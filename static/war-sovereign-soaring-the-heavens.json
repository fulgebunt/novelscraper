I\u2019ve fallen into a trap!\u201dHe didn\u2019t even have the time to open his eyes as he reflexively slapped his hands against the ground, intending to use the counterforce produced to leap up and flee\u2026This was an instinctual reaction for an outstanding member of the Special Forces!The moment his hands touched the ground, an aching pain jolted through his hand like lightning, along with a burst of powerlessness.Ling Tian opened his eyes as his mind trembled.\u201cTian, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201dA woman\u2019s gentle and pleasantly surprised voice drifted into his ears.Ling Tian looked towards the source of the voice and found a delicate face full of love attentively gazing at him.He saw a classical beauty who was breathtakingly beautiful and absolutely drop dead gorgeous.In Ling Tian\u2019s mind, a familiar stream of memories unfolded\u2026Ling Tian, citizen of Hua.Formerly serving in the nation of Hua\u2019s Elite Wolf Fang Special Forces, Army Division, he rendered innumerable meritorious deeds throughout his service.He took part in the International Special Forces Competition, winning the honor of top individual combatant, and was acknowledged as \u201cThe King of Weapons Specialists.\u201dLater, in an SSS ranked multinational mission, a slight mistake on his part led to the sacrifice of a comrade.Riddled with guilt, he chose to retire and left the Wolf Fang Division.After retiring, there was no news of him for some time. He chose to go abroad and became the trump card of an internationally renowned mercenary organization.Any mission that he took part in would have an unparalleled success rate of 100%!Although he had retired from the Wolf Fang Division many years ago, his heart was still with his homeland.As long as a mission was detrimental to the nation of Hua, not only would he decline the mission, but he would also uncover the identity of the person who issued the mission and brutally slaughter him.As time passed on, he became a thorn in the side of every nation besides the nation of Hua.In the eyes of the other nations, he was a time bomb.Slaughter and bloodshed would follow wherever he went.Various countries started plotting against him, sparing no expense to hire world-class assassins.However, Ling Tian\u2019s life grew more comfortable as the days went by and the assassins vanished into thin air. Eventually, no assassin were willing to accept the \u201cSuicide Mission\u201d anymore.Trying to kill Ling Tian was the same as committing suicide!This statement was universally acknowledged by both the assassin and mercenary world.He, Ling Tian, was not only a formidable weapon specialist, but he was also a master practitioner of Form and Will Boxing who even managed to cultivate his internal energy.He was rarely able to meet an opponent around the world; even on the rare occasion that he did meet one, he never lost!Not long ago, Ling Tian received news from his most trusted broker.R Nation had created a type of a colorless and tasteless biological weapon. They were planning to transport the weapon into the nation of Hua, to carry out an atrocious conspiracy.Naturally Ling Tian would not sit idly by and let this happen.He took action!With the help of his broker, the location of the biological weapons were pinpointed.Just when he succeeded in carving out a path of blood and entering the underground laboratory, and just when he was about to destroy the batch of biological weapons\u2026 The underground laboratory suddenly caved in, trapping him in a fully sealed cage.When he caught sight of R countrymen appearing outside the cage one by one, with firearms in their hands\u2026 Ling Tian understood right away.This was a conspiracy\u2026 a conspiracy against him.He was betrayed by the person he trusted the most!Otherwise, with his level of astuteness, the R countrymen\u2019s conspiracy would never have been able to succeed.Even until the moment of death, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201cHa ha ha ha\u2026\u201dAs the thoughts raced through his mind, Ling Tian could not hold back and bursted out laughing; his mood was filled with delight.\u201cTian, what\u2019s wrong with you? Don\u2019t frighten your mother.\u201dThe gentle voice sounded again, this time with a hint of anxiousness.Ling Tian\u2019s mind was in chaos\u2026He was absolutely sure he didn\u2019t recognize the woman in front of his eyes.However, the look in this woman\u2019s eyes seemed to be full of sincerity and without any falsehood whatsoever, as if she was looking at her own kin.Just as Ling Tian was preparing to start a debate with this beautiful woman,a stream of foreign memories flowed into his mind\u2026Ling Tian felt as if he was struck by lightning, completely dumbfounded as though pressure was being applied to his acupuncture pointsThe only thing Ling Tian was pleased with was that this guy was also named Ling Tian\u2026 \u201cDuan Ling Tian\u201dDuan Ling Tian, 15 years old.Fresh Breeze Town, Li Family\u2019s disciple with another surname.His mother, Li Rou, was the Li Family\u2019s Ninth Elder.His father\u2026in his memories, there was no such person to begin with.In the process of merging with this segment of foreign memories, Ling Tian found the reason Duan Ling Tian was severely injured and bedridden.This morning, Li Family\u2019s Seventh Elder\u2019s youngest son, Li Xin, insulted Duan Ling Tian by calling him a bastard son who only knew his mother but not his father.Duan Ling Tian snapped into a fit of rage, and started fighting with Lin Xi\u2026But how could Duan Ling Tian, who had not even achieved the Body Tempering Stage, be a match for Li Xin, who had already achieved level two of Body Tempering Stage. He was immediately severely injured by Li Xin and sent to the verge of death.Just as Duan Ling Tian inhaled his last breath of air, Ling Tian took over Duan Ling Tian\u2019s entire being\u2026 including Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body and memories.After completely merging with the foreign memories, Ling Tian sighed.He knew, from this moment onwards, he would be using the identity of Duan Ling Tian to integrate himself into this foreign world.From today onwards, he would be Duan Ling Tian, and Duan Ling Tian would be him.\u201cMadam, the Patriarch sent some medicine over.\u201dA voice sounded from the side of his ears, making Duan Ling Ting look up towards the source of the voice.A servant girl hurriedly entered the room and handed over the small and exquisite case in her hands to Li Rou.A medicinal fragrance drifted in the air immediately as the small case was opened.\u201cTian, come; take this medicinal pill. Mother will treat your injuries.\u201dLi Rou took out a dark looking medicinal pill from the case and guided it to the front of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth.Taking a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.The pill dissolved upon entering his mouth and turned into a warm current as it entered his body.Subsequently, Duan Ling Tian noticed that Li Rou had placed her hand on his chest\u2026A stream of ice cold current passed into his body, dissolving the warm current from the pill and treating his injuries.An hour later, Li Rou finished up.Duan Ling Tian noticed that half of the aching pain in his body had disappeared, lacking any strain whatsoever.He was startled.Was what he took just now some sort of elixir of life?Meanwhile, Duan Ling Tian noticed that Li Rou\u2019s face was pale, as beads of cold sweat dripped out of her forehead. Obviously, she expended too much Origin Energy in treating his injuries.\u201cMom, are you alright?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart felt warm.His voice sounded intimate, without a hint of artificialness.\u201cMother is fine. I just need to rest for a while.\u201dLi Rou shook her head while smiling.For the sake of her son, expending this little bit of Origin Energy was nothing.Half an hour later, the servant girl entered the room and lightly said, \u201cMadam, the Patriarch sent someone to inquire if you would release young master Xin now? The Patriarch and Seventh Elder are still waiting in the Punishment Hall.\u201d\u201cRelease him? Go tell the person the Patriarch sent, that I will deal with this matter myself!\u201dThe gentle and amiable expression on Li Rou\u2019s face was completely gone, replaced by an icy cold expression, causing the room to feel as if the temperature had gone down slightly.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart stirred.Never did he think that this woman, who was as beautiful as a flower, would be so protective\u2026\u201cMom, what was that pill you gave me earlier? I feel like my injuries are nearly healed.\u201dDuan Ling Tian got up from bed, lightly stretching his body.\u201cSilly child, that was a \u2018Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill\u2019,\u201d Li Rou lightly smiled.Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill!Duan Ling Tian sifted through the foreign memories in his mind\u2026It turned out that even within Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li Family, there were only two of this Grade Eight Gold Injury Pills. Now, one had been used on him, a disciple with another surname.It looked like his mother had quite a high status in the Li Family.\u201cTian, the Patriarch is waiting for us. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLi Rou brought Duan Ling Tian to a spacious courtyard in the Li Family Estate.Instruments of torture laid scattered around the vast courtyard.This was where punishment in the Li family was carried out: the Punishment Hall!It was exactly noon, and the sun was burning high in the sky\u2026The surroundings of the Punishment Hall were filled with people. Li Family disciples had come to watch the show.In the middle of the courtyard, a youth was tied to a pillar under the blazing sun with two middle aged men standing by his side.The cross eyed, middle aged man on the right side had an expression of rage when he noticed the arrival of Duan Ling Tian and his mother.\u201cDuan Ling Tian has arrived\u2026The families precious Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill has such a strong effect!\u201d\u201cYea, I was there when Duan Ling Tian was carried away, half-dead, but now, after taking the Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill, he\u2019s back to being full of vigor and vitality.\u201d\u201cUsually, Lin Xin would just casually bully Duan Ling Tian and Ninth Elder would not say anything about that. However, this time he inflicted such severe injuries that Duan Ling Tian nearly died\u2026 Of course Ninth Elder is going to be furious.\u201d\u2026\u2026One by one, the Li Family disciples started whispering to one another as they noticed the arrival of Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian.\u201cPatriarch!\u201dLi Rou brought Duan Ling Tian over to salute the middle aged man on the left.\u201cNinth Elder, regarding todays matters, my son Li Xin was at wrong. On the other hand, your son is fine now and yet my son has been burning under the sun the whole afternoon. Can we let him down now?\u201dAt this moment, the cross eyed middle aged man, Li Family\u2019s Seventh Elder Li Kun had a dark expression.Who would have thought that Li Rou wouldn\u2019t even bother to answer him and directly ignored him.Li Rou brought Duan Ling Tian in front of the tied up Li Xin.\u201cTian, now it\u2019s time to repay him in the same way that he injured you earlier!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was an expert at that.Li Xin was the same age as Duan Ling Tian, and he had been tied to the punishment pillar under the blazing sun, causing his face to turn green long ago\u2026Hearing Li Rou\u2019s words, he was scared sh*tless and went into a frenzied state while roaring in terror, \u201cDad, save me!\u201d\u201cLi Rou, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d Seventh Elder Li Kun\u2019s face sunk as he bursted out in rage.\u201cGoing too far? Li Kun, usually your son bullies my son. Since his skills are inferior, I accept that slight injury is unavoidable. But this time, your son nearly killed him\u2026 Do you really think I, Li Rou, am an easy target to bully?\u201dLi Rou glanced coldly at Li Kun; her voice contained a trace of icy cold anger.\u201cTian, don\u2019t hesitate and attack. Today, let me see who dares stand in my way of disciplining this junior!\u201dLi Rou\u2018s voice was filled with a heroine\u2019s valiant spirit.Even though she was a woman, the imposing manner she exuded was not a shred below that of a man!\u201cPatriarch.\u201dLi Kun looked towards the Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, beside him, hoping he would uphold some sort of justice.\u201cSeventh Elder, today\u2019s matter is a private matter between you and Ninth Elder. To the greatest extent possible, I hope you can settle it privately.\u201dLi Nan Feng shook his head.\u201cSo you\u2019re the one that beat him into such a miserable state?\u201d Duan Ling Tian muttered to himself.Slap!Moving one step forward, he directly slapped Li Xin without saying a second word.A light sharp pain emanated from his palm, and Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows slightly creased.\u201cDuan Ling Tian\u2026 let me down if you have the balls, and we can fight one on one!\u201dLi Xin growled, nearly howling, as half of his face had swollen up and his eyes emitted a cold and fierce light.\u201cOne on one fight? Sorry, I\u2019m not interested\u2026 As for if I have the balls or not, that\u2019s not something that you should be worried about,\u201d Duan Ling Tian laughed as he spread out his hands and indifferently shrugged his shoulders.Slap!He hurled another slap at Li Xin.\u201cThis guy\u2019s face has really thick skin.\u201dHe frowned as he blew on his aching palms while feeling slightly satisfied as he expressed his resentment.When the surrounding Li Family disciples saw Duan Ling Tian\u2019s actions and heard his words, they were left speechless.The other guy was already tied up like a punching bag for him to hit, but he still complained that the skin on his face was thick?What was wrong with this guy!?\u201cShoes are still the best after all.\u201dBending down, Duan Ling Tian removed a shoe from his foot, took it in his hand, and suddenly aimed it at Li Xin\u2019s face.This scene caused the surrounding Li Family disciples to feel a chill run down their spines.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian, he can\u2019t be thinking of using that shoe to slap Li Xin\u2019s face, right?\u201d\u201cIf he really slaps Li Xin on the face with that shoe, won\u2019t his face tear open like a blooming flower!?\u201d\u201cLittle bastard, you\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Kun could not control himself any longer as he caught sight of this scene, and his body flew out towards Duan Ling Tian like a roc.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Rou glided with graceful steps, as if she had turned into both the wind and a celestial maiden drifting across the nine heavens, and arrived in front of Duan Ling Tian a step earlier.Extending out her delicate hands which radiated with the brilliance of Origin Energy, she slapped her palm towards the oncoming Li Kun.At the same time, above Li Rou\u2019s head vague wisps of white mist appeared.\u201cLi Rou, today, let me see how strong you really are.\u201dLi Kun gazed sternly as his hand descended like a giant fan.Origin Energy burst forth and intercepted Li Rou\u2019s palm strike with full force!Instantly, four obscure silhouettes of ancient mammoths emerged in the space above Li Kun.Li Kun attacked at full force and drew upon the energy of heaven and earth, creating four ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026In other words, the strength he was exerting was equal to the strength of four ancient mammoths!Just one ancient mammoth had the strength of 10,000 pounds.\u201cMom\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned, feeling worried.The Li Family disciples were watching the battle between Seventh Elder and Ninth Elder intently because it was extremely rare to see an event of such scale.Bang!Under the watchful eyes of the surrounding people, Li Rou and Li Kun\u2019s bodies converged as they exchanged a palm strike.Both of their bodies jerked; Li Rou\u2019s body was slightly inclined forward, and the white mist above her head developed into ancient mammoth silhouettes as well\u2026A total of six! The strength of six ancient mammoths!Li Kun\u2019s strength of four ancient mammoths was pitted against Li Rou\u2019s strength of six ancient mammoths. Moreso, it was even a frontal exchange\u2026 The outcome was obvious.Instantly, Li Kun looked like an arrow leaving the bowstring. He flew out over ten meters in a sorry state before he could finally stabilize himself.\u201cWaa!\u201dLi Kun\u2019s face flickered between a pale and green color, whereupon he spat out a mouthful of blood.With a face full of disbelief, he glanced at the fading silhouettes of those six ancient mammoths above Li Rou.\u201cHow is this possible\u2026 The strength of six ancient mammoths\u2026 Li Rou is actually a fourth level of Core Formation Stage martial artist?!\u201dLi Kun was startled.He had never imagined that the usually low profiled Ninth Elder Li Rou, who virtually never lifted her hands against others in the Li Family, would actually have such frightening strength!The Li Family disciples that were present could not resist drawing in a breath of cold air, \u201cThe strength of six ancient mammoths\u2026 Ninth Elder is so strong!\u201d\u201cAccording to calculations, based upon the strength of six ancient mammoths, Ninth Elder\u2019s strength is around the fourth level of Core Formation Stage.\u201d\u201cWho could have imagined that the Ninth Elder, who was usually kind and gentle, actually had such strength\u2026 If Li Xin had not nearly killed Duan Ling Tian, we might have never had the chance to see Ninth Elder in action.\u201d\u2026\u2026Li Rou stood still, and her fine, thin figure seemed incomparably lofty.\u201cI really never imagined that Mom actually had such strength. Drawing upon the energy of heaven and earth and developing six ancient mammoth silhouettes, she is definitely at the fourth level of Core Formation Stage.\u201dDuan Ling Tian let out a breath of relief.In this world, the first stage to becoming a martial artist was known as Body Tempering Stage, which was further separated into nine levels.Cultivating to level nine of Body Tempering Stage would allow the fleshly body to have a strength of ten thousand pounds.At full strength, drawing upon the energy of heaven and earth would become possible. It could be developed it into an ancient mammoth silhouette, allowing one to possess the strength of one ancient mammoth.Above the Body Tempering Stage was the Core Formation Stage.The biggest difference between the Body Tempering Stage and the Core Formation Stage was Origin Energy.After achieving level nine of the Body Tempering Stage, producing Origin Energy would allow one to advance to the first level of Core Formation Stage.The strength of the Origin Energy at level one of Core Formation Stage was equal to the strength of one ancient mammoth, and, combined with the existing strength of the fleshly body, the cultivator would be able to produce the strength of two ancient mammoths.As their cultivation increased, the level of power that could be controlled would increase as well.Thinking up to this point, a smile appeared on the corner of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth.\u201cTian, nobody will bother you now\u2026 You can continue.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s gentle voice drifted into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears, reminding him.\u201cDad, save me!\u201dHearing Li Rou\u2019s words, Li Xin\u2019s face turned green, and his eyes emitted a deep sense of fear\u2026The shoe in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand would definitely slap down upon him, and it was no joke!Li Kun\u2019s face was grim, but, due to his fear of Li Rou, he did not dare to make a move.Duan Ling Tian bursted out in laughter.Slap!The shoe in his hand descended mercilessly.Instantly, Li Xin emitted shrill cries, like that of a pig being slaughtered, as a clear shoe print appeared on his face.Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!\u2026\u2026Holding a shoe in his hand, Duan Ling Tian kept swinging his hand and hitting Li Xin\u2019s face time after time.Every time his shoe descended upon Li Xin\u2019s face, the Li Family disciples that were present would feel an uncontrollable shiver run through their bodies. Just hearing the sound of the shoe slapping against Li Xin\u2019s face was enough to make them cringe.Only after Li Xin fainted did Duan Ling Tian finally stop.Duan Ling Tian murmured in his heart, and only he knew who he was talking to.While following behind his mother and leaving the courtyard, Duan Ling Tian noticed that Seventh Elder\u2019s glare, which emitted a sense of bloodthirst and hatred; it was as if he was waiting for a chance to swallow him up\u2026His heart sank.He had seen this kind of gaze countless times in his previous life.A person who had this gaze was an unscrupulous person who would use any means available to achieve his goal!That\u2019s why, in his previous life, whenever someone gazed at him in this way, he would get rid of them before they could pose a threat to him.Duan Ling Tian felt a sense of pressure.Even though Lin Kun was not a match for his mother, it would be impossible for his mother to always be by his side. It would be impossible for her to take care of him for his whole life.In order to live in this world, where only the strong were revered, he could only rely on himself.What he needed desperately was strength\u2026 Formidable strength!As Li Family\u2019s Ninth Elder, Li Rou had an independent courtyard.There were three rooms in the courtyard; Li Rou, Duan Ling Tian and the servant girl each lived in their own room.Duan Ling Tian greeted Li Rou as they returned to the courtyard before heading back to his room.\u201cAfter receiving severe injuries this time, Tian seems a little bit different\u2026\u201dAs the closest person to Duan Ling Tian, Li Rou noticed the difference in Duan Ling Tian after he woke up.She didn\u2019t contemplate any further and presumed that her son experienced a change after enduring such a shock.How could she ever know that the body of her son was still present, but his soul had been switched for another.After returning to his room, Duan Ling Tian sat on his bed with a gloomy expression on his face.From those foreign memories, he found out that the original owner of this body was sick and fragile from a very young age.If he wanted to succeed in body tempering, reach the first level of Body Tempering Stage, and become a martial artist, it would be as difficult as ascending the heavens!Scolded Duan Ling Tian in his heart.\u201cHeHeHeHe\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a string of eerie and husky laughter, like that of a ghost, resonated inside Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mind.\u201cWho?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face distorted.\u201cKid, I didn\u2019t think you were that lucky; for your soul to survive that! But nothing has changed\u2026 Wait, you\u2019re not that kid. Who are you?! Damn it! You actually dared to snatch away the body that I wanted. Die!!\u201d the husky voice was suddenly filled with cruelty and rage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re not a person of this world\u2026So close, just a little bit more\u2026 I can\u2019t accept this\u2026 I can\u2019t accept this!!\u201dThe husky voice suddenly distorted as if it encountered something that caused it to feel intense fear.After roaring once more, the voice vanished completely, as if it had never appeared at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dAfter the sharp pain receded, Duan Ling Tian finally began to recover his senses.Soon, his eyes opened wide, and a stream of vastly complex and foreign memories rushed into his brain as he forcibly seized them.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dEven with two lifetimes of experiences, Duan Ling Tian was still stupefied by the stream of memories.These memories belonged to the \u2018Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019 of 10,000 years ago, who was one of Cloud Continent\u2019s Seven Great Martial Emperors!Cloud Continent was the common name for this world.The Seven Great Martial Emperors of 10,000 years ago were great figures who stood at the pinnacle of Cloud Continent who were nearly equal to Gods\u2026 They were incomparably strong and looked down upon commoners. It seemed as if they had the ability to pluck the stars and cover the sun and moon by merely stretching their hands.In that era, the Rebirth Martial Emperor was considered the strongest among the Seven Great Martial Emperors. He once seized another\u2019s body and possessed it with his soul in order to achieve rebirth, thus allowing him to have lived two lifetimes.In his first lifetime, besides pursuing the pinnacle of martial arts, he was also a remarkable alchemist.In his second lifetime, he was a formidable weapons craftsman and even researched inscription techniques to complete mastery.\u201cUnbelievable!\u201dDuan Ling Tian took a deep breath.Rebirth Martial Emperor was a godlike figure of Cloud Continent.If he could complete three lifetimes of rebirth, the Three Lives Rebirth Technique would be complete.At that time, even if the remaining Seven Great Martial Emperors teamed up they would not have been his match!\u201cHa ha ha ha,\u201dDuan Ling Tian began laughing.Originally he was worried about how he would begin cultivating with this fragile body, but the Rebirth Martial Emperor just sent him a great and timely gift!Duan Ling Tian took a deep breath and made his decision.He would cultivate the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique!In the Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s first lifetime, he was a Royal Grade alchemist.As such, concocting some medicinal solution for a medicinal bath was an easy task for Duan Ling Tian.In the eyes of ordinary people across Cloud Continent, alchemists were divided into nine grades, with Grade Nine being the lowest and Grade One being the highest.However, only great figures that stood at the pinnacle of Cloud Continent actually knew that above the rank of Grade One alchemist there were actually the ranks of Quasi-Royal Grade alchemist and Royal Grade alchemist.Rebirth Martial Emperor was the one and only Royal Grade alchemist in the entire Cloud Continent.\u201cMom, I need some medicinal materials.\u201dDuan Ling Tian passed a piece of paper to his mother Li Rou.\u201cTian, these are all medicinal materials that improve and strengthen the body. A long time ago, I obtained some medicinal materials and got Grand Elder to prepare them for you, but there was no effect at all.\u201dLi Rou glanced at the medicine list, and, even though she was not well versed in pill refining, she could still recognize the medicinal materials on the list.Li family Grand Elder Li Huo was a Grade Nine alchemist, and the only alchemist in the Li family; thus he possessed a high status within the family.\u201cMom, I want to try.\u201dThe youth shook his head with a firm and unyielding expression.\u201cFine, Mom will go buy it for you,\u201d Li Rou said as she dotingly nodded her head.In her opinion, as long her son was happy, so what if those medicinal materials went to waste? After all, they were just mere worldly possessions.Half an hour later, Li Rou returned with the medicinal materials requested by Duan Ling Tian.\u201cTian, do you need Mom to request the Grand Elder for help to prepare the medicinal materials?\u201d\u201cMom, it\u2019s not necessary. Just pass them to me.\u201dAfter receiving the medicinal materials, the youth returned to his room.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Tian is thinking of processing those medicinal materials by himself? Never mind, as long he\u2019s happy. Those medicinal materials are not poisonous anyway. I\u2019ll just let him amuse himself.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s heart stirred, but she wasn\u2019t concerned.Duan Ling Tian had Li Rou buy him a total of seven types of common medicinal materials to concoct the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.This medicinal liquid had the ability to increase the strength of the physical constitution and increase the speed at which a Body Tempering Stage martial artist cultivated.The medicinal formula of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid had been considered extinct in Cloud Continent since long ago. This formula was discovered by the Rebirth Martial Emperor in an ancient ruins during his second lifetime.He originally planned to use it during his third lifetime, but the benefits were now reaped by Duan Ling Tian.Concocting medicinal liquids was different from refining medicinal pills.To refine medicinal pills, one would first require the formation of Pill Fire, an ability that was only achievable by graded alchemists.However, concocting medicinal liquids only required a formula. With the knowledge of the medicinal materials required and the order in which the medicinal materials were to be prepared, anyone was capable of concocting medicinal liquids.Concocting the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for the first time, Duan Ling Tian clumsily wasted an hour before finally succeeding in creating the medicinal liquid according to the formula from the memories of the Rebirth Martial Emperor.After succeeding, he had his mother\u2019s servant girl prepare some warm water and a bath barrel.Duan Ling Tian poured the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid into the barrel, mixed everything thoroughly, and took off his clothes before jumping in.Sitting cross legged inside the barrel, Duan Ling Tian could clearly feel his whole body numbing.He knew that this was the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid fusing into his body and changing his physical constitution.Closing his eyes, Duan Ling Tian started cultivating the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2026The Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique was separated into the War Sovereign\u2019s Nine Forms.When mastery of the technique was attained, one would be able to control the strength of nine dragons and achieve the cultivation of a Martial Emperor and possess unparalleled martial prowess!Presently Duan Ling Tian was cultivating the first form known as the Spirit Serpent Form.Under the greedy absorption of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body, a barrel of medicinal bath was swiftly consumed.Meanwhile, the cultivation of Spirit Serpent Form was finally on the right track.The foundations of transforming into a martial artist were the body tempering process, the strengthening of vital energy and blood, and the metamorphosis of the fleshly body.Three days later, after absorbing the third barrel of medicinal liquid, Duan Ling Tian finally stepped into the realm of the first level of Body Tempering Stage.\u201cHua La La~\u201dDuan Ling Tian got out of the barrel and stood in front of a mirror. He looked at the able-bodied figure that was completely different than the figure from three days ago and started laughing.He then started stretching his body and noticed that his body\u2019s level of flexibility was astonishing.This was an effect of cultivating the Spirit Serpent Form; it would cause the body to become flexible like a spirit serpent.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In my dream, I met an old man, who taught me the formula to a type of medicinal liquid,\u201d he casually made up an excuse.He then proceeded to tell Li Rou about the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid and its overall effects.\u201cIncreasing the cultivation speed of Body Tempering Stage martial artists?\u201dLi Rou was stunned.She had never heard of any medicinal liquid capable of increasing the cultivation speed of Body Tempering Stage martial artists. Moreover, one which only required such common medicinal materials.She realized instantly that this medicinal formula was no ordinary formula.As far as she knew, there were medicinal pills that were capable of increasing the cultivation speed of Body Tempering Stage martial artists, but those medicinal pills required a graded alchemist to be refined successfully. Also, the required medicinal materials were extremely costly, so costly that ordinary people could not afford them.\u201cTian, do not tell the benefits of this medicinal formula to anyone, under any circumstances.\u201dOnce she realized the value of the medicinal formula, Li Rou\u2019s first thought was to protect her son, thus she warned him with a serious expression.\u201cMom, I know, I\u2019m just telling my mother.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.Being an orphan in his previous life, he enjoyed the feeling of motherly love in this lifetime.\u201cMy good child.\u201dLi Rou started smiling as well. She smiled radiantly and looked incomparably beautiful.\u201cTian, you\u2019ve now finally stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage, so you can select a martial skill from the Li Family Martial Pavilion.\u201cYes Mom. I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201dAlthough the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor had no lack of martial skills, he still decided to take a look for the sake of appearances\u2026Martial Pavilion, the place the Li Family stored its martial skills, was an important location that usually was guarded personally by at least one Elder.\u201cFifth Elder\u201dDuan Ling Tian saluted the Elder at the door of the Martial pavilion.\u201cDuan Ling Tian?\u201dFifth Elder Li Ting was slightly shocked to see Duan Ling Tian.Once he noticed the changes in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body, he could not help himself from exclaiming softly, \u201cYou\u2026. stepped into the first level of one Body Tempering Stage?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled lightly and nodded.\u201cNow your mother can finally be at ease. Ok, you can go in and select one martial skill of your choice.\u201dLi Ting smiled.He had a good relationship with the Ninth Elder Li Rou.Answering with a grunt, Duan Ling Tian walked into the Martial Pavilion.\u201cDuan Ling Tian stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage?\u201dA few of the youths that had just arrived at the Martial Pavilion looked at each other in surprise.As far as they were concerned, the shock that Duan Ling Tian brought them by stepping into the first level of one Body Tempering Stage was not at all lower than seeing a female pig climbing trees or a cow that could fly.Inside the Martial Pavilion, Duan Ling Tian started reading through martial skills.As he read through the skills, he realized that the martial skills in the Li family Martial Pavilion were extremely ordinary\u2026These low and middle grade Yellow Rank martial skills were, in his opinion, not mentioning the Form and Will Boxing he practiced in his previous life, even inferior to Military Boxing.Duan Ling Tian had already achieved the rank of Grandmaster in Form and Will Boxing and surpassed his teacher.Thinking up to this point, he left the Martial Pavilion.Fifth Elder Li Ting noticed Duan Ling Tian walking out empty handed, and his face displayed a curious expression.This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.\u201cWhat, didn\u2019t find anything suitable?\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cPfft!\u201dSuddenly, a laughing sound entered into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.\u201cLooks like you, Duan Ling Tian, disdain the martial arts in our Li Family\u2019s Martial Pavilion\u2026 I\u2019m curious, what kind of martial skill did your mom pass on to you privately to allow you to be so arrogant? Duan Ling Tian, I heard you\u2019ve stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage; how about I ask for guidance on a few moves?\u201d he voice implied sarcastically.Duan Ling Tian lifted his head. Only then did he notice.Unknowingly, Li Xin had also arrived at the Martial Pavilion with bruise marks still on his cheeks. He looked at Duan Ling Tian with an expression of provocation.\u201cPhew, I was wondering who it was, and it turns out that it\u2019s you. Hehe\u2026 Does your face still hurt?\u201dConfronted with Li Xin\u2019s provocation, Duan Ling Tian did not get angry but instead laughed.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I want to challenge you! Let Fifth Elder bear witness, do you dare to accept my challenge?\u201d Li Xin took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.The incident from three days ago was undoubtedly an unprecedented disgrace and utterly humiliating for him.During the past three days, the thing he wanted to do the most was take revenge!Today, when he heard that Duan Ling Tian had stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage, he immediately rushed over.In his opinion, Duan Ling Tian was now a martial artist, and if he was seriously injured in an official battle, according to the family rules, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mother could do nothing about it no matter how furious she was.Of course, the prerequisite would be that Duan Ling Tian accepted his challenge.Confronted with Li Xin\u2019s provocation, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, as he smiled lightly, \u201cWhy would I not dare?\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, don\u2019t be rash!\u201d Fifth Elder Li Ting frowned.In his opinion, Duan Ling Tian was only at the first level of Body Tempering Stage. Moreover, he had not cultivated any martial arts. How could he be a match for Li Xin, who was already at the second level of Body Tempering Stage.\u201cGood, Duan Ling Tian. You\u2019ve got balls.\u201dLi Xin laughed complacently in a manner that showed his scheme had succeeded.\u201cFifth Elder, please bear witness to the battle between us so as to prevent Ninth Elder from troubling me later.\u201dLi Xin briefly looked towards Li Ting respectfully.\u201cYeah, Fifth Elder, please bear witness\u2026 I don\u2019t wish for Seventh Elder to trouble me later.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was reluctant to show weakness.If it was a few days ago, he would have a trace of fear towards Li Xin, who had achieved the second level of Body Tempering Stage\u2026However, after finding out the martial arts inside the Martial Pavilion were difficult to take seriously, he realized that he had overestimated Li Xin.\u201cThis kid is too rash\u2026 Never mind, this will teach him a lesson.\u201dLi Ting frowned while glancing at Duan Ling Tian as he stood up and walked out of the Martial Pavilion.The Li Family disciples that were passing by the Martial Pavilion had expressions of excitement on their faces; There was a show to see!In the empty space outside of the Martial Pavilion, Duan Ling Tian and Li Xin stood facing each other.Li Ting, who was acting as the witness, was standing to the side.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, today I will return the humiliation you gave me last time to you tenfold!\u201dLi Xin had a ominous smile on his face, as if Duan Ling Tian was a fish on his chopping block ready to be slaughtered.\u201cThen we will need to see if you have the capability,\u201d Duan Ling Tian laughed.Li Xin turned angry from embarrassment, and shouted loudly, \u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dPounding his legs on the ground, he ran out at full speed like a fierce tiger dashing down the mountain.Fierce Tiger Fist!His hands waved out, gradually forming a current, and swept straight towards Duan Ling Tian.\u201cIt\u2019s the middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill Fierce Tiger Fist! Li Xin is so formidable; his Fierce Tiger Fist has obviously been cultivated to the Initial Stage.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian only recently stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage, so he probably has not even cultivated any martial skills\u2026 To actually be brave enough to accept Li Xin\u2019s challenge, he really is unafraid of death!\u201d\u201cFifth Elder is bearing witness today, and even if Duan Ling Tian is severely injured again, as long as he doesn\u2019t die, Ninth Elder can\u2019t do a thing to Li Xin no matter how furious she is.\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding Li Family disciples were discussing one after another, nobody had high hopes for Duan Ling Tian.After all, difference between the first level and second level of Body Tempering Stage was just too large.\u201cFierce Tiger Fist? It looks like Sick Cat Fist to me.\u201dThe corner of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth moved, forming a disdainful smile.In his opinion, the martial art that Li Xin was using was full of flaws, and he had more than a hundred ways to overcome the attack.In the end, he chose the most direct method.Deng!In front of the eyes of the crowd, Duan Ling Tian also ran out at full speed and intercepted the attack.Just when Li Xin\u2019s fists were about to make contact, his upper body bent backwards to an alarming degree and he dodged Li Xin\u2019s fists as his body swept past Li Xin, swiftly landing behind him.\u201cNow!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s legs jerked, and his body nimbly twisted around.Clenching his right fist, his upper body abruptly bent backwards as both of his arms drew backward.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian became like a heavy bow drawn to its limit as even his spine started to tremble.His upper body abruptly tilted forward as his right fist took advantage of the momentum and shot out, exerting a tremendous force like a landslide.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian skillfully dodged Li Xin\u2019s Fierce Tiger Fist, and, in the instant Li Xin was brought forward by inertia, he mercilessly punched Li Xin\u2019s right shoulder.Kacha!The sound of bones breaking rang out.Li Xin was blasted airborne while emitting a shrill cry, as if he was a pig being slaughtered.Even though Li Xin\u2019s strength was 20 pounds more than Duan Ling Tian, he had no way to use that strength.Bang!Li Xin\u2019s body fiercely hit the ground, and he emitted a wave of shrill cries as his body severely trembled and convulsed in pain.Silence\u2026The entire area became deathly still.From Fifth Elder Li Ting to every single Li Family disciple on site, their mouths gaped as they looked on with disbelief at the scene in front of their eyes.The Collapsing Fist that Duan Ling Tian used just now\u2026in their opinion, it was virtually godlike!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems just like any ordinary straight punch, but he smoothly dodged Li Xin\u2019s Fierce Tiger Fist, moved to Li Xin\u2019s back, spun his body, and swung out with that punch, all of which happened in just an instant\u2026 I wonder how he did it?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? How could such a strong move not be a martial skill? Duan Ling Tian split open Li Xin\u2019s shoulder blade with just a single punch!\u201d\u2026\u2026The Li Family disciples discussed energetically, but they were absolutely unable to see through the Collapsing Fist Duan Ling Tian used.That fist move\u2026 although seemingly simple, its might was truly shocking.\u201cLi Xin\u2019s shoulder blade has completely shattered. His right arm is crippled!\u201dFifth Elder examined Li Xin\u2019s injuries and drew in a breath of cold air. He displayed a brief startled expression when he glanced at Duan Ling Tian.A mere level one of Body Tempering Stage martial artist was actually able to execute such a formidable attack.After assigning some Li Family disciples to carry Li Xin away for treatment, Li Ting walked over to Duan Ling Tian, who was calmly standing there.At this very moment, he had the misconception that the person standing in front of him was not a youth but a seasoned expert of the Martial Dao.\u201cThat fist technique you executed earlier\u2026 what is it called? It lacks the complication of common martial skills and instead exerts force like a landslide. How long have you cultivated it?\u201dLi Ting glanced at Duan Ling Tian with glistening eyes.The Li Family disciples were unable to see through the profoundness of that move, but he saw it clearly.That move seemed simple, but it actually utilized a formidable method of force exertion.In the instant that Duan Ling Tian swung his fist, the strength of his entire body was perfectly concentrated into a single point.It was a feat that was difficult even for a high grade Yellow Rank martial skill to accomplish.No, perhaps even ordinary Profound Rank martial skills were unable to accomplish such a feat!The martial arts of Cloud Continent were divided into four ranks, from high to low: Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Yellow.Every rank of martial skill was further divided into three grades: high, middle and low.In the Li Family, besides the low grade and middle grade Yellow Rank martial skills placed in the Martial Pavilion, there was only one high grade Yellow Rank martial skill, the Wind Chaser Palm.This martial skill was only permitted to be cultivated by Li Family martial artists that were at the Core Formation Stage or above.But Li Ting knew that even if Wind Chaser Palm was mastered, the exertion of force would still be inferior to that move from earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s called Collapsing Fist!\u201d said Duan Ling Tian, but he did not say anything regarding his time spent cultivating it.How could he say that he cultivated it for over 10 years?Collapsing Fist, one of the Five Elemental Fist moves of Form and Will Boxing, was a type of straight punch.When exerting force, it stressed upon concealing the accumulation of strength and performing an unexpected, swift, and intense attack which penetrated the internal organs. It was a type of fist technique with powerful penetrative capabilities!Collapsing Fist seemed simple, but it actually encompassed the exertion of force of the entire body, including the internal organs.In order to reach the same level of cultivation as Duan Ling Tian, it would require at least ten years of hard work.\u201cFifth Elder, I\u2019m going back home. About the incident today, I\u2019m sure you noticed who provoked who first. I hope you can bear witness on my behalf.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded toward Li Ting, turned around, and left.\u201cCollapsing Fist? This kid is extraordinary\u2026 Li Rou, all along, even you were deceived by your son\u2026 He\u2019s been concealing his abilities and waiting for the right moment!\u201dLi Ting took a deep breath and tried to stabilize his agitated mood.He noticed that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist was not a martial skill that could be cultivated quickly or with ease. He naturally believed that Duan Ling Tian was patiently holding back, hiding his strengths and weaknesses.The surrounding Li Family disciples that were spectating the battle dispersed.They all knew that the terrifying punch Duan Ling Tian executed was called Collapsing Fist!\u201cSatisfying!\u201dAfter arriving back home, Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief as a brief smile appeared on his immature face.Since arriving in this world, this was the first time he executed Form and Will Boxing without restraint!In that moment, he felt like he had gone back to his previous life, one that was full of excitement and bloodshed.Duan Ling Tian returned to his room and noticed that the remaining Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was only enough for two more medicinal baths.\u201cSeems like I need to ask mom to buy me more medicinal herbs.\u201dSitting in the bath barrel, he cultivated Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique while enjoying the medicinal bath. Duan Ling Tian cultivated intently, but little did he know that, because of his victory against Li Xin, there was a great disturbance in the once tranquil Li Family.\u201cHey! Have you heard? Ninth Elder\u2019s son Duan Ling Tian completed his body tempering and has stepped into level one of Body Tempering Stage!\u201d\u201cPfftt! I knew that long ago. Do you know that Duan Ling Tian not only stepped into level one of Body Tempering Stage, he even severely injured Li Xin during a public battle that was witnessed by the Fifth Elder; he even crippled one of Li Xin\u2019s arms!\u201d\u201cReally? Li Xin is already at level two of Body Tempering Stage, and he even cultivated the low grade Yellow Rank martial skill Fierce Tiger Fist to the Initial Stage. Don\u2019t tell me he couldn\u2019t even beat a mere first level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist like Duan Ling Tian?\u201d\u201cFierce Tiger Fist is useless! Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist is seemingly simple, but it has actually been stripped of all extravagances and returned to simplicity\u2026 Now that is formidable! Even Fifth Elder expressed admiration towards it\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026The effects of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist became more and more exaggerated as the news spread.Some Li Family disciples proclaimed it to be a Profound Rank martial skill, some proclaimed it to be an Earth Rank martial skill, and some even proclaimed that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist was a Heaven Rank martial skill!Within a room in a large courtyard of the Li Family Estate\u2026Seventh Elder Li Kun stood beside the bed, looking at the broken shoulder of his son who was so exhausted that he fell asleep.In his ears, the voice of the Grand Elder was still ringing, \u201cSeventh Elder, if it was just an ordinary cracked or broken bone then consuming a Grade Nine Gold Injury Pill and getting some rest would be enough to heal the injury. But your son Li Xin\u2019s shoulder blade has been totally shattered\u2026 Even if you can get a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill from the Patriarch, it would make no difference\u2026 You have my condolences.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I want you dead\u2026 You must die!!\u201dLi Kun\u2019s eyes opened wide and radiated a light of hatred as he gnashed his teeth and clenched his fists; Origin Energy bursted forth as he growled and roared.\u201cDad, how is my little brother?\u201dJust at this moment, a hurried voice sounded from outside, as a figure rushed in the room.This person was Li Jie, the eldest son of Seventh Elder and a famous genius martial artist of the Li Family.He stepped into the fourth level of Body Tempering Stage at the age of sixteen, and he even mastered the middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill Falling Leaf Palm.Li Family disciples were considered adults at the age of sixteen.After the coming of age ceremony, they would usually be sent to help at one of the Li Family businesses in Fresh Breeze Town, and even Li Jie was not exempted from these duties.He rushed home when he heard that his little brother Li Xin had been severely injured.Li Kun took a deep breath, and said in an extremely heavy voice, \u201cLittle Jie, your little brother\u2026 his right shoulder is crippled\u2026 Even Grand Elder is unable to do anything.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dLi Jie\u2019s body trembled, as if struck by lightning.The Grand Elder of the Li family was a famous Grade Nine Alchemist in the entire Fresh Breeze Town! Even Grand Elder was unable to treat his little brother\u2019s injuries. He was clear as to what this implied.\u201cLittle Xin\u2026\u201dStanding at the side of the bed and gazing at the soundly asleep Li Xin, Li Jie\u2019s eyes opened wide and radiated a light of hatred not one bit less than Li Kun!His mother died while giving birth to this little brother. He doted dearly upon his little brother all these years\u2026 Whether it was food or toys, he would always give priority to his little brother.But now, his little brother\u2019s right shoulder was crippled, and his future ruined. Li Jie\u2019s heart was filled with rage!\u201cDad, are you sure it was Duan Ling Tian?\u201d Li Jie asked while looking at Li Kun.When he initially heard about this incident, besides being worried for his little brother Li Xin, he felt a sense of disbelief\u2026 How could a piece of trash that couldn\u2019t even complete body tempering be capable of severely injuring his little brother?\u201cYes, I talked with Fifth Elder. It was Duan Ling Tian! Three days ago, that piece of trash hadn\u2019t even completed body tempering, but who could have known that today he had not only stepped into the first level of Body Tempering Stage, but also defeated your little brother. He even allegedly used a high ranked Martial Skill called Collapsing Fist!\u201d Li Kun gnashed his teeth while saying.\u201cLevel one of Body Tempering Stage; Collapsing Fist, huh?\u201dLi Jie laughed coldly, his gaze like that of a poisonous snake, \u201cFather, follow me!\u201dIn a quiet courtyard.\u201cMom, you sent for me. Did something happen?\u201d Duan Ling Tian, who just walked out of his room after he finished absorbing the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, looked at his mother Li Rou with a slightly embarrassed expression.Li Rou gazed at her son in a slightly absentminded manner.She still could not believe what she had heard earlier.As far as she was concerned, her son being able to complete his body tempering and step into the first level of the Body Tempering Stage was a difficult feat. But this kid\u2026 With just one trip to the Martial Pavilion, he crippled the arm of Seventh Elder\u2019s youngest son and even handed him an untreatable injury!\u201cCollapsing Fist\u2026 Tian, shouldn\u2019t you explain to Mom when you learned a martial skill that even Fifth Elder would exclaim in admiration at?Li Rou looked at Duan Ling Tian with a faint smile.\u201cMom, if I told you that when the old man taught me the medicinal formula he taught me this fist technique as well, would you believe me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had an embarrassed smile.\u201cTian, you\u2019re all grown up\u2026 Since you have secrets that you\u2019re unable to disclose, Mom won\u2019t force you. But you have to remember, no matter when and no matter what happens, Mom will always be there for you!\u201dLi Rou glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian, sighing faintly.\u201cMom.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled, his eyes slightly red.Just at this moment, a voice that was disgusting as a fly, broke the warm atmosphere between mother and son. \u201cNinth Elder, Li Kun requests for an audience!\u201d\u201cHe still dares to come here?\u201dLi Rou\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light.In the next moment, Seventh Elder Li Kun and his eldest son, Li Jie, walked into the courtyard, while glaring hatefully at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cSeventh Elder, you didn\u2019t come here on purpose just to make trouble for my son right?\u201d Li Rou took a step forward, shielding Duan Ling Tian behind her, and lightly smiled.\u201cNinth Elder be at ease\u2026 The battle between your son, Duan Ling Tian, and my son, Li Xin, was witnessed by Fifth Elder. His arm being crippled is a consequence of his inferior skill; he can\u2019t resent anyone but himself.\u201dLi Kun took a deep breath as he repressed the rage in his heart.\u201cThen, Seventh Elder came here for\u2026?\u201dLi Rou became curious after hearing what Li Kun said.\u201cGreetings Ninth Elder,\u201d Li Jie, who was beside Li Kun, stood out and said.After greeting Li Rou, Li Jie\u2019s eyes sparkled as he glanced at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cNinth Elder, my father followed me here\u2026 The reason I came here is to challenge Duan Ling Tian. I heard his Collapsing Fist is extremely formidable.\u201dHearing what he had to say, Li Rou\u2019s expression turned icy cold.\u201cLi Jie, if memory serves me right, you\u2019re one year older than my son and have already stepped into the fourth level of Body Tempering Stage, while my son is only at the first level of Body Tempering Stage\u2026 Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself for challenging him?\u201d Li Rou glanced at Li Jie and said indifferently.\u201cNinth Elder, Duan Ling Tian is no ordinary first level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist. He easily defeated my little brother, and his strength is formidable!\u201dLi Jie smiled, as if he didn\u2019t notice Li Rou\u2019s face turning cold.Just when Li Rou was about to harshly see her visitors out, Duan Ling Tian walked out from behind her.\u201cI can accept your challenge, but I have one condition!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It made her extremely unhappy that her son made a decision without consulting her first.\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Li Jie looked at Duan Ling Tian while asking.As long as Duan Ling Tian agreed to the challenge, he was prepared to agree to any reasonable conditions.This was the best opportunity to take revenge for his little brother, and he was unwilling to let the chance slip him by!\u201cMy condition is extremely simple: delay the battle for a month! After a month, I will fight you\u2026 If you\u2019re unwilling or scared, then it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just take it as if you never came here to challenge me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression was tranquil, as if he knew Li Jie would agree to his condition.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll give you a month\u2026 I hope that you don\u2019t cower in fear at that time!\u201dLi Jie did not hesitate at all as the corners of his mouth raised with a hint of a cold smile.After Li Kun and Li Jie left, Li Kun\u2019s eyebrows creased slightly as he said, \u201cLittle Jie, could it be that Duan Ling Tian delayed the battle for a month because he\u2019s confident he can beat you? Wasn\u2019t it slightly rash of you to accept his conditions so readily?\u201d\u201cDad, trash will always be trash\u2026 Even though he completed his body tempering, it\u2019s still only the first level of Body Tempering Stage! He might not even be able to step into level two of Body Tempering Stage in another month,\u201d Li Jie laughed confidently.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dLi Kun wanted to continue but was interrupted by Li jie.\u201cDad, you\u2019re afraid of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist right? Well you can be at ease. Even if his Collapsing Fist is a martial skill at the Profound Rank or above and even if he can step into the second level of Body Tempering Stage, do you really believe that he can shorten the difference of strength between us with just a Collapsing Fist?\u201dLevel three to level four of Body Tempering Stage was a significant divide, and the difference in strength between the two was over 100 pounds! There was no need to mention the difference of strength between level two and level four Body Tempering Stage\u2026\u201cDad is overthinking things. I must be dizzy from seeing your little brother injured.\u201dAfter Li Kun heard his son\u2019s logical and precise analysis, he smiled lightly and nodded.His eldest son had always been his pride and had never let him down.After Li Kun and his son left, Duan Ling Tian noticed his mother Li Rou\u2019s eyes glaring at him with a face covered in displeasure\u2026\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m confident!\u201d Duan Ling Tian hurriedly said.\u201cTian, I\u2019ve noticed the changes in you, but you shouldn\u2019t reach for what is beyond your grasp! Li Jie is the universally acknowledged genius among the Li Family disciples. He is one of the promising seedlings chosen for development in the Li Family. Li Jie is Li Family\u2019s universally acknowledged strongest fourth level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist! He is not someone his little brother Li Xin can compare to.\u201dLi Rou sighed faintly.\u201cMom, I\u2019m aware of all the things you said. Can you trust me please? I will win for sure. I won\u2019t disgrace you Mom!\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Li Rou with a serious expression.\u201cSilly child, Mom is not worried about shame; Mom is worried about you. Mom doesn\u2019t want what happened a few days ago to happen again\u2026 You nearly left me\u2026\u201dAs Li Rou spoke, her eyes slowly turned red.It seemed as if the incident that happened a few days ago had left a lingering shadow in her heart.\u201cMom, I promise I will never make you worried ever again!\u201d Duan Ling Tian pledged sincerely.\u201cOk, Mom trusts you. Don\u2019t hesitate to let Mom know if you need anything during this month.\u201dLi Rou lightly nodded as she forced out a slight smile.\u201cMom, help me buy another batch of the medicinal materials that you bought for me the other day. Also, I need some silver coins\u2026\u201dAfter getting some silver coins from his mother, Li Rou, Duan Ling Tian left his house courtyard and walked out of the Li Family estate.This would be the first time he was going out since arriving in this world.The Fresh Breeze Town Marketplace was divided into three bustling streets between three families, including the Li Family. Li Family\u2019s marketplace was situated towards the north, near the Li Family estate.Duan Ling Tian had only just walked into the Li Family marketplace when he began to hear the sound of hawkers peddling their wares from their booths all around the streets and alleyways. Booths on both sides of the street were filled with glittering arrays of exotic items.For a moment, Duan Ling Tian felt as if he time-travelled back to the ancient times from his previous life.This was a scene that could only be seen on television in his past life.Duan Ling Tian looked left and right as he walked along the road\u2026When he reached the entrance of the Li Family weapons store and saw the glittering array of neatly arranged weapons, he hesitated for a moment before moving on and leaving the Li Family marketplace. He entered the Chen Family marketplace towards the southwest of Fresh Breeze Town.The Chen Family was also one of the three major families in Fresh Breeze Town, on par with the Li Family and Fang Family.The three families formed a three way power struggle in Freeze Breeze Town and mutually restraining each other. Although there was no lack of opposition between the three families behind the scenes, it was quite peaceful on the surface because no one wanted to be the first to stand out and break the peace.As soon as he entered the Chen Family weapons store, an attendant greeted him, \u201cSir, may I ask what weapon you need?\u201dThe attendant smiled lightly.Duan Ling Tian shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not buying any weapons. I just want to buy some materials from you.\u201dHearing Duan Ling Tian, the attendant was shocked.A weapons craftsman was different from the blacksmiths that worked in the weapons store. Their status on Cloud Continent was on a par with alchemists.Every weapons craftsman was an individual that powers would fight over for!Weapons made by blacksmiths were only considered common weapons, but the weapons crafted by weapons craftsmen were Spirit Weapons, which had the ability to amplify attack power and resulted in items that were extremely extraordinary.In Fresh Breeze Town, each of the three families had an alchemist, but not one had a single weapons craftsman.This easily showed how rare a weapons craftsman was!\u201cSir, may I ask what materials you need? I will go get them right away.\u201dDuan Ling Tian noticed that the attitude of the attendant changed abruptly, and his voice even contained a hint of reverence.He easily guessed the reason but did not offer an explanation\u2026The materials he was buying were not for weapons crafting.The Rebirth Martial Emperor was a Royal Grade Weapons Craftsman, and he inherited all of his weapons crafting memories and experiences. However, a weapons craftsman required a minimum cultivation of the Core Formation Stage and the development of his Origin Energy first.Graded alchemists followed the same concept; without Origin Energy, it was impossible to form Pill Fire to refine medicinal pills.Duan Ling Tian listed out nine types of materials he needed in a single breath.He prepared these materials to carry out inscriptions.Inscription techniques were one of the rarest techniques in the entire Cloud Continent; they were usually inscribed on weapons or personal belongings.Items that had an inscription would carry an exotic or bizarre power.These powers weren\u2019t unique and consisted of various strange abilities. Once the power was released, the inscription would be fully expended,similar to a bomb which would be consumed once it exploded.From the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, Duan Ling Tian discovered that the period when inscription techniques developed to its pinnacle on Cloud Continent was precisely during Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s second lifetime.During that period, Rebirth Martial Emperor greedily mastered all of the practical inscription techniques!Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s Three Lives Rebirth Technique required the soul to slumber for 10,000 years before carrying out rebirth again.Only able to start looking for a new body 10,000 years later.Presently, 10,000 years had passed, and inscription techniques were gradually on the decline due to unknown circumstances.As such, inscription masters were highly sought after throughout the entire Cloud Continent; their statuses surpassed even those of alchemists and weapon craftsmen.The nine types of common materials that Duan Ling Tian wanted to buy were materials for him to inscribe a low level inscription.\u201cSir, these materials you requested cost a total of seven silver coins.\u201dThe attendant in the Chen family weapon store swiftly completed the preparation of the materials for Duan Ling Tian.After respectfully seeing Duan Ling Tian out, the attendant left the weapon store and headed to the Chen Family estate.The news that a weapons craftsman might have arrived in Fresh Breeze Town was something he had to report to the Patriarch at once so as to avoid letting the other two families beat them to the punch!\u201cThis money really isn\u2019t enough\u2026 Mom only gave me 20 silver coins, and I used nearly half of it in such a short amount of time.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and took a shortcut toward the Li Family estate.While passing by the intersection of the three marketplaces of Fresh Breeze Town, Duan Ling Tian noticed a group of people surrounding and pointing at something by the side of the road.Out of curiosity, Duan Ling Tian squeezed into the crowd.A girl in mourning attire with long hair covering her face was kneeling at the side of the road.Based on her figure, the young girl appeared to be around fifteen.In front of her laid a piece of paper with bright red writing: \u201cSelling body to pay for mother\u2019s burial!\u201dDuan Ling Tian never imagined that he would come across a scene that could only be seen on television in his previous life.As a former King of Weapons Specialists, his acute senses allowed him to clearly feel the desolate aura the young girl was emitting.\u201cHe he\u2026 Little girl, your figure is not bad. Lift up your head and let me see. If you look good, I\u2019ll buy you to be my servant girl.\u201dA potbellied fatty, with a temperament of one who had just struck it rich, looked pervertedly at the girl kneeling on the ground.\u201cYeah. If you don\u2019t even raise your head, nobody would dare to buy you,\u201d another person continued to instigate.\u201cI will only raise my head when a benefactor is willing to help me bury my mother,\u201d said the girl, without raising her head. Her voice was pleasant to the ears like an oriole singing, but it was also filled with a sense of unyieldingness.\u201cYour voice is not bad, but since you don\u2019t want to raise your head, you probably are ugly, I\u2026\u201dThe potbellied fatty was interrupted with a cold humph from Duan Ling Tian who could not bear to watch any longer.Duan Ling Tian walked before the young girl and lightly said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you 10 silver coins. Go bury your mother properly.\u201d\u201cThank you Young Master.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s body trembled, slowly raising her head, extending out a pair of delicate and tender hands to move apart the hair covering her face.She had a clean and fair complexion with a trace of slight immaturity, and her beautiful face, without makeup, was simple and elegant.Under her curved willow-leaf-like eyebrows were a pair of beautiful, clear eyes filled with grief, but they also contained a sense of strong will which caused a sense of pity to rise in others.Her fine, jade-like nose was straight and slightly raised, and she had attractive mellow red lips that gave people the urge to go up and kiss them!Like the fatty, Duan Ling Tian had initially assumed that this young girl was reluctant to raise her head because she did not look good, but who could have known that this young girl was actually a blossoming beauty!Combined with her delicate figure, she seemed fair, slim, and graceful. It would be easy to imagine how she would look once she grew up\u2026 She would definitely be drop-dead gorgeous.In that moment, the surrounding men all fiercely swallowed their saliva, and their eyes revealed their greed.\u201cHe only offered 10 silver coins. I\u2019ll offer 20! Follow me from now on.\u201dThe potbellied fatty hurriedly put forth a price, as he nearly began to drool after catching a glimpse of the young girl\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019ll offer 30!\u201dAnother person followed and offered a price.\u201cI\u2019ll offer 50!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll offer 60!\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian watched coldly from the side as the audience began competing as if it were an auction.If the young girl chose the highest bidder, he would leave right away. That type of person was not worth his help!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If not, today this little girl is mine!\u201d100 silver coins!The people that were still bidding shut their mouths.100 silver coins was over their budget.In their opinion, this young girl was not worth that much money.\u201cThank you everyone. Thank you.\u201dThe fatty smiled and cupped his hands to the surrounding people, pleased with himself.\u201cFrom now on, you will follow me\u201dSubsequently, he looked towards the kneeling young girl.Suddenly, a frivolous voice sounded, \u201cI offer 200 silver coins!\u201dThe crowd opened up a path, and a silk robed youth with a sickly complexion walked over. He had a thin figure and walked with light footsteps.\u201cFang Jian?\u201dDuan Ling Tian recognized the debaucherous youth; he was the son of the Patriarch of Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Fang Family.He was only 15 years old, but he had brought ruin to many young girls of respectable descent. He was infamous throughout Fresh Breeze Town.If it wasn\u2019t for his status and identity, he would have long been beaten to death!\u201cA despicable thing like you is capable of offering 200 coins?\u201dThe potbellied fatty looked at Fang Jian with disdain.He didn\u2019t notice that when Fang Jian appeared, most of the surrounding people had expressions of fear on their faces.\u201cYou\u2019re not from Fresh Breeze Town right?\u201d Fang Jian glanced at the fatty and said coldly.\u201cHumph! I\u2019m a merchant from outside who has experienced the world\u2026 Don\u2019t think that I didn\u2019t notice that you\u2019re wearing silk robes, but who knows where you stole it from! From the moment I saw your weak appearance, I knew you were a pauper. You\u2019re someone who would not look like a prince even after wearing royal garments\u2026 You\u2026 I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t even take out five silver coins, right?!\u201dThe fatty looked disdainfully at Fang Jian, with an expression that said \u2018I have seen through your disguise so you better hurry up and f**k off.\u2019\u201cPfft!\u201dDuan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter, and the surrounding people\u2019s faces were all red from trying to suppress their laughter. They were afraid of Fang Tian and thus did not dare laugh out loud.\u201cFatty, you\u2026 will die for sure!\u201dFang Tian glared at Ling Tian, then looked towards the fatty and took a deep breath.While the fatty was still in a daze, Fang Jian abruptly shouted, \u201cAll of you useless things, what are you all still standing there like idiots for? Hurry up and get over here. Beat this fatty to death! You didn\u2019t even know who I, Fang Jian, am\u2026 In Fresh Breeze Town, I am the lord!\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201dThree robust youths who were at a similar age as Fang Jian walked out and surrounded the fatty.The fatty was completely stunned.Although he had only arrived at Fresh Breeze town a few days ago, he had heard of most well-known people of Fresh Breeze Town, and one of them was the of the Fang Family\u2019s young Patriarch, Fang Jian.Fang Jian was an infamous young ruffian of Fresh Breeze Town who relied upon his family\u2019s power to bully men and forcibly seize women. Not many people dared to mess with him.\u201cOh\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s Young Master Fang. This lowly one is blind and didn\u2019t recognize Young Master Fang. Young Master Fang, please pardon my offense. I\u2019ll give up this girl to Young Master Fang\u2026\u201dThe fatty\u2019s face distorted, and he couldn\u2019t possibly keep up his smug expression. Cold sweat flowed from his forehead, and even his tone became humble and respectful.Fang Jian grunted coldly before shouting, \u201cIt\u2019s too late to beg for mercy now. Now beat him up for this young master!\u201d\u201cMercy, young master Fang\u2026 Have mercy\u2026\u201dThe three robust youths attacked, beating the fatty until he was running and rolling all over the place and emitting shrill cries while begging for mercy.The crowd consciously moved back a few steps and looked on from afar. They were afraid that they would get into trouble on account of the fatty\u2019s misfortune, and Young Master Fang\u2019s lackeys would target them.Fang Jian acted as if he could not hear the fatty\u2019s cries for mercy.\u201cLittle beauty, follow this young master home. I\u2019ll give you two hundred silver coins, and give your mother an extravagant burial. From now on, if you follow me, I will love you fondly.\u201dFang Jian looked at the young girl kneeling on the floor, his face covered with a mix of anxiousness and carnal desire. He stretched his hand out to hold hers \u2026The young girl was flustered. She tried to stand up, but, as a consequence of kneeling for too long, blood did not flow properly to her legs and they started trembling.\u201cYoung Master Fang, this other young master has already paid 10 silver coins and bought this servant. I am his for this lifetime.\u201d The young girl hid behind Duan Ling Tian and said with a trembling voice.\u201c10 silver coins? Did you not hear that I am offering 200 silver coins?\u201dFang Jian\u2019s face sunk. He felt as if he was cheated.\u201cI never asked anyone to bid. Anyone who was willing to be the first to help me bury my mother would be the one I would follow,\u201d the young girl said in an unyielding voice.\u201cNot bad, not bad. You have integrity. I like it! However, even if you want to follow him, he might not dare to\u2026 Kid, what say you?\u201dFang Jian looked towards Duan Ling Tian, his eyes shining with a cold light, with no lack of a threatening intention.Although Duan Ling Tian recognized Fang Jian, Fang Jian did not recognize him.\u201cYoung Master, save me\u2026\u201dThe young girl grabbed ahold of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sleeve, like she was holding onto the last lifeboat on a sinking ship.She had long since heard about Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s infamous Fang Jian, and she dreaded him from the bottom of her heart\u2026 She would rather die than be the servant of Fang Jian!\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly clapped the back of her hand and comforted her with a light smile.His smile washed over her like a spring breeze, and the young girl\u2019s anxious expression eased up slightly.\u201cYoung master, this pig fainted.\u201dThe fatty was beaten up until he was covered in blood and blacked out, causing Fang Jian\u2019s lackeys to stop.\u201cForget about him for now, come over here and look\u2026 someone is actually trying to snatch a woman from me!\u201dFang Jian glanced at Duan Ling Tian with a mocking smile.\u201cWho dares to try and snatch a woman from Young Master Fang!\u201dFang Jian\u2019s three lackeys stared at Duan Ling Tian menacingly.\u201cScram!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s voice was cold and detached, as if coming from hell, causing chills in the heart of anyone who heard it.Fang Jian and his three lackey\u2019s were stupefied, even the crowd was struck dumb.Where did this reckless guy come from?\u201cKid, do you know who I am?\u201dFang Jian asked with a cold smile, he even felt suspicious as to whether this kid even knew who he was\u2026\u201cAren\u2019t you that useless kid from the Fang Family? Relying on your family\u2019s power to bully men and forcible seize woman\u2026 I really wonder if the Fang Family was no more, what would happen to you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed coldly while holding the young girl\u2019s tender and delicate hands as he walked out of the crowd.\u201cKill him!\u201d Fang Jian\u2019s face was the color of a pig\u2019s intestine and he shouted with extreme rage.\u201cYes, Young Master!\u201dThe three lackey\u2019s rushed towards Duan Ling Tian.\u201cStand here and don\u2019t move.\u201d Lightly instructing the young girl, Duan Ling Tian did not have a sliver of fear when facing the three lackeys, and he directly went to meet them head on.He had already noticed earlier that the cultivation of the strongest of the three lackey\u2019s was only at the second level of Body Tempering Stage, therefore they were of no threat to him!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s leg moved slightly and dodged the attack of the strongest lackey as he brushed past him smoothly.Spinning his body around agilely, his upper body inclined backwards as his arms drew backward and his spine trembled; his whole body became like a heavy bow drawn to its limit and waiting to be released.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian swung out his right fist like an arrow leaving the bowstring, and his fist moved like a landslide. The strength in his entire body was focused in his fist, and it blasted into the back of the lackey, landing exactly on his spine\u2026Kacha!The lackey let out a harsh and shrill cry and was fiercely blown away; falling to the ground, he blacked out.This scene was practically the same as the scene from earlier in the morning when Duan Ling Tian defeated Li Xin\u2026The only difference was that Duan Ling Tian showed mercy when defeating Li Xin and only crippled an arm.However, this time he shattered the opponent\u2019s spine.Fang Jian\u2019s lackey would never be able to stand up again in his lifetime.The faces of the other two lackeys distorted, and they were stuck in a daze after seeing the strongest among them being beaten like that.However, even when they noticed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s stern gaze, they still forced themselves to go up against him.Bang! Bang!For Duan Ling Tian, teaching a lesson to two first level of Body Tempering Stage martial artists was as easy as playing a game.Casually moving a step, he lifted his hands and swung out both fists to smash downward from above. His fists hit both lackeys on the head and caused them to black out.Cleaving Fist!It was another type of Five Element Fist move from Form and Will Boxing.Only Fan Jian was left standing.Even though Fang Jian was the son of the Fang Family Patriarch, his debaucherous lifestyle drained his body of its vigor, and was only at the first level of Body Tempering Stage. His strength was even lower than that of his three lackeys.\u201cYou\u2026 Don\u2019t come near me\u2026 I\u2019m the young master of the Fang Family\u2026 If you dare touch me, your whole family will die!\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian walking towards him, Fang Jian\u2019s face distorted.\u201cWorthy of being called the Fang Family Young Master! Even in such a situation you still dare to threaten me!\u201d Duan Ling Tian laughed coldly, and he quickly moved forward two steps and kicked Fang Jian away.Spinning around, he pulled the dumbstruck, beautiful young girl and left, disappearing far away at the end of the road.\u201cSeems like this time Young Master Fang met a ferocious person. He went for wool but came home shorn!\u201d\u201cI wonder who that other Young Master was? He seemed to be around the same age as Fang Jian and his lackeys, but his strength is so shocking.\u201d\u201cHe dares to beat the young master of the Fang Family\u2026 He\u2019s no ordinary person for sure.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd dispersed slowly, their discussions carried a sense of pleasure taken at Fang Jian\u2019s misfortune.Duan Ling Tian followed the young girl back to her rundown room and spent a few silver coins on her mother\u2019s burial.\u201cTake this money to start a small business.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave his remaining silver coins to the young girl.\u201cYoung master, do you\u2026 dislike me?\u201dThe young girl\u2019s body trembled. Her face was deathly pale and carried a trace of weakness.Duan Ling Tian shook his head.\u201cWhat are you thinking of\u2026. You only tried to sell yourself to pay for your mother\u2019s burial because you had no other choice. My assistance required little to no effort., You don\u2019t need to use your life to repay me.\u201dSince the beginning, he had never intended for the young girl to be his servant.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re a good person. Let me follow you please\u2026 Mom is dead, and I have no one left in this world, please.\u201d The young girl extended her hand and grabbed on to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sleeve, and said in a delicate and touching manner.Noticing the anticipation in the young girl\u2019s eyes, Duan Ling Tian took a moment to think\u2026\u201cOk, you can follow me home,\u201d he decided.\u201cThank you Young Master!\u201dThe young girl immediately smiled like a flower.When Duan Ling Tian left the Li Family estate he was alone, but he had another person with him when he returned.On the way back, the young girl\u2019s extremely beautiful appearance caused many Li Family disciples to look her way, and they started guessing the identity of the young girl and her connection to Duan Ling Tian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With just a glance, Li Rou had a good impression of this beautiful young girl.\u201cThis is my mom,\u201d Duan Ling Tian introduced Li Rou to the young girl.\u201cI\u2019m Ke Er, nice to meet you Madam.\u201dThe young girl seemed ill at ease when she met Li Rou; her beautiful face flushed, making her look even cuter.\u201cTian, what\u2019s this all about?\u201dLi Rou glanced at Duan Ling Tian with a faint smile.She didn\u2019t expect that her son would return with a beautiful young girl after only going on a short outing.\u201cMom, it\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d Duan Ling Tian told his mother the story of how he met the young girl, Ke Er, and he did not conceal any information as he even included the part where he taught the Fang Family\u2019s Young Master a lesson.\u201cIs that the same Fang Jian who is infamous throughout Fresh Breeze Town? It doesn\u2019t matter if you beat him up. Even if the Fang Family comes here and tries to cause trouble, we are in the right.\u201dLi Rou displayed an expression of indifference and nodded. In the next moment, her gentle gaze full of motherly love slowly descended upon the young girl.\u201cKe Er, since you have no one left, you can stay with us. As it happens, the servant girl of my courtyard went back to her village yesterday to get married. You can stay in her room.\u201dLi Rou looked tenderly at the young girl.\u201cThank you Madam.\u201dKe Er hurriedly expressed her thanks as her rosy face flashed a brief expression of excitement.\u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you to get changed.\u201dLi Rou took hold of the young girl\u2019s hands and went into her bedroom, leaving a stunned and astounded Duan Ling Tian standing still.When the young girl followed Li Rou out once again, she had changed into bright and new clothes, and Li Rou even helped her put on a little bit of makeup.Her long jet black hair was now tied up, and her elegant face emitted a charming bright-red glow that made her seem like a lotus that had just bloomed.Her eyebrows were shaped like willow leaves, and eyes were shaped like apricots. Her fine nose and red lips\u2026 all seemed perfect.Her slightly expanding chest was like a budding flower; it seemed as if it would burst forth and blossom at any moment.She had a slender waist that could be embraced with a single arm; round and mellow buttocks; and long and slender legs. Her features made her appear fair, slim, graceful and likeable.\u201cLike the meaning of her name, she is indeed a likeable and cute girl.\u201dStanding to the side, Li Rou praised while looking at the young girl.\u201cKe Er, these clothes were mine when I was younger. They are yours from now on.\u201dLooking at the entranced Duan Ling Tian, Li Rou joked, \u201cLook, I only helped you put on a little bit of makeup, and someone is already staring blankly, wishing he could eat you up!\u201dHis mother\u2019s words cause Duan Ling Tian give an embarrassed smile, withdrawing his gaze from the young girl.The young girls elegant appearance after putting on some make up did indeed enchant him.As the King of Mercenaries from his previous life, he never had a lack of women by his side. Although those women were beautiful, they lacked elegance and refinement.On this point, they could not even be compared against Ke Er!\u201cMadam, I\u2019m just a servant girl\u2026 It\u2019s not proper for me to wear such clothes.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s words caused the young girl\u2019s face to become so red that it seemed as if blood might drip out. She was overwhelmed by the unexpected favor of Li Rou.Smilingly, Li Rou teased again, \u201cWho told you that you\u2019re a servant girl? Even if I wanted to make you my servant girl, I\u2019m afraid somebody won\u2019t even let me\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was speechless. Since the beginning, he had not uttered a single word, yet he still took a bullet!Hearing Li Rou, the young girl\u2019s face became even more red.Although Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t consider Ke Er to be a servant girl, the intelligent and sensible Ke Er still took on the responsibility of all the chores.As far as she was concerned, Young Master and Madam were kind enough to allow her to stay. If she didn\u2019t do anything to repay them, her heart wouldn\u2019t be at ease.The kind, sensible, and intelligent Ke Er quickly obtained the acknowledgment of Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian and quickly blended in into the small family.Fang Family estate.In a medium sized courtyard, middle aged man restlessly walked about, occasionally glancing at the nearby bedroom.Suddenly, the bedroom door opened, and an old man emerged from within.\u201cMaster Sun, how\u2019s the condition of my son?\u201dThe middle aged man hurriedly greeted the old man.\u201cManager Fang, the person who did this was extremely merciless and almost completely shattered your son\u2019s spine\u2026 Even after consuming a Grade Nine Gold Injury Pill, there were no signs of recovery. I am unable to do anything; you have my condolences.\u201dThe old man sighed while shaking his head.\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe middle aged man\u2019s faced distorted.Even the Grade Nine Alchemist that their Fang Family paid a hefty to sum to invite was unable to do anything. Did that mean his son would be crippled permanently and be stuck lying on a bed for the rest of his life?\u201cFang Qiang!\u201dRight at this moment, a dignified middle aged man walked in and passed an exquisite box to the Fang Family manager, Fang Qiang.\u201cThis is a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill, quickly let your son consume it.\u201d\u201cPatriarch!\u201dFang Qiang stared blankly.Although he wanted to beg the Patriarch for the Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill, when he thought about how the Fang Family only had one Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill, he could only give up on the idea because he did not believe he would be able to obtain the pill with his status as the Fang Family manager.When he saw the Patriarch delivering the Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill to him, he couldn\u2019t help himself from getting excited.\u201cFang Qiang, if it wasn\u2019t for my unfilial son causing trouble, your son wouldn\u2019t have been injured. I apologize for this incident\u2026 As for that unfilial son, I will surely severely punish him and give you a satisfying explanation,\u201d Patriarch Fang Yi said with an expression of shame and regret.\u201cPatriarch!\u201dFang Qiang was so agitated that he knelt down; the sliver of displeasure in his heart disappeared completely.\u201cGet up and quickly give the medicinal pill to your son,\u201d Fang Yi said.Fang Qiang stood up and began to extend his hands out to receive the Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill from Fang Yi.\u201cManager Fang, if I were to be straightforward\u2026 Let alone a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill, even a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill would be unable to heal your son\u2019s injuries!\u201d the old man standing to the side abruptly said.\u201cUnless you have a Bone Formation Pill\u2026 But Bone Formation Pills are extinct.\u201dFang Qiang\u2019s extended hand stiffened, and the rekindled hope in his heart was mercilessly shattered again.\u201cNevertheless, let him consume it and try his luck,\u201d Fang Yi said.\u201cPatriarch, it\u2019s not necessary. I believe Master Sun. There\u2019s no point in wasting this precious medicinal pill on my son.\u201dFang Qiang shook his head.\u201cWhat I want to do the most know is to find out who crippled my son and seek revenge!\u201dTaking a deep breath, Fang Qiang\u2019s eyes emitted a cold light of hatred.\u201cManager Fang, you can be assured that the entire Fang Family will spare no efforts in finding the assailant!\u201d said Fang Yi in a resolute voice.\u201cThank you Patriarch.\u201dLi Family estate.A piece of shocking news spread among the Li Family members like lightning.Next month, Li Family\u2019s genius martial artist Li Jie would fight a battle against Ninth Elder\u2019s son Duan Ling Tian!Allegedly, for the sake of this battle, Seventh Elder even went to request the Patriarch and Grand Elder to be the witnesses to the battle.This news caused quite a large sensation in the Li Family.\u201cThe moment Li Xin\u2019s arm was crippled by Duan Ling Tian, I knew that Seventh Elder and Li Jie wouldn\u2019t be willing to let go. Who could have known that they would take action so swiftly!\u201d\u201cHe he\u2026 A fourth level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist challenging a first level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist. For the sake of his brother, Li Jie is really going all out and throwing away all his pride!\u201d\u201cI wonder what Duan Ling Tian was thinking. To actually agree to Li Jie\u2019s challenge\u2026 It couldn\u2019t be that his brain got fried when he was beaten up by Li Xin before, right?\u201d\u201cLi Jie will show no mercy in this battle, and even if he can\u2019t kill Duan Ling Tian, he will definitely cripple him!\u201d\u2026\u2026No one had high hopes for Duan Ling Tian.One was the famous genius martial artist of the Li Family with boundless potential, who stepped into the fourth level of Body Tempering stage at the age of sixteen.The other was an obscure disciple with another surname who had only recently completed body tempering and become a first level of Body Tempering Stage martial artist.Although relying upon the strange and formidable Collapsing Fist allowed him to defeat Li Xin at the second level of Body Tempering Stage, no one would consider that he would able to defeat Li Jie even then.Although Li Jie and Li Xin were siblings, their strength was not on the same level at all.While the whole Li Family was stirred up about the upcoming battle, the person concerned with the whole matter seemed to have vanished.\u201cDone!\u201dLooking at the ring on the middle finger of his right hand, Duan Ling Tian had a smile on his face.Relying on Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s thorough comprehension of the inscription technique, he succeeded in inscribing the ring on his first try.\u201cLi Jie, when the day comes, I\u2019ll give you a pleasant surprise.\u201dThe corner of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up, forming an evil smile.\u201cYoung master, the water is ready.\u201dBehind the bedroom screen, the young girl gracefully walked out as she has finished changing the water in the bath barrel for Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKe Er, you must be tired. Go get some rest.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked over, extended his hand, and used his sleeve to help wipe the sweat off the young girl\u2019s forehead.The entire process was extremely gentle.\u201cKe Er, let me do this kind of hard labor from now on,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said with an expression of pity.\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s alright. After bathing with the medicinal liquid you gave me, Ke Er is very strong\u2026\u201dThe young girl shook her little arms, and a touched smile appeared on her flushed face.\u201cSeems like our Ke Er is going to complete her body tempering and become a martial artist as soon as she starts cultivating a cultivation method.Duan Ling Tian lightly kneaded the young girl\u2019s little arms and smiled.\u201cYoung Master, Ke Er knows you treat me very well, but Ke Er also knows that families such as the Li Family have their own set of rules. Cultivation methods are not permitted to be casually passed on to others\u2026 Ke Er is happy as long as Ke Er is able to accompany you and Madam. It doesn\u2019t matter if Ke Er can become a martial artist or not,\u201d Ke Er sensibly said.\u201cSilly girl, if I wanted to pass a cultivation method to you, naturally it would not be one from the Li family. Ok, you go and have a rest, I\u2019ll come look for you in your room later this evening\u2026 Eh, Ke Er why did your face suddenly turn so red; are you ok?\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and lightly smiled.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re so evil, bullying Ke Er\u2026\u201dAfter being made fun of by Duan Ling Tian, the young girl fled, leaving a laughing Duan Ling Tian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If not, even with the help of inscriptions, I will lose the initiative in the battle with Li Jie.\u201dLi Jie was a fourth level Body Tempering stage martial artist, so his cultivation provided him with an extra two hundred pounds of strength. Furthermore, his body, bones, and internal organs had gone through a large degree of metamorphosis which caused its toughness to rise beyond that of an ordinary person\u2019s body.If Duan Ling Tian does not break through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage by the end of the one month period, even if Li Jie stands there like a punching bag, Duan Ling Tian still might not be able to injure him even if Form and Will Boxing is stronger.The concept is likened to a child that has just learned to walk. Even if the child has a Grandmaster level Form and Will Boxing comprehension, the child will not be able to harm an adult.The child and the adult are not on the same level playing field.If one\u2019s strength can\u2019t even go through the opponent\u2019s defense, what use would skills and techniques have?\u201cRight, I have a rendezvous with Ke Er.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked out of his room thinking about what cultivation method he should pass to Ke Er.Besides the two top cultivation methods, Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique and Three Lives Rebirth Technique, Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories contained many other cultivation methods that could be cultivated to the Martial Emperor Stage.It\u2019s not that Duan Ling Tian was unwilling to pass on the best Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique to Ke Er and was purposely concealing it, the issue was that this cultivation method pursued a Dao of indomitable fierceness, so it was not suitable for women.\u201cGot it, this cultivation method isn\u2019t bad\u2026. Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique, the cultivation method of a Martial Emperor from twenty thousand years ago. This Martial Emperor was a formidable cultivator of the sword, and most importantly, she was a woman!\u201dNo matter whether it was Earth from his previous life or his current lifetime in Cloud Continent, in terms of physical constitution, women were naturally weaker than men; this was an undeniable fact.In Cloud Continent, if a woman wanted to become strong, she would need to put in much more effort than a man would!Frost Martial Emperor aroused deep veneration and respect in Duan Ling Tian!Through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian found out that Rebirth Martial Emperor and Frost Martial Emperor had battled once\u2026.In that battle, the wager was their personal cultivation methods. In the end, Rebirth Martial Emperor won, and that is how he acquired Frost Martial Emperor\u2019s cultivation method.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll pass this cultivation method to Ke Er.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian finally made his decision, he had already arrived outside Ke Er\u2019s bedroom.He lightly knocked on the door.The door opened.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dThe young girl lightly said when she saw Duan Ling Tian, then her immature and beautiful face turned slightly red.Duan Ling Tian entered Ke Er\u2019s bedroom and closed the door behind him.\u201cKe Er, I\u2019ve already thought about which cultivation method to pass on to you. Come, I\u2019ll pass the Body Tempering section to you first. You need to remember it properly.\u201dLooking at the young girl who was not at ease due to being nervous, Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled.The young girl lightly nodded, listening seriously.It has to be said that Ke Er was indeed a very intelligent young girl.Duan Ling Tian only recited the Body Tempering section of Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique three times before Ke Er was able to fully memorize it.But, problems arose quickly as well.\u201cYoung master, I\u2026.Although I have already memorized the cultivation method, I don\u2019t know where all the acupuncture points listed are located. What should I do?\u201dKe Er looked eagerly at Duan Ling Tian with a delicate and touching expression.\u201cI was careless. Why don\u2019t I teach you how to identify those acupuncture points?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed for a moment before shaking his head and smiling.\u201cOK, OK.\u201dKe Er nodded excitedly.In Ke Er\u2019s heart, she really desired to become a martial artist.In her mind, once she becomes a martial artist, she will be able to protect her loved ones like the young master and the madam.Following the directions of Duan Ling Tian, Ke Er sat on the bed facing him.\u201cKe Er, the Jiu Wei Acupuncture Point is seven inches above the belly button\u2026.Yes, it\u2019s here.\u201dDuan Ling Tian slowly extended his hand and located her belly button through her thin clothes. His finger moved upwards and stopped at her Jiu Wei Acupuncture Point.\u201cKe Er, have you remembered it?\u201dDuan Ling Tian could feel how her body was trembling lightly.He thought about how sensitive this girl was while secretly laughing to himself.\u201cYes\u2026.Yes, I\u2019ve remembered.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s face was as red as an apple and her voice was lightly quivering because she was feeling extremely shy.Duan Ling Tian taught her how to identify the acupuncture points one by one.As his hand slowly moved upwards, the young girl\u2019s body started to shake even more intensely, causing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart to become slightly restless.Although Ke Er was only fifteen, she had developed well. To Duan Ling Tian, it was undoubtedly an enormous temptation.After he became a mercenary in his previous life, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s life could be described as unrestrained.Of course, it was merely for amusement most of the time.As a mercenary that was constantly in the battlefield, he was self-conscious.He knew that love was just a dream, and he wasn\u2019t willing to allow a woman to become a weak point that his enemies could use against him.\u201cKe Er, can you still continue?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked after noticing that she was covered in sweat.\u201cYoung master, you can continue.\u201dShe said unyieldingly.\u201cKe Er, here is the Shan Zhong Acupuncture Point.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, then he extended a finger and pressed down again.Ke Er\u2019s body trembled intensely, as if shocked by electricity. She could not hold on any longer, so she fell forward into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s embrace.As the beautiful young girl covered in sweat fell down on him, a sweet scent entered his nose. Duan Ling Tian caught her in his arms.When the soft and supple figure entered his arms, the mood in the room became slightly charming and gentle\u2026.The young girl\u2019s body trembled and she shyly lowered her head.It coincidentally knocked into a hard object, causing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face to distort. He then let out a smothered sound.\u201cYoung master, you\u2026.you\u2019re OK, right?The young girl hurriedly raised her head, looking at Duan Ling Tian with a slightly panic-stricken expression.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dDuan Ling Tian forced out a low growl from his throat.The young girl seemed to have realized something at this moment, so she shyly lowered her head, not daring to look at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKe Er, ask my mother to teach you how to identify the rest of the acupuncture points. I need to leave now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian unwillingly got off the bed and fled.\u201cI\u2019m so ashamed\u2026.just now I actually\u2026.actually\u2026.\u201dHe left behind the young girl whose face was so red that it seemed as if blood would drip out at any moment talking to herself in a low voice.After Duan Ling Tian left the young girl\u2019s room, he took a deep breath. He was afraid that he would be unable to refrain himself from doing something crazy.According to what people would say in his previous life.The fifteen-year-old Ke Er was a girl that had not reached adulthood.\u201cTian, why are you coming out of Ke Er\u2019s room, huh?\u201dLi Rou, who had just returned, coincidentally bumped into Duan Ling Tian and noticed his panicked discomposure.\u201cMom, I have things to do. I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian noticed Li Rou\u2019s gaze, he laughed embarrassedly and hurriedly returned to his room.As someone who was experienced, Li Rou couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter.It seemed her son had grown up.Li Rou walked up and entered Ke Er\u2019s room which had not been closed yet.\u201cKe Er, you\u2026.\u201dLi Rou was just in time to see the young girl sitting on her bed with a flushed complexion. Li Rou\u2019s gaze had a hint of playfulness.\u201cMadam!\u201dNoticing Li Rou, the young girl was startled.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking, I\u2026.Young master\u2026.Young master was just teaching me how to identify acupuncture points.\u201dShe hurriedly explained.\u201cIdentify acupuncture points?\u201dAfter hearing her, Li Rou\u2019s gaze became even weirder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When their eyes met, she lowered her head in panic as a slight trace of rosy red emerged on her face.The young girl was wearing light green clothes that showed off her developing figure.A pair of budding flowers that unintentionally released the temptation of youthfulness.A slender waist that could be embraced with one arm was tied with a light blue belt that fluttered with the wind\u2026.Gazing at the young girl outside, Duan Ling Tian was absent-minded for a moment.\u201cKe Er, you woke up so early.\u201dComing back to his senses, Duan Ling Tian smiled slightly.He sighed lightly in his heart. In this past month, since she completed her body tempering, her body was becoming more and more hot.As Duan Ling Tian continued to size her up, her face was so red that it seemed that blood might drip out.\u201cYoung master, madam said that she will be going ahead. She asked me to come wake you up and come together with you. I didn\u2019t expect young master to be awake so early.\u201dThe young girl blinked her eyes. Her willow leaf eyebrows curved into the shape of a crescent moon as she lightly nodded.What the young girl said caused Duan Ling Tian to laugh bitterly.\u201cKe Er, you\u2026.broke through to the second level of the Body Tempering stage?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian gazed at the young girl with a shocked expression when he noticed that she had broken through.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to young master and the medicinal liquid that you concocted for me. If not for that, Ke Er\u2019s progress would not be so quick.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s clear eyes slightly moved and her willow leaf eyebrows lightly rose. She lightly nodded her chin and the corners of her mouth held a moving smile.\u201cThe medicinal liquid is just a secondary factor; the most important point is that you have good innate talent. It seems like Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique is very suitable for you\u2026.Ke Er, you will need a sword since you\u2019re cultivating a sword cultivation method. Later in the afternoon, I\u2019ll take you out to go buy a sword.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled.\u201cYoung master, didn\u2019t you say that the body tempering section of Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique didn\u2019t contain any matching sword skills?The young girl blinked her clear eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll teach you other sword skills. Do you want to learn?\u201dDuan Ling Tian playfully asked.\u201cYes!\u201dShe hurriedly nodded, seemingly afraid that Duan Ling Tian might go back on his word.\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s go.\u201dAfter walking out of his room and closing the door behind him, he naturally extended his hand and held the tender and delicate hand of the young girl. His actions seemed extremely natural and smooth, as if he had practiced countless times.\u201cYes, we can\u2019t let madam wait for us for too long.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s face had a smile of happiness as her little hands exerted force to hold the youth\u2019s hand tightly.The young couple held hands as they walked out of the courtyard and towards the Li Family Martial Arts Practice Hall.On the way, they attracted many gazes that contained jealousy, admiration, and hatred.The way some Li Family disciples gazed at Duan Ling Tian made it seem as if their eyes would spit fire at any moment. They wished they could push Duan Ling Tian aside and take his place.There were also some young girls who had expressions of jealousy when they looked at Ke Er, who was beautiful enough to resemble a little celestial maiden.\u2026\u2026The Li family Martial Arts Practice Hall was an enormous greenstone arena.The terrain outside the arena had a slightly higher elevation. Right now there was a stream of people going there. These people were all Li family disciples that were gathering together. They were bustling with so much noise and excitement that the force of the sound shot up to the sky.\u201cIt\u2019s only two youths having a battle, but nearly all the elders of the family have come. What a spectacle!\u201d\u201cYeah, even the family\u2019s marketplace managers have returned from Fresh Breeze Town. The size of the occasion today can be compared to a coming of age ceremony.\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, the reason that all the elders have returned is because Seventh Elder invited the Grand Elder and the Patriarch to bear witness. They have no choice but to come or it would be disrespectful.\u201d\u2026\u2026At the front of the Martial Arts Practice Arena, there was a high platform on which seating had been laid. Many people were already sitting there enjoying some scented tea.These people were the higher-ups of the Li family.The Li family Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, sat in the middle.Besides the empty seat beside him, the other seats had all been taken. Behind each of these Li family Elders stood a few youths and young girls.As the Ninth Elder of the Li family, Li Rou sat at the edge. Her face was tranquil as if her expression would not change even if Mount Tai collapsed in front of her.\u201cNinth Elder, you have good self-control.\u201dSeventh Elder Li Kun and Li Rou were separated by the Eighth Elder. Li Kun leaned his head over to look at Li Rou and smiled faintly.Li Kun had an expression of utter confidence in victory.Li Rou acted as if she didn\u2019t hear him and completely ignored him, causing the Eighth Elder who was in the middle to be unable to refrain from revealing an odd smile on his face.\u201cHumph!\u201dLi Kun grunted out of anger.He wanted to see how long Li Rou could continue putting up her act.Today, his son Li Jie will surely cripple Duan Ling Tian and take revenge for that kid who will be unable to recover from his injuries.\u201cGrand Elder!\u201d\u201cGrand Elder!\u201d\u2026\u2026The stream of people split apart.Along with respectful greetings full of reverence, an aged figure walked up the high platform.It was the Li Family Grand Elder, Li Huo!\u201cGrand Elder!\u201dIncluding Patriarch Li Nan Feng, all of the Li family elders stood up and respectfully saluted the old man.This old man was not only the strongest person in the Li family, he was also a respected Grade Nine Alchemist.In the Cloud Continent, only a graded alchemist could be considered to be a real alchemist.Becoming an alchemist required one to meet extremely stringent requirements.It can be said that out of a thousand Core Formation stage martial artists, there was a chance that not even one would be capable of becoming an alchemist.In Fresh Breeze Town, the three families each had one Grade Nine Alchemist.But only the Li Family\u2019s alchemist was of their own kin, whereas the alchemists of the other two families were invited into the family by paying hefty sums. Those alchemists could leave at any moment.The old man lightly nodded and sat at the seat beside the Patriarch Li Nan Feng, then he closed his eyes and rested his mind.\u201cLittle Jie, since Grand Elder has already arrived, go enter the arena.\u201dSeventh Elder said to Li Jie, who was standing behind him. After nodding his head, Li Jie walked off into the spacious Martial Arts Practice Hall.\u201cEven Grand Elder has arrived and Li Jie has entered the arena, but why hasn\u2019t Duan Ling Tian arrived yet?\u201d\u201cWhat haughty manners Duan Ling Tian has!\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t afraid to come, right?\u201d\u2026\u2026The Li family disciples surrounding the Martial Arts Practice Hall started to talk to each other. Some of them were even feeling contemptuous toward Duan Ling Tian.\u201cNinth Elder, even Grand Elder has arrived; why hasn\u2019t your son Duan Ling Tian arrived yet? He isn\u2019t afraid to come, right?\u201dSeventh Elder purposely said loudly on the high platform.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Seventh Elder. Since my son has agreed to the battle, he will naturally come.\u201dLi Rou made a light \u201chumph\u201d sound.\u201cNinth Elder, I feel there is no reason to conduct today\u2019s battle. Why don\u2019t you concede on behalf of your son? At least this way you can avoid him getting injured and prevent the relationship between you and Seventh Elder from getting hurt.\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping, a man with a knife scar on his face, said coolly as he was on good terms with Li Kun.\u201cSixth Elder, according to what you said, do you think that Li Jie will win for sure?\u201dFifth Elder could not refrain from asking.\u201cThat is a publically acknowledged fact.\u201dLi Ping smiled.\u201cThen Sixth Elder, let\u2019s make a bet\u2026.If Li Jie wins, I\u2019ll pay you five hundred silver, but if Duan Ling Tian wins, you will pay me five hundred silver. What say you?\u201dLi Ting looked deeply at Li Ping before slowly saying this.The Li family elders were only paid no more than twenty silver each month. Li Ting unexpectedly used a few years\u2019 worth of his salary to make the bet!The Li family higher-ups at the scene, including the Patriarch Li Nan Feng, looked at Li Ting in shock. Never could they have imagined that he was so confident towards Duan Ling Tian.Even Grand Elder Li Huo opened his eyes and looked deeply at Li Ting.After hearing what Li Ting had said, Li Ping\u2019s eyes shone brightly.He was originally a person who liked to gamble; he could be considered a gambling addict. In his mind, Li Ting was gifting him free money.The only problem was that he did not have five hundred silver at the moment.His money was mostly spent at the gambling den.\u201cAre you afraid, Sixth Elder?\u201dSeeing that Li Ping was quiet, Li Ting laughed.Li Ping\u2019s face instantly turned red. He leaned over and looked toward Seventh Elder Li Kun.\u201cSixth Elder, I can lend you five hundred silver. Furthermore, I will take out another five hundred silver to bet with Fifth Elder. Are you willing to bet with me, Fifth Elder?\u201dLi Jie said, after noticing Li Ping\u2019s difficulties. He looked at Li Ting with a keen gaze.Li Ting frowned.Although five hundred silver was only a few years\u2019 worth of salary, once the expenses for these few years were taken into account, Li Ting only had around eight hundred silver saved up.Li Kun, who could collect a savings of a thousand silver, could be considered to be rich amongst the Li family Elders.It could be said that Li Kun was risking his entire fortune and going all out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t you dare to bet with Seventh Elder?\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping laughed with a complacent expression.Just as Li Ting was about to ask the other elders for a loan.\u201cSeventh Elder, I\u2019ll take you up on that five hundred silver bet!\u201dA voice sounded from afar.Following this voice came a young couple walking together hand in hand.The one who spoke earlier was the youth.The youth had sword-shaped eyebrows and starry eyes; he was extremely handsome with a graceful bearing.It was indeed Duan Ling Tian!\u201cNinth Elder, after spending most of your money on your son in these years, could it be that you still have five hundred silver left?\u201dSeventh Elder Li Kun ridiculed while take a deep glance at Li Rou.Li Rou\u2019s eyebrows creased slightly and she sighed lightly in her heart.\u201cGreetings, Patriarch, Grand Elder, and all Elders.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked up the high platform while holding Ke Er\u2019s hand and lightly bowed to the Li family higher-ups.Patriarch Li Nan Feng glanced at Duan Ling Tian with an expression of shock. The last time he saw him was a month ago.At that time, Li Rou was in a rage and was punishing Seventh Elder\u2019s son, Li Xin.At that time, Duan Ling Tian was just a sickly person.But Duan Ling Tian seemed like a completely different person now!\u201cThird level of the Body Tempering stage\u2026Duan Ling Tian, you actually broke through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage!\u201dWhen Li Nan Feng instinctively checked up on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation, his pupils shrank and his face had an expression of disbelief.Lin Nan Feng\u2019s shocked exclamation was like a rock falling into a pool and causing a thousand waves.Instantly, everyone on the platform had their gazes on Duan Ling Tian.After a brief moment, everyone on the platform except for Li Rou and Li Ting had expressions of disbelief.\u201cIf memory serves me right, a month ago when he was severely injured by Li Xin, he wasn\u2019t even a martial artist yet!\u201d\u201cIn only one month, this Duan Ling Tian went from being from an ordinary person to completing body tempering and subsequently reached the third level of the Body Tempering stage\u2026.I\u2019m not seeing things, am I?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing things; he really is at the third level of the Body Tempering stage. Seems like he must have obtained some fortuitous gain!\u201d\u2026\u2026Including Seventh Elder, most of the Elders were all struck dumb.The scene in front of them was something that took them quite a while to react to.Grand Elder Li Huo opened his eyes and looked at Duan Ling Tian with an intrigued expression.Li Kun drew in a breath of cold air.Duan Ling Tian breaking through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage was something that exceeded his expectations.However, once he thought about the difference between the third level and the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage, he felt at ease once again.In his opinion, whether Duan Ling Tian was at the second level or the third level of the Body Tempering stage made no difference to his son Li Jie\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you said earlier that you\u2019re willing to bet five hundred silver with me?\u201dLi Kun looked at Duan Ling Tian as he asked.\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cBut to the best of my knowledge, Ninth Elder has spent most of her money on you in the past few years, so I\u2019m afraid her savings are not enough to amount to five hundred silver.\u201dLi Kun said.His face had a complacent expression as he waited for Duan Ling Tian to yield.\u201cYou\u2019re right, my family really can\u2019t gather five hundred silver.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.The financial situation of his family was something that even he knew about.It was also for this reason that he wanted to cheat Li Kun of his five hundred silver.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, the bet between me, Fifth Elder, and Sixth Elder are done using presently available money. The money must be passed over to the Patriarch so that he may bear witness\u2026.If you think you can make a bet without actually having the money to back it up, you are wrong.\u201dLi Kun smiled mockingly.\u201cDid I say I was going to place the bet without having the money first? Do you think I am like you?\u201dDisdainfully glancing at Li Kun and ignoring his eyes that were seemingly flaming, Duan Ling Tian let go of the young girl\u2019s hand and lightly said, \u201cKe Er, go to my mother.\u201dThe young girl cleverly nodded and went to stand beside Li Rou.\u201cNinth Elder, you have such good fortune!\u201dSome of the elders glanced at the young girl and congratulated Li Rou one after the other.All of them noticed that the young girl would grow up to be a drop dead gorgeous beauty on par with Li Rou.Li Rou smiled in response to the elders\u2019 congratulations.Beside her, the young girl\u2019s face had long ago flushed red from embarrassment.<\u201cWhat is Tian planning to do?\u201d>Watching her son going against Seventh Elder Li Kun, Li Rou\u2019s eyes flashed with a sliver of doubt.It was getting tougher to understand her son.\u201cThen let me see how you, Duan Ling Tian, produce five hundred silver today. If I\u2019m not wrong, even Fifth Elder isn\u2019t able to produce another five hundred silver .\u201dLi Kun glanced at Duan Ling Tian in disdain.Just when Li Ting was about to take out his last three hundred silver, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s reply not only interrupted his actions but also caused him to have an astounded expression on his face.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Seventh Elder, I\u2019m not planning on borrowing money from Fifth Elder\u2026.\u201dSaid Duan Ling Tian, under gazes of disbelief from the Li family higher ups. He then walked to the front of Grand Elder.\u201cGrand Elder, I know that because you usually have to cultivate and refine medicine, your body probably has many hidden injuries\u2026.How bout I help give you a massage and then you give me five hundred silver as payment. What say you?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Li Huo and faintly smiled.\u201cTian, don\u2019t cause trouble!\u201dLi Rou\u2019s face distorted.In the Li family, Grand Elder\u2019s status was even above the Patriarch. Seeing her son being conceited in front of the Grand Elder, she felt angry and worried.Hidden injuries?Grand Elder was a Grade Nine Alchemist; if he really had any hidden injuries, he would have treated himself already.Just when the Patriarch and all the higher ups were expecting Grand Elder to be furious.\u201cYou want five hundred silver only for giving me a massage? Kid, you really know how to demand an exorbitant price.\u201dLi Huo glanced at Duan Ling Tian with an intrigued expression, lightly smiling.\u201cGrand Elder, how about I give you the massage first\u2026.After it\u2019s done, you judge the effect yourself and pay me according to how much you think it\u2019s worth.\u201dDuan Ling Tian made nothing of what Li Huo had said.Hearing what Duan Ling Tian said aroused Li Huo\u2019s interest.\u201cOK, I\u2019m curious about what you\u2019re capable of, kid.\u201dThe only reason he agreed was because Duan Ling Tian had changed so much in the past month.In one month\u2019s time, breaking through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage from an ordinary person was something truly unbelievable.As a Grade Nine Alchemist, he was well aware.A normal person would be unable to completely transform into a third level Body Tempering martial artist in a mere month\u2019s time even if that person had an unending supply of body tempering medicinal pills.The present Duan Ling Tian was covered in mystery.Moreover, his body really did have hidden injuries which had worried him for all these years, so he wanted to give Duan Ling Tian\u2019s massage a try.Seeing Duan Ling Tian standing behind Li Huo and placing his hand on his shoulders, most of the Li family elders had odd expressions on their faces.They thought that Ninth Elder\u2019s son was dreaming. If a casual massage could really earn five hundred silver, they would resign from being elders to go be masseuses.Seeing this scene, the corner of Li Kun\u2019s mouth curled into a cold smile.Not respecting hierarchy and playing tricks on the Grand Elder!Not only would Grand Elder be furious, it would also be a crime against the Li family!In his opinion, Duan Ling Tian was out of luck.Li Jie and the surrounding Li family disciples in the Martial Arts Practice Hall were unable to hear what was said on the high platform, so they did not know what was happening.Seeing Duan Ling Tian standing behind Grand Elder and giving him a massage, their eyes nearly dimmed and they almost blacked out!What was Duan Ling Tian doing? Did he think that giving a massage to the Grand Elder would make the Grand Elder bestow him with the strength to defeat Li Jie?\u201cF**K! What is this Duan Ling Tian doing?!\u201d\u201cInstead of getting into the arena as soon as he arrived, he\u2019s busy flattering the elders. Is he trying to win favor from the Grand Elder because he\u2019s worried that Li Jie will beat him up too badly?\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re right. Seems like the only possible explanation.\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian\u2019s action caused anger in the masses.\u201cGrand Elder, while I\u2019m massaging, please don\u2019t circulate your Origin Energy.\u201dSaid Duan Ling Tian to Li Huo. Using force in his hands, he started kneading Li Huo\u2019s shoulders\u2026.At this moment, a segment of memories flashed by in his mind.This segment of memories belonged to Rebirth Martial Emperor; it was a very ingenious massaging technique. This technique was made to treat the side effects present on the bodies of low-grade alchemists.Just now when he saw Grand Elder for the first time, Duan Ling Tian noticed from the light black spot between his eyebrows that he was suffering from side effects.This kind of side effect usually presented itself on low-grade alchemist who had to research the methods of refining medicine by themselves.Usually these side effects would not cause any discomfort, but when the alchemist circulates Origin Energy, there will be some pain in the body. On rare occasions, this pain would hurt so badly that it would feel like a knife was being twisted inside one\u2019s heart and living would be no better than dying.Duan Ling Tian learned all of this from Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories.Rebirth Martial Emperor, being a formidable alchemist himself, had researched the art of refining medicine to mastery, so there was nothing he wasn\u2019t capable of.Abruptly, the movement of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands that were kneading Li Huo\u2019s shoulders increased in speed!Li Huo\u2019s expression changed from being tranquil and he started to tremble.Soon after, he clenched his teeth with a ferocious expression on his face as if he was dealing with extremely intense pain.The Li family higher-ups on the platform all felt chills go down their spines\u2026.How painful could it be to cause the formidable Grand Elder to have such an expression?Fifteen minutes later, Duan Ling Tian stopped while sweating heavily.\u201cHu!\u201dAt this moment, Li Huo spat out a mouthful of foul air. After slowly opening hi eyes, they shone like there was an array of stars inside. He seemed as if he had grown ten years younger.Origin Energy was circulating smoothly throughout his body, causing him to feel a pleasant feeling like never before!In the past, circulating his Origin Energy would reopen his hidden injuries, but at this moment it seemed as if those hidden injuries had disappeared.\u201cGrand Elder, you still need to receive two more massages after this to fully treat the hidden injuries on your body. Now, how do you feel, Grand Elder? How much do you think you should give me as payment?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled faintly.Li Huo laughed loudly, readily taking out a bunch of silver bills.\u201cTake one thousand silver for now. Later on, each time you give me a massage, I\u2019ll give you a thousand more like this time\u2026.What say you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This difference is really too much.\u201d>Li Rou sighed in her heart.When they saw Duan Ling Tian receive one thousand silver, the Li family higher ups were all dumbstruck.Especially Li Kun, who was waiting to ridicule Duan Ling Tian. The cold smile on the corner of his mouth had stiffened\u2026.The scene in front of him felt like a dream.\u201cDuan Ling Tian only gave the Grand Elder a massage for a while and he received one thousand silver?\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, I can massage you too; my wife even praises me for my skills in giving massages. Why don\u2019t I give you a massage for two hours and then you can give me a thousand silver too.\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping\u2019s eyes were shining brightly; it was as if he had found a new road to riches. He was staring intently at Grand Elder Li Huo.Li Huo made a light humph sound, completely ignoring Li Ping.Then he looked towards Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKid, where did you learn such a miraculous massaging technique? I feel as if the hidden injuries that I have accumulated over the years have started to be suppressed. With another two more massage sessions later on, the pain will certainly be fully removed.\u201dLi Huo asked curiously.\u201cGrand Elder, I stumbled upon the technique in a medical book.\u201dDuan Ling Tian faintly smiled.Li Huo glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.He naturally would not believe Duan Ling Tian\u2019s lies, but he did not continue asking.It was obvious from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s attitude that he wasn\u2019t willing to say.\u201cHidden injuries?\u201dThe Li family higher ups were flabbergasted.They remembered that before Duan Ling Tian gave Grand Elder the massage, he mentioned hidden injuries.They were curious as to how did Duan Ling Tian found out that Grand Elder had hidden injuries.More importantly, he was capable of a massage technique that could cure the Grand Elder\u2019s hidden injuries.Li Rou glanced at her son. The doubt in her eyes had grown deeper.The young girl beside Li Rou, however, looked at Duan Ling Tian in adoration. She was not the least bit shocked at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ability.In her heart, young master was omnipotent.\u201cSeventh Elder, can I bet with you now?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Li Kun.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you want to gift money to me, I will naturally not decline.\u201dLi Kun\u2019s eyes narrowed and he made a low humph sound.\u201cGood.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, then he passed half of the silver bills in his hand to the Patriarch Li Nan Feng.\u201cPatriarch, this is the wager between Seventh Elder and I. Please safe keep it and bear witness for us.\u201dLi Nan Feng received the five hundred silver with a complicated expression and nodded.\u201cPatriarch, here is the wager for the bet between Sixth Elder and I.\u201dAt this moment, Fifth Elder Li Ting took out five hundred silver and passed it to Li Nan Feng.\u201cPatriarch, here is the wager for Sixth Elder and I.\u201dLi Kun took out one thousand silver.\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201dAfter Li Nan Feng received the silver bills, he put them away and then looked towards Duan Ling TianAfter giving the remaining five hundred silver to his mother, Duan Ling Tian nodded his head and walked into the Martial Arts Practice Hall to confront the waiting Li Jie.The Li family disciples surrounding the Martial Arts Practice Hall were looking at them intently.It was finally going to begin!\u201cDuan Ling Tian, it took you a long time to get here. You aren\u2019t afraid, are you?\u201dLi Jie laughed coldly.\u201cAfraid? You think too highly of yourself. Li Jie, you better give today\u2019s match your all\u2026.If you lose, your family is going to go bankrupt!\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled faintly.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dLi Jie\u2019s face fell. He wasn\u2019t aware of the betting that had taken place on the platform.\u201cYou will find out after today.\u201dThe smile on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face became even more prominent, but in Li Jie\u2019s eyes it looked extremely unpleasant.Li Jie\u2019s face turned grim and the muscles in his body started bulging, causing his clothes to stretch.In an instant, Li Jie stomped his feet on the ground and ran swiftly towards Duan Ling Tian.His speed was extremely fast, like that of a cheetah running at full speed\u2026.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I will make you pay tenfold for crippling the arm of my little brother!\u201dLi Jie swiftly rushed in front of Duan Ling Tian, shouting loudly.His hands opened up, forming two palms, and he executed the Master Stage middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill, Falling Leaf Palm. His hands came violently slapping towards Duan Ling Tian.Falling Leaf Palm!\u201cSeventh Elder, Li Jie is able to achieve mastery of the Falling Leaf Palm at only the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage. His innate talent is really good!\u201d\u201cI cultivated Falling Leaf Palm when I was young as well and only achieved mastery when I was at the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage. In this aspect, I am inferior to Li Jie. Seventh Elder has such good fortune.\u201d\u201cYes, Seventh Elder has such a good son; it really makes me admire him.\u201d\u2026\u2026On the platform, as he heard the praise of the other elders, Li Kun smiled faintly. He was slightly smug.\u201cEh, what martial skill is Duan Ling Tian executing?\u201dPatriarch Li Nan Feng\u2019s voice suddenly sounded.Everyone\u2019s gaze instantly focused on Duan Ling Tian.They saw that Duan Ling Tian had taken the horse stance and his body was slightly inclined forward. His body resembled a strong, heavy bow; it seemed like he was immovable like a mountain.Just at this very moment, when Li Jie\u2019s Falling Leaf Palm was descending towards him with a roaring sound, he finally moved\u2026.Silent as a virgin, moving like a mad rabbit!This sentence perfectly described the current Duan Ling Tian.When facing Li Jie\u2019s Falling Leaf Palm, Duan Ling Tian was not one bit scared; he moved to meet the attack head on.Hi lifted up his right fist and swung it as if here were launching a cannonball towards Li Jie\u2019s palm strike.Clap!After the palm and fist struck each other, Li Jie\u2019s body slightly trembled, but he stood his ground.Duan Ling Tian on the other hand was forced a few steps back, his face slightly red.\u201cTian!\u201dSeeing Duan Ling Tian being forced backwards, Li Rou had an expression of worry.The young girl behind her nervously clenched her fists as well.Whereas Li Kun had a complacent expression.In his opinion, a fourth level Body Tempering martial artist going against a third level Body Tempering martial artist was a one-sided battle without any suspense.\u201cFifth Elder, thank you for your five hundred silver.\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping complacently said to Li Ting.It was as if Fifth Elder\u2019s five hundred silver had already entered his pocket.\u201cAs expected of a fourth level Body Tempering martial artist; my strength is still lower if I fight him head on.\u201dIn the arena, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart jerked.\u201cMaybe\u2026.\u201dGlancing at the ring on his hand, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up into a smile. This was his secret weapon.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I really didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d be able to break through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage. But even so, it is impossible for you to be my opponent. Today I will take revenge for my little brother and completely cripple you\u2026.I will make you have to stay on a bed for the rest of your life! You will live your life in unending pain and despair until you die!\u201dLi Jie said in a condescending manner.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim and cold light flashed in his eyes. He didn\u2019t know that Li Jie was so merciless and cruel.The other time when Li Xin provoked him, he showed mercy by only crippling one of his arms.Or else Li Xin would\u2019ve ended up the same as Fang Jian\u2019s lackey.Today, although Li Jie\u2019s strength was greater than his, he was absolutely confident that he could win if he relied on the inscription on his ring.Originally, as they both were Li family disciples, he was only planning to cripple one of his arms as punishment\u2026.But now that punishment seemed too lenient.\u201cMake me lie on a bed and live the rest of my life in pain and despair? Li Jie, you must remember what you just said. Please don\u2019t regret it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian stared at Li Jie and abruptly laughed.\u201cRegret? I, Li Jie, have never known regret!\u201dLi Jie laughed coldly and stomped his legs with a disdainful expression on his face He seemed as if he had transformed into a fierce tiger as he dove towards Duan Ling Tian.The Master Stage Falling Leaf Palm slapped down towards Duan Ling Tian once again.Duan Ling Tian moved forward a step, then his upper body inclined backwards and once again bent into the shape of a bow.His right shoulder pressed backwards, causing his body to tremble, then his right fist swung out straight forward. Strength seeped out from his entire body as he moved to intercept Li Jie\u2019s Falling Leaf Palm\u2026.Cannon Fist!One of the Five Elemental Fists of Form and Will Boxing. Like a cannon but not a cannon; once this punch is used, it has the force to topple mountains and overturn seas.\u201cClap!\u201dThe fist and palm struck each other again!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart slightly jerked. The power inside the inscription on his ring burst forth, entering Li Jie\u2019s body\u2026.Instantly, Li Jie looked like he had just been struck by lightning; his body was trembling, his face was extremely distorted, and his eyes emitted an expression of extreme fear.It was as if he had been met with some horrible thing.Bang!When Li jie\u2019s body started trembling, the force behind Falling Leaf Palm dispersed, then Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Cannon Fist struck out.Ka!Li Jie\u2019s arm bone broke from the force!The sharp sound of the bone breaking accompanied by Li Jie\u2019s shrill scream entered the ears of everyone present.Everyone felt a chill run down their spine.Just when everyone was wondering how Li Jie, who had the upper hand, was now being trampled on by Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian moved forward, catching up to Li Jie, who was falling backwards. He kicked Li Jie, causing him to fly upwards for more than three meters.In the next moment, Duan Ling Tian, who was still standing on the same spot, bent his legs and abruptly squatted!Li Jie, who had been kicked up into the sky, had a ghastly pale face and was dripping in cold sweat.When his body started to fall downwards, he turned his head and noticed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s actions. He instantly understood what Duan Ling Tian was planning to do.\u201cDad, save me!!\u201dLi Jie felt a bone-piercing chill in his heart, so he shouted in fear.Because he was unable to move freely in the air, he had no means to use his fourth level Body Tempering stage strength.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s legs straightened in the blink of an eye and then, like a cannon ball blasted up into the sky, he flew towards the rapidly falling Li Jie\u2026.\u201cNo!!\u201dHearing his son\u2019s scream of despair, Li Kun finally reacted. Shouting loudly, he left his seat and flew down towards the arena.He wanted to save his son.Li Rou was worried that her son would be treated unfairly, so she followed after him and flew down towards the arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His head swung backwards and his shrill scream stopped abruptly, then he blacked out.\u201cBang!\u201dDuan Ling Tian made use of the counterforce and firmly dropped to the ground.He raised his right arm just in time to catch Li Jie\u2019s falling body.He looked like an undefeatable war god.Heaving a sigh of relief, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up slightly, turning into a warm smile.He had finally won, and it was all thanks to the Paralyzation Inscription on his ring.Paralyzation Inscription was the inscription that Duan Ling Tian prepared a month ago. Once released, it will cause the target to experience a split second of paralyzation, causing all the accumulated energy in the body to dissipate.That was the reason why Li Jie had lost to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201dAll around the Martial Arts Practice Hall, every one of the Li family disciples were struck dumb. They all took a large amount of time to regain their senses.They found the events that had unfolded before their eyes extremely hard to believe!Noticing Seventh Elder flying over in rage, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth flashed with a cold smile.Exerting force with his hand, he threw Li Jie towards Li Kun.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dLi Kun caught Li Jie. When he looked at Duan Ling Tian, his eyes were filled with killing intent.Only when Li Rou arrived and stood beside Duan Ling Tian did he withdraw his gaze due to a slight sense of fear.\u201cTian, are you alright?\u201dLi Rou took out her handkerchief and wiped the sweat off Duan Ling Tian\u2019s forehead. Her face flashed with slight worry.\u201cMom, I\u2019m fine.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart felt warm. He lightly smiled while he shook head.He was fine, but someone else wasn\u2019t\u2026.\u201cGrand Elder!\u201dLi Kun suddenly shouted with a voice full of grief. Holding Li Jie in his arms, he turned around and rushed toward the platform to meet the Li Family higher ups that were currently descending.Among these higher ups, Sixth Elder Li Ping\u2019s face was the ugliest while Fifth Elder on the hand had an expression of self-satisfaction.Grand Elder Li Huo checked Li Jie\u2019s injuries and his face slowly turned grim.\u201cKid, Li Jie\u2019s backbone is almost completely shattered. Even a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill won\u2019t save him. Don\u2019t you think you were a tad bit too merciless? You have basically destroyed Li Jie\u2019s life.\u201dLi Huo said heavily as he raised his head to look at the approaching Li Rou and her son. His gaze was fixed upon Duan Ling Tian.Li Jie was the youth that the Li family had the highest hopes for amongst the Li family disciples.But now he had come to a premature end. This was a great loss to the Li family.\u201cWhat?!\u201dAfter hearing what Grand Elder Li Huo had said, Li Kun\u2019s face severely distorted and his body started shaking as if he had been struck by lightning.He didn\u2019t expect his son to be injured so severely by Duan Ling Tian\u2026.Backbone almost completely shattered?Even a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill was unable to save him?\u201cI want you dead!\u201dLi Kun bellowed, then his figure flashed as he madly flew towards Duan Ling Tian and attacked with rage!At the top of his head, four ancient mammoth silhouettes developed.Li Rou, who was on guard against Li Kun, instantly had six ancient mammoth silhouettes develop above her head, forcing Li Kun back in a single exchange.\u201cLi Kun, if you try to attack my son again, I will kill you!\u201dHer voice was cold and indifferent; it was as if it were coming from the pits of hell.\u201cLi Rou!\u201dLi Kun\u2019s face was green, but even though he was extremely furious, he did not doubt what Li Rou had said.\u201cGrand Elder, you must uphold justice for my son!\u201dLi Kun said to Grand Elder Li Huo in a miserable voice. There was a \u2018pu tong\u201d sound as he knelt on the ground heavily.When his youngest son\u2019s arm was crippled, his future looked worrisome.In Li Kun\u2019s heart, he had long ago put all his hopes onto his eldest son, Li Jie.But now, Li Jie\u2019s entire backbone was almost shattered and there was no hope of recovery. His whole life would be spent lying on a bed.In this instant, Li Kun felt his eyes go black. The world seemed dark without any light; it was as if the world was falling down upon him!\u201cLI Kun, the family rules state than when the disciples of the family have a battle, besides not being allowed to take one\u2019s life, there are no other limitations so that the disciples may go all out and fight to the best of their abilities. When martial artists battle, injury is unavoidable. Today it\u2019s your son that is lying down there, but what if it was my son? Would you ask Grand Elder to hold your son accountable?\u201dLi Rou made a cold humph sound, grunting out of anger.\u201cNinth Elder, you\u2019re arguing irrationally. Your son Duan Ling Tian has already broken one of Li Jie\u2019s arms, and he was bound to win. But instead of showing mercy, he continued attacking and crippled Li Jie\u2026.In my opinion, he did it on purpose, and this is against the spirit of unity and friendship between Li family disciples!\u201dSixth elder Li Ping\u2019s eyes shone with a cold light.\u201cSixth Elder, what you\u2019re saying is wrong. After Duan Ling Tian broke Li Jie\u2019s arm, he could have admitted defeat. But instead, he didn\u2019t admit defeat because he most probably thought that he still had a chance at victory; he thought that he still had a chance to defeat Duan Ling Tian\u2026.Furthermore, you should not forget that Duan Ling Tian is only at the third level of the Body Tempering stage. Even if he was going up against a one-armed fourth level Body Tempering stage opponent, it was still a dangerous affair, and as such he needed to continue attacking to prevent Li Jie from obtaining an opportunity to counterattack, because that would cause him to lose more than he would gain.\u201dFifth Elder Li Ting said indifferently. Faced with an argument backed by facts, Li Ping\u2019s face turned grim as he did not have a way to counter this argument.\u201cEnough. Stop arguing. In the afternoon, there will be a family emergency meeting to discuss the matter. What\u2019s important now is to take Li Jie back to rest\u2026.Seventh Elder, take Li Jie back home.\u201dPatriarch Lin Nan Feng frowned.\u201cYes, Patriarch!\u201dLi Kun slowly stood up and held Li jie in his arms. His face had a grim expression.His eyes were radiating a shocking killing intent as he fiercely glanced at Duan Ling Tian before leaving.Duan Ling Tian smiled indifferently. He made nothing of Li Kun\u2019s glance.Regarding what happened today, there was no guilt in his heart.Not mentioning his previous life of walking through the battlefield as a mercenary, which made him accustomed to being cruel and cold blooded.But just those merciless remarks that Li Jie had made towards him, if it was his previous life, Li Jie would\u2019ve been dead by now. In his opinion, he had already shown mercy.The Li family higher ups left the Martial Arts Practice Hall one after another.But when these people left, their gazes towards Duan Ling Tian were hostile.After all, in their opinion, Duan Ling Tian was not part of the main Li family as his surname was not Li.On the other hand, Li Jie was the Li family\u2019s genius martial artist, a future pillar of support for the Li family.Regarding this incident, they were more or less biased against Duan Ling Tian.The Li family disciples who surrounded the Martial Arts Practice Hall also dispersed.What happened today caused them to feel shocked and speechless at the same time.Li Jie, their Li family\u2019s martial arts genius, the strongest fourth level Body Tempering stage martial artist in the Li family, actually lost to a third level Body Tempering stage disciple with another surname.Ashamed, they were truly ashamed!\u201cI used to think that Li Jie was formidable, but I never expected him to be so weak!\u201cDuan Ling Tian is only at the third level of the Body Tempering stage and he could defeat Li Jie. Once he steps into level nine Body Tempering stage, will anyone under the Core Formation stage be a match for him?\u201d\u201cI really wonder what fortuitous gain Duan Ling Tian had to be able to complete such a metamorphosis in a single month and amaze the world with a single brilliant feat!\u201d\u2026\u2026The topic of conversation between the Li family disciples quickly moved towards Duan Ling Tian.The previously unknown Duan Ling Tian became the hot topic within the Li family for a time.As the Li family disciples left one by one, there were only four people left in the enormous Martial Arts Practice Hall.Duan Ling Tian, Li Rou, Ke Er, and Fifth Elder Li Ting.\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian noticed that his mother had an ugly expression.\u201cKid, you really are young and arrogant. You crippled Li Jie. Of course it was satisfying for you, but you didn\u2019t think of the consequences\u2026.Li Jie is the family\u2019s youth genius, and as such the family has placed enormous hope in him. In the afternoon, the family meeting is said to be a discussion about today\u2019s incident, but it will actually be a discussion on to how to punish you. Tell me, why wouldn\u2019t your mom be worried?\u201dLi Ting shook his head and sighed.In his opinion, Duan Ling Tian was like a newborn calf that was not afraid of the tiger; he was too fearless and dared to do anything.\u201cGrand Elder still needs my help. With his status in the Li Family, as long as he speaks for me, everyone else has to give him some face, right?\u201dSaid Duan Ling Tian unconcerned.\u201cIf you think like this, then you\u2019re wrong. Grand Elder has always differentiated between public and private matters. This is the reason why all the members of the Li family respect him so much. The identity of a Grade Nine Alchemist is not enough to cause everyone to respect him so wholeheartedly.\u201dLi Ting shook his head.Duan Ling Tian slightly frowned. He didn\u2019t expect that his secret weapon would become useless so easily.When they returned home, although Li Rou\u2019s expression seemed better, there were still signs of worry.The young girl was quiet, not daring to talk as she feared it would agitate Li Rou.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I have a method to solve this problem. Nothing will happen to me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian, who was pondering throughout the journey back home, finally laughed.\u201cWhat method do you have?\u201dLi Rou obviously did not believe him.\u201cMom, what you\u2019re worried about is that the Li family elders will be biased towards Li Jie and punish me, right? You can be at ease; I have a method to make them biased towards me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s smile was mysterious and full of confidence.\u201cWhat method?\u201dAsked Li Rou curiously.The young girl on the side glanced over with a face full of anticipation.\u201cLet me go get some things ready. I will tell you two when we have lunch at noon.\u201dDuan Ling Tian returned to his room as soon as he finished speaking.After he left, the two women looked at each other with helpless expressions.\u201cKe Er, do you know what method Tian is talking about?\u201dLi Rou asked the young girl.\u201cKe Er doesn\u2019t know either.\u201dThe young girl shook her head lightly.\u201cThat stinking brat, he\u2019s getting more and more mysterious lately.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s eyes slightly squinted, then she laughed helplessly.After eating lunch, Duan Ling Tian took a hundred silver in bills and thirty silver coins from his mother before taking the young girl out alone, leaving the Li family estate.The Li family disciples that saw this scene were all speechless.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he know what his circumstances are? He\u2019s still in the mood to leisurely go shopping?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t preparing to run away because he\u2019s worried that the family will punish him after the family meeting, right?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding? He\u2019s the son of the Ninth Elder; just like how a monk may run but the temple can\u2019t, even if he wants to run, he has nowhere to go\u2026.\u201d\u201cHe really is something! After the family meeting today, if nothing happens to him, I will certainly make him my idol and ask him to be my boss!\u201d\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think it\u2019s better if young master chooses for me.\u201dThe young girl lightly shook her head.Duan Ling Tian nodded.Under the multitude of gazes full of either admiration or jealousy in the Li family marketplace, Duan Ling Tian walked into the Li family weapon store while holding the young girl\u2019s tender and lovely small hand.\u201cYoung master Tian!\u201dAs soon as they entered the Li family weapon store, a youth walked up and greeted them with a courteous tone.\u201cYou recognize me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly surprised.\u201cYoung master Tian, I\u2019m a Li family branch family member. I took half a day\u2019s leave today so I could see the battle between you and Li jie. Young master Tian was so formidable that even Li Jie was no match for you.\u201dThe youth faintly smiled.\u201cI was just lucky.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled.\u201cI want to buy a good sword. Do you have any recommendations?\u201dDuan Ling Tian stated his purpose.\u201cYoung master Tian, is it for you own use?\u201dThe youth asked with a smile.\u201cNo, it\u2019s for my Ke Er.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.Hearing Duan Ling Tian saying that she was his, the young girl\u2019s willow leaf eyebrows raised, her clear eyes blinked, and her pretty face turned rose red; she was glittering and translucent and looked like she could easily be broken with a flick of the finger.\u201cYoung master Tian, this way please.\u201dThe youth only glanced at the young girl before withdrawing his gaze. He was afraid that it would piss off the youth beside her if he looked any longer.Subsequently, he brought the couple to the weapon rack at the side.Various types of swords were laid on the weapon rack.Duan Ling Tian, who had merged with Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, only glanced at the swords once before being able to differentiate the quality of the swords.Finally, his gaze descended upon a sword made of a violet-colored material.This was a small and exquisite short sword, and the reason he took a fancy to the sword was not for its gorgeous exterior but rather the material it was made of\u2026.Violet Meteoric Iron!Once Violet Meteoric Iron is refined by a weapons craftsman, it is able to become a rare crafting material known as Violet Meteorite.Just fifty grams of Violet Meteorite was worth a lot of money, and this short sword could easily be refined into 350 to 400 grams of Violet Meteorite.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heartbeat slightly elevated.\u201cYoung master Tian, this sword is made of Violet Ore, which is extremely durable, only slightly inferior to a Fine Steel Sword.The youth introduced.Only slightly inferior to a Fine Steel Sword?Duan Ling Tian laughed secretly. Never would he have thought that Violet Meteoric Iron would be mistaken for Violet Ore in the Li family weapon store.The exterior appearance of Violet Meteoric Iron was indeed similar to Violet Ore, but the worth of the two were as different as heaven and earth.Furthermore, if Origin Energy is circulated through the Violet Meteoric Iron short sword, it would not suffer any damage whatsoever even if it cleaved hundreds of Fine Steel Swords in half.It was truly a hidden gem!Violet Meteorite that is refined from Violet Meteoric Iron is indeed something that a knowledgeable weapons craftsman would know about and could identify.But Violet Meteoric Iron on the other hand would be hard to identify even for graded weapons craftsman, let alone the blacksmiths of the Li family weapon store.\u201cHow much is this sword?\u201dDuan Ling Tian suppressed the agitation in his heart, and calmly said.\u201cTwo hundred silver.\u201dThe youth said, while adding:\u201cYoung master Tian, since you\u2019re not an outsider, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. Besides its outer appearance, this sword is utterly inferior to a Fine Steel Sword. The Fine Steel Sword is an exactly three-foot-long blade which can slice iron like clay, and it\u2019s even double the length of this sword but only one hundred and eighty silver.\u201cKe Er, do you like it?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked the young girl beside him instead.\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s too expensive.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s gaze had long been attracted by the exquisite appearance of the violet short sword, but she was shocked when she heard its price.Duan Ling Tian secretly laughed in his heart. If this little girl knew how much the Violet Meteorite that could be refined from this Violet Meteoric Iron sword was worth, he wondered what she would think then.\u201cI\u2019ll take this short sword, but I only brought a hundred silver out with me\u2026.Why don\u2019t you bring the Fine Steel Sword and come find me when you get back to the Li family estate. At that time I\u2019ll pay you the remaining two hundred and eighty silver. What do you think?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards the youth.\u201cNo problem.\u201dThe youth hurriedly nodded.Duan Ling Tian was the son of the Li family\u2019s Ninth Elder, so the youth wasn\u2019t afraid that Duan Ling Tian would go back on his word.\u201cKe Er, this is your first sword, so you must take extremely good care of it\u2026. As a sword cultivator, the most important thing is to love your sword like your life. As for false sayings such as 'when the sword is present the sword cultivator is alive,' you should ignore such things.\u201dAfter receiving the violet short sword from the youth, Duan Ling Tian casually passed it over to the young girl.\u201cOK, young master.\u201dThe young girl received the short sword from Duan Ling Tian and fondly admired it.Her beautiful face was filled with happiness.After leaving the Li family weapon store, Duan Ling Tian took the young girl around the marketplace.He bought some small accessories for the young girl before finally returning to the Li family estate.When they arrived at the Li family estate entrance, Duan Ling Tian stopped for a moment and glanced at a corner behind him.In the distance was a sly figure that fled the moment Duan Ling Tian glanced his way.\u201cYoung master, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe young girl asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s go in.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.He had noticed that person a long time ago. That person had been following him from around the Fang family marketplace until here.While holding the young girl\u2019s hands and walking into the Li family estate, Duan Ling Tian had a faint smile on his face.At this moment, his mother should be attending the family meeting\u2026.In a spacious hall in the Li family estate.From the Patriarch Li Nan Feng to the Grand Elder Li Huo, all of the Li family elders were gathered here.Even Seventh Elder, whose son had recently been crippled, was present.Li Kun\u2019s fierce gaze moved away from a certain beautiful young woman. She was the Ninth Elder, Li Rou.\u201cFellow Elders, the reason I gathered everyone for this emergency meeting today is to discuss the matter of Li Jie being crippled by Duan Ling Tian. Regarding this matter, do any of you have any opinions you would like to share?\u201dPatriarch Li Nan Feng directly asked.All of the elders\u2019 gazes instantly landed upon Grand Elder Li Huo.If the Grand Elder didn\u2019t say anything, they would not dare exceed their authority.\u201cIn my opinion, we should punish that kid Duan Ling Tian. Being so merciless at such a young age; if he is not guided, who knows what calamity he might cause.\u201dLi Huo said.\u201cGrand Elder is indeed fair and just!\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping hurriedly flattered Grand Elder, not forgetting to complacently glance at Fifth Elder Li Ting.\u201cToday, Duan Ling Tian did not show mercy after breaking Li Jie\u2019s arm but instead went even further and completely shattered Li Jie\u2019s spine, causing him to become completely crippled\u2026.Li Jie is the genius martial artist that our whole Li family has put emphasis on to develop. By crippling him Duan Ling Tian has caused a serious loss to the Li family. I feel we should heavily punish him!\u201dLi Ping added.\u201cSixth Elder, I have already said this earlier, but Duan Ling Tian is only at level three Body Tempering stage whereas Li jie is at level four Body Tempering stage. The fact that Li Jie didn\u2019t admit defeat even after having one of his arms broken posed a huge threat towards Duan Ling Tian. As such, I feel what Duan Ling Tian did was not wrong and does not go against the family\u2019s rules!\u201dFifth Elder Li Ting said in a low voice, arguing in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s favor.\u201cFifth Elder, according to you, doesn\u2019t that mean that during battles between disciples, as long as they do not kill each other, they should be allowed to trample on and even cripple their opponents?\u201dSeventh Elder Li Kun said with a grievous expression.When a martial artist has his backbone shattered, it means that he will forever be a cripple without a future.Just when everyone expected Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mother to say something, her face was tranquil; it was as if she was an outsider.Li Ting\u2019s eyebrows slightly creased. He thought that the Ninth Elder had given up on arguing on behalf of her son.\u201cFellow elders, do you all have anything else to add?\u201dLin Nan Feng asked the elders.\u201cI feel Seventh Elder is right. Duan Ling Tian is too merciless and cruel, and he even destroyed a future pillar of the family. He should be punished!\u201dSome elders showed support towards Seventh Elder\u2019s argument.They did not have any relationship with Li Rou or Li Kun and were speaking from a neutral position.Of course, it would be impossible to say they did not have any selfish motives.In their opinion, even if Duan Ling Tian has even greater natural talent, even if his talent is better than Li Jie\u2019s, he was still only a disciple with another surname; he was not a true Li family member.\u201cVery good. Now let us vote\u2026.\u201dAs Patriarch Li Nan Feng said this, the Fifth Elder sighed and shook his head.The current circumstances were not in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s favor.\u201cPatriarch!\u201dNo one expected that just at this moment, the previously silent Li Rou would interrupt Li Nan Feng.Everyone\u2019s gaze instantly fell upon her.\u201cNinth Elder, you have something to say?\u201dLi Nan Feng frowned with a slight displeased expression.\u201cI\u2019m sure that Patriarch and all the fellow elders here have noticed the that changes my son experienced this past month\u2026.there are even many elders who think that my son received some sort of fortuitous gain, and the truth is exactly so.\u201dLi Rou said indifferently.Hearing what Li Rou said, even Sixth Elder Li Ping and Seventh Elder Li Kun quieted down.They were curious as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After that, the alchemist passed a medicinal formula to him. Following that medicinal formula, my son was able to concoct a medicinal liquid called Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. This medicinal liquid is able to increase the speed at which a Body Tempering stage martial artist cultivates!\u201dIncrease the speed of a Body Tempering stage martial artist\u2019s cultivation?What Li Rou said was like a bolt of thunder; it caused all of the elders with the exception of the Seventh Elder to be immensely shocked.\u201cLi Rou, stop uttering nonsense! I bet you\u2019re just making all this up. Alchemist? Medicinal liquid? Those are all just things you made up so that you can help your son get out of trouble!\u201dSeventh Elder said in a stern voice. He was so agitated that he stood up and looked fiercely at Li Rou.\u201cGrand Elder, you\u2019re a Grade Nine Alchemist; this is the medicinal formula my son wrote. Although the portions of the medicinal materials required is not stated, it should be enough for you to discern its authenticity. You will understand once you take a look.\u201dLi Rou ignored Li Kun and passed a piece of paper with the medicinal formula to the Grand Elder. She was going to use evidence to explain everything.Li Huo unfolded the medicinal formula and started reading it.\u201cIngenious! Truly ingenious! Never had I thought that combining these six medicinal materials together, concocted with the correct ratios, would actually be able to increase the speed at which a Body Tempering stage martial artist cultivates.\u201cMoreover, the medicinal properties of these medicinal materials are easily absorbed. No wonder\u2026.No wonder that kid experienced such a massive change in a mere month\u2019s time. Most importantly, all of these medicinal materials are extremely ordinary, so any elder would be able to provide their children prolonged usage.\u201dAfter Li Huo finished reading, his murky eyes shone brightly, exclaiming in admiration.The Li family higher ups that were present could easily disregard what Li Rou had said.But Grand Elder Li Huo, who was the only Grade Nine Alchemist amongst the Li family members, was someone that no one would doubt.For a moment, everyone felt excited.This medicinal liquid would be able to change the fate of their children; it would be able to change the fate of the Li family!\u201cPatriarch!\u201dLi Huo looked towards Li Nan Feng with a serious expression.Li Nan Feng nodded heavily.He knew that this was a chance for the Li family.\u201cNinth Elder, what you meant earlier was that Duan Ling Tian can concoct this type of medicinal liquid?\u201dLi Nan Feng looked towards Li Rou.\u201cYes.\u201dLi Rou nodded.For a moment, the entire hall was filled with the sound of heavy breathing.Every elder of the Li family that was present had a few children.They were already imagining how fast their children would be able to cultivate if they used the medicinal liquid that Duan Ling Tian concocted. The changes that occurred on Duan Ling Tian was the best example.Watching their children become dragons and phoenixes was something that every parent hoped for.\u201cNinth Elder, since your son has obtained such a valuable medicinal formula, he should contribute it to the family\u2026.Fellow elders, what do you think?\u201dSeventh Elder said with a grim expression because felt that the mood in the room was changing.\u201cYes, what Seventh Elder said is correct. Such a valuable medicinal formula should indeed be shared with the family.\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping said.\u201cHahahaha!\u201dJust when Li Rou\u2019s face had turned grim and she was about to rebuke, the sound of a wild and arrogant laughter came from outside the hall.\u201cPatriarch, Duan Ling Tian requests an audience!\u201dThe sound of laughter abruptly stopped.Duan Ling Tian!The eyes of all the Li family elders in the room shone brightly.If Duan Ling Tian was just an outsider to them in the past, then now\u2026.Now Duan Ling Tian was the hope for their children to achieve greatness.\u201cEnter.\u201dLi Nan Feng replied.\u201cSixth Elder, what did you say earlier? If I didn\u2019t hear wrongly, you requested that I share the medicinal formula?\u201dDuan Ling Tian said indifferently as he walked in. Then he directly went to face Sixth Elder Li Ping.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Duan Ling Tian, I know that you don\u2019t have the Li family surname, but even so, you have been eating and wearing things of the Li family for all these years. Isn\u2019t it time for you to repay the Li family?\u201dSaid Li Ping as if he was speaking of something reasonable and justified.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know that what I have been eating and wearing was of the Li family? I thought that what I ate and wore were what my mother earned from working for the Li family. What does it have to do with the Li family? Even outside of the Li family, my mother can easily seek refuge from the Fang family or the Chen family. Do you think she can\u2019t get this small salary from somewhere else?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, how dare you betray the Li family!\u201dLi Kun immediately tried to place the crime of betraying the family onto Duan Ling Tian.\u201cBetraying the family? Li Kun, I know you hate me because I crippled your sons, but so what? What I did didn\u2019t go against any of the family rules. Now, are you trying to slander me with false accusations of betraying the family so you can punish me and take revenge for you son?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed disdainfully, openly offending Li Kun.\u201cEven you yourself said that you were going to go to the Fang family or Chen family. Is that not betrayal?\u201dLi Kun got angry from embarrassment.\u201cIdiot! I\u2019m sure all the elders present understood that what I said was only an example. Do you understand what a figure of speech is? Didn\u2019t you parents teach you what that means? What I said just now was just to tell Sixth Elder that I don\u2019t owe the Li family anything, and the only reason I\u2019m standing here before everyone is because the Li family is my mother\u2019s family!\u201dDuan Ling Tian spat towards Li Kun, then he looked towards Li Ping.\u201cSixth Elder, if you want me to concoct the medicinal liquid for your children, I hope that you think before you speak in the future so you can avoid hurting the relationship between everyone. Don\u2019t you think that what I\u2019m saying makes sense?\u201dA threat!An undisguised threat!Li Ping\u2019s expression turned gloomy, but he obediently shut his mouth.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s threat had hit his soft spot.\u201cNot considering what I just said, even if I wanted to contribute the medicinal formula to the family, I wouldn\u2019t dare to. My teacher told me that if anyone dared to try and obtain the medicinal formula from me by force, then that person would undoubtedly die!\u201dDuan Ling Tian said with a serious tone as his gaze shifted to circle the room.The Li family higher ups inhaled a deep breath of cold air after they heard what Duan Ling Tian said.Only now did they remember that Ninth Elder Li Rou mentioned earlier that her son was taken as a disciple by an alchemist and that he obtained the medicinal formula from his teacher.But they were all so preoccupied with the medicinal formula that they had forgotten about the alchemist.\u201cKid, what is the grade of your teacher?\u201dGrand Elder Li Huo inquired.\u201cI have no idea what grade alchemist he is, but I once saw him refining a medicinal pill, and the Pill Fire he produced with his Origin Energy was gold in color\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian creased his eyebrows as if he was trying to remember something.\u201cWhat\u201dLi Huo\u2019s pupils shrank, then he instantly stood up and exclaimed, \u201cGrade seven Alchemist!\u201dGrade seven Alchemist?The Li family higher ups were struck dumb. The Patriarch Li Nan Feng asked, \u201cGrand Elder, are you sure?\u201dLi Huo grunted, \u201cAny graded alchemist knows that an alchemist that can produce a gold-colored Pill Fire is certainly a grade seven Alchemist\u2026.Moreover, a grade seven Alchemist is at least at the seventh level of the Origin Core stage!\u201dAn Origin Core stage powerhouse!The hearts of the Li family higher ups trembled violently.Origin Core stage martial artists were individuals that were above the Core Formation stage. The strongest in the Li family, the Grand Elder, was only at the sixth level of the Core Formation stage. At this moment, no one doubted what Duan Ling Tian said. Even those who had already lived half their lives did not know that a grade seven Alchemist\u2019s Pill Fire was gold-colored until today.\u201cThis little animal is such a lucky bastard!\u201dSeventh Elder Li Kun\u2019s face was getting uglier by the moment.\u201cPatriarch and all the elders, I still have things to do, so I will return now. Yeah, the elders present, if you require my assistance in concocting the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, you can purchase the needed medicinal materials and seek me\u2026. Oh yes, I nearly forgot, Patriarch, I think you still owe me a thousand silver, right?\u201dAfter taking the thousand silver from the Patriarch, Duan Ling Tian swaggered away.The Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was the product of removing a medicinal material from the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid formula, causing its effect to be halved.Duan Ling Tian was not generous enough to actually share his most valuable possession with everyone.\u201cPatriarch, Grand Elder, my son should be awake by now, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201dSeventh Elder Li Kun took in a deep breath and left with a complicated expression.He was aware that from today onwards, everyone, including Sixth Elder, who was on good terms with him would need to seek the help of Duan Ling Tian for the sake of their children. And thus it would be impossible for him to put his hopes on Sixth Elder being able to assist him in causing trouble for Duan Ling TIan and getting his revenge.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving as well.\u201dLi Rou hurriedly followed. She was afraid that Li Kun might lose all reason and attack her son.In the Li family hall, the remaining elders did not leave.Under the leadership of the Patriarch, a second family meeting was started.This second family meeting mainly revolved around the medicinal formula that Duan Ling Tian had control over.Finally, for the sake of secrecy, they unanimously decided to only allow the children of the elders that were present to use the medicinal liquid.\u201cPatriarch!\u201dFifth Elder Li Ting looked towards Li Nan Feng with a serious expression.\u201cToday, because we didn\u2019t sentence Duan Ling Tian to any punishment, Seventh Elder will surely have resentment in his heart. If he spreads the news of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, even if the Chen family and the Fang family are afraid of the Grade Seven Alchemist behind Duan Ling Tian, they will still come pressure our Li family to get a share.\u201d\u201cFifth Elder is right. I know Seventh Elder very well; even if Duan Ling Tian has a Grade Seven Alchemist providing him protection, he will still not let it go easily.\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping fearfully said.When he finished, he noticed Li Ting looking at him with a strange face, causing him to smile embarrassedly.\u201cThis matter concerns the future of my son.\u201dAlthough his relationship with Seventh Elder was indeed good, this matter concerned the future of his son, and so he made a choice.All the Li family higher ups quickly made an important and secret decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A drooping leaf on a tree in the courtyard was instantly sliced.When the leaf was sliced, the sword in the youth\u2019s hand had already returned to its sheath.\u201cSo fast! Young master, what sword skill was that?\u201dThe young girl standing on the side, slim and graceful, looked at the youth with adoration.\u201cSword Drawing Arts.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled lightly before his gaze turned misty as if recalling a distant memory.In his previous life, besides being a grandmaster in Form and Will Boxing, Sword Drawing Arts was another one of the fundamentals he had used to establish himself as undefeatable.At that time, numerous charming and beautiful assassins came on to him on purpose, hoping to find a chance to kill him.But at the moment that these beautiful assassins emitted the slightest amount of killing intent, that would be the moment their lives would come to an end.It was commonly known that Ling Tian\u2019s military dagger was called \u2018The Death God\u2019s Scythe\u2019 and that it was always the fastest.\u201cKe Er, you have to remember that the Sword Drawing Arts focus on speed. Amongst all of the martial arts around the world, only speed is undefeatable! Even against a martial artist stronger than you, as long as you are capable of drawing your sword and slicing through his throat before he can react, he will certainly die!\u201dDuan Ling Tian guided the young girl in a patient and gentle manner.The young girl was very studious, so she listened attentively.The young girl\u2019s delicate hands grasped the violet short sword, and with Duan Ling Tian\u2019s careful guidance, she slowly trained until her actions seemed similar in pattern and appearance.\u201cYoung master, is Ke Er stupid?\u201dAfter an afternoon of training, the young girl was drenched in sweat, her willow leaf shaped eyebrows were moving slightly, and her clear eyes seemed to be less lively; she seemed to be slightly disappointed.\u201cKe Er, why do you ask?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked in doubt.\u201cI trained for a whole afternoon, but the speed at which I draw my sword is not even one percent of young master\u2019s speed\u2026. Young master, is Ke Er not suitable to practice the sword?\u201dThe young girl\u2019s attractive lips slowly moved as she said this.\u201cSilly girl, a master of the Martial Dao is not something that can be produced in a single day. You have only trained in the Sword Drawing Arts for an afternoon; don\u2019t you think that coming to such a conclusion so fast is really arbitrary? You know, when I first trained in the Sword Drawing Arts, I trained for an entire day and my progress was still inferior to your current progress.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head. He was wondering what the problem was, but he didn\u2019t expect that what was troubling her was this.\u201cReally?\u201dThe young girl blinked her beautiful, clear eyes. Her confidence was emerging once again.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled gently.\u201cKe Er, if you want to fully execute the speed of the Sword Drawing Arts, you have to familiarize yourself with the methods of exertion I taught you earlier. How you should hold your sword, which part of the body to exert strength with first, and then you have to get fully familiar with the order and power to use during each step; only once you understand these will you be able to catch up to me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said.\u201cYoung master, I will work hard.\u201dThe young girl said sincerely as she nodded her exquisite chin.Duan Ling Tian stood to the side and watched the young girl continue training with the sword.Suddenly, he seemed as if he noticed something.\u201cMom.\u201dIt was unknown when Li Rou had appeared beside Duan Ling Tian.Noticing the young girl practicing the same sword move over and over again, Li Rou had an expression of doubt.\u201cTian, what sword skill did you teach Ke Er? Why is she only practicing the same sword move over and over again\u2026. Do you need mom to buy Ke Er a set of sword skills from the marketplace?\u201dLi Rou asked.\u201cMom, it\u2019s not necessary. Those flashy sword skills are only good to look at, but when it comes to real battles, they are totally useless.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.He did not even take any of the martial skills in the Li family Martial Pavilion seriously, let alone the inferior sword skills available in Fresh Breeze Town.\u201d\u201cTian, don\u2019t tell me the sword skill you taught Ke Er is even better than those that can be bought in the marketplace.\u201dLi Rou had an expression of disbelief.\u201cMom, do you want to try?\u201dDuan Ling Tian turned around and laughed.\u201cWhat, you want to spar with your mother?\u201dLi Rou laughed.For her, sparring with a level three Body Tempering stage martial artist was the same as playing house.\u201cMom, be careful\u201dDuan Ling Tian reminded, and at the same time his right hand let go of the sheath and instead grabbed the hilt of the Fine Steel Sword.Sword Drawing Arts!He drew the sword without a trace!Under the shining sun, only a white flash could be seen.Before the sword sheath could even drop down, the Fine Steel Sword was already back inside the sheath in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand.Sword Drawing Arts: drawing the sword like lightning and then putting away the sword like muffled thunder!At the same moment that Duan Ling Tian drew his sword, Li Rou moved, flying backwards!The force she exerted with her feet even drew upon the force of heaven and earth, so an ancient mammoth silhouette appeared above her head.Which meant that to dodge Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword, she had to use the strength of one ancient mammoth!Li Rou took a deep breath and looked at Duan Ling Tian in disbelief.She noticed that although her son\u2019s drawing movement was similar to what Ke Er was practicing, the speed at which they moved were not on the same level.If she was just a little bit slow earlier, her son\u2019s sword would certainly have touched her.Swinging a sword with his third level Body Tempering strength forced her to use strength equal to that of a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist to dodge\u2026.This sword skill was truly heaven-defying!\u201cMom, that was the sword skill I taught Ke Er. What do you think?\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.Relying upon the Fine Steel Sword, even if the opponent was a sixth level Body Tempering stage martial artist, as long as he could get close, he was fully confident in his ability to kill his opponent.When one\u2019s cultivation has not reached a certain level, the aid of weapons is extremely important.Combined with his Sword Drawing Arts, it would be even easier for him to be successful in his endeavors!\u201cThis sword skill, is it also from the old man you met in your dreams?\u201dLi Rou glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian could not help himself from touching his nose and smiling embarrassedly.\u201cTian, what is this sword skill called?\u201d\u201cSword Drawing Arts.\u201d\u201cCan you teach your mother?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dLi Rou became interested in the Sword Drawing Arts, so she started to practice with Ke Er.With her cultivation as a base, her progress in cultivating the Sword Drawing Arts was much faster than Ke Er\u2019s.After one day, relying upon the strength of one ancient mammoth, Li Rou\u2019s drawing speed was similar to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s.Of course, her comprehension of the Sword Drawing Arts was nowhere near Duan Ling Tian\u2019s.After all, she was using ten thousand pounds of strength to match Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed, while he hardly used two hundred pounds of strength.For the sake of cultivating the Sword Drawing Arts, Li Rou bought herself a Fine Steel Sword as well. Her sword would usually never leave her side.In the following few days, Duan Ling Tian started to get busy.Besides his own cultivation, he not only had to teach the two beautiful women how to cultivate the sword, but he also had to concoct the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for the Li family higher ups\u2026.If it wasn\u2019t for the help of his mother and Ke Er, he would\u2019ve been exhausted.Only after spending three days\u2019 time of concocting medicinal liquid to supply the Li family higher ups children for three months did Duan Ling Tian get some free time.Looking at the medicinal materials piled up into a mountain in his room, Duan Ling Tian had a satisfied smile on his face.He pocketed at least a third of the medicinal materials that the Li family higher ups had provided as his labor fee.Which meant that when he wanted to concoct the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid in the future, he wouldn\u2019t need to buy six of the seven medicinal materials.\u201cTian, people from the Fang family have come. The Patriarch asked you to come to the Audience Hall.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s voice sounded from outside.Fang family?\u201cSo they finally came?\u201dDuan Ling Tians eyes flashed. They were without a trace of unexpectedness.When he took Ke Er to buy a sword a few days ago, he had guessed that the person that was following him was of the Fang family.Li Family Audience HallPatriarch Li Nan Feng sat at the head and Sixth Elder Li Ping sat beneath him.Sitting opposite to them was the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi.Standing behind Fang Yi was a red-eyed middle-aged man.\u201cPatriarch.\u201dSuddenly, an immature voice sounded from outside the Audience Hall.\u201cEnter.\u201dLi Nan Feng replied.\u201cSixth Elder, I heard that your son, Li Dong, is about to break through to the third level of the Body Tempering stage. Congratulations\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian entered and greeted Li Nan Feng before nodding to Li Ping.Li Ping smiled amicably and his eyes flashed with a trace of gratefulness and regret.If Duan Ling Tian was not magnanimous, his son would not have the chance to improve so quickly.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, this is the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, and the one behind him is the Fang family\u2019s Manager.\u201dLi Nan Feng introduced.\u201cGreetings, Patriarch Fang, Manager Fang.\u201dDuan Ling Tian moved his gaze towards the two guests and smiled faintly.His expression was carefree.\u201cI heard long ago that the Li family\u2019s Ninth Elder was a rare heroine. Like mother like son; as expected, you\u2019re out of the ordinary.\u201dThe Fang Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed into a line.According to his investigation in these past few days, the abrupt rise of Duan Ling Tian was like a miracle.In one month\u2019s time, transforming from a sickly person into a third level Body Tempering martial artist.And he even dominantly crippled Li jie, the son of the Li family\u2019s Seventh Elder and the Li family\u2019s genius youth.Even after that, he did not receive any punishment from the Li family.\u201cPatriarch Fang, I\u2019ve brought Duan Ling Tian here. Why are you looking for him?\u201dAsked Li Nan Feng.The moment Li Nan Feng finished his words.Fang Yi\u2019s face changed. He stood up from his seat and looked at the youth in a condescending and fierce manner.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, how dare you?! One month ago you injured my son and crippled the son of my Fang family\u2019s Manager. Regarding this matter, shouldn\u2019t you give my Fang family an explanation?\u201dLi Nan Feng and Li Ping did not expect Fang Yi\u2019s sudden outburst.They did not know of this matter.The youth\u2019s immature face was tranquil as a pool of water; obviously it was not unexpected to him.\u201cPatriarch Fang, if you came here today to denounce my crimes, then I\u2019m afraid you will be disappointed. Regarding the matter of that day, as I\u2019m sure you have investigated thoroughly, justice is in everyone\u2019s hearts. If your son didn\u2019t rely on the power of the Fang family, I would not have attacked. Moreover, in my opinion, I have already showed mercy by not crippling your son. I have already given enough face to your Fang family.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.\u201cHow dare you, a mere Li family disciple with another surname, dare to be so disrespectful to my Fang family\u2019s Patriarch! You\u2019re courting Death!\u201dThe Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang, who was behind Fang Yi, caught on to the chance he desired. He shouted loudly before flying out like an eagle towards the youth.His actions emitted a cold hatred and killing intent\u2026.Above his head, the force of heaven and earth stirred as an ancient mammoth silhouette appeared!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He obviously wanted to kill the youth immediately!Fang Qiang was extremely quick; he moved in front of the youth in the blink of an eye.At the moment he slapped out his palm, the youth\u2019s body trembled and reacted, instinctively stomping on the ground and flashing backwards at a high speed!But even then, the youth was still hit by the residual force. He was sent flying into the wall and then spat out a mouthful of blood\u2026.The youth\u2019s face was ghastly pale and his body was swaying. He quickly managed to stabilize his body with great difficulty.His fist were clenched tightly and his nails pierced into his palm, but he was not feeling any pain\u2026.His sharp eyes were emitting bloodthirsty killing intent!Fang Qiang stomped his feet on the ground and flew out. After missing his first attack, he actually wanted to attack a second time!\u201cHow dare you!\u201dNoticing this, the Li family\u2019s Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, stood up and shouted loudly!\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dOrigin Energy busted out of Sixth Elder Li Ping\u2019s feet, then he moved like a bolt of lightning, flashing towards Fang Qiang.His punch burst forth with Origin Energy, drawing upon the force of heaven and earth, developing into four ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026.A punch containing the strength of four ancient mammoths! If it hits Fang Qiang, even if he does not die, he will be crippled!However, at this critical moment, the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch attacked.He moved forward and pulled Fang Qiang away to dodge Li Ping\u2019s punch.Fang Yi\u2019s speed was two times faster than Li Ping\u2019s!At this moment, eight ancient mammoth silhouettes flashed above Fang Yi\u2019s head\u2026.The strength of eight ancient mammoths!\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Li Ping glanced at Fang Yi coldly before coming to side of the youth and asking this.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you, Sixth Elder.\u201dThe youth shook his head. Even though he was injured, he did not make a single sound.To him, that was a sign of being weak.\u201cFang Yi!\u201dA loud shout echoed from the Li family\u2019s Patriarch; it was as if thunder exploded.The entire audience hall started shaking from the force.\u201cMy Li family will investigate the matter between your Fang family and Duan Ling Tian ourselves! But your Fang family member actually dared to attack and injure my Li family member inside the Li family estate! It looks like you are making light of the Li family! Regarding this, don\u2019t you think that you have to give me, and the Li family for that matter, an explanation?!\u201dLi Nan Feng was thoroughly enraged and furious. Duan Ling Tian was the treasure of the Li family.If Duan Ling Tian were to be killed, not to mention the fact that Ninth Elder would never let it go, but even the Li family\u2019s chance at rising up to crush the Fang and Chen families would be totally destroyed!\u201cPatriarch Li, please forgive him. My Fang family\u2019s Manager\u2019s only son was crippled by Duan Ling Tian. His son will be bedridden the rest of his life. He had a good reason for attacking Duan Ling Tian, and he had no intention of offending the Li family\u2026. Now, Duan Ling Tian is fine, so why don\u2019t we just leave it as it is?\u201dNo one expected that Fang Yi would have such a tranquil expression; it was as if nothing had happened.\u201cFang Yi!\u201dLi Nan Feng\u2019s face turned grim.But before he could continue, he was interrupted by the youth that walked a few steps forward.\u201cPatriarch, I would like to settle the matter myself.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said, not even waiting for Li Nan Feng to reply. The youth\u2019s bloodshot eyes stared at the Fang family\u2019s Manager.He was like an Asura that had just walked out of hell. His entire body was emitting a bloodthirsty killing intent, causing others to feel a chill to run down their spines\u2026.\u201cIt\u2019s Fang Qiang, right? In three months, I will visit your Fang family and I\u2019ll take your life!\u201dFinishing what he said, the youth turned around and walked out.\u201cOK! Three months from now, I\u2019ll be waiting for you. At that time, I will kill you with my own two hands and take revenge for my son!\u201dBecause he originally believed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take revenge for his son, when Fang Qiang heard what the youth said, his dark red eyes instantly emitted a light of agitation and excitement\u2026.\u201cThat will depend on whether you have the capability.\u201dThe youth didn\u2019t even turn his head around, he only laughed coldly and walked out, leaving the Li family\u2019s audience hall.Leaving behind a proud and aloof figure.The Ling Tian of his previous life went unhindered for half of his lifetime; he was unrestricted and unmatched!In this lifetime, a mere Fang family Manager dared to try and take his life.In three months he will surely visit the Fang family and splatter blood on his sword to wash away the humiliation he received today\u2026.Only slaughter could calm down the rage in his heart!\u201cPatriarch Li, your Li family really has young heroes\u2026. This Duan Ling Tian has so much ambition at such a young age; someone like that is really hard to come by! Since he has established a life and death agreement with Fang Qiang, there is no point in pursuing the matter any further. In three months , the entirety of my Fang family will be waiting for his arrival!\u201dFang Yi looked towards Li Nan Feng and laughed.Finishing what he said, Fang Yi ignored the green-faced Li Nan Feng, taking Fang Qiang along and leaving.\u201cPatriarch, Duan Ling Tian is too rash!\u201dSixth Elder Li Ping frowned, his face full of worry.He wasn\u2019t worried about Duan Ling Tian\u2019s life or death, but was worried that if anything happened to Duan Ling Tian, his son wouldn\u2019t have any Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid left to use.In these past few days, he had noticed his son\u2019s improvement in cultivation. The Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was indeed a godly item!Li Nan Feng had a complicated expression.Earlier, when Duan Ling Tian emitted a bloodthirsty killing intent, even he felt a trace of being suppressed.He could not understand how Duan Ling Tian, who supposedly had not killed anyone before, could be capable of emitting such killing intent\u2026.In his opinion, only a veteran of a hundred battles that had killed many martial artists would be capable of developing such a terrifying killing intent.\u201cSince he has made a decision, we can only believe in him and hope that he produces a miracle once again\u2026. Sixth Elder, I want to know about the matter between Duan Ling Tian and the Fang family. Go and investigate for me.\u201dThe mysteriousness of Duan Ling Tian caused a trace of hope to rise in Li Nan Feng\u2019s heart.\u201cYes, Patriarch.\u201dLi Ping replied and left. His face was ugly.Although Duan Ling Tian defeating Li Jie could be considered a miracle.Li Jie was only at the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage, while Fang Qiang was a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist. They could not be compared.A third level Body Tempering youth intending to defeat a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist in three months, would be an unbelievable feat in his opinion.The Body Tempering stage was divided into nine levels, each level being more difficult to achieve than the previous.Duan Ling Tian, who was forcefully bearing the pain, walked with heavy footsteps towards his home.His pride did not allow him to show any weakness.When he reached the courtyard of his house, he finally coughed severely, spitting blood all over the floor.\u201cYoung master, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dSeeing this scene, the face of Ke Er, who was washing some vegetables in the courtyard, turned ghastly pale.After hurriedly putting down the things in her hands, she supported Duan Ling Tian back to his room. Her clear eyes were glimmering with tears.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t frighten Ke Er, don\u2019t frighten Ke Er\u2026.\u201dThe young girl started to cry.\u201cSilly girl, I only suffered some light injuries. I\u2019ll be fine; I just need to rest for a while.\u201dDuan Ling Tian slowly wiped the tears from the corners of the young girl\u2019s eyes while forcefully smiling.An hour later, Li Rou, who had just returned from the marketplace in Fresh Breeze Town, entered the courtyard.Noticing the floor covered in blood, her face changed greatly.\u201cTian, who injured you?\u201dLi Rou rushed into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s room. Her voice was ice cold.\u201cMom, I\u2019m fine\u2026. And, I\u2019ve already talked with the Patriarch about this matter; I will settle it myself. Mom, you have to trust me!\u201dAfter going through Ke Er\u2019s devoted care and consuming the grade nine Gold Injury Pill that the Patriarch brought over, Duan Ling Tian had already partially recovered, so he managed to squeeze out a smile on his face.\u201cWas it Fang Yi?\u201dLi Rou asked in a low voice.\u201cNo, it was the Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang. Mom, he doesn\u2019t have much longer to live; three months from now is the day he will die!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes emitted a cold light as he neared the end of that sentence.Afterwards, the medicinal effects of the grade nine Gold Injury Pill hit him and Duan Ling Tian fell soundly asleep.\u201cKe Er, take good care of Tian.\u201dLi Rou performed a brief check on him. After making sure that her son was alright, she let out a breath of relief. She then left the courtyard to go see Patriarch Li Nan Feng.From Li Nan Feng, she found out the whole sequence of events, and she understood what her son meant earlier.She took a deep breath. Although her eyes shone with intense killing intent, when she thought about her son\u2019s persistence, she forced herself to put up with it.She decided in her heart that if her son is not Fang Qiang\u2019s match in three months, even if it means enraging the entire Fang family, she will still kill Fang Qiang!For the sake of her son, she would give up everything\u2026.Even her life!The tranquil Fresh Breeze Town was bustling with noise and excitement as soon as the Fang family purposefully leaked some news\u2026.\u201cHey! Have you heard the news? Rumor has is that a Li family disciple with another surname publically challenged the Fang family\u2019s Manager, \u2018Fang Qiang,\u2019 to a life and death battle three months from now!\u201d\u201cYeah, I heard about it. That disciple with another surname is called Duan Ling Tian. He is the Li family\u2019s Ninth Elder\u2019s son. A month ago, for the sake of a young girl that was selling her body to bury her mother, a conflict arose between him and the Fang family\u2019s young master, Fang Jian, and he even crippled one of Fang Jian\u2019s lackeys!\u201d\u201cAllegedly, the person that was crippled by Duan Ling Tian was the only son of the Fang family\u2019s Manager!\u201d\u201cI remember now. A month ago, Fang Jian did suffer a loss in the hands of a youth, and I was there at the time. That youth was Duan Ling Tian? Judging by his appearance, I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t even sixteen yet\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true; he\u2019s not even sixteen, yet he dares to challenge the Fang family\u2019s Manager to a life and death battle? There\u2019s nothing wrong with his head, right? Everyone in Fresh Breeze Town knows that the Fang family\u2019s Manager is a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist.\u201d\u201cYoung and arrogant!\u201d\u2026\u2026Similar discussions could be heard all around Fresh Breeze Town.Everyone thought that Duan Ling Tian was committing suicide.Li family estate.In the Main Hall, Patriarch Li Nan Feng and all of the Li family\u2019s elders were gathered.Even Seventh Elder, who had been closed up in his home for the past few days, was present.The news that spread wildly all over Fresh Breeze Town had made its way into the ears of the Li family\u2019s elders.They were anxious.Three months from now, if anything were to happen to Duan Ling Tian, wouldn\u2019t that mean that their children wouldn\u2019t have any more Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to use?\u201cPatriarch!\u201d\u201cPatriarch!\u201d\u2026\u2026Besides Grand Elder Li Huo, Seventh Elder Li Kun, and Ninth Elder Li Rou, all the elders had anxious expressions as they looked towards Li Nan Feng.Li Nan Feng raised his hands, preventing everyone from continuing.\u201cFellow elders, I know everyone\u2019s wishes, but this matter has already been decided upon. Moreover, the news has been spread by the Fang family, so if we were to admit defeat, what would happened to the Li family\u2019s reputation? That means we can only trust in Duan Ling Tian. I have already discussed the matter with the Grand Elder. For these three months, the Li family will spare no cost and effort to help Duan Ling Tian! Fellow Elders, do you have any objections?\u201dAt this moment, the Li family\u2019s elders could only laugh bitterly and sign. It was too late to undo the battle agreement, so they had no choice.After all the Li family higher ups left.And Seventh Elder Li Kun walked towards his home, the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.\u201cLittle Jie, soon someone will take revenge for you\u2026. That Duan Ling Tian actually dared to challenge a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist to a life and death battle. He is really seeking death!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At that time, your hidden injuries will be completely cured.\u201dThe youth massaged as he said this.\u201cKid, if it wasn\u2019t for you, this old bag of bones would have to suffer for who knows how long.\u201dThe old man sighed.In these last few years, he nearly went insane from the torture his hidden injuries caused him.Being able to eradicate his injuries was the best news he could ever come upon.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, Grand Elder. I\u2019m only doing what you paid me to do.\u201dThe youth shook his head while smiling lightly.Massaging the old man for a thousand silver each time was an extremely lucrative business to him.\u201cI heard you refused the Patriarch\u2019s help.\u201dThe old man abruptly asked.\u201cYes, I\u2019m not in need of money at the moment, and everything I need can be bought from the marketplace. There\u2019s no reason for me to waste the family\u2019s resources; those resources would be better used on someone who needs it more than me.\u201dThe youth smiled.\u201cKid, you make it sound like you\u2019re so kind, but why didn\u2019t I notice that you were so enlightened? The true reason you declined was because you don\u2019t want to owe the Li family, or should I say you don\u2019t want get tied up with the Li family, right?\u201dWith just one remark, the old man unraveled the youth\u2019s true thoughts.The youth smiled embarrassedly. As expected, wisdom and experience came with age.It was exactly as the old man said; he didn\u2019t want to get tied up with the Li family. He was going to leave sooner or later to explore the vast world.The Li family and Fresh Breeze Town were merely a starting point for him.\u201cHu!\u201dThe youth stopped massaging.The old man opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of foul air, then he passed a stack of silver bills to the profusely sweating youth.\u201cGrand Elder, I\u2019ll be leaving now. See you in half a month.\u201dThe youth laughed playfully.After the youth left, the old man muttered to himself.\u201cI hope you will be able to pleasantly surprise me two and a half months from now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian went straight home after leaving Grand Elder Li Huo\u2019s residence.As he entered the courtyard, he saw a gentle and graceful figure rapidly drawing and sheathing her sword over and over, repeating unceasingly\u2026.It was as if she was unaware of what exhaustion was.The young girl was dripping in sweat and biting on her pink lips. Her clear eyes, which were as clear as water, were filled with a sense of resolution!Duan Ling Tian felt a tug in his heartstrings as he watched her.\u201cKe Er, sword cultivation strives to follow the heart and not overdo things. Overexerting yourself will only cause more harm than good.\u201dHe gently said as he walked forward and grabbed the young girl\u2019s drawing arm.\u201cYoung master, Ke Er wishes to master the Sword Drawing Arts as soon as possible, because only then will Ke Er be able to protect young master, help young master beat up bad people, and save young master from being bullied by bad people.\u201dThe young girl had a flushed face and was breathing heavily as she earnestly said this.\u201cSilly girl, go get some rest.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart was warm as he gently touched the young girl\u2019s soft hair.The young girl nodded. She seemed meek like a kitten.Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Spirit Serpent Form!That night, the youth sat inside the bath barrel while greedily absorbing the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid within\u2026.When he finished absorbing the medicinal liquid, his lifeblood\u2019s strengthening and his fleshly body\u2019s metamorphosis had arrived at a critical threshold.He walked out of the bath barrel and put on some clothes.\u201cTomorrow morning I will surely be able to break through to the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage\u2026. But, if I want to kill Fang Qiang with certainty two and a half months from now, I need to break through to the seventh level at a bare minimum. Improving cultivation gets more difficult as the levels progress, so I will undoubtedly be unable to achieve the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage in two and half months from by only relying on the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. Maybe it\u2019s time I go get some things from the marketplace.\u201dThe youth\u2019s eyes flickered as he muttered to himself.In the morning of the following day, when the sun had not risen yet, the youth woke up and poured a portion of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid into the bath barrel before beginning to cultivate.After a night of rest, the medicinal properties that fused into his body during the medicinal bath last night had finally been fully absorbed by him.While circulating Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form, the youth sat inside the bath barrel with his eyes closed, greedily absorbing the medicinal liquid.After an unknown amount of time.When dawn arrived, the rays of morning sunlight shone upon the earth. After passing through the curtain, tiny rays of sunlight gently shone upon the youth. Only then did he slowly open his eyes.SplashThe youth stood up and casually stretched his body. His bones emitted a clear and melodious sound as they rubbed together\u2026.Suddenly, a smile appeared on the youth\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019ve finally broken through.\u201dHe lifted his palms upwards and slowly clenched them into fists.Feeling the explosive strength within his body, the smile on the youth\u2019s face became even wider.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as I expected; while an ordinary fourth level Body Tempering martial artist would gain two hundred pounds of strength, I gained a full three hundred pounds!The Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique was indeed different from other cultivation methods.After putting on his clothes, the youth pushed open the door, walked out, and enjoyed bathing in the rays of sunlight.Whoosh! Clang! Whoosh! Clang! Whoosh! Clang!\u2026\u2026The clear and melodious sounds of a sword being drawn and sheathed entered his ears.Only then did Duan Ling Tian notice that Ke Er had been seriously cultivating her Drawing Sword Arts since early in the morning.The young girl chose to cultivate far off in the corner of the courtyard so she could avoid disturbing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s and his mother\u2019s sweet dreams.If he hadn\u2019t walked out of his room, he would definitely be unable to hear these sounds.Duan Ling Tian sighed as he understood that Ke Er was having a difficult time forgetting the matter of him being injured the other day.She had been cultivating desperately in these past few days. Not only did her cultivation step into the third level of the Body Tempering stage, but she even became proficient in the rudiments of the Sword Drawing Arts.It can be said that everything Ke Er was doing was for him\u2026 to protect him.\u201cKe Er, stop cultivating for now and accompany me to the marketplace.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he walked over.\u201cYoung master, I\u2019ll go prepare some breakfast.\u201dThe young girl put away her sword. Seeming tall and graceful, her cheeks, which were without make up, had a slight blush.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, let\u2019s eat out.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll prepare some for Madam\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it; my mom can make breakfast herself. Let\u2019s go.\u201dDuan Ling Tian grabbed the young girl\u2019s hand. On the way out, he didn\u2019t forget to look towards his mother\u2019s room to call out.\u201cMom, I\u2019m taking Ke Er out. Take care of your breakfast yourself.\u201dAfter Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er left.\u201cIs this considered forgetting the mother after getting a wife?\u201dThe woman shook her head and the corners of her mouth curled into a smile.\u201cBoss, Boss, wait for me\u2026.wait for me!\u201dAs the couple walked out of the Li family estate, a voice combined with heavy breathing sounded from behind them.A little fatty with the fat on his body flinging about stopped in front of them, blocking their path as he bent over panting.\u201cWere you calling me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian turned around and looked behind himself but did not notice anyone else.The little fatty was slightly familiar, but he could not remember who he was. Could he be a lackey of the old Duan Ling Tian?But the old Duan Ling Tian was sickly; would anyone actually be willing to be his lackey?\u201cBoss, of course it\u2019s you. You are my idol.\u201dThe little fatty nodded his head like a chick pecking grain. The fat on his face was shaking.\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201dCreasing his eyebrows, Duan Ling Tian held the young girl\u2019s hand and continued forward.\u201cBoss, it was my wrong to pull down your pants when we were kids, but you don\u2019t have to be so resentful, right? The other day, when you crippled Li Jie, it really helped me vent some resentment, and also, Boss, you crippled him and nothing happened to you. You\u2019re really amazing!\u201dThe little fatty jubilantly followed, his mouth not stopping.Pull down my pants?Hearing what the little fatty said, a vague picture popped into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s head.It was one of the memories of the old Duan Ling Tian.In the memory, a group of five or six-year-old kids were playing\u2026.Suddenly, a little fatty snuck up behind him and pulled down his pants, causing all of the kids to start laughing, then he cried out of grievance.\u201cYou\u2019re Li Xuan?\u201dDuan Ling Tian finally remembered.This fatty was the only son of Fifth Elder Li Ting. He had gone away from Fresh Breeze Town with his grandfather at an early age but unexpectedly had returned.\u201cBoss, you finally remembered me.\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s eyes shone brightly.\u201cWhen did you return? Also, why are you calling me Boss?\u201dAsked Duan Ling Tian.In his memories, the old Duan Ling Tian did not often come into contact with the little fatty, let alone take him as a lackey.\u201cI\u2019ve been back for two months. Since you helped me teach Li Jie a lesson and because you\u2019re so formidable, I decided to make you my boss. Boss, from now on I\u2019m one of your people, so you have to take good care of me!\u201dThe little fatty laughed, blinking his small eyes.After hearing an explanation from the little fatty, Duan Ling Tian found out that upon returning, the little fatty came into conflict with Li Jie\u2019s little brother, Li Xin. But since Li Xin wasn\u2019t his match, he brought his brother, Li Jie, to beat him up.\u201cI crippled Li Jie for my own reasons; I wasn\u2019t trying to help you\u2026. Besides, you\u2019re not one of my people, and I have no intention of becoming your boss, so stop bothering me!\u201dDuan Ling Tian said indifferently with a cold voice He held the young girl\u2019s hand and walked away without turning back.Being sold out by a brother in his previous life taught him an important lesson: he would never take another brother without a good reason, as he didn\u2019t want to have a ticking time bomb by his side.A thief from within is hard to guard against!The little fatty didn\u2019t expect Duan Ling Tian to turn hostile so abruptly, so he was stunned on the spot and watched the couple slowly move further away.Behind his chubby face was a pair of eyes full of grievance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was established by a large merchant group from outside Fresh Breeze Town.There were many people walking in and out of Agarwood Restaurant to have breakfast.Anyone who could afford to eat in Agarwood Restaurant was someone who came from a well-off family; either someone rich or a noble.When the couple walked into Agarwood Restaurant, they attracted the attention of the people who were walking in and out of the restaurant. Most of them were gazes of envy and admiration.The gazes of envy fell upon the young girl, whereas the gazes of admiration were upon the youth.\u201cAre the two of you dining?\u201dThe attendant standing at the door greeted them in a respectful voice with his head lowered.\u201cYes, a booth on the second floor. Do you have any beside the windows left?The youth nodded and said familiarly.\u201cYes, this way please.\u201dWhen the attendant heard what the youth said, he knew that they weren\u2019t first timers. He hurriedly took them to the second floor, which was much quieter than the first floor.Of course, the price for eating in the second floor was double.\u201cOur luck isn\u2019t bad.\u201dSeeing the last table beside the window, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s slightly knit his eyebrows.As Duan Ling Tian brought the young girl over to the window\u2019s side, some of the people on the second floor had their gazes fixed upon Ke Er, attracted by her charm and good looks.Three youths that were sitting beside another window not far away had gazes of greed when they looked at Ke Er.\u201cKe Er, sit.\u201dDuan Ling Tian took the violet short sword from Ke Er and placed it on the table, then, like a gentleman, he casually pulled out a chair for Ke Er to sit on.\u201cThank you, Young Master.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s delicate and immature face blushed as she sat down.Just when Duan Ling Tian was about to sit opposite of Ke Er, a sound of wind passed by his ears as a figure flashed by and then sat on his seat before him.Duan Ling Tian frowned when he saw that immature young girl sitting on his seat.The green-clothed young girl was around sixteen years old. Her appearance could not be considered to be exceedingly beautiful, but her slightly innocent face contained a hint of charm. Combined with her innocent temperament, they formed a conflicting combination.A servant girl of ordinary appearance followed behind her and came to stand behind her.\u201cMiss Chen, I\u2019m sorry, this young master has already taken this seat. Could you please choose a different seat?\u201dSaid the attendant that brought Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er over. His face had a humble smile, meaning that he obviously recognized the green-clothed young girl.\u201cThis miss has taken a liking to this seat. As a regular customer of Agarwood Restaurant, don\u2019t I even get this little special treatment?\u201dThe green-clothed young girl raised her proud head, glancing at the attendant condescendingly.\u201cThis miss doesn\u2019t like having strangers around when I\u2019m eating.\u201dShe said indifferently as she gazed at Ke Er, who was sitting opposite of her. There was jealousy in her eyes.\u201cYoung master, why don\u2019t you\u2026.\u201dThe other attendant that was following the green-clothed young girl looked towards Duan Ling Tian, wanting him to change seats.But when he noticed that Duan Ling Tian was paying no attention to him, he could only laugh bitterly and shut his mouth.\u201cYoung master, why don\u2019t we change our seats?\u201dAt this moment, Ke Er looked towards Duan Ling Tian.She had noticed that this Miss Chen was of a respectable family with high status.Although her appearance and disposition were inferior to Ke Er\u2019s, the aura she unintentionally emitted pressured Ke Er until she could not breathe properly.Even though she had been following Duan Ling Tian for a long time, she had a sense of inferiority deep inside her heart due to her inferior birth.Duan Ling Tian noticed Ke Er\u2019s gaze and instantly understood what she was thinking.He understood that if he wanted Ke Er to let go of the sense of inferiority in her heart, he had to make a good example.He needed to at least let Ke Er know that in this world, dignity and honor were things you had to fight for on your own.\u201cKe Er, can you tell me why we should change our seats?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked in a gentle voice while affectionately looking at Ke Er.\u201cYoung master, I\u2026.\u201dKe Er didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cKe Er, you have to remember that ever since the day you followed me home, you stopped being the Ke Er that you used to be. I hope that I can see a confident you, a you that has gained new life, and not the old you. Do you understand?\u201dGuided Duan Ling Tian patiently and gently.\u201cYoung Master, I was wrong.\u201dKe Er\u2019s eyes were slightly red as she lowered her head.\u201cHey! Did the two of you hear me? This miss doesn\u2019t like strangers around when she eats, so hurry up and F**K off!\u201dAfter hearing Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er chat, the greed-clothed young girl turned angry from embarrassment and shouted this.\u201cMiss Chen, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian suddenly looked towards the green-clothed young girl.\u201cI\u2019ll give you the time of three breaths to f**k off from my seat, or else\u2026. you will face the consequences!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light. His voice was suppressed until it sounded grim and low.The green-clothed young girl\u2019s face changed.Just when she was about to start scolding.She felt a cold aura emanate from the youth and descend upon her, suppressing her until she could hardly breathe; it even caused her face to turn pale.\u201cTwo more breaths left!\u201dThe low and grim voice sounded again.This time, the icy cold aura suppressed her even more!The green-clothed young girl\u2019s consciousness nearly collapsed, but being the Chen family\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s daughter, her pride as the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter allowed her to clench her teeth and persevere.\u201cOne more breath left!\u201dThe low and grim voice sounded a third time like muffled thunder.Accompanying the voice this time was not only the icy cold aura but also a trace of a bloodthirsty aura.The green-clothed young girl\u2019s face was ghastly pale. When she got to the point where she could not hold on any longer, she stood up in panic.While helplessly watching Duan Ling Tian sit down, the frightening aura that suppressed her slowly disappeared.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe green-clothed young girl asked unwillingly after taking a deep breath.She could not understand how a youth that looked younger than her had such a frightening aura.Earlier, she felt as if he was an Asura that had climbed out from the depths of hell; his entire body was emitting an icy cold and bloodthirsty aura.She didn\u2019t doubt that if she had continued to sit, a terribly frightening consequence would befall her.\u201cBring me two of your specialty dim sums. Hmmm, also bring me two bowls of soya-bean milk.\u201dDuan Ling Tian slowly said. He acted as if he hadn\u2019t heard the green-clothed young girl and instead looked at the dumbstruck attendants\u201cYes.\u201dOne of the attendants responded respectfully and left.In his opinion, someone who dared to go against the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter, Chen Mei Er, was no ordinary person.\u201cHey! I\u2019m talking to you. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201dChen Mei Er was on the brink of going berserk.Ever since she could remember, she was the beloved daughter of her parents and was doted upon constantly. This was the first time someone had actually ignored her.\u201cKe Er, the dim sum here is good; you should try some. If you like it, I\u2019ll bring you here every morning.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young girl opposite to him, his eyes filled tenderness as he smiled lightly.\u201cYoung Master, coming here to eat occasionally is enough. I remember hearing that the dim sum here is extremely expensive.\u201dThe young girl sensibly shook her head.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Even though I\u2019m not extremely rich, it\u2019s more than enough to satisfy my Ke Er\u2019s taste buds.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s unconcealed words caused the young girl to lower her head out of embarrassment. Her tender and lovely cheeks blushed.\u201cYoung Master, my Miss is speaking to you.\u201dThe servant girl beside Chen Mei Er timidly said to Duan Ling Tian as she looked at Ke Er in admiration.\u201cFollowing this sort of Miss must be really hard on you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at the servant girl before faintly smiling.\u201cNo\u2026It\u2019s not\u2026Miss\u2026.Miss is very good to me.\u201dThe servant girl\u2019s face turned ghastly white from fear as she hurriedly said this.\u201cDid I ask you to speak?\u201dChen Mei Er gave the servant girl a stare.At this moment, there was a trace of envy in her heart. Even she didn\u2019t think that there would be a day where she would be envious of the servant girl beside her.Not for any other reason but because the hateful guy who ignored her actually spoke nicely to her servant girl.\u201cMiss Mei Er!\u201d\u201cMiss Mei Er, it\u2019s really you!\u201d\u2026\u2026The three youths sitting at the nearby table recognized Chen Mei Er, so they were walking over and enthusiastically greeting her.Their tones were filled with admiration.Chen Mei Er\u2019s expression eased up and she looked proudly towards Duan Ling Tian.It was as if she was trying to tell Duan Ling Tian: I, Chen Mei Er, am richly endowed by nature and there are many people who acknowledge me.But when she noticed that Duan Ling Tian still had not even glanced at her, her expression instantly turned gloomy.\u201cMiss Mei Er, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dOne of the youths who was older than Chen Mei Er asked when he noticed her change.\u201cYeah, Miss Mei Er, do you need us to help you with anything?\u201dThe other two youths who were the same age as Chen Mei Er hurriedly asked as well.\u201cThis seat was mine, but he forced me to move and snatched my seat.\u201dChen Mei Er glanced at Duan Ling Tian. A trace of injustice emerged from her clear eyes as she exaggerated.\u201cWhat? He dared to snatch Miss Mei Er\u2019s seat?\u201d\u201cKid, you really are tremendously brave!\u201d\u2026\u2026When the three youths heard her, they shouted and instantly became furious at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cMiss, why do you slander others?\u201dKe Er asked. After hearing what Chen Mei Er had said, her immature face turned slightly red.Ke Er\u2019s exquisite eyes that were slightly red caused the three youths who were filled with righteous indignations to be struck dumb.Had they ever see such a beautiful girl before?At this moment, they even forgot what they were doing\u2026.\u201cIs she nice to look at?\u201dChen Mei Er said, with a stern voice as her face turned dark.\u201cYes, no, no!\u201dThe three youths were startled and came back to their senses.Only now did they remember that the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter was famous for being jealous.Allegedly, a long time ago, a servant of the Chen family praised a servant girl to be more beautiful than her, and as a result both, the servant and servant girl both disappeared into thin air.They looked towards Duan Ling Tian and furiously said,\u201cKid, if you know what\u2019s good for you, hurry up and f**k off. Didn\u2019t you even try to find out if Miss Chen is someone you can offend?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t f**k off, don\u2019t blame the three of us for not going easy on you!\u201d\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But what I think is funny is, where did you three get the confidence to think that you have the ability to not go easy on me? If I\u2019m not wrong, you three are from the Fang family, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s smile grew even wider. His wise eyes seemed to be able to see through them.Actually, in the old Duan Ling Tian\u2019s memories, there were vague memories of one of the youths. He should be one of the Fang family\u2019s young master\u2019s, Fang Jian\u2019s, lackeys.\u201cYou\u2019re right, we are from the Fang family. Now both our Fang and Chen family members are here, and you\u2019re just a little kid. Don\u2019t tell me you plan to go against us?\u201d\u201cYeah, can a little kid like you mess with the Fang and Chen families ?\u201d\u201cHurry up and kowtow and apologize to give Miss Chen, and maybe then we will let you live!\u201dThe three Fang family youths threatened Duan Ling Ting as if they had forgotten that they themselves were only little kids slightly older than him.\u201cI do believe that the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter can represent the Chen family\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded his head in all seriousness, causing Chen Mei Er, who was standing at the side, to feel complacent.But, what Duan Ling Tian said after that caused her face to become pitch black!\u201cBut the three of you whose legs get feeble the moment you see a woman, can you three represent the Fang family? I have to say though, this has to be the most ridiculous joke I have heard in my entire life! I even looked down on Miss Chen. Do you think it would be any different for you three?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face had a disdainful expression as he finished speaking; however, his eyes emitted a mischievous smile, as if he did it on purpose.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dThe three Fang family youths got angry from embarrassment as Duan Ling Tian ridiculed them in front of Chen Mei Er.\u201cWhat, want to fight?\u201dDuan Ling Tian started laughing.\u201cI\u2019m aware that your Agarwood Restaurant has a considerable background, so if they strike the first blow, I hope that you can bear witness for me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said while promptly looking at the attendant that was standing not far from them.When the attendant took a deep look at Duan Ling Tian, he noticed a farsightedness and confidence that even an adult may not necessarily have, as if everything was under his control.\u201cSo what if we strike the first blow? Attack!\u201dOne of the Fang family youths shouted. The three of them attacked at the time, violently approaching Duan Ling Tian. Theirs attacks were merciless, aiming directly for the vital points\u2026.\u201cYoung master!\u201dKe Er exclaimed as she prepared to pick up her sword.But just as her hand stretched towards the sword on the table, she noticed that it was already in Duan Lang Tian\u2019s hands.She only saw a streak of violet flashing across before returning to the sheath with a \u2018clang\u2019.In the next moment.Accompanied by three shrill cries were six lines of blood spraying out.The wrists of the three youths were violently spraying blood without any signs of stopping\u2026.\u201cI\u2019ll give you three breaths of time to disappear from my sight, or else, die!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s indifferent voice suppressed the shrill cries of the three youths.After hearing what he said, their faces instantly changed.Disregarding their hands, which were violently spraying blood and had lost all feeling, they hurriedly rushed down the second floor of Agarwood Restaurant.Using only two breaths of time, they had already disappeared from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sight.When a person faces death, they are able to arouse the potential within their bodies.The attendant at the side stared. Until now he still could not regain his senses after seeing that scene.In his opinion, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword was too fast; so fast that even a fifth level Body Tempering martial artist like him could not see it clearly.Chen Mei Er\u2019s face was pale and her gaze was filled with terror.The servant girl beside Chen Mei Er even lost her composure and screamed. She was so frightened that her entire body started shaking, not daring to even glance at Duan Ling Tian.The youth that was faintly smiling at her earlier was now a living king of hell in her eyes.Ke Er, who was sitting opposite of Duan Ling Tian, did not have a good expression either; her face was slightly pale.\u201cWhat, Miss Chen, do you want me to send you out myself?\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at the dumbstruck Chen Mei Er as he laughed.\u201cWho are you?\u201dChen Mei Er took a deep breath.\u201cMiss Chen, you\u2019re so unwilling to leave me; don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve fallen for me? But I really don\u2019t like women with an unrestrained disposition such as yours, so I hope that Miss Chen doesn\u2019t make any futile efforts.\u201dDuan Ling Tian ridiculed.Chen Mei Er didn\u2019t expect Duan Ling Tian to be so brazen. Her face and eyes turned red as she spat.The fear in her heart eased up as an effect of what Duan Ling Tian had said.\u201cCui Er, since the three of them have left, that table is unoccupied. Let\u2019s go there.\u201dWhereupon she brought her shivering servant girl to walk towards the other table that was beside a window.The dim sum that the three Fang family youths were eating earlier was still giving out hot steam.\u201cClear up the place, then go serve Miss Chen.\u201dNodding to the attendant, Duan Ling Tian smiled faintly.Chen Mei Er was different from normal unruly women; at least she was brave enough to stay behind after that experience.\u201cYes.\u201dThe attendant responded respectfully, then she wiped up the blood stains and proceeded to serve the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter.\u201cKe Er, did that frighten you?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards the young girl with a gentle expression.He acted like a completely different person now compared to earlier.\u201cNo.\u201dThe young girl shook her head.But her slightly pale, beautiful face undoubtedly showed that she actually was slightly frightened.After a few moments, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s order arrived.He acted as if nothing had happened as he ate dim sum and drank soya-bean milk.As for the young girl, she seemed to have lost her appetite, so she only ate a little bit.\u201cKe Er, your usual appetite is not so small; be a good girl and eat some.\u201dSaid Duan Ling Tian to encourage her.\u201cYoung master, I\u2026.\u201dHer face was slightly pale; she was seemingly recalling the scene from before.\u201cKe Er, sooner or later I will be leaving Fresh Breeze Town. If you\u2019re planning on following me, then you have to be prepared mentally, because even more bloody things may happen in the future. Do you understand? Of course, if you\u2019re not planning on following me, just take it as I never said a word.\u201dDuan Ling Tian purposely sighed, speaking slowly.\u201cYoung master, Ke Er understands. Ke Er will eat\u2026. Please don\u2019t leave Ke Er behind.\u201dShe hurriedly picked up the dim sums and started eating with a delicate and touching expression. Anyone who saw her would not be able to help themselves from loving her.It was impossible to say that Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t feel his heart ache when seeing Ke Er look like this.But he knew that he had to harden his heart, because only then would Ke Er be tempered, allowing her to quickly let go of the cowardice in her heart.\u201cHey! You, if you don\u2019t leave now, aren\u2019t you afraid of the Fang family coming to find trouble with you?\u201dChen Mei Er\u2019s voice came from afar and entered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.\u201cI won\u2019t burden Miss Chen with worrying. I bet Miss Chen actually can\u2019t wait for the Fang family\u2019s people to arrive and secretly hopes that they would hurry up, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian said indifferently.\u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off, you\u2019re pissing me off!\u201dChen Mei Er, who got pissed off by what Duan Ling Tian said, was gnashing her teeth and raging in her heart.Sooner or later I will find out who you are, and I\u2019ll never let you off, never!\u201cThis Chen Mei Er is really a jinx.\u201dAfter he finished eating, Duan Ling Tian looked out the window and noticed that the three youths from before had returned.Their hands had been bandaged and they were walking over with vigorous strides. They were bringing along a gloomy-faced twenty-year-old young man and were approaching in an aggressive manner.The four of them quickly entered Agarwood Restaurant.When this scene was caught by the nearby Chen Mei Er, her eyes lit up with a smiling expression. When she glanced at Duan Ling Tian, her heart stirred. \u2018So you didn\u2019t listen to my advice, now the Fang family medicine store\u2019s junior manager has come personally. Let\u2019s see if you can still laugh now\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cIf you beg me and kowtow three times for me, maybe I might consider helping you.\u201d\u201cBrother Quan, that\u2019s him!\u201dThe three Fang family youths brought the young man to the second floor, then they fell over each other to extend their hands and point towards Duan Ling Tian while gnashing their teeth.\u201cStay calm and discuss the matter. Stay calm.\u201dThe attendant that followed behind hurriedly persuaded.\u201cStay calm and discuss the matter?\u201dThe young man, the Fang family\u2019s medicine store\u2019s junior manager, Fang Quan, swept the attendants with a cold gaze.\u201cWhy weren\u2019t any of you persuading him when the tendons on the hands of my Fang family members were cut off? F**k off!\u201dWhat the young man said caused Chen Mei Er\u2019s face to change.Cut off the tendons on the hands?In an instant, a bone piercing chill arose in her heart. Her gaze towards Duan Ling Tian contained fear.Sheoriginally thought that Duan Ling Tian had only made the three Fang family youths bleed, but never would she have expected that he had actually cut off the tendons on their hands.Once the tendons on the hand were cut off, even if it was healed, the hand would never be as sensitive as before.To a martial artist, it was no different from cutting off both arms.\u201cYou, take your own life!\u201dFang Quan coldly stared at Duan Ling Tian as if he were looking at a dead man.In his opinion, a mere fourth level Body Tempering kid was no different from a dead man.\u201cHehe\u2026. What, I beat up the small ones, then the big one couldn\u2019t wait to jump out? The smallest of the three of you is still older than me. Since I can make you flee and force you to get reinforcements, should I feel extremely honored and proud? The three of you are truly the pride of the Fang family\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.He was completely ignoring Fang Quan and glancing at the three Fang family youths with contempt.\u201cShut your mouth!\u201dFang Quan\u2019s eyes turned cold, then he moved forward with a stern shout, stomping his feet on the ground. Just when he was about to attack\u2026.\u201cStop!\u201dJust then, a cold and indifferent voice sounded.Whereupon a middle-aged man wearing a green robe could be seen walking over. The attendants present respectfully bowed to him, respectfully calling him \u2018Manager Ma\u2019.\u201cManager Ma.\u201dWhen he saw the middle-aged man, Fang Quan\u2019s face eased up and showed a little respect.\u201cJunior manager Fang, you should know our Agarwood Restaurant\u2019s rules. Any problems need to be settled outside. The Agarwood Restaurant is not a place where you can act as you please.\u201dThe middle-aged man said indifferently.\u201cOK.\u201dFang Quan took in a deep breath.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you outside the door of the restaurant. If you don\u2019t have the balls, you can stay here for the rest of your life!\u201dFang Quan\u2019s icy cold gaze briefly swept Duan Ling Tian before he left.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, once my Ke Er has finished eating, I will take my leave.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as if he did not care about what Fang Quan said.Instead, he looked at Ke Er with an intrigued expression.\u201cKe Er, why aren\u2019t you eating anymore? Yes, good girl, finish eating and don\u2019t be wasteful.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young girl with a face filled with tender affection.The middle-aged man glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian before turning around and leaving.The guests and attendants on the second floor, however, looked at Duan Ling Tian with gazes filled with pity\u2026.In their opinion, even if this youth\u2019s strength was above others of the same age, he was only a fifteen-year-old youth after all, and Fang Quan, on the other hand, was twenty years old and was a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist.It was impossible for the youth to be a match for Fang Quan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After finishing the last piece of dim sum, the young girl drank the last sip of soy-bean milk, then she looked at the youth with a delicate and touching expression.\u201cOK, let\u2019s head to the marketplace to get some things before heading home.\u201dThe youth faintly smiled as he picked up his sheathed sword from the table.The young girl meekly nodded, following behind the youth. Under the gazes of everyone present, they slowly walked down the second floor of the Agarwood Restaurant.\u201cHe\u2019s really unafraid of death.\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian leaving, Chen Mei Er brought along her servant girl and followed suit, leaving behind her leftovers.The remaining guests on the second floor stood as well and followed behind Chen Mei Er.Wanting to watch a scene was human nature.At the front door of the Agarwood Restaurant stood Fang Quan and the three Fang family youths who were fiercely glaring at the restaurant. They seemed to be waiting for something.\u201cIt\u2019s been so long and he still hasn\u2019t come out. He can\u2019t be planning to be a coward, right?\u201d\u201cCheh! Wasn\u2019t he acting all brave earlier? But he cowers the moment Brother Fang Quan gets here. What a pu**y!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201dBefore the third youth could even open his mouth and continue mocking Duan Ling Tian, they noticed the couple walking slowly out of the restaurant.Even though they were enemies, they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from sighing in their hearts. What a match made in heaven!Of course, their gaze towards the youth was filled with jealousy\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be daring enough to come out.\u201dFang Quan looked towards the youth as he sneered, speaking in a condescending manner.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare to come out? It\u2019s only a mad dog and three handicapped smaller mad dogs blocking my way.\u201dThe youth smiled indifferently with a carefree expression, seeming to look down upon Fang Quan.\u201cThis guy dares to enrage Fang Quan even in this situation. Isn\u2019t he afraid Fang Quan will really kill him?\u201dChen Mei Er stood at the front of the crowd that followed Duan Ling Tian out. Watching him provoke Fang Quan caused her expression to unconsciously freeze.The other people in the crowd had the same thoughts as Chen Mei Er, but their gazes were filled with pity.\u201cWhat a dumb little kid! I, Fang Quan, will tell you right here right now: you will certainly die today!\u201dAfter being thoroughly enraged by the youth, Fang Quan\u2019s eyes flashed coldly as he clenched his fists and the muscles on his body bulged slightly.As a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist, he was capable of exerting a thousand pounds of strength!\u201cThere are plenty of people who want me dead, but I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not capable of killing me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently while grasping his sword in one hand and holding Ke Er\u2019s hand in the other. He slowly walked out as if nothing was happening.\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian bringing the young girl into the battle, everyone was struck dumb with puzzled expressions.Don\u2019t tell me he thinks Fang Quan would show mercy due to the young girl\u2019s presence?In front of the window on the third floor of the Agarwood Restaurant.\u201cWhat an interesting kid. I wonder where he comes from. Not mentioning anything else, just his courage and composure are far superior to that of people of the same age.\u201dManager Ma looked at the youth with an intrigued expression.The coldness in Fang Quan\u2019s gaze increased and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.His thoughts were exactly similar to everyone else\u2019s. He assumed that Duan Ling Tian was bringing the young girl into the battle on purpose, hoping he would be scrupled and show mercy.But would he?The answer was no\u2026.\u201cDie!\u201dFang Quan abruptly shouted as he stomped his feet on the ground.He burst forth with the strength of a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist With the help of a thousand pounds of strength, he flew like a cannonball straight towards Duan Ling Tian\u2026His fists exploded towards Duan Ling Tian, going straight for Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest.Middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill, Raging Bull Fist!Hearing the wind shrieking by his ears, the sneer on Fang Quan\u2019s face grew wider. It was as if he could see Duan Ling Tian being blasted away and dying from severe injuries.In the instant that Fang Quan attacked, everyone in the crowd\u2019s hearts were in their mouths!The three Fang family youths had expressions filled with pleasure and satisfaction.You dared to touch us, so go die!\u201cThis guy\u2026\u201dChen Mei Er frowned.Although the youth was rude to her from beginning until the end.Somehow, in her heart, she didn\u2019t hate him one bit. Instead, she was curious about him and wanted to get to know him.\u201cStop!\u201dEventually, Chen Mei Er stepped forward, desiring to stop Fang Quan.But her reaction was still too late.Fang Quan\u2019s fists, which were just like cannonballs, were just about to strike Duan Ling Tian\u2026At this moment, even if Fang Quan wanted to stop, it was too late! Not to mention he had no intention of stopping.\u201cKe Er, relax your body!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth moved slightly as he warned the young girl, then his left hand embraced her slender waist and his body moved.Fully exhibiting the flexibility he had gained from cultivating the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form, he carried the young girl along as he dodged Fang Quan\u2019s fist strike!Fang Quan\u2019s fists brushed past Duan Ling Tian\u2019s clothes\u2026Whoosh.Clang!Practically in the same moment, the sound of a sword being drawn and returning to its sheath sounded!In the next moment.Everyone present clearly saw.The eyes of Fang Quan, whose body was being carried by inertia, abruptly dimmed. His hands tightly gripped his throat, but he was unable to stop the blood from spraying\u2026In the end, he could not hold on any longer, so his body crashed towards the ground, lifeless.Silence.The area outside of Agarwood Restaurant\u2019s main door was deathly silent.Everyone\u2019s gazes were on the lifeless Fang Quan\u2026The dignified Fang family medicine store\u2019s junior manager, a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist, died just like this?Moreover, the one who did it was obviously not even sixteen!Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!\u2026\u2026For a moment, the sound of people drawing in breaths of cold air sounded throughout the area around the Agarwood Restaurant\u2019s main door.The gazes of everyone present moved from Fang Quan\u2019s lifeless body to the youth that was gradually walking farther away.The youth embraced the young girl while holding the sheathed sword, leaving coolly\u2026Killing a man in ten steps, unstoppable for a thousand miles.[1]Suddenly, everyone heard the voice of the leaving youth.\u201cThree kids of the Fang family, if you still can\u2019t let it go, you can look for me at the Li family. Right, remember my name so you don\u2019t look for the wrong person. I\u2019m Duan Ling Tian!\u201dThe voice was dull, as if killing someone was nothing to him.\u201cI\u2019m Duan Ling Tian!\u201dThe youth\u2019s voice entered everyone\u2019s ears.It was not the first time they had heard this name.Half a month ago, this name spread across the entire Fresh Breeze Town.That disciple with another surname of the Li family was called Duan Ling Tian!\u201cSo he\u2019s Duan Ling Tian? The Duan Ling Tian that half a month ago declared that he would visit the Fang family and take the Fang family\u2019s Manager\u2019s, Fang Qiang\u2019s, life?\u201d\u201cIt should be him\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect him to be so formidable!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even see how he attacked when Fang Quan\u2019s throat had already been sliced open in a single strike. His speed is too fast!\u201d\u201cI noticed that his cultivation is only at the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage, but killing a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist was as easy as cutting grass to him.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd could not stop themselves from discussing. The tone of their voices were filled with fear.It appeared that the declaration that this disciple with another surname of the Li family made half a month ago was not him being arrogant and conceited, but he actually had the confidence!\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201d\u201cCarry Brother Quan back to the manager!\u201d\u201cWe have to get an explanation about this matter from the Li family!\u201dThey gnashed their teeth as they said this. The fear in the eyes of the three youths didn\u2019t dissipate for a very long time. Carrying Fang Quan\u2019s corpse, they headed towards the Fang family marketplace.\u201cDuan Ling Tian? So he is Duan Ling Tian?\u201dAfter Chen Mei Er recovered from the shock, a mischievous smile emerged on her face.As far as she was concerned, as long as Duan Ling Tian was a member of the Li family, she would eventually be able to see Duan Ling Tian again, and she would slowly get even with him.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go home!\u201dChen Mei Er said to the servant girl before walking with her towards the Chen family marketplace.The crowd surrounding the Agarwood Restaurant\u2019s main door gradually dispersed, but they never stopped their discussion.The topic of their discussions revolved around the other surnamed junior of the Li family, Duan Ling Tian.Before, they had heard of his name but had never seen him in person.But from this moment onwards, they had seen him in person, and even seen his skills!Relying on his fourth level Body Tempering cultivation, with a single sword strike, he killed the sixth level Body Tempering martial artist, Fang Quan; a truly astonishing feat!If it was just a rumor, they might not have believed it. But after seeing it with their own eyes, they couldn\u2019t help but believe.\u201cHe is the Li family\u2019s Duan Ling Tian?\u201dIn the third floor of the Agarwood Restaurant, Manager Ma\u2019s eyes flashed brightly.\u201cThat sword strike of his was unbelievably fast\u2026 By relying merely on his fourth level Body Tempering cultivation, he can already achieve such a speed. If he can step into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage in the next two months, killing the Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang, won\u2019t be impossible anymore!\u201cBut to progress from the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage to the seventh level in only two months is practically an impossible feat. Although I\u2019ve only met him once, I can tell that he isn\u2019t the sort of person who would seek his own doom. Since he dares to challenge the Fang family\u2019s Manager, it must be because he is confident! Now I\u2019m slightly looking forward to it\u2026Li family marketplace.Duan Ling spent some silver coins to buy materials from the Li family weapon store and the medicine store before returning to the Li family estate with Ke Er.After obtaining these materials, he felt much more at ease.\u201cFang Qiang, in three months, you will certainly die!\u201dA grim fire jumped about inside Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes as the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.\u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201dNoticing his sinister expression, Ke Er looked over with a worried expression.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Ke Er, what happened earlier in front of the Agarwood Restaurant didn\u2019t frighten you, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head slightly and kneaded the young girl\u2019s palm while he gently asked this.\u201cYoung master didn\u2019t allow Ke Er to look back, so Ke Er wasn\u2019t frightened.\u201dThe young girl shook her head.\u201cGood.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Although he wanted to temper Ke Er, he didn\u2019t plan to expose her to such a bloody scene straight away.Everything requires an order to proceed gradually.If he tried to temper her in one shot, it would unavoidably cause some complications.Even to the extent that it may cause Ke Er to suffer from trauma that would be difficult to treat.This was something that Duan Ling Tian was unwilling to let happen.[1]TL note: A line from a Chinese poem, meaning the person is so strong that he can kill a man in ten steps, and during his journey of a thousand miles, no one could stop him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You saw what happened. It wasn\u2019t my fault; if he didn\u2019t force me by saying he would kill me, I wouldn\u2019t have killed him.\u201dThe youth shook his head and laughed.As the formidable Weapon Specialist from his previous life, he had his own set of rules:If someone does not offend me, then I will not offend them!But if someone offends me, then I will return it tenfold, hundredfold, or even a thousand fold!The instant Fang Quan threatened to kill him, Duan Ling Tian saw Fang Quan as a dead man walking.\u201cTian, what did you do to the Fang family members this time?\u201dDuan Ling Tian and Ke Er had just entered the house when they saw Li Rou walking towards them.\u201cMom, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled faintly as he said this. He knew that his mother had overheard him speaking to Ke Er.\u201cTell me the truth!\u201dLi Rou frowned. Her clear eyes narrowed into the shape of a crescent moon; it was obvious that she was not easy to fool.\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing. It was just one of the Fang family members being naive, threatening to kill me\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian embarrassedly touched his nose as he slowly said this.\u201cWho is so brave to actually dare to threaten to kill my son?!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t even able to finish his sentence before Li Rou flew off the handle!Rage emerged from her eyes, and her voice sounded slightly icy cold\u2026\u201cI think he was the Fang family medicine store\u2019s junior manager, a guy called Fang Quan. But I\u2019ve already taken care of him, so you don\u2019t need to worry, mom.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\u201cFang Quan? Fang Tao\u2019s son?\u201dLi Rou frowned.She quickly remembered that this Fang Quan was the son of the Fang family medicine store\u2019s manager, Fang Tao.Although his natural talent in the Martial Dao was only average, he was still a young man barely over the age of twenty.For someone at his age to hold a grudge against her only fifteen year old son, and even threatening to kill her son\u2026For a time, an unending wave of rage arose in her heart!\u201cTian, he didn\u2019t injure you, right?\u201dLi Rou glanced at Duan Ling Tian from head to toe, asking with deep concern.The manner at which she spoke made it clear that if Duan Ling Tian was injured, she would go get even with Fang Quan.\u201cMom, there isn\u2019t even a scratch on me. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask Ke Er. He didn\u2019t even touch me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart felt warm as he shook his head.Li Rou looked towards Ke Er, who instantly started nodding like a chick pecking on grain.At the beginning, she too was worried that the young master might suffer a loss.But in the end, even though she didn\u2019t look back, she was faintly aware of what happened to the Fang family member.Now that she thought about it again, the young girl\u2019s delicate face turned slightly pale. She was obviously frightened.\u201cKr Er, why does your face look so bad. Are you sick?\u201dLi Rou asked with a concerned expression when she noticed the young girl\u2019s pale face.She had long ago regarded Ke Er as her future daughter in law, so her concern for Ke Er was no less than that of her son.The young girl lightly shook her head, her expression easing up.\u201cCome, I\u2019ll carry you back to your room to rest\u2026\u201dSeeing his mom carry the young girl to her room, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed.In his opinion, Ke Er having this sort of reaction was normal. After all, she wasn\u2019t the same as him.To him, someone who had once lived a life filled with bloodshed and battle, murder was an ordinary occurrence; the feeling of taking another\u2019s life was something he had long ago become numb towards.After putting the materials in his room, Duan Ling Tian greeted his mother before going out.He went to see Grand Elder Li Huo.\u201cKid, I don\u2019t think now is the time of our appointment. What did you come see me for?\u201dLi Huo\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at Duan Ling Tian while he asked this.\u201cGrand Elder, I\u2019ve come to request your help in refining some medicinal pills.\u201dDuan Ling Tian stated his purpose.\u201cOh? What medicinal pill do you want?Li Huo laughed.\u201cThe Thunder Flame Pill.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze became focused as he slowly said this.\u201cKid, although the Thunder Flame Pill is a type of Body Tempering stage medicinal pill, it\u2019s much more valuable and rare. Moreover, I\u2019ve only ever heard of the Thunder Flame Pill, and I don\u2019t have the method to refine one.\u201dLi Huo\u2019s expression dulled for a moment before he started laughing bitterly.\u201cGrand Elder, if I give you the medicinal formula, would you be able to refine one?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked with a smile. He made nothing of what Li Huo had said.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re willing to give me the Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal formula?\u201dLu Huo\u2019s breathing started becoming short and rapid.As an alchemist, what he desired the most was the chance to refine various types of medicinal pills so he could gain experience and thus, advance his skill in medicine refinement.Even though he was a grade nine Alchemist, the number of medicinal pills he was capable of refining was extremely limited\u2026\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cYour teacher is allowing you to pass down the Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal formula to me?\u201dLi Huo took a deep breath as he asked this.\u201cMy teacher said that all of the medicinal formulas that he passed down to me are mine and that I can do as I please with them. Moreover, the Thunder Flame Pill isn\u2019t really rare; there are quite a few alchemists around the Cloud Continent who know how to refine one.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.Not really rare?After hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, the corners of Li Huo\u2019s mouth twitched.Although quite a few alchemists knew how to refine the Thunder Flame Pill, which alchemist wasn\u2019t the type to cherish things of little value simply because it was their own?Even if they could write down the medicinal formula of the Thunder Flame Pill, they would still be unwilling to share it with others.Even in the larger cities outside of Fresh Breeze Town, the Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal formula was priceless.The Thunder Flame Pill is a medicinal pill exclusive to Body Tempering martial artists. Once consumed, the body will have to endure the pain of thunder and flames bursting forth within the body, thus stimulating the body\u2019s potential.If consumed together with a Body Tempering Pill, the speed of cultivation would even increase to twice the speed of only consuming Body Tempering Pills!\u201cKid, thank you.\u201dLi Huo abruptly stood up and bowed deeply towards Duan Ling Tian.To an alchemist, the medicinal formula to a rare medicinal pill was more important than their lives.\u201cGrand Elder, there\u2019s no need to act this way. I\u2019m only passing down the medicinal formula to you due to selfish reasons. I want to request your help in refining some Thunder Flame Pills. We are each taking what we need.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s sword-shaped eyebrows twitched as he slowly said this.\u201cYou can\u2019t think of it that way. Refining a Thunder Flame Pill will only consume a small amount of Origin Energy and vigor; my contribution is incomparable to yours.Li Huo shook his head.As far as he was concerned, the value of the Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal formula was too huge. If it could be used by the Li family disciples\u2026The Li family suppressing the Fang family and the Chen family could happen in the near future!\u201cIf Grand Elder still feels it difficult to accept my proposition, you can always give me some silver.\u201dDuan Ling Tian quirked his eyebrows and faintly smiled.\u201cKid, you really care for nothing but money. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll speak to the Patriarch about this matter. At that time, you\u2019ll get your share of silver.\u201dLi Huo jokingly scolded.He was puzzled in his heart. Why did this kid love money so much?If Duan Ling Tian knew of Li Huo\u2019s opinion of him, he would surely give him a disdainful look\u2026From the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, Duan Ling Tian knew that regardless of it being medicine refinement, weapon crafting, or inscriptions, they were professions that virtually burned through money.Since he was only at the Body Tempering stage now, the expenses weren\u2019t high for the moment.But once he breaks through to the Core Formation stage and develops his Origin Energy, he will need to start refining medicine and crafting weapons.At that time, the materials will cost hefty sums; they could even be considered a bottomless pits.Besides weapon crafting and medicine refinement, the inscriptions that require Origin Energy to assist in the engraving will also require various rare materials!After writing down the medicinal formula of the Thunder Flame Pill and passing it to Grand Elder Li Huo, Duan Ling Tian said his farewells and took his leave.On the way out, he didn\u2019t forget to remind Li Huo.\u201cGrand Elder, I\u2019ll be counting on you to get the materials for the Thunder Flame Pill. I\u2019ve been really poor recently, so I really can\u2019t afford those materials.\u201dDuan Ling Tian fled as soon as he finished speaking, only leaving his gradually receding figure to the stunned Li Huo.\u201cThis kid took a thousand silver from me yesterday, but he still cries poor. This kid isn\u2019t old, but he is so shameless!\u201dLi Huo grinned and jokingly scolded after Duan Ling Tian finally vanished from his sight.After leaving Grand Elders Li Huo\u2019s residence, Duan Ling Tian went straight back home. He closed himself off inside his room and arranged the materials he had bought with Ke Er earlier.Duan Ling Tian prepared these materials to conduct inscriptions.The \u2018Paralyzation Inscription\u2019 Duan Ling Tian used to defeat Li Jie was only effective on martial artists below the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, so using it on a martial artist above that level was no different than tickling them.This time Duan Ling Tian planned to inscribe a different inscription as a preventive measure.If he can\u2019t kill Fang Qiang in two and a half months by relying only on his own strength, then he will use this inscription as assistance to take Fang Qiang\u2019s life!\u201cFang Qiang, even if you\u2019re a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist, I will certainly kill you!\u201dRemembering what happened the day Fang Qian injured him in the Li family\u2019s audience hall, a surging rage arose inside Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest, and he was unable to subside it for a long time.He and Fang Qiang were like fire and ice, so as long as Fang Qiang was alive, his heart would never feel at ease.Just when Duan Ling Tian was about to conduct inscriptions.\u201cTian!\u201dLi Rou\u2019s hurried voice sounded from outside.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart jerked. He was faintly able to guess what happened.The corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.\u201cThe Fang family\u2019s response is really quite fast! But they still have the nerve to come here, so they must really have thick skin.\u201d\u201cMom, you\u2019re looking for me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian pushed open his door and walked out.Li Rou took a deep breath.Since the Fang family\u2019s Third Elder arrived and said that her son had killed Fang Quan, her mood started to become agitated and even now she still had not calmed down.Fang Quan was a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist.Killed by her son?Her son, Duan Ling Tian, who had only broken through to fourth level Body Tempering stage this morning.After a quick inquiry.Li Rou became aware of the sequence of events from Duan Ling Tian.Likewise, she was made aware of the circumstances at which Duan Ling Tian killed Fang Quan, unexpectedly only using a single sword strike\u2026A fourth level Body Tempering martial artist killing a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist.Slicing the throat open with a single sword strike!Li Rou deeply understood how fearsome her son\u2019s Sword Drawing Arts were.\u201cTian, why didn\u2019t you let mom know of such a huge matter?\u201dWith a slightly displeased expression, Li Rou stared angrily at the youth.\u201cMom, you didn\u2019t ask me. The Fang family members have come, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly.\u201cYes, the Fang family\u2019s Third Elder, Fang Xing, and the Fang family medicine store manager, Fang Tao, have come together. They are urging the Patriarch to hand you over to them\u2026 Tian, don\u2019t worry; since we are in the right, not to mention only two of them have come, even if the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi, comes in person, he can\u2019t do anything to you!\u201dLi Rou gave Duan Ling Tian a shot in the arm.But she quickly realized that Duan Ling Tian did not seem the least bit worried; he was even more composed than her.She seemed to have thought of something, so her willow shaped eyebrows frowned and her heart started.\u201cThis should be the first time Tian has killed someone, but why do you seem so tranquil?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why doesn\u2019t mom know about it?\u201dLi Rou\u2018s willow-leaf-shaped eyebrows raised up as she asked curiously.\u201cMom, prior to today, I\u2019ve killed people in my dreams\u2026 and quite a few at that. It was part of the training regimen the old man in my dreams prepared for me. I can still remember when I first killed a man in my dreams; I felt extremely scared and even vomited.\u201dExplained Duan Ling Tian.A dream again!Although Li Rou didn\u2019t quite believe what her son said, she had no idea how to explain the changes that occurred to him.\u201cIt looks like the old man in your dreams really looks after you. Tian, let\u2019s go to the audience hall. The Patriarch is waiting\u2026\u201dAfter taking a deep breath, Li Rou stopped trying to get to the bottom of it.Duan Ling Tian nodded and followed his mother to the Li family's audience hall.\u201cBrother Nan Feng, I hope you\u2019ve been well!\u201dThe moment they approached the Li family's audience hall, they heard a hearty laughter coming from within.\u201cChen Li? What\u2019s he doing here?\u201dAfter hearing the voice, Li Rou felt it to be quite odd.But she soon noticed the bitter smile on the corners of her son\u2019s mouth.\u201cTian, don\u2019t tell me you offended the Chen family as well?\u201dLi Rou\u2019s heart skipped a beat.The Chen family\u2019s Patriarch paying a visit at this time made her suspect him.Duan Ling Tian embarrassedly told her about the conflict between him and the Chen family\u2019s eldest daughter, Chen Mei Er.\u201cSo it turns out to be just a trivial matter\u2026 There\u2019s no way Chen Li would pay a visit just to accuse you of such a trivial matter, so he must have come on some other business.\u201dLi Rou heaved a sigh of relief. She was worried that her son had actually killed one of the Chen family\u2019s members as well.Duan Ling Tian walked slowly behind Li Rou and entered the audience hall, whereupon he noticed a slightly strange atmosphere.\u201cHumph!\u201dTwo middle-aged men brushed past Duan Ling Tian, leaving the Li family's audience hall.Their fierce gazes seemed as if they were trying to tear Duan Ling Tian apart.\u201cPatriarch\u2026 this?\u201dLi Rou looked towards the Patriarch Li Nan Feng with a puzzled expression.Before she went to get her son, the two Fang family members wished that Duan Ling Tian would pay with his life.But when her son finally arrived, they actually left without saying a word.\u201cThis is all thanks to Mei Er. She guessed that the Fang family would visit our Li family to denounce Duan Ling Tian\u2019s crimes, so the Chen family\u2019s Patriarch brought her here to bear witness. She was there when Duan Ling Tian killed Fang Quan. Since it was Fang Quan who provoked him, Duan Ling Tian is not guilty.\u201dLi Nan Feng laughed loudly.\u201cThank you, Miss Mei Er.\u201dLi Rou looked towards the young girl, lightly smiling.\u201cTian, it\u2019s all thanks to Miss Mei Er this time. Why aren\u2019t you thanking her?\u201dLi Rou looked towards Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered as he glanced at Chen Mei Er with an intrigued expression, wondering why she helped him.\u201cThank you, Miss Mei Er.\u201dSince it was his mother who asked, even though he didn\u2019t want to, he had to at least keep up appearances.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dChen Mei Er blinked her clear eyes as she smiled beautifully like a flower.Compared to the unruly eldest daughter in the Agarwood Restaurant earlier, she was like a completely different person now.\u201cMei Er is so cultured. Patriarch Chen, you\u2019ve given her such a good upbringing.\u201dLi Nan Feng faintly smiled towards the middle-aged man beside Chen Mei Er.The middle-aged man was indeed the Chen family\u2019s Patriarch, Chen Li.Chen Li shook his head as he smiled, his gaze falling on Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHow could my daughter compare to your Li family\u2019s Duan Ling Tian, who has such formidable strength at such a young age? Once he grows up, I\u2019m afraid he will have no equal in the entire Fresh Breeze Town\u2026\u201d\u201cNinth Elder, may I ask if your son has any marriage arrangements?\u201dSubsequently, Chen Li looked towards Li Rou.The moment Chen Li finished his sentence, Li Rou, Duan Ling Tian, and Li Nan Feng were all struck dumb.The three of them subconsciously looked towards Chen Mei Er. Upon noticing her blushing cheeks, they instantly guessed Chen Li\u2019s intentions.\u201cChen Mei Er couldn\u2019t have fallen for me, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart stirred. He could not believe what was happening.This morning in Agarwood Restaurant, he and Chen Mei Er were like fire and ice. Even if women were capricious, they shouldn\u2019t be capricious to this extent\u2026At this moment, Duan Ling Tian noticed his mother gazing at him with a mischievous expression.But at the same time, her gaze felt as if she was inquiring his opinion.With a helpless expression, Duan Ling Tian shook his head.\u201cPatriarch Chen, unfortunately, I just decided upon a wife for my son a short while ago.\u201dLi Rou looked at Chen Li with an apologetic expression.\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. Patriarch Li, Ninth Elder, little brother Duan\u2026 My daughter and I have fulfilled the purpose of our trip, so we will be taking our leave now.\u201dChen Li nodded as he left with Chen Mei Er.When Chen Mei Er was leaving, she glanced at Duan Ling Tian with a bitter gaze. Her face was gloomy\u2026\u201cNinth Elder, why didn\u2019t I know about you deciding upon a wife for Duan Ling Tian?\u201dLi Nan Feng looked towards Li Rou with a puzzled expression.\u201cPatriarch, Ke Er is the wife I decided upon.\u201dA heartfelt smile appeared on Li Rou\u2019s face when she spoke of Ke Er.What she said caused Duan Ling Tian to be astounded.In his heart he thought,\u201cIf Ke Er heard what mom said, she would certainly be too embarrassed to show her face.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. They are indeed a perfect match.\u201dLi Nan Feng smiled as he nodded.\u201cNinth Elder, Grand Elder wanted to see me before the two Fang family members arrived. I\u2019ve already delayed for some time, so I will be taking my leave.\u201dSeeing Li Nan Feng taking his leave, a smile emerged on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face.He knew the reason that Grand Elder wanted to see the Patriarch.\u201cI hope the Patriarch isn\u2019t too stingy\u2026 Even though the Thunder Flame Pill is only a low ranked pill, its importance to the Li family is extraordinary.\u201dIf the children of all the Li family elders were to consume the Thunder Flame Pill and then absorb the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, the speed of their cultivation would double!Of course, this was also the reason why Duan Ling Tian was willing to share the Thunder Flame Pill medicinal formula with Li Huo.He desperately needed the Thunder Flame Pills.With the help of the Thunder Flame Pills, stepping into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage within the next two and a half months wouldn\u2019t be impossible anymore.\u201cTian, why are you smiling? I\u2019m telling you right now: no matter what, you can\u2019t abandon Ke Er. Or else mom will never forgive you!\u201dLi Rou said to Duan Ling Tian seriously.\u201cMom, what are you talking about?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.What was she going on about?\u201cTian, if you go out in the next few months, remember to tell mom so I can go with you.\u201dLi Rou said.\u201cMom, are you worried that the Fang family members will attack me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian guessed.\u201cYes, neither Fang Tao nor Fang Xing are not good and honest people; I\u2019m worried that they would secretly plot against you.\u201d\u201cMom, Fang Quan is Fang Tao\u2019s son. Him seeking revenge against me was normal, but why would that Third Elder of the Fang family want to go against me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was puzzled.\u201cTian, Fang Xing and Fang Tao have a special relationship; he is Fang Tao\u2019s elder brother.\u201dLi Rou explained.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was enlightened.He didn\u2019t expect Fang Quan to be the nephew of the Fang family\u2019s Third Elder. It was no wonder they personally paid the Li family a visit to denounce his crimes.But the Fang family must have been aware that they were in the wrong, or else the one that came wouldn\u2019t just be the Fang family\u2019s Third Elder but the Patriarch too\u2026Ten days later, Grand Elder Li Huo called Duan Ling Tian over.Duan Ling Tian gave Li Huo his last massage session, helping him to fully treat his hidden injuries before putting away the first batch of Thunder Flame Pills that Li Huo refined.This batch of Thunder Flame Pills had a total of thirty pills.\u201cKid, this is the one thousand silver that I owe you. On top of that, here is another thirty thousand silver from the family. You can consider it payment for your Thunder Flame Pill medicinal formula.\u201dThe old man withdrew a large stack of silver bills and passed them to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cGrand Elder, thanks!\u201dDuan Ling Tian grabbed the silver bills from his hand; he wasn\u2019t one bit courteous.\u201cI noticed that your fleshly body has reached a threshold. It seems you should be breaking through to the fifth level of the Body Tempering stage soon, right? With your natural talent combined with the help of the Thunder Flame Pills, breaking through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage in the next two months shouldn\u2019t be impossible\u2026. At that time, relying upon your swift sword, if nothing unexpected happens, it should be enough for you to kill Fang Qiang!\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes narrowed as he slowly said this.\u201cGrand Elder, you\u2019re aware of what happened?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied.It looked like Grand Elder was aware of what happened half a month ago; he was aware of how he relied on his fourth level Body Tempering strength to kill Fang Quan, who was at the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage.\u201cThis matter isn\u2019t a secret in Fresh Breeze Town; I heard from the Patriarch half a month ago. Kid, I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d know how to conceal your strength so well\u2026 Looks like Li Jie being crippled by you wasn\u2019t simply his bad luck!\u201dThe old man glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI was just lucky.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly. After putting away the silver bills, he took his leave.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad his aspirations don\u2019t lie within Fresh Breeze Town\u2026 Or else it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for our Li family to unify the entire town.The old man sighed. His tone contained a hint of pity.Duan Ling Tian naturally didn\u2019t know how highly Grand Elder thought of him. He went straight home after leaving Grand Elder\u2019s residence.After preparing the bath barrel and some Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he took off his clothes.Then he consumed the Thunder Flame Pill.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian could clearly feel an aching pain throughout his entire body\u2026The aching pain grew stronger by the moment!Hiss hiss~~At this moment, Duan Ling Tian felt like he was being attacked by thunder and flames.The aching pain spread throughout his entire body, causing him to be unable to stop himself from letting out a low \u201chumph\u201d sound\u2026Luckily, being a person of two lifetimes, his will was incredibly tenacious, so he easily endured the pain caused by the medicinal effects of the Thunder Flame Pill.Half an hour later, Duan Ling Tian noticed the aching pain in his body start to dissipate.He could clearly feel that all the pores in his body had opened up, greedily absorbing the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid within the bath barrel.The absorption speed was a whole two times faster than the previous speed\u2026Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Spirit Serpent Form!As Duan Ling Tian greedily absorbed the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he started to circulate his cultivation method.The lifeblood within his body continuously strengthened. His body was undergoing a metamorphosis at an alarming speed, meaning he was quickly breaking through the threshold.Fifth level of the Body Tempering stage!Duan Ling Tian opened his eyes. His expression was filled with intense joy.As expected, the Thunder Flame Pill didn\u2019t disappoint him.Duan Ling Tian would usually need half a day to completely absorb a portion of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.This was his limit.But thanks to the Thunder Flame Pill.With merely an afternoon\u2019s worth of time, he continuously absorbed two portions of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid and immediately broke through!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You better not tell me you spent the thirty thousand silver I gave you yesterday.\u201dLi Huo\u2019s face had an expression of vigilance the moment he saw him.\u201cGrand Elder, I\u2019m not here to ask you for money\u2026 I actually want you to smelt this blade for me with your Pill Fire.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly.Then he withdrew the violet short sword from its sheathe.\u201cThis is a sword made from Violet Ore, right? Kid, if I use my Pill Fire to smelt Violet Ore, it would melt and be vaporized as it\u2019s only a type of common metal.\u201dLi Huo frowned.\u201cGrand Elder, are you really that confident? How about we make a bet?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled as he said this.Li Huo gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance. He knew that this kid wouldn\u2019t do something for naught, so he wouldn\u2019t be fooled by Duan Ling Tian.But it did, however, rouse his interest towards the sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands.Could it be that he misjudged it?Li Huo quickly took the violet short sword in his hands.His Origin Energy condensed into a milky white Pill Fire, covering the short sword\u2026After half an hour.It could clearly be seen that.More than half of the metal on the short sword had been vaporized, but the violet metal that remained instead changed into liquid form.No matter how hard Li Huo tried, it was virtually impossible to vaporize it with his Pill Fire.At this moment, Li Huo\u2019s face was drenched in sweat.He waved his hand to put out his Pill Fire.\u201cKid, is this a weapon crafting material?\u201dAfter all, Pill Fire was strong enough to be capable of vaporizing Fine Steel\u2026Thus, only a weapon crafting material would be able to withstand his Pill Fire and not be vaporized!\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly nodded.\u201cCan you tell me what material this is?\u201dLi Huo took in a deep breath as he asked this.\u201cViolet Meteorite.\u201dDuan Ling Tian did not conceal the truth.\u201cWhat?!\u201dLi Huo was shocked.Although he was only a grade nine Alchemist, he had heard of the material called Violet Meteorite, which was treasured by weapons craftsmen.\u201cKid, where did you get this sword?\u201dLi Huo asked before drawing in a deep breath.\u201cFrom the Li family weapon store\u2026 It cost me two hundred silver.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said with a painful expression.Two hundred silver coins?The corners of Li Huo\u2019s mouth twitched.Such a big piece of Violet Meteorite for only two hundred silver?If he were to let those weapon craftsmen know, they might even feel like committing suicide!Of course, Li Huo was aware that no ordinary person was capable of identifying unrefined Violet Meteorite.\u201cSo that means that this sword was actually forged from Violet Meteoric Iron?\u201dLi Huo inquired.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Grand Elder to know of Violet Meteoric Iron.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was astonished.\u201cI saw it in some ancient books. Violet Meteorite is usually hidden inside Violet Meteoric Iron, so it\u2019s extremely difficult to be identified\u2026 Kid, how did you identify it?\u201dLi Huo glanced deeply at the youth, as if trying to see through him.Unfortunately, he was bound to be disappointed.Duan Ling Tian smiled mysteriously, but didn\u2019t answer Li Huo.\u201cGrand Elder, I still have matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201dReceiving the Violet Meteorite from Li Huo, Duan Ling Tian immediately left.\u201cThis kid seems completely different from before, as if he\u2019s another person entirely. Hmm, it must be all thanks to his grade seven Alchemist teacher.\u201dGrand Elders murky eyes flashed with a bright light as he surmised this.Duan Ling Tian returned from Grand Elder\u2019s residence with the Violet Meteorite. He arrived at his home without disturbing Ke Er, who was cultivating in her room. He instead went to see his mother to get her to accompany him outside of the Li family estate.\u201cTian, you want to get a blacksmith to forge this metal into two swords?\u201dLooking at the violet-colored metal in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands, Li Rou\u2019s expression was filled with disbelief.In her opinion, the volume of this metal was only enough to forge a dagger, and a small one at that.\u201cWhat, mom, you don\u2019t believe me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.Li Rou shook her head.The pair of mother and son quickly arrived at the Li family\u2019s blacksmith store.\u201cNinth Elder.\u201dAn attendant greeted them as soon as they entered, bowing to Li Rou.\u201cWhere\u2019s your manager?\u201dLi Rou nodded and subsequently asked.\u201cHaha! Such a rare sight\u2026 Ninth Elder, do you need anything from my smithy?\u201dA middle-aged man walked out from inside the weapon store.The middle-aged man\u2019s laughter had a grand sound to it. He walked swiftly to stand in front of Duan Ling Tian and his mother.\u201cThis must be young master Ling Tian, right?\u201dThe middle-aged man glanced at Duan Ling Tian as he smiled lightly.\u201cTian, this is Manager Long of our Li family\u2019s smithy. The Fine Steel Swords sold in the weapon store are all his works.\u201dLi Rou said to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cManager Long!\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled lightly towards the middle-aged man.\u201cNinth Elder, you\u2019re treating me like a stranger. If you hadn\u2019t appealed to the Patriarch for me all those years ago, how could I possibly still remain in the Li family?\u201dThe middle-aged man said. He couldn\u2019t help himself from sighing as we took a trip down memory lane.\u201cLi Long, you don\u2019t have to mention what happened all those years ago. The reason I\u2019m here today is because my son needs your help to forge two swords.\u201dLi Rou shook her head.She look at Duan Ling Tian as she said this.\u201cTian, Manager Li is the best blacksmith in the entire Li family. The Fine Steel Swords he forges are famous throughout Fresh Breeze Town, and the Fine Steel Swords forged by the other two families can\u2019t even compare to his.Hearing what his mother said, Duan Ling Tian lightly nodded.\u201cYoung master Ling Tian, what sort of sword do you want to forge?\u201dLi Long asked respectfully.\u201cManage Long, I want you to forge two flexible swords from this piece of metal I have here. Make them as thin as you possibly can.\u201dDuan Ling Tian revealed the fist-sized piece of Violet Meteorite in his hand.\u201cFlexible sword? Young master Ling Tian, to forge a flexible sword, the material must have high levels of malleability. Forgive me, but I\u2019m unable to recognize the metal you\u2019re holding in your hand.\u201dLi Long\u2019s eyes flashed as he said slowly this.Li Rou\u2019s willow-leaf-shaped eyebrows slightly twitched and an expression of shock emerged on her beautiful face.She knew extremely well of Li Long\u2019s capabilities, but even he was incapable of identifying the material in her son\u2019s hands\u2026Obviously, it was no common metal.\u201cManager Long, you can go ahead and try forging it. Just make sure it comes out as thin as you can make it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.He must be kidding, right? In the entire Cloud Continent, there were hardly any metals that could compete in malleability against Violet Meteorite.The reason that Violet Meteorite was a weapon crafting material pursued by many weapons craftsmen was because of its malleability.\u201cOK, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201dLi Long nodded as he received the Violet Meteorite.Even he was interested in this piece of metal that he couldn\u2019t recognize.\u201cYoung master Ling Tian, follow me to my private forge.\u201dWith Li Long in the lead, Duan Ling Tian followed him into an inner chamber inside the Li family\u2019s smithy.The forge was fully equipped.On the weapons rack in the corner were many Fine Steel Swords that shone with a cold light.Under Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze, Li Long quickly took off his shirt, revealing his robust upper body.He tossed the Violet Meteorite onto the hearth of the forge, allowing the flames to heat the metal.Li Long bent down and started pulling on the bellows.Causing the fire to burn to an extreme temperature\u2026After an hour, the Violet Meteorite finally showed signs of melting.Li Long heaved a sigh of relief.But he was extremely shocked in his heart\u2026Even Fine Steel wouldn\u2019t need more than half an hour to become soft under this temperature.As far as he was concerned, this piece of metal was truly bizarre.Of course, it also brought him a new challenge, causing his mood to become agitated.After a moment, Li Long stood up.Grasping his hammer, the muscles and veins in his arms bulged.Clang!His hammer descended, furiously hammering on the softened Violet Meteorite.Instantly, the Violet Meteorite changed into a pile of \u2018mud\u2019.\u201cWhat good malleability!\u201dLi Long couldn\u2019t stop himself from exclaiming after seeing this.\u201cYoung master Ling Tian, forging two swords will not be a problem!\u201dLi Long looked towards the nearby youth as he lightly smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll be troubling Manager Long.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Clang!Clang!\u2026\u2026The hammer in Li Huo\u2019s hand descended time after time, quickly dividing the Violent Meteorite into two.The shape of two swords slowly formed.Duan Ling Tian, who was watching from the corner, had a gaze of admiration when he looked at Li Long.When forging a weapon, no matter if was it pulling on the bellows to control the temperature or to temper the metal by hammering, Manager Long did it all by himself.Based entirely on this fact, it would be easy to conclude that he was an expert in forging.Maybe it was because of this that he was able to produce the best Fine Steel Swords in Fresh Breeze Town.Two hours later, Li Long completed the final step in the forging process, and the two flexible swords finally took their final forms.Through the flames, two swords could be seen. Their bodies were glittering and translucent, thin as a cicada\u2019s wings.Shiing~Li Long lifted his hand and withdrew a Fine Steel Sword from the weapons rack.He swung the flexible sword to meet the Fine Steel Sword head on\u2026Ka!The Fine Steel Sword split with a sound. It was like paper to the flexible blade.\u201cWhat a sword!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze shone.The level of Li Long\u2019s forging skill caused him to be lost in amazement.Besides the lack of ability to amplify the power of attacks, the other characteristics of these two swords were comparable to that of something made by a grade nine Weapons Craftsmen.\u201cYoung master Ling Tian, thank you.\u201dLi Long respectfully bowed to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cManager Li, why are you acting this way?\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly bowed in response.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that young master Ling Tian allowed me to forge such a rare metal. Until I have the chance to forge an even better material, these two swords will be my, Li Long\u2019s, greatest masterpieces!\u201dLi Long said excitedly.Every blacksmith hoped that the weapon forged by them would be the best weapon.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian swung the flexible sword made of Violet Meteorite like a gust of wind.The weight of the flexible sword could be totally ignored, allowing him to execute Sword Drawing Arts with more ease.A satisfied smile crept up on his face.With this Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword, his strength would once again go up another level.\u201cManager Long, do you have leather sword sheaths here? The type that can be used as a belt.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked toward Li Long as he asked.\u201cYoung master Ling Tian, if you need this type of sword sheathe, I will personally make a customized one for you.\u201dLi Long smiled.His mood was elated after he successfully forged two swords that exceeded his past standards.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be troubling Manager Long again.\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly expressed his gratitude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is much more powerful than common weapons!\u201cMom, Manager Li seems very respectful towards you. He even mentioned something about you helping him appeal to the Patriarch, or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in the Li family\u2026 What actually happened?\u201dIn the courtyard, Duan Ling Tian asked Li Rou as he slowly kneaded her shoulders.\u201cIt happened more than ten years ago. At that time, Li Long had a secret affair with the daughter of one of the elders, accidentally making her pregnant. You can imagine what the consequences were. He was violently beaten with sticks before being tossed out of the Li family estate\u2026 After that, the elder\u2019s daughter insisted upon giving birth to the child, causing the elder to literally die of anger.\u201d\u201cShe was a really pitiable person. Although she successfully gave birth to the child, she died soon after due to complications in childbirth. Seeing the child alone and uncared for, I appealed to the Patriarch to allow Li Long to return to the Li family.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s clear eyes seemed to fall into a trance as she slowly said this.After hearing what Li Rou said, Duan Ling Tian finally came to understand.Never would he have expected that Li Long had such a past.\u201cWhen I think about it now, if I didn\u2019t appeal to the Patriarch to allow him to return to the Li family, maybe he would have left Fresh Breeze Town long ago. Then our Li family would have really lost a rare talent.\u201dLi Rou laughed.Duan Ling Tian nodded.In this world, some things were really just so marvelous.\u201cOK, hurry up and go cultivate. With the help of the Thunder Flame Pills and the speed at which you have been progressing, you still have a good chance to break through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage in the next two months.\u201dLi Rou said to Duan Ling Tian, urging him to return to his room and cultivate.After witnessing the formidability of her son\u2019s Sword Drawing Arts.As far as she was concerned, so long as her son could break through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, he would not necessarily be unable to kill the Fang family\u2019s Manager.\u201cYes, madam!\u201dDuan Ling Tian instantly stood straight as a spear, giving his mother a military salute.Under Li Rou\u2019s stupefied gaze, he turned around and returned to his room.\u201cWhat was that movement Tian did?\u201dLi Rou had a puzzled expression.Maybe if she had the chance to take a tour of the Earth, she would realize that the movement Duan Ling Tian made earlier was a standard military salute.Time flies.In the blink of an eye, one and a half months passed by.CrackleAt dawn, the sound of bones rubbing together sounded from inside Duan Ling Tian\u2019s room.Subsequently, the room\u2019s door was shoved open and Duan Ling Tian slowly walked out, bathing in the sunlight.\u201cHalf a month earlier than expected.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curved into a smile as he lightly clenched his fists and felt the boundless power within his body.Thanks to the unending assistance of the Thunder Flame Pills and the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, Duan Ling Tian made it from the fifth level of the Body Tempering stage to the seventh level in only one and a half months\u2019 time!An ordinary seventh level Body Tempering martial artist would possess two thousand pounds of strength\u2026Whereas Duan Ling Tian, who cultivated the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, at the moment of progressing into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, his body\u2019s strongest explosive force had already passed the three thousand pound mark.Compared to the three hundred pounds of strength he had when he was at the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage, his power increased by a whole ten times!\u201cI still have a half month more, just enough time to cultivate the martial arts in the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form, Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!\u201dThinking up to this point, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone brightly.He immediately started to cultivate the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique in the courtyard\u2026After cultivating the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form until the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, the flexibility of his body was beyond imagination.Duan Ling Tian was absolutely sure that even the yoga masters with the best flexibility on Earth wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to his current flexibility.\u201cSou!\u201dDuan Ling Tian cultivated around the large tree at a corner of the courtyard. His whole body was like a Spirit Serpent, sticking to the tree trunk as he flashed around swiftly.In a few moments, he had already gone around the tree from top to bottom more than ten times.The Spirit Serpent Movement Technique is a pure movement technique martial skill that stresses upon the utmost usage of the cultivator\u2019s body\u2019s flexibility, while at the same time producing terribly frightening speeds!Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian, whose body fulfilled the flexibility requirements to cultivate the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, was able to cultivate it proficiently.An hour later, he finally grasped some of the quintessences of the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique.Of course, it was mostly due to the foundation from Form and Will Boxing that he achieved in his previous life, or else it would be impossible for him to grasp some of the quintessences of the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique in such a short amount of time.The more he trained, the more deeply absorbed he was.After an unknown amount of time, the clear and melodious sound of a door opening entered his ears. Only then did he stop his cultivation.\u201cMom!\u201dWhen he saw the beautiful woman that walked out, a light smile emerged on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face.He, who was an orphan in his previous life, truly cherished and enjoyed the motherly love Li Rou gave him\u2026 And he was deeply trapped within this feeling, unable to break free from its clutches.\u201cTian.\u201dLi Rou replied with a smile.But her smile quickly froze.\u201cTian, you\u2026 you broke through?\u201dLi Rou\u2019s voice trembled lightly.\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cGood, good.\u201dLi Rou was so excited that she was unable to control her tone.In these past few months, she was always worried about whether her son would be able to step into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage before the day of the battle.But now it seemed like she had overthought things.Her son didn\u2019t disappoint her, and he even completed his seventh level Body Tempering breakthrough half a month earlier\u2026\u201cTian, mom is very happy today. I\u2019ll go buy some things now and cook something good for you!\u201dLi Rou\u2019s beautiful face was glowing. She left as soon as she finished her sentence.Warmth aroused inside of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart. He could understand his mother\u2019s mood.A parent\u2019s love and devotion\u2026\u201cBoss, boss!\u201dJust when Duan Ling Tian was about to continue cultivating the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, a slightly hurried voice sounded from outside the courtyard.\u201cThis damn fatty is really thickheaded. He\u2019s back again\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned.He recognized the owner of the voice.In the past two months, the fatty had come more than ten times.Most of the time, taking into account the good relationship between Fifth Elder and his mother, Duan Ling Tian usually wouldn\u2019t give him attitude.But after giving this damn fatty an inch, he was trying to take a mile!After opening the unlocked door, he walked out of the courtyard.\u201cLi Xuan, how many times must I tell you, I won\u2019t take you as a lackey\u2026 If you continue to harass me, then I\u2019ll be forced to take this matter to your dad!\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards the little fatty and frowned.\u201cBoss, please don\u2019t! I came today because I really have an important matter to tell you. You\u2019re in trouble, big trouble.\u201dWhen he heard Duan Ling Tian say that he would complain about him to his dad, the fatty immediately got scared.\u201cWhat matter is it? Hurry up and tell me!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned slightly grim.As far as he was concerned, this damn fatty\u2019s filthy mouth couldn\u2019t utter anything decent.\u201cBoss, when I heard about this, the first thing I did was come to see you. I didn\u2019t even tell my dad. I\u2019m really loyal right?\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s fat face bulged out as he laughed.\u201cIf y ou don\u2019t tell me right away, then you don\u2019t have to anymore!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed. In front of this damn fatty, he didn\u2019t have any patience.\u201cPlease don\u2019t, boss. I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll tell you! This was something I heard by chance. Even in the Fang family, it\u2019s still a secret\u2026\u201dHis fat face trembled as he said this, then the little fatty took a deep breath.\u201cFang family?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows raised.\u201cBoss, I heard that the Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang, broke through to the Core Formation stage a few days ago\u2026 Why don\u2019t we ignore the agreement that\u2019s supposed to take place in half a month? You\u2019re only fifteen, so even if u go against an agreement, it\u2019s not really shameful!\u201dAfter finishing what he wanted to say in a single breath, the little fatty looked eagerly at Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face didn\u2019t change; it was as if he wasn\u2019t the least bit shocked.But his eyes had narrowed slightly, and a bright light flashed through them.The thing that he was worried about the most actually happened.Fang Qiang actually broke through at this critical juncture!The ninth level of the Body Tempering stage possesses ten thousand pounds of strength when the strength of the fleshly body is fully exerted. It is able to draw upon the force of heaven and earth to develop an ancient mammoth silhouette\u2026Whereas at the first level of the Core Formation stage, on top of the fleshly body\u2019s strength being equal to the strength of one ancient mammoth, the developed Origin Energy provides a martial artist with strength similar to another ancient mammoth!A first level Core Formation martial artist has a total of strength of two ancient mammoths when fully exerting his strength!As he drew in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian could feel the pressure. The happiness he felt when he broke through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage eased up.\u201cLi Xuan, it\u2019s enough that you told me about this. Don\u2019t tell any other person, do you understand?\u201dHe looked towards the little fatty as he coldly said this.\u201cI can\u2019t even tell my dad?\u201dThe little fatty asked naively.\u201cIs your dad not a person?\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the little fatty a stare, causing the little fatty to feel as if he was sitting on a bed a needles.\u201cBoss, that\u2026\u201dAbruptly, the little fatty looked eagerly at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cWhat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. This damn fatty was really annoying, but for the sake of sealing his lips, Duan Ling Tian had no choice but to endure.\u201cBoss, I need you to help me teach a lesson to Li Ming.\u201dThe little fatty rubbed his fat hands together while he laughed slyly.Duan Ling Tian thought for a second.He was remembering who Li Ming was\u2026Li Ming, the youngest son of the Second Elder.A famous genius in the Li family. His natural talent was not one bit lower than the Li Jie of the past.He was seventeen this year, and under the assistance of the Thunder Flame Pills and the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he stepped into the sixth level of the Body Tempering stage a few days ago.\u201cYou and Li Ming\u2019s conditions are the same, both not lacking Thunder Flame Pills and Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, so why don\u2019t you rely on your own strength to defeat him?\u201dSaid Duan Ling Tian angrily.In this sense, this damn fatty was not one bit similar to the Fifth Elder.\u201cI don\u2019t lack it\u2026 but the problem is that he\u2019s older than me by two years.\u201dThe little fatty looked at Duan Ling Tian with anticipation as he laughed maliciously.\u201cBoss, please help me. I was nearly kicked around like a ball last time, and he even insulted me saying I was a \u2018damn fat pig.\u2019 I must teach him a lesson and make him call me \u2018Brother Fatty\u2019 every time he sees me!\u201d\u201cBoss, you have to help me. If I get beaten up by him again, I\u2019m afraid I might forget what you said to me earlier\u2026\u201dNoticing that Duan Ling Tian was still thinking it over, the little fatty hurriedly struck while the iron was hot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His chubby face had a painful expression. \u201cBoss, this is the birthday present from my grandfather last year\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you exchanging with me or not? If you\u2019re not exchanging, then scram!\u201dDuan Ling Tian he shouted in a low voice. He then turned around like he was about leave.The little fatty was a shrewd person, so he instantly noticed the hidden clues. He hurriedly spread open his hands and moved to block Duan Ling Tian. He slyly smiled as he said, \u201cBoss, does the ring in your hand have some secrets?\u201dDuan Ling Tian responded, \u201cHmph, if you take this ring, defeating Li Ming will just be a matter of seconds. But since you\u2019re unwilling to give up the ring your grandfather gave you, then it doesn\u2019t matter anymore!\u201dDuan Ling Tian was about to return to the courtyard as soon as he finished speaking.\u201cBoss, I\u2019m in the wrong, I admit that I\u2019m in the wrong. Isn\u2019t that enough!\u201dThe little fatty became anxious. While quickly walking forward, he looked at Duan Ling Tian eagerly and said, \u201cBoss, this ring in your hand, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s inscribed with an inscription.\u201d\u201cYou even know about inscriptions?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly surprised. He didn\u2019t expect that Li Xuan would know about inscriptions.\u201cHehe.\u201dThe little fatty laughed complacently. \u201cWhen I was at my grandfather\u2019s house, I saw some records about inscriptions in an ancient book. Allegedly, inscriptions are typically inscribed on personal belongings and enable an individual to control unbelievable powers.\u201d\u201cFortune really does favor the fool.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head as he passed the bronze ring in his hand to the little fatty. \u201cTake it. If you\u2019re unwilling to give up the gold ring on your hand, once you\u2019ve used up the inscription on the bronze ring, return it to me.\u201dThe little fatty extended his chubby hand to receive the ring. His little eyes stared at it intensely before he exclaimed, \u201cBoss, I was just casually making a remark. Does this ring of yours really have an inscription on it?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201dDuan Ling Tian made a low hmph sound.The inscription on this ring was inscribed using the materials he had bought the other day.He originally intended to keep it just in case he needs to use it against the Fang family\u2019s Manager.But who could have known that Fang Qiang would break through at this critical juncture?This type of inscription was only effective against Body Tempering martial artists; it was useless against Core Formation martial artists!Therefore, he made use of the opportunity and gave it to the little fatty.With his current strength, he wouldn\u2019t need the power of inscriptions to defeat a Body Tempering martial artist.\u201cBoss, you\u2019re even acquainted with an Inscription Master?\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s small eyes started to glare brightly in a manner that seemed as if he would never be satisfied until he knew everything.\u201cEnough. Hurry up and scram! Remember what I said: if you dare to spread the word that Fang Qiang has broken through, especially if it spreads to my mother\u2026 I\u2019ll knead you into a ball and kick you around!\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked into the courtyard after giving the little fatty a stare.However, the little fatty followed him into the courtyard. \u201cBoss, boss!\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. \u201cWhat now?\u201dThe little fatty smiled embarrassedly. \u201cBoss, how do you activate the inscription on this ring?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you read an ancient book about inscriptions? What, you need me to teach you such a simple thing?\u201dDuan Ling Tian angrily gave the little fatty a disdainful gaze, then he taught him how to activate the inscription before kicking him out.After the little fatty left, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.Fang Qiang breaking through to the Core Formation stage was undoubtedly bad news to him.The inscription technique may be miraculous, but it also had its limits.The inscriptions that Duan Ling Tian was capable of inscribing at the moment were only effective against martial artist that had not developed their Origin Energy.Inscriptions that could affect Core Formation martial artists required the combination of Origin Energy with materials in order to be engraved successfully.He thought about asking his mother for help, but inscribing was an extensive and profound art. Someone who lacked the slightest knowledge of inscriptions would require years of bitter research into the Dao of inscription before being able to inscribe their first inscription successfully.The only reason he was able to inscribe inscriptions so easily was thanks to the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor that he possessed. When he inscribed an inscription, it was as if Rebirth Martial Emperor was doing it, so he didn\u2019t feel any pressure.\u201cLooks like if I want to kill Fang Qiang, I can\u2019t rely on any external forces; I can only rely on myself!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed as he returned to the courtyard.Maybe the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique will become a turning point for him!He didn\u2019t allow Li Xuan to spread the news that Fang Qiang had broken through to the Core Formation stage, because he didn\u2019t want his mother to know.He knew that the moment his mother found out about Fang Qiang breaking through, never in a million years would she allow him to pay the Fang family a visit half a month from now.Whereas the Fang family concealed this news because they were worried that he wouldn\u2019t dare pay them a visit once he heard of it.The Fang family was obviously trying to use this opportunity to get rid of him!\u201cFang family, you\u2019re really looking down on me!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light\u2026At the Li family Martial Arts Practice Hall, the little fatty Li Xuan had both his hands in his pockets. He was standing there putting on airs.His surroundings were filled with Li family disciples. Each one of them was looking at Li Xuan while pointing at him and discussing. \u201cIs he high? He actually dared to challenge Li Ming. Does he feel the pitiful state Li Ming left him in the last time wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe because he\u2019s covered in thick skin and flesh, he can\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d\u201cFifth Elder is handsome and unrestrained with an imposing appearance, but besides Li Xuan\u2019s eyebrows, there isn\u2019t a single part of him that\u2019s similar to Fifth Elder.\u201d\u201cEven if he does have a similar appearance, it\u2019s been blocked out by his fat.\u201d\u2026\u2026Many of the discussions were filled with ridicule. They felt like Li Xuan was overestimating himself.\u201cDamn fat pig, I heard that you want to challenge me\u201dAfter a short time, a youth walked in from afar and stopped in front of Li Xuan. His face had a mocking expression while looking at Li Xuan. He was looking down on him.He was Li Ming, the son of the Li family\u2019s Second Elder.\u201cLi Ming, let\u2019s settle the score between us today!\u201dThe little fatty shouted loudly, then all the fat on his entire body trembled as he flew out like a ball. His chubby fists blasted towards Li Ming.\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating yourself!\u201dLi Ming smiled in disdain. He didn\u2019t even bother to move; his fists struck out to intercept the little fatty.As far as he was concerned, as long as his fist strikes the little fatty, then the little fatty will be blasted away rolling like a ball.The surrounding Li family disciples had the exactly same thought.In their opinion, Li Xuan was far from being a match for Li Ming\u2026Ping!Their fists collided.But at the instant of collision, the little fatty\u2019s eyes narrowed into slits. He instantly activated the inscription on the ring on his pinky\u2026HisssssImmediately, Li Ming felt as if he was struck by lightning. His entire body was feeling powerless.Besides that, he felt an aching pain from being struck by thunder and flames throughout his entire body.This feeling was extremely familiar to him; it was exactly the same thing he always felt after consuming the Thunder Flame Pill.Before he could even begin wondering why the symptoms of Thunder Flame Pill consumption would arise at this moment, the powerless Li Ming was blasted backwards by Li Xuan\u2019s punch.Subsequently, Li Xuan followed up with another fist strike, hitting the side of Li Ming\u2019s face and knocking him down!Following that was a hurricane of attacks\u2026A completely one sided mauling!\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dThe surrounding Li family disciples\u2019 mouths gaped wide open.Some even ruthlessly pinched their thighs, which made them emit shrill cries before realizing it wasn\u2019t a dream.They were all dumbstruck.When did Li Xuan become so formidable?Didn\u2019t Li Ming just break through to the sixth level of the Body Tempering stage a few days ago?\u201cStop, stop it!\u201dWhen the aching pain in his body finally dissipated, Li Ming wanted to retaliate, but he felt pain in his muscles whenever he tried to slightly exert strength. He was obviously severely injured by Li Xuan.Forced by the circumstances, he hurriedly started to beg for mercy.\u201cWill you continue calling me damn fat pig?\u201dLi Xuan was merciless; even when his opponent was down, he stepped on Li Ming\u2019s thigh, causing Li Ming to scream in pain before putting his hand on his hips and mouthing off.\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t!\u201dLi Ming said, in a slightly hysterical tone.\u201cNext time you see me, call me Brother Fatty. Do you understand?\u201dThe little fatty gave him a fierce and malicious stare before threatening him.\u201cYes, Brother Fatty, Brother Fatty!\u201dLi Ming hurriedly said, afraid that if he was too slow, the little fatty\u2019s fist would once more descend upon him.A wise man doesn\u2019t fight when the odds are against him. Since his entire body was filled with injuries and he had no chance of defeating Li Xuan, he chose to endure!As far as he was concerned, once he recovers, he will be able to wash away the shame he endured today!Of course, he was puzzled in his heart as to why the symptoms of Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal properties taking effect spread throughout his body the moment he collided fists with Li Xuan.Could it be a side effect from Thunder Flame Pill consumption?\u201cI never noticed that you were such a contemptible wretch. Only obedient after taking a beating!\u201dAfter making a hmph sound, Li Xuan left Li Ming and left the Martial Arts Practice Hall under gazes of disbelief.After teaching Li Ming a lesson, Li Xuan\u2019s mood was elated. \u201cThe Thunder Flame Inscription boss gave me is really great. I bet Li Ming is still wondering why his body was suddenly affected by the symptoms of Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s medicinal properties taking effect\u2026 I bet he thinks it\u2019s the side effects of the Thunder Flame Pill, haha!\u201dIn the courtyard, a slim, graceful, and beautiful young girl with a Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in her hand was unceasingly drawing and sheathing her sword. She was cultivating the Drawing Sword Arts.Beside her was a handsome youth with delicate features. He was patiently explaining to her the minute details of the Sword Drawing Arts and answering all her questions like a tireless teacher.\u201cBoss, boss!\u201dSuddenly, the sound of someone calling out came from outside the courtyard, causing the youth to frown. \u201cThis damn fatty is such a nuisance! Ke Er, I\u2019m going out for a second. Cultivate by yourself for a while.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dThe young girl obediently nodded.The youth walked out of the courtyard with large strides. When he spotted the little fatty that was walking over, he frowned and asked, \u201cWhat now?\u201dThe little fatty laughed slyly, then he took off the bronze ring from his pinky as well as the gold ring on his thumb before passing them both to the youth. \u201cBoss, your ring\u2026\u201dThe youth didn\u2019t move to receive the rings but instead looked at the gold ring in the fatty\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201dThe fatty smiled embarrassedly. \u201cBoss, I brutally beat up Li Ming today, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come get even with me once he has recovered, so I\u2026I want to ask you to get that Inscription Master to inscribe a Thunder Flame Inscription for me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I still haven't even asked you for compensation. Do you know that just this Thunder Flame Inscription costs thirty silver worth of materials?!\"The inscription technique is an art that burned through money.Inscriptions like the Thunder Flame Inscription are still considered low grade inscriptions.Inscriptions that are of a slightly higher grade would easily cost thousands, ten thousand, or even more silver\u2026Duan Ling Tian originally expected the little fatty to back out after he heard of the expenses.After all, even the little fatty\u2019s dad, Fifth Elder Li Ting, only received not even twenty silver coins a month, so it would be impossible to allow him to pour money down the drain like this.Unexpectedly, after hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, the little fatty abruptly started laughing.He put his hand into his pocket and withdrew a stack of silver bills. Each of the bills was of the one hundred silver denomination. He passed them over to Duan Ling Tian. \u201cBoss, isn\u2019t it only silver? Anything that can be solved by silver is not a problem at all! There should be around seven or either hundred silver here; take it all and get that Inscription Master to make me some inscriptions.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was struck dumb.He was absolutely sure that the silver bills in the little fatty\u2019s hands were not from Fifth Elder Li Ting.Li Ting earned five hundred silver the other day by betting on him.But even then, Li Ting\u2019s entire net worth wasn\u2019t more than 1,500 hundred silver.Otherwise, during that time when he battled with Li Jie, Li Ting would have been able to use five hundred more silver to bet with Li Kun.Duan Ling Tian received the silver bills from the fatty and quickly weighed them before asking, \u201cLi Xuan, where did you get all this money from?\u201dThe little fatty smiled widely and his little eyes narrowed. \u201cMy grandfather gave it to me before I returned to the Li family estate. Boss, please don\u2019t tell my dad, or else I won\u2019t even be able to keep the balance of my money.\u201d\u201cBesides these silver bills, you still have more?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied and his eyes started to glow. He didn\u2019t expect the little fatty to be this loaded.\u201cHe he, I still have some.\u201dThe little fatty had an carefree expression on his face. \u201cMy grandfather told me that I can send him a letter whenever I\u2019ve used up all of this silver and he will send me more.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth twitched. It would seem that the little fatty\u2019s grandfather was no ordinary person, though he had never heard of him before.In the memories of the past Duan Ling Tian, he only knew that the little fatty\u2019s mother died of an illness around seven or eight years ago. After that, the little fatty went away with his grandfather.\u201cWith silver coins, anything can be discussed\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed and he started patting the little fatty on the shoulder. \u201cHow about this: I\u2019ll write down the materials needed for the Thunder Flame Inscription and you go buy them yourself. We\u2019ll consider the money here as my compensation. From now on, I will inscribe as many Thunder Flame Inscriptions as you can supply the materials for. What say you?\u201d\u201cBoss, you said that you will inscribe it for me\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me the Thunder Flame Inscription was inscribed by you?\u201dThe little fatty was dumbfounded when he understood the meaning behind what Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the nonsense? As long the inscriptions are good, why do you care about who inscribed them?\u201dDuan Ling Tian casually put away the silver bills in his pocket, turned around, and returned to the courtyard to write down the materials needed for the Thunder Flame Inscription.\u201cLook at the materials written on this list. Each set can be used to inscribe one Thunder Flame Inscription\u2026 Right, you have to prepare some accessories, and each accessory can only contain one inscription.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said as he passed the list over to the little fatty.\u201cOK.\u201dThe little fatty took the list as if it was a precious treasure, then he looked eagerly at Duan Ling Tian, hesitating to speak what was on his mind.\u201cIf you have something to say, then say it and scram!\u201dDuan Ling Tian said angrily.For the past few months, he\u2019d been totally annoyed by the little fatty.\u201cBoss, I\u2026 Can I learn the inscription technique from you?\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s chubby face trembled with an expression full of anticipation.Noticing Duan Ling Tian frowning, the little fatty hurriedly added, \u201cBoss, I can pay you tuition fees; I won\u2019t learn for free.\u201dTuition fees?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s frown eased up and his eyes shone brightly.What he lacked the most was money. Even though he had thirty thousand silver with him, he knew that the moment he stepped into the Core Formation stage, it wouldn\u2019t be very long before it would all be used up.No amount of silver would be sufficient for him, especially since he was capable in so many professions.He had medicine refining, weapon crafting, as well as inscriptions.\u201cOK, since you\u2019re so sincere, even though it\u2019s difficult, I will still take out half an hours\u2019 time to teach you. How much you can learn will be entirely up to you.\u201dOnly an idiot wouldn\u2019t take money that was sitting on the table.Duan Ling Tian patted the little fatty on his shoulder again and said, \u201cOut of respect for Fifth Elder, I\u2019ll only ask for one thousand silver coins a month. Any problems with that?\u201dAfter hearing what he said, the little fatty was dumbstruck.Noticing the little fatty\u2019s expression, Duan Ling Tian thought that he felt that it was too expensive, so he embarrassedly coughed as he slowly said, \u201cIf you think it\u2019s too expensive, we can still negotiate. Slightly-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so cheap! Boss, thank you.\u201dThe little fatty excitedly interrupted Duan Ling Tian.This caused Duan Ling Tian, who kept quiet, to feel regret at the same time. Did he really set the price too low?Seeing the little fatty holding the list in his hand and walking out, Duan Ling Tian stopped him and said, with a heavy expression, \u201cNo matter what, never let anyone know the fact that I know the inscription technique, or else you can forget about learning it from me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Boss, I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone even if they beat me to death!\u201dThe little fatty pledged sincerely, jubilantly walking out.Imagining how Li Ming would continuously be thwarted by him in the future, his heart was filled with excitement and joy.He decided that he would at least get another ten to twenty Thunder Flame Inscriptions to keep as backup\u2026\u201cI, Li Xuan, have such good foresight. Taking such a formidable person as my boss, not to mention his heaven defying strength, he even knows the inscription technique. I gained big time!\u201dThe little fatty muttered to himself in a low voice while excitedly walking home to get his money.He had already given all the money he had on him to Duan Ling Tian.After little fatty left, Duan Ling Tian returned to the courtyard and continued to stand behind Ke Er. Their bodies were close together as he guided her in the Sword Drawing Arts.After two months of cultivation, Ke Er had nearly grasped the quintessence of the Sword Drawing Arts. She was only lacking a little bit of practice.Smelling the delicate fragrance coming off the young girl\u2019s hair and feeling the warmth of her body, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze became slightly dazed. He took in a deep breath in enjoyment.\u201cWhat are the two of you doing?\u201dA voice that had a hint of laughter in it followed by the sound of footsteps abruptly came from behind them.When he heard the voice, Duan Ling Tian embarrassedly took a step back, distancing himself from the young girl.The young girl had an embarrassed expression. Her face was so red that it seemed like blood would drip out at any time. \u201cMadam!\u201dIt was exactly Li Rou who had just returned from the marketplace.\u201cKe Er, stop cultivating for a while and help me. I bought plenty of things today to nourish you both up.\u201dLi Rou shook the vegetable basket in her hand as she smiled\u201cYes.\u201dThe young girl hurriedly put away her sword.\u201cMom, do you need my help?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked with a smile on his face.\u201cGo away! Go and cultivate properly. Although you\u2019ve broken through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, Fang Qian is a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist; if he somehow has luck on his side and dodges your Sword Drawing Arts, then you\u2019ll be done for.\u201dLi Rou gave Duan Ling Tian a contemptuous glance, absolutely ignoring him.\u201cYoung Master, you broke through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage?\u201dThe young girl looked at Duan Ling Tian with a pleasantly surprised expression.Duan Ling Tian laughed loudly. \u201cMy Ke Er is already at the sixth level of the Body Tempering stage. If I hadn\u2019t broken through, then I would\u2019ve lost face.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s gaze dimmed as she slowly said, \u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ll try to cultivate slower.\u201dLi Rou smiled. \u201cKe Er, ignore him; just work hard and cultivate. We women need to be stronger than men so we can suppress them\u2026 If you don\u2019t want to be bullied by him in the future, then you have to hurry up and surpass him.\u201dAfter hearing what Li Rou said, the young girl blushed. She took the vegetable basket off Li Rou\u2019s hands before running into the kitchen, leaving the mother and son to look at her embarrassed figure.\u201cKid, don\u2019t get lazy!\u201dLi Rou gave Duan Ling Tian a stare before following Ke Er into the kitchen.Duan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled, continuing his cultivation.His flexible body seemed as if it had transformed into a spirit serpent as it flashed swiftly across the courtyard.Swift as wind and lightning, his speed grew faster by the moment\u2026The natural talent Ke Er revealed in the past two months amazed even Duan Ling Tian.Just like him, Ke Er\u2019s cultivation circumstances exceeded that of the Li family disciples.But Ke Er was a girl after all; having this level of natural talent was indeed rare.According to his mother, Ke Er\u2019s natural talent even exceeded hers.Nevertheless, Ke Er having such good natural talent and fast cultivation speeds made Duan Ling Tian happy.At least when he leaves Fresh Breeze Town to wander the world, he can bring Ke Er along.If he didn\u2019t have Ke Er by his side, he would feel unaccustomed.After a short while, the two beauties finished cooking a sumptuous feast with a strong aroma.The family sat down to enjoy the meal together. As they put food on each other\u2019s plates, the atmosphere was filled with happiness and warmth.At the same time, in the courtyard of Second Elder Li Sheng.Li Sheng stand at the door and looking at his son, Li Ming, who was lying there on a bed. His expression was filled with disappointment. \u201cLook at you. If it was Duan Ling Tian that did this to you, I wouldn\u2019t say a single word. But you actually got beaten up to this sorry state by Li Xuan. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed? I know I do!\u201d\u201cDad, I already told you eight hundred times: it was the side effects of the Thunder Flame Pill that abruptly affected me, or else I would have pummeled Li Xuan until he was unrecognizable!\u201dLi Ming sat up on the bed with his head resting against the wall. He had an expression of helplessness and he was unable to vindicate himself.\u201cLook at you, still looking for excuses. Your brother consumed the Thunder Flame Pill as well; why didn\u2019t I see him be affected by any side effects?\u201dLi Sheng shook his head. He obviously didn\u2019t believe Li Ming. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat him now, go cultivate hard and beat him later on. Stop trying to find excuses; that\u2019s what cowards do!\u201dLi Sheng turned around and left as soon as he finished.LI Ming lied there on the bed. Even slightly stretching his body made him feel pain. He gnashed his teeth as he fiercely said, \u201cDamn fatty, once I\u2019ve recovered, I will properly teach you a lesson! I don\u2019t believe your luck will always be that good.\u201dIn Li Ming\u2019s opinion, Li Xuan being able to defeat him was all thanks to good luck.If it wasn\u2019t for him being affected by the Thunder Flame Pill\u2019s side effects, it would be impossible for Li Xuan to defeat him.When he recalled how his father and brother didn\u2019t believe him, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they believe me? Didn\u2019t they even think about it? That damn fatty, how could he even be a match for me?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt it to be slightly too much.\u201cYes, Boss.\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s head nodded like a chick pecking on rice, subsequently asking, \u201cBoss, are there any problems?\u201d\u201cNo problems.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.He then said, \u201cI just want to tell you that you can\u2019t use the Thunder Flame Inscription on anyone besides Li Ming, or else it won\u2019t take long for everyone to realize that you used an inscription on him. If you only use it on Li Ming, even if it happens repeatedly, he will be unable to explain it because no one will believe him.\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201dThe little fatty hit himself on the head, then he regretfully said, \u201cI bet once I use the Thunder Flame Inscription on Li Ming a few times more, he won\u2019t dare to offend me again\u2026 Boss, won\u2019t the remaining materials go to waste?\u201dDuan Ling Tian indifferently said, \u201cKeep the remaining materials, you will need them. The first inscription I\u2019ll be teaching you is the Thunder Flame Inscription.\u201d\u201cThanks, Boss, thanks a lot.\u201dA wide smile burst forth on the little fatty\u2019s face.Suddenly, he noticed Duan Ling Tian opening his hand towards him. Feeling puzzled the fatty asked, \u201cBoss, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cTuition fee!\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the little fatty a stare as he said angrily this.\u201cYes, yes, I nearly forgot.\u201dThe little fatty laughed slyly as he reached into his pocket, withdrew a stack of silver bills, and passed them to Duan Ling Tian. \u201cBoss, I had it ready a long time ago. Here\u2019s a thousand silver. It\u2019s the tuition fee for the next month.\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and took it from him, then he nodded his head. \u201cStarting from tomorrow, I\u2019ll come find you at your place after lunch. For half an hour daily, I\u2019ll teach you to the best of my ability. What you can learn will be entirely up to you.\u201d\u201cThanks, Boss. Then I won\u2019t disturb you any longer.\u201dThe little fatty had a wide smile as he turned around and jubilantly left.After quickly weighing the thousand silver in bills in his hand, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up into a slight smile. \u201cEvery penny counts. I need to collect as much as I can, because in the future, no matter whether it\u2019s medicine refining, weapon crafting, or inscriptions, they are all bottomless pits\u2026\u201dStarting the following day, Duan Ling Tian would dedicate half an hour out of his schedule to go to Li Xuan\u2019s house after lunch.At the beginning, Fifth Elder Li Ting felt it to be odd.But after seeing his son and Duan Ling Tian becoming good friends, he was happy for it to happen.Although, in the past few days, he would always hear weird sounds coming from his son\u2019s room.\u201cClap!\u201dAbruptly, the noise sounded again\u2026Li Ting shook his head and walked out of the courtyard.In the room, the handsome youth with sword-shaped eyebrows and starry eyes slapped the little fatty on his head. \u201cHow can you be so stupid? I told you that Violet Gold Sand and Scorching Grass Powder can\u2019t be mixed directly, but you still can\u2019t remember!\u201d\u201cBoss, don\u2019t hit me anymore. If you continue, I\u2019ll become even more stupid.\u201dThe little fatty rubbed his head. His face had a wronged expression.\u201cWhy did I ever agree to teach you the inscription technique? You\u2019re a blockhead! I\u2019m telling you right now: if you don\u2019t achieve any improvement in this month, no matter how much silver you give me, I won\u2019t teach you anymore next month because I don\u2019t want to waste my time.\u201dThe youth had an expression of disappointment.The little fatty bitterly smiled. \u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll work hard and not let you down.\u201d\u201cI hope you can do as you say. Half an hour is up, so it\u2019s time for me to leave. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. I hope you can improve a little.\u201dWith a frown, the youth walked out of the room and left.Half a month later.Dawn, the Li family\u2019s Martial Arts Practice Hall was bustling with noise and excitement.The gathered Li family disciples were all youths and young girls.Their discussions all revolved around Second Elder\u2019s youngest son, Li Ming, and Fifth Elder\u2019s son, Li Xuan.\u201cThis time Li Ming took the initiative to challenge Li Xuan. Looks like he\u2019s finished recovering.\u201d\u201cLi Ming said that he only lost to Li Xuan because he was sick. I wonder if it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIf he loses to Li Xuan again, then it must be a lie.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think so too. He can\u2019t always be coincidentally sick, right?\u201d\u2026\u2026Li Ming had arrived long ago and was standing in the middle of the Martial Arts Practice Hall.As he heard the surrounding discussions, his face grew uglier by the moment.His father didn\u2019t allow him to spread the matter regarding the Thunder Flame Pill, so he could only use the excuse of being sick.But he didn\u2019t expect that so many people would doubt him.Did they really think he wasn\u2019t a match for Li Xuan?\u201cLi Xuan, this time I\u2019m going to make you lie on a bed for half a month too!\u201dLi Ming angrily said as he gnashed his teeth.\u201cLi Xuan has arrived!\u201dSuddenly, the youths and young girls surrounding the Martial Arts Practice Hall all turned around to look in the distance.In the distance, a perfect couple walked in front, while a slightly wretched little fatty followed behind them like a little lackey. The little lackey was exactly the main protagonist of today, Li Xuan.\u201cI heard Li Xuan acknowledged Duan Ling Tian as his boss.\u201d\u201cAcknowledging a disciple with another surname as his boss, such a disgrace to the Li family.\u201d\u201cSo what if he\u2019s a disciple with another surname? If you\u2019ve got the balls, repeat what you just said loudly. Do you dare? You don\u2019t dare, right? If you don\u2019t dare, then don\u2019t talk big!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even though Duan Ling Tian is a disciple with another surname, he brought honor to our Li family. The Fang family was put in embarrassing situations many times by him!\u201d\u201cThe three months period will be up tomorrow. I wonder if Duan Ling Tian will really pay a visit to the Fang family.\u201d\u2026\u2026As Duan Ling Tian held Ke Er\u2019s hand, he could hear the discussion about him from afar.Towards all of this, he just laughed it off.He then looked at the little fatty behind him. \u201cDon\u2019t injure him too severely today. Let him withdraw after he understands that he won\u2019t win, or else Second Elder will go argue with your dad even though he\u2019s extremely magnanimous. Don\u2019t make it difficult for your dad, do you understand?\u201dThe little fatty hurriedly nodded.In this world, the person he admired the most was Duan Ling Tian.When they noticed the three of them arriving, the Li family disciples opened up a path.Duan Ling Tian held Ke Er\u2019s hand as they stood in the front.The little fatty, on the other hand, walked out and entered the arena. He was grinning broadly as he looked towards Li Ming. \u201cLi Ming, have you recovered well? You recovered so quickly.\u201d\u201cLi Xuan, today I will wash away the shame you gave me half a month ago!\u201dLi Ming\u2019s face was bright red.The rage that he had suppressed for half a month was finally bursting forth\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my boss told me not to injure you so severely this time.\u201dLi Xuan laughed slyly. His expression seemed annoying and extremely despicable.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Ming\u2019s gaze turned cold, his legs, which had already been accumulating energy for some time, shook, and he flew out like a fierce tiger towards Li Xuan.The mastered middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill Fierce Tiger Fist was executed, blasting towards Li Xuan.\u201cFierce Tiger Fist?\u201dUpon seeing this scene, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.He remembered that Seventh Elder\u2019s youngest son, Li Xin, also used Fierce Tiger Fist.However, Li Xin\u2019s Fierce Tiger Fist was inferior to Li Ming\u2019s; they were on completely different levels.This was the difference between the initial stage and mastery.Martial skills were only able to exert their true might when cultivated to mastery.Li Xuan moved, directly moving to intercept the strike.He didn\u2019t even use any martial arts; he only casually struck out his fist towards Li Ming\u2019s fist.In an instant, the corners of his mouth curled up into a wicked smile and he activated the Thunder Flame Inscription\u2026Instantly, the scene from half a month ago appeared once again.Li Ming\u2019s whole body froze as if struck by lightning. The strength in his fists dissipated, only leaving behind a slight inertia. He was completely unable to stop Li Xuan.\u201cPing!\u201dLi Xuan\u2019s fist struck out and struck Li Ming down, putting him in such a painful state that he started sweating profusely.A flurry of fists and kicks followed that\u2026The Li family Martial Arts Practice Hall was deathly silent.To the people who saw their fight half a month ago, this scene was so similar\u2026Half a month ago, Li Ming was beaten up by Li Xuan in the same way.\u201cNo, impossible\u2026 How could this be possible?!\u201dAfter Li Xuan stopped, Li Ming noticed that the aching pain of thunder and flames striking his body had vanished.He seemed to be in a daze, unable to believe that what had happened was real.If half a month ago Li Xuan\u2019s luck was good, could it be that his luck was good again this time?How could there be such a coincidence?\u201cDon\u2019t offend me anymore from now on, or else I won\u2019t mind making you lie on a bed for half a month again.\u201dLi Xuan\u2019s chubby face trembled as he boasted. Under the revering gazes of the surrounding people, he returned to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side.Li Xuan had a flattering smile on his face; he seemed like a completely different person. \u201cBoss, I listened to you and showed mercy. This time he will be bedridden for a few days at most.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded indifferently.\u201cSister-in-law, I\u2019m formidable right?\u201dLi Xuan looked towards Ke Er as he smiled slyly.Hearing how Li Xuan addressed her, Ke Er\u2019s face instantly blushed.\u201cStop being complacent. With the assistance of Thunder Flame Pill and the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, you\u2019re only at the fifth level of the Body Tempering stage now. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave Li Xuan a disdainful glance.Since he was forced to tacitly approve of Li Xuan as his lackey, he added materials into the fatty\u2019s Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, changing it into the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.Of course, this was a secret between him and Li Xuan; even Fifth Elder Li Ting didn\u2019t know.Only then did Li Xuan find out that the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was actually made by his boss, and this made him start admiring Duan Ling Tian from the bottom of his heart.Li Xuan embarrassedly scratched the back of his head while laughing bitterly. \u201cBoss, do you think everyone is abnormal like you and Sister-in-law\u2026\u201dYesterday, Ke Er\u2019s cultivation followed behind Duan Ling Tian\u2019s; she stepped into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, causing Li Xuan to be speechless. He had no choice but to admire them.\u201cScram. You\u2019re the abnormal one.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the little fatty a stare. While holding Ke Er\u2019s hand, he turned around and walked away.As the crowd automatically opened up a path for them, all of the gazes that gathered on him were filled with respect.The Duan Ling Tian of four months ago was considered to be someone that everyone looked down upon.But now, unknowingly, Duan Ling Tian had become someone that they could only look up to\u2026Some of them even regretted not getting on good terms with him when he was still weak.If they had, they would be able to follow beside him like Li Xuan. How prestigious!\u201cBoss, wait for me!\u201dDragging along his body that was covered in fat, Li Xuan followed along jubilantly.When the shadow of their figures disappeared from everyone\u2019s sight, only then did everyone look towards the person lying in the middle of the arena. Li Ming, who had a stupefied expression, was looking up towards the sky. The crowd started mocking him. \u201cIs Li Ming going to say he lost again because he got sick again?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, when he said he was sick last month, it was totally an excuse. Look now, he disgraced himself!\u201d\u201cSuch a disgrace!\u201d\u2026\u2026The corners of Li Ming\u2019s mouth emitted a helpless and bitter laugh as he heard the ridicule that came from the surrounding Li family disciples.He could not understand why such a bizarre thing would happen to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you really going?\u201dOn the way back from the Martial Arts Practice Hall, the little fatty had a serious expression as he looked towards the youth beside him.The youth smiled indifferently. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going!\u201dFor over twenty years in his past life, he always kept his promises; he never had the habit of taking back anything he said.This was one of his rules when he dealt with his affairs.If he changed it, then he wouldn\u2019t be the Ling Tian whose name once shook the planet Earth and its various countries.The little fatty was silent for a bit. After a short moment he asked, \u201cBoss, are you confident?\u201dThe youth shrugged his shoulders. The corners of his mouth contained a smile as he answered, \u201cDo you want the truth or a lie?\u201d\u201cOf course I want the truth!\u201dThe little fatty said in all seriousness.\u201cI\u2019m not a hundred percent confident.\u201dThe youth\u2019s pupils flickered as he lightly shook his head.\u201cBoss, if you\u2019re not confident, then don\u2019t go tomorrow\u2026 You\u2019re only fifteen, the same age as Fang Qian\u2019s son. If you back out of the fight with Fang Qiang, no one would really ridicule you.\u201dAn expression of worry emerged on the little fatty\u2019s face as he said this sincerely.\u201cLi Xuan.\u201dThe youth abruptly said.\u201cYes, Boss?\u201dThe little fatty hurriedly replied.\u201cRemember this: as a man, you must be responsible. Once you\u2019ve promised something, there is no reason for you to break it. If I don\u2019t go, I would be going against my heart, and I might end up stuck in this pit for the rest of my lifetime because I was a coward and I was scared\u2026 So, even if I don\u2019t have a hundred percent confidence, I will still go!\u201dThe youth had a serious expression as he slowly said this.The young girl beside the youth had eyes that were clear like water as she looked at him sentimentally.She noticed that at this moment, there was an indescribable charisma emanating from the youth; it was touching the strings in the deepest part of her heart.It caused her to be deeply trapped within the grasps of his charismatic persona and she was unable to break free from the cage that it imposed onto her.\u201cBoss, I can\u2019t defeat you in an argument; everything you say always sounds logical.\u201dThe little fatty had a bitter smile, \u201cBut just this once, you must listen to me: please don\u2019t act arbitrarily! It\u2019s not as if you don\u2019t know that Fang Qiang is not at the Body\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is all this nonsense coming from? You should first take care of yourself; you don\u2019t have to bother about my business!\u201dThe youth cut the fatty off. His sword-shaped eyebrows slightly twitched as he shot the little fatty a glare.This guy is a real bigmouth.Only now did the little fatty realize that young girl was present. He embarrassedly smiled at her.After driving the little fatty away, the youth brought the young girl back to their home\u2019s courtyard.At this moment, the young girl\u2019s immature and delicate face had a hint of worry. Her warm and gentle gaze fell upon the youth as she asked, \u201cYoung Master, do you really not have confidence?\u201dThe youth lightly smiled, gently touching the young girl\u2019s cheek, which was smooth as jade. \u201cSilly girl, I only said that I don\u2019t have a hundred percent confidence! Don\u2019t worry, no matter what, nothing will happen to me. Even if I can\u2019t defeat him, I will still come out in one piece. I\u2019m unwilling to leave my Ke Er, after all.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s willow-shaped eyebrows twitched and her clear eyes showed signs of tearing up. She flew into the youth\u2019s embrace and with a voice that slightly sounded like she was in tears, she said, \u201cYoung Master, if anything happens to you\u2026 Ke Er\u2026 Ke Er will not live on alone.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s words were like heavy hammers striking Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart. His heart could not help but shiver in fear\u2026Because he had experienced two lifetimes, he was able to tell that what she said was true without the slightest bit of falseness!In this moment, the strong-willed Duan Ling Tian, who would bleed but never cry, actually could not stop his eyes from becoming slightly wet.As his hands tightly embraced the young girl, he gently said, \u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t you believe me?\u201dThe young girl nodded like a weeping beauty. \u201cKe Er is scared\u2026 Scared that Young Master will leave Ke Er. If Young Master isn\u2019t here anymore, Ke Er\u2019s life will have no meaning.\u201dSince the time Duan Ling Tian brought her back home and took care of her like family, she had already made a promise in her heart.This lifetime, she lived it only for the Young Master.Even if the Young Master marries and settles down one day and has his own wife and kids, she would still silently be by the Young Master\u2019s side, willing to be a servant or slave, serving him until she was old.Until the day she takes in her last breath of air\u2026Her life would be for this man, and she would live it without any regrets.\u201cAlright, look at you. You look like a little panda.\u201dHelping the young girl wipe her tears, Duan Ling Tian smiled lightly as he said, \u201cIf my mom comes home and sees you like this, she will surely think I bullied you. It\u2019s not as if you don\u2019t know that in her heart, since you\u2019re her soon-to-be daughter in law, you have a higher status than me, her son.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re so bad, making fun of Ke Er again.\u201dThe young girl embarrassedly left the youth\u2019s embrace, ran into her room, and closed the door behind her.\u201cThat girl is feeling shy.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled, then his pupils emitted a never-before-seen staunchness.For Ke Er, for his mother, and for himself, he would never let anything happen to himself.\u201cFang Qiang, you will certainly die!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils flickered with a cold light, emitting an unending coldness.Li family estate, Fifth Elder Li Ting\u2019s residence\u2019s courtyard.Li Ting entered his house with a weird expression. When he noticed his son, who was sitting there in a daze, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from jokingly scolding him. \u201cHow did you do it, kid? Li Ming actually fell twice by your hands.\u201dHe was aware that Li Ming was injured by his son half a month ago, and he was curious about how it happened.When he went to apologize to the Second Elder, he heard Li Ming shouting, saying something about the side-effects of the Thunder Flame Pill abruptly arising.He, who was absolutely clear of his son\u2019s capabilities, naturally believed it to be true.But this time Li Ming took the initiative to challenge his son and actually got injured by his son again, causing him to feel astounded.He had just returned from Second Elder\u2019s residence. In the end, Li Ming once again said that it was the side-effects of the Thunder Flame Pill again and got scolded by Second Elder\u2026On the way home, the more he thought about it, the more he felt like something was wrong.Although his son being able to consecutively defeat Li Ming brought honor to him, he had a feeling that this matter wasn\u2019t as simple as how it seemed on the surface.\u201cXuan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe quickly noticed that his son had a troubled expression, completely different from the complacent him back when he defeated Li Ming for this first time half a month ago.Why is he so weird today?Shouldn\u2019t he be happy that he defeated Li Ming?Li Ting couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking, \u201cXuan, do you have a problem in your mind? Why do you keep frowning?\u201dWhen Li Xuan came back to his senses, he gritted his teeth as if he had finally made a huge decision, then he lifted up his head to look towards Li Ting before saying, with a serious expression, \u201cDad, I have something I want to tell you\u2026 But, you can\u2019t let Ninth Elder know about this, or else Boss will surely not acknowledge me as a brother anymore!\u201dLi Ting frowned. \u201cWhat is it? Tell me!\u201dLi Xuan hurriedly told him about what he overheard from the Fang family half a month ago. After laughing bitterly, he said, \u201cBoss didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone, so I kept it a secret all this time, but Boss will be going to the Fang family tomorrow. Although he has already broken through to the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, how could he possibly be a match for Fang Qiang, who has stepped into the Core Formation stage?!\u201d\u201cFang Qiang is at the Core Formation stage?\u201dWhen he heard his son\u2019s story, Li Ting\u2019s face changed greatly as he loudly exclaimed, \u201cKid, you even dared to conceal such an important matter? You really are extremely audacious! After I tell the Patriarch, I\u2019ll come home and teach you a lesson.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Li Ting made haste to see the Patriarch.After his dad left, Li Xuan lowered his chubby head and muttered to himself, \u201cBoss, don\u2019t blame me. I\u2019m just worried that something might go wrong. Even if you resent or hate me after this, I\u2019ll take it.\u201dAt dusk, Patriarch Li Nan Feng ordered someone to come get Duan Ling Tian. This came as a surprise to himIn the Li family\u2019s Audience Hall, besides Li Nan Feng, Grand Elder Li Huo and Fifth Elder Li Ting were there. His heart jerked as he understood what was going on.That damn fatty opened his mouth for sure.\u201cGreetings Patriarch, Grand Elder, and Fifth Elder.\u201dDuan Ling Tian bowed to the three of them.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, do you know why we called you here?\u201dLi Nan Feng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he slowly asked this.\u201cPatriarch called me here for the matter regarding Fang Qiang stepping into the Core Formation stage, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian went straight to the point.\u201cKid, you have good natural talent and you\u2019re intelligent\u2026 But, on this matter, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being reckless?\u201dLi Nan Feng heaved a sigh.Duan Ling Tian was the treasure of the Li family. As long as he was here, the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s supply would not end.The Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s importance to the Li family was too high.Combined with the Thunder Flame Pill, the cultivation of the children of all the Li family Elders were advancing leaps and bounds. They were pulling far ahead of the younger generations of the Fang and Chen families.Duan Ling Tian smiled as he said, \u201cPatriarch, as a real man living in this world, there are things I should do and some things I shouldn\u2019t do! Tomorrow\u2019s matter is something I, Duan Ling Tian, promised upon in front of all of you. Just like the saying \u201ca gentleman\u2019s promise is worth a thousand gold coins,\u201d if Patriarch wants to persuade me to break my promise, I\u2019m afraid I will be disappointing you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dLi Nan Feng had a gloomy expression.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s words were incisive, without any openings in his argument, causing Li Nan Feng to really not know how to persuade him.\u201cKid, you can\u2019t joke around with a matter like this. With your current cultivation and relying upon your swift sword, killing a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist is quite possible, but a first level Core Formation martial artist who possesses the strength of two ancient mammoths is far too much for you to handle.\u201dGrand Elder Li Huo was hoping Duan Ling Tian would give up on the idea of going to the Fang family estate tomorrow.\u201cThank you for your concern, Grand Elder.\u201dGratitude emerged on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face; however, his eyes remained as staunch as before, without a bit of change.\u201cForget it, forget it\u2026\u201dAfter staring at Duan Ling Tian for a moment, Li Huo sighed. \u201cPatriarch, since this kid is determined, just let him go.\u201d\u201cGrand Elder!\u201dLi Nan Feng and Li Ting were both stupefied.\u201cThank you, Grand Elder!\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a smile on his face and gratefully glanced at Li Huo, then he looked towards Li Nan Feng and Li Ting. \u201cPatriarch, Fifth Elder, before I go to the Fang family tomorrow, I hope you don\u2019t tell my mother about this. Duan Ling Tian is indebted to you.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking and saying his farewells, Duan Ling Tian turned around and left, unrestrained and free.\u201cGrand Elder, how could you agree to let him go?\u201dLi Ting had a bitter expression. He didn\u2019t know why Grand Elder would make such a decision.Li Nan Feng also looked towards Li Huo. He had the same question.\u201cLi Ting, you\u2019ve seen this kid\u2019s attitude. Do you think we can actually stop him? Don\u2019t tell me you want to put him under house arrest? This is the path he chose, and everyone must be responsible for their own choices. Even he is not excluded.\u201dLi Huo stood up and prepared to leave.Before he left, he added, \u201cTomorrow, I will go with him. I will hide in the shadows for the sake of the Li family. So what if this old face of mine is put at risk?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He grasped the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword and pushed it into its sheath\u2026It would be impossible for anyone who didn\u2019t know to realize with just a glance that his belt had a secret.The room door opened and the rays of sunlight entered. The youth narrowed his eyes as he stretched and yawned.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dA pleasing voice entered his ears.The youth\u2019s gaze fell upon the slim and graceful young girl in front of him.The young girl was wearing light green clothes. Matched with the violet leather belt on her waist, the colors didn\u2019t seem like they conflicted each other.The young girl\u2019s belt was the same as the youth\u2019s but even more exquisite; it was inclined towards women.Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s burning gaze, the young girl\u2019s delicate cheeks blushed. \u201cYoung Master, what are you looking at?\u201dDuan Ling Tian pretended to have a perverted expression. \u201cOf course it\u2019s my little beauty, Ke Er.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re making fun of Ke Er again.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s face flushed from embarrassment, then she asked, \u201cYoung Master, madam and I have prepared breakfast for you. Hurry up and come have some.\u201dAfter saying this, she brought Duan Ling Tian to the dining table, which was filled with a sumptuous breakfast.\u201cWhere\u2019s my mother?\u201dDuan Ling Tian inquired.\u201cMadam was summoned by the Patriarch early in the morning.\u201dThe young girl said.\u201cHmm, Ke Er, I reckon my mom won\u2019t be back anytime soon. We can eat first.\u201dDuan Ling Dian nodded as he informed Ke Er. His mother leaving was not a surprise to him.After eating their fill, they walked out of the house. \u201cKe Er, when we get to the Fang family estate, go stand beside my mother. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dKe Er obediently nodded.On the way, the perfect couple attracted a long \u2018tail\u2019 everywhere they passed.After leaving the Li family estate, they passed through the Li family marketplace and entered the Fang family marketplace before finally walking towards the Fang family estate.Today\u2019s marketplace was exceptionally bustling with noise and excitement. The streets were filled with a stream of people even at dawn, and even more people were standing on the sides as if they were waiting for something.Suddenly, these people, as if noticing something, all looked towards the distance.\u201cIt\u2019s the Li family\u2019s Duan Ling Tian. I didn\u2019t think he would really dare to visit the Fang family!\u201d\u201cI told you this long ago: if Duan Ling Tian dared to kill Fang Quan, he would surely not be afraid of the Fang family and would definitely go.\u201d\u201cThe Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang, is not someone Fang Quan can compare to. The gap in strength between the two is over a thousand miles long. Duan Ling Tian is too rash.\u201d\u2026\u2026As the couple made their way through the town, people from all three market places of Fresh Breeze Town trailed behind them.The line went on from one end of the Fang family marketplace to its other end. It could be said to be a large movement.In addition, the number of people was still increasing\u2026Finally, the youth and young girl arrived in front of the Fang family estate\u2019s main entrance.When they finally got there, the area outside of the Fang family estate was already swarming with people.After a moment, the crowd consciously opened up a path\u2026The Li family members walked over. Everyone from the Patriarch to all the elders, except for Seventh Elder Li Kun, had come.\u201cPatriarch, elders.\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t feel one bit surprised that Li Nan Feng and the elders had come. He walked up with the young girl beside him and he bowed to them.The surrounding crowd could not help themselves from discussing in whispers.\u201cLooks like the Li family really values Duan Ling Tian. Even the Patriarch came in person.\u201d\u201cYeah, the Li family\u2019s Patriarch came in person, and the Li family\u2019s elders are nearly all gathered\u2026 Even though this Duan Ling Tian is only a disciple with another surname, his status in the Li Family is obviously extraordinary!\u201d\u201cLooks like the matter between Duan Ling Tian and Fang Qiang today isn\u2019t purely a personal grievance anymore but a fight between the Li family and the Fang family!\u201d\u2026\u2026After sending Ke Er off to be by his mother\u2019s side, Duan Ling Tian went alone to the front of the Fang family estate\u2019s main entrance. His voice sounded like dull lightning as he said, \u201cThe three months period is over. Fang family Manager Fang Qiang, do you dare to come out?!\u201dDuan Ling Tian shouted this in a loud voice at the main entrance of the Fang family estate. His imposing manner seemed to pierce through the sky.He was like an undefeatable war god.\u201cWhy would I not dare?\u201dA group of people walked out from the Fang family estate.The person who followed at the back was the one that replied to Duan Ling Tian. It was none other than Fang Qiang!In front of Fang Qiang was the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi, and all the Fang family elders.There was an old man walking shoulder to shoulder with Fang Yi. Even Fang Yi emitted a heartfelt sense of respect towards the old man.\u201cIt\u2019s the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder!\u201d\u201cWho would have thought that from the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch to all the elders, they\u2019re coming out at full strength!\u201d\u201cIf the Li family\u2019s Grand Elder comes as well, it will be even livelier!\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing the crowd\u2019s discussions, Duan Ling Tian glanced at the old man.The Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder looked at him with a seemingly tranquil gaze, but behind that tranquility was actually a hidden killing intent.As a strong-willed weapons specialist from the battlefield, he saw through it with just a glance.The Fang family members greeted the Li family members as soon as they walked out, then the Li family members went to stand near the Li family crowd.Suddenly, the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder looked off into the distance and indifferently said, \u201cLi Huo, since you\u2019ve come, why\u2019re you hiding in a corner?\u201d\u201cGeezer Fang, looks like your cultivation has improved again.\u201dJust when everyone was puzzle, an aged figure walked out from within the crowd.It was indeed the Li family\u2019s Grand Elder, Li Huo.\u201cGrand Elder!\u201dThe Li family members hurriedly bowed to Li Huo.\u201cGrand Elder.\u201dSeeing Li Huo here was slightly unexpected even to Duan Ling Tian.The surrounding spectators\u2019 gazes all lit up.Such a scene was something they would not forget in their entire lives. They all felt coming here was worth it as they would be able to brag about it once they got home.\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t expect both Grand Elders to come personally. Chen Li brought his daughter here to join in as well.\u201dJust at this moment, the crowd split apart to form a path. The Chen family\u2019s Patriarch, Chen Li, and Chen Mei Er slowly walked over. They moved to stand at the side once they bowed to the Li family\u2019s and the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elders.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian noticed that Chen Mei Er had a hint of concern in her eyes when she looked at him. He couldn\u2019t help but be stupefied by this.This girl couldn\u2019t have really fallen for me, right?\u201cFang Qiang!\u201dStanding on the empty space in front of the Fang family estate main door, Duan Ling Tian gazed fixedly at Fang Qiang from afar. His voice was cold and indifferent.Fang Qiang walked out and stood facing Duan Ling Tian.\u201cFirst level of the Core Formation stage! Fang Qiang actually broke through to the Core Formation stage!\u201d exclaimed the Li family\u2019s Second Elder when his gaze fell upon Fang Qiang.Everyone besides the Fang family members, Li Nan Feng, Grand Elder Li Huo, and Fifth Elder Li Ting couldn\u2019t help but be moved.The Li family members\u2019 expressions changed greatly, while the other people had expressions of astonishment.The information that was unveiled before their eyes was something that completely exceeded their expectations!\u201cThe Fang family\u2019s Manager broke through to the Core Formation stage?\u201d\u201cThe Fang family concealed it so well. Such shocking news was actually wrapped up so tightly.\u201d\u201cThe Fang family intentionally concealed the news of Fang Qiang breaking through, they were probably waiting for this moment!\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding crowd discussed in succession. They all looked at Duan Ling Tian with eyes filled with pity.Li Rou\u2019s expression also changed greatly. Never would she have thought that Fang Qiang would have reached the Core Formation stage. She immediately walked out and said to Duan Ling Tian in a low voice, \u201cTian, come back home with mom! We\u2019ll just leave today\u2019s matter as it is.\u201dBefore Duan Ling Tian could even reply, the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi, laughed loudly. \u201cNinth Elder, it was your son who spoke such heroic words that day. Don\u2019t tell me you want to go back on your word? A Li family member wouldn\u2019t run before a battle, right?\u201dLi Rou ignored Fang Yi. She was preparing to take Duan Ling Tian home.As far as she was concerned, her son still had a chance at victory against a ninth level Body Tempering stage Fang Qiang.But against a first level Core Formation Fang Qiang, her son had no chance at all!\u201cNinth Elder, please don\u2019t make it hard on me.\u201dAn elder of the Fang family walked out and stood between Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian, preventing her from proceeding further.The other elders of the Fang family also looked fiercely at the Li family elders, causing them to be unable to interfere in the matter.The Fang family was prepared!\u201cLet me see who can stop me!\u201dLi Rou grasped her sheathed Fine Steel Sword tightly.As long as she executed her Sword Drawing Arts, she was confident in her ability to kill the Fang family elder in front of her with a single a strike.But once she performs this strike, it would mean war between the Fang family and the Li family, and it wouldn\u2019t stop until one side was completely wiped out!\u201cMom!\u201dJust at this moment, Duan Ling Tian finally spoke. He gave his mother gaze that said \u201cbe at ease.\u201dLi Rou understood the meaning of her son\u2019s gaze. After hesitating for a moment, she took in a deep breath and her hand that was gripping the sword sheath slightly loosened.But in her heart, she had already made a decision: if her son wasn\u2019t a match for Fang Qiang and his life was in danger, even if it meant spilling the blood of the Fang family, she would still protect her son.For her son, she was willing to be enemies with the entire world!\u201cDad, what should we do? Fang Qiang actually broke through to the Core Formation stage. It\u2019s impossible for Duan Ling Tian to be his match.\u201dChen Mei Er had an expression of worry as she looked towards her father. \u201cDad, please help him.\u201dChen Li had a bitter smile. \u201cMei Er, I\u2019m bound to only be a spectator for today\u2019s matter\u2026 Dad is powerless.\u201dChen Mei Er\u2019s expression slightly changed. Lightly biting her lips, she looked at Duan Ling Tian from afar with an expression full of worry. In her heart, she said to herself, \u201cYou bad guy, nothing better happen to you. I still haven\u2019t taken revenge yet\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201dKe Er\u2019s face was pale. She never would have thought that the Young Master\u2019s opponent had stepped into the Core Formation stage.Her delicate, jade-like hands were already upon the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword on her waist; she was prepared to draw her sword at any moment.\u201cBoss, good luck!\u201dThe little fatty was in the crowd looking at Duan Ling Tian from afar. His expression extremely was serious.Fang Qiang gazed at Duan Ling Tian with a slightly shocked expression. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, I didn\u2019t think you would reach the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage in only three months\u2026. But you will certainly die by my hand today, and I will take revenge for my son with my own two hands!\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently. \u201cTalking big, huh? Aren\u2019t you afraid you\u2019ll hurt your tongue?!\u201dFang Qiang smiled coldly. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, isn\u2019t your sword your most formidable weapon? Why didn\u2019t you bring it with you today\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you think that I, Fang Qiang, am not worthy of you using your sword?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be such an understanding person.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled widely. His smile was as bright as the sun.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dFang Qiang\u2019s gaze turned cold, the veins in his forehead started bulging, and the fingers of each of his hands came together as Origin Energy suffused between them.At the same time, above his head, the forces of heaven and earth trembled and slowly emerged into two balls of white mist. They would develop into two ancient mammoth silhouettes at any moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had killed him with a swift sword strike!In their opinion, if Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t have a sword, it would be impossible for him to be a match against Fang Quan.Although Duan Ling Tian reaching the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage was a shocking feat, he was now facing a first level Core Formation martial artist empty-handed.Everyone felt a bit of dread.The surrounding spectators were equally dumbstruck. \u201cDuan Ling Tian is going to fight Fang Qiang bare-handed? Has he gone mad?\u201d\u201cMaybe he knows that regardless of whether he has a sword in his hand, he will not be a match for Fang Qiang, so he gave up any resistance altogether\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian, catch my sword!\u201dJust at this moment, Chen Mei Er raised her hand and tossed her Fine Steel Sword over to Duan Ling Tian.Since the day she saw Duan Ling Tian\u2019s elegant demeanor when he drew his sword, she became attracted to swords. Ever since then, her sword had never left her.She never expected that she would be able to help Duan Ling Tian today.But just when she was expecting Duan Ling Tian to catch it and thank her, he did something that exceeded her expectations. He actually raised his hand and tossed the sword back to her.Clang!The sword tumbled in front of her.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dChen Mei Er\u2019s face turned slightly green and she stomped her feet in a graceful manner. She was so angry that she could not speak.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian is really mad! Miss Chen actually kindly passed her sword over, but he rejected it. Does he really think he can contend with Fang Qiang without a sword?\u201dAt this moment, the people on the scene, besides the Fang family members, who had cold smiles on their faces, and Li Rou and Ke Er, who looked like they had thought of something, were struck dumb.They were unable to understand Duan Ling Tian\u2019s actions.\u201cWhat is this kid trying to do?\u201dLi Huo\u2019s expression was ugly. The appearance of the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder destroyed his earlier plans.With that geezer here, even if Duan Ling Tian were to face danger, it would be extremely difficult for him to save Duan Ling Tian.As for the remaining Li family members, each one of them was being watched by a member of the Fang family, and they were unable to extricate themselves.The Fang family had obviously come prepared!They wanted Fang Qiang to kill Duan Ling Tian as a show of force\u2026Even Li Huo couldn\u2019t help but burn with anxiety.If he knew that Duan Ling Tian would be so overconfident that he wouldn\u2019t even use his sword today, he would have surely put Duan Ling Tian under house arrest yesterday, disallowing him from appearing here.But it was all too late now!\u201cBoss!\u201dThe little fatty stood at the edge of the surrounding crowd. His chubby face lowered and his small eyes filled up with worry.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, looks like you understand that whether you have a sword or not, you will surely be killed by me today. Since you know your own limitations, I\u2019ll give you a fast death.\u201dFang Qiang had a mocking expression on his face. The Origin Energy that he had accumulated for some time suffused on his palms. He was ready to attack at any time.\u201cAnyone can talk big. If you want to kill me, it depends on whether you have the capability.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled coldly.\u201cStop trying to be mystifying and die!\u201dFang Qiang\u2019s gaze turned cold. After letting out the Origin Energy in his legs, he flew out like an arrow leaving a bowstring.The Origin Energy in his palms seemed as if it were pushing the clouds forward as it flew towards Duan Ling Tian\u2026High grade yellow ranked martial skill, Flowing Clouds Palm!Instantly, the two balls of white mist above Fang Qiangs head finally developed into two clear ancient mammoth silhouettes.At this instant, the hearts of everyone present jumped to their throats.The hand Li Rou grasped her sword sheath with tightened; she was prepared to kill the Fang family elder blocking her path at any moment in order to save her son.\u201cHmm?\u201dSeeing Fang Qiang violently approaching, Duan Ling Tian was unexpectedly dazed.He noticed that something was wrong\u2026\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth abruptly curled into a sneer, seeming as if he thought of something.When Fang Qiang was a fraction of a second away from hitting him, Duan Ling Tian finally moved!His upper body inclined in a tricky angle, a difficult maneuver that ordinary people were incapable of, dodging Fang Qiang\u2019s violently approaching palm strike!The palm strike caused Duan Ling Tian\u2019s violet clothes to flutter in the wind.\u201cDie!\u201d Fang Qiang abruptly shouted loudly in response, then his palms changed directions, slapping towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s exposed back which became exposed after he bent down to dodge his strike\u2026Just at this moment, under gazes of disbelief.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s legs started trembling and his entire body became like a spirit serpent. Borrowing strength from Fang Qiang\u2019s body, he flashed behind Fang Qiang.He had once again dodged Fang Qiang\u2019s fierce palm strike!\u201cMovement technique!\u201d Li Huo and the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder said at the same time. Their voices contained a trace of shock.After their voices spread out, even more people had expressions of disbelief\u2026Before everyone\u2019s astounded expressions could ease up.The scene that took place in front of their eyes caused their gazes to freeze!They saw Duan Ling Tian moving behind Fang Qiang, and at the moment Fang Qiang turned around, the hand he had pressed against his waist moved\u2026\u201cWhoosh!\u201dPeople with a higher cultivation level could barely see a violet sword shine as it flashed by.It was so fast that even they could not see it clearly!In the blink of an eye, the sword shine had disappeared as Duan Ling Tian completed his attack.\u201cCough\u2026\u201dFang Qiang\u2019s body trembled as he coughed dryly.A line of blood on his throat slowly widened. No matter how tightly he clasped his throat, he had no way of stopping the stream of blood that was pouring out of his throat\u2026His hands very quickly became dyed red with blood. As his body was on the verge of collapse, he looked towards the youth with an expression of unwillingness.But he was now powerless to attack the youth.\u201cSo what if you\u2019re at the Core Formation stage? Killing you only requires one sword strike!\u201d said Duan Ling Tian in cold and indifferent voice. Fang Qiang stared at him with eyes full of despair and his body was about to drop to the ground.This shocked the hearts of everyone present.Killing you only requires one sword strike!What a straightforward saying\u2026Most importantly, this was something that a seventh level Body Tempering martial artist had said to a first level Core Formation martial artist!\u201cTian!\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cBoss!\u201dThree figures reacted first and came to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side.The young girl seemed to have forgotten to be embarrassment as she tightly embraced Duan Ling Tian. Her extremely beautiful face had a faint smile that was drop dead gorgeous.Li Rou and Li Xuan both looked at each other when they saw this and shook their heads while smiling. Unexpectedly, they didn\u2019t tease the two of them.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 Geezer Fang, I\u2019m afraid you came here for nothing today.\u201dFang Huo looked towards the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder and laughed loudly. His voice contained a hint of pleasure as he mocked his old adversary to his heart\u2019s content.\u201cHumph!\u201dThe Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder coldly grunted. His icy cold gaze swept over Duan Ling Tian as he quickly walked into the Fang family estate.From the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi, to all the other Fang family elders, they all had ugly expressions as they followed their Grand Elder into the Fang family estate.They originally expected to crush the Li family\u2019s spirit, but instead everything happened the other way around.At the same time, traces of coldness slowly aroused in their hearts.Unknowingly, such a monster had appeared in the Li family, and most importantly, he was only fifteen\u2026Fifteen\u2026. There was still ample space for him to grow.His extraordinary movement technique and that unpredictable and mysterious sword skill struck terror in their hearts.This kid couldn\u2019t be left alive!This was the thought that abruptly entered their hearts.\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201dLi Huo abruptly coughed twice, causing Ke Er, who was happily enjoying Duan Ling Tian\u2019s embrace, to be embarrassed. This made her immediately back up.Only now did she realize that most of the crowd was looking at them. Her delicate cheeks blushed a bright red and she hid behind Li Rou in embarrassment.The people at the scene could not help but laugh with good intentions.One of the spectators sighed and said, \u201cOnly this kind of girl would be a match for Young Master Ling Tian!\u201dThe continuous voices of agreement caused the young girl to be afraid to even raise her head.\u201cDad, let\u2019s go home.\u201dAfter witnessing this scene, Chen Mei Er\u2019s face was pale. While biting her lips, she notified Chen Li that she wanted to leave.Chen Li, of course, knew what his daughter was thinking about. He shook his head and heaved a sigh.If Duan Ling Tian had any feelings towards his daughter, he would be willing to bring them together.But unfortunately, his daughter\u2019s love was one-sided.\u201cEnough. This isn\u2019t the place to speak. We can speak once we get home.\u201dLi Huo said.When they noticing the Li family members leaving while clustered around Duan Ling Tian, the surrounding spectators slowly dispersed.They urgently wanted to go home and share what they had seen today with their friends and families. This piece of news was definitely explosive.\u201cHe really is shocking.\u201dIn the crowd, a figure quietly left. It was none other than the Agarwood Restaurant\u2019s Manager Ma.Li family estate, in the audience hall.As always, Duan Ling Tian was the center of attention. Grand Elder looked at Duan Ling Tian with a faint smile. \u201cKid, you really made us suffer by concealing all of that\u2026\u201dLi Nan Feng and the others all nodded as they deeply felt the same.No matter whether it was the movement technique Duan Ling Tian executed or the flexible sword concealed in his waist, they all felt that it was too much for their eyes to take in.Duan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I wanted to take him by surprise and not give Fang Qiang time to defend himself! If all of my trump cards were known by Fang Qiang, he would surely not be as careless as he was today. If I hadn\u2019t been secretive, the person who died today wouldn\u2019t be him but me.\u201dIt was true that out of all the factors that contributed to Duan Ling Tian killing Fang Qiang today, \u2018luck\u2019 played a very important role.Firstly, when he saw that Duan Ling Tian had no sword in his hand, Fang Qiang let his guard down.Secondly, Fang Qiang didn\u2019t expect that Duan Ling Tian would be capable of such a profound movement technique.Movement techniques were currently extremely rare in the Cloud Continent.This point was something that Duan Ling Tian only realized due to the old Duan Ling Tian\u2019s memories. This information only surfaced at the moment Fang Qiang moved to attack him.This was because at the time that Fang Qiang attacked in full force, his speed, in the old Duan Ling Tian\u2019s opinion, was far above fully utilizing the strength of two ancient mammoths.After obtaining Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian could be considered to have great experience and knowledge.But in those two eras that Rebirth Martial Emperor experienced, movement techniques were common; they were not nearly as rare as they were in the current era.According to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s memories, during the ten thousand years that Rebirth Martial Emperor was in deep slumber, movement techniques started to become rare.\u201cKid, can you let me see your sword?\u201dLi Huo asked Duan Ling Tian.\u201cOf course.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, then he casually removed the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword from his waist before passing it over to Li Huo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I was right to think that in the entire Fresh Breeze Town, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone else with such superb skill in forging besides him. The entire sword looks like it was shaped by nature; there are no manmade marks or traces on it.\u201dLi Huo complemented the sword before casually returning it to Duan Ling Tian.The little fatty\u2019s eyes shined brilliantly as he loudly shouted, \u201cBoss, your sword is forged from Violet Ore, right? I\u2019ll go get Manager Long to forge me one later. This is the absolute best weapon for deceit!\u201dViolet Ore?Duan Ling Tian shook his head. This guy loved to pretend he knew about things he didn\u2019t.\u201cPa!\u201dAt this moment, Fifth Elder Li Ting gave the little fatty a smack on the back of his head. \u201cKid, don\u2019t come here and pretend you know about things you don\u2019t. How could Violet Ore have such strong malleability?\u201dLittle Fatty pouted as he felt wronged. \u201cHow would I know?\u201dEveryone was amused by him and started laughing.Abruptly, Patriarch Li Nan Feng looked towards Duan Ling Tian and asked, \u201cYour movement technique was passed down to you by your teacher?\u201dTowards Li Nan Feng\u2019s inquiry, Duan Ling Tian was prepared. \u201cYes.\u201dFor a moment, including Li Nan Feng and Li Huo, all of the Li family elders besides Li Rou looked at Duan Ling Tian with envious gazes.In their opinion, Duan Ling Tian being able to be the disciple of a grade seven Alchemist was extremely good fortune.Duan Ling Tian was quiet for a moment before slowly saying, \u201cPatriarch, at that time, my teacher gave me two sets of movement techniques and asked me to thoroughly memorize them; only then did he let me return\u2026 The movement technique that I cultivate requires an extremely strong flexibility of the body to be cultivated. The other movement technique is suitable for anyone to cultivate. I\u2019ll share it with the Li family. How about it?\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s words caused the atmosphere in the audience hall to freeze up.Heavy sounds of breathing could be heard one after another.Li Nan Feng drew in a deep breath as he asked unsurely, \u201cYou\u2026you really mean it?\u201d\u201cYes. Give me half a month\u2019s time so I can write it out.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, then he said, \u201cThis movement technique is a middle grade Profound rank movement technique named Swift Wind Steps!\u201dA middle grade Profound Rank movement technique?The Li family members started breathing rapidly\u2026Looking at everyone\u2019s serious expressions, Duan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly. \u201cOf course, if the family is willing to give me some silver coins as repayment, I wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026\u201dWhat Duan Ling Tian said caused the atmosphere in the room to ease up. Li Nan Feng readily said, \u201cNo problem. How about I give you another 100,000 silver coins?\u201d\u201cThank you, Patriarch.\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly expressed his gratitude.The movement technique he mentioned was just the lowest ranked movement technique he could find in Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s entire memory, so he didn\u2019t expect it to be sold for 100,000 silver coins.Li Nan Feng continued, \u201cOf course, this movement technique is absolutely not only worth these few silver coins, but our Li family\u2019s liquid funds are insufficient, so we\u2019ll just give you 100,000 in advance. In the future, if you need anything, the Li family will help you without a doubt. I believe that all the fellow elders will agree with my decision.\u201dThe Li family elders hurriedly nodded. As far as they were concerned, the temptation of the movement technique was just too big!\u201cThen I\u2019ll go home and start writing down the movement technique and pass it to Patriarch as soon as possible.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said his farewells and then left the audience hall together with Ke Er and his mother.\u201cToday\u2019s matter will be considered a family secret. No one is allowed to spread it!\u201dAfter Duan Ling Tian and his family left, LI Nan Feng\u2019s expression was extremely serious as he put down the gag order.\u201cYes!\u201dThe elders nodded.They all knew the weight of the matter; spreading the news at this moment would only disadvantage the Li family.Fifth Elder Li Ting gave a stare to the little fatty who was eagerly looking out. \u201cStinking kid, did you hear him?\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201dLittle fatty nodded. His expression had a sense of loss.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you now?\u201dLi Ting frowned as he asked this.\u201cFather, did you notice that Boss was ignoring me? It must be because I told you about Fang Qiang breaking through. Boss is angry now. Sigh, if I knew this would happen earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201dLittle fatty said in all seriousness.\u201cPa!\u201dLi Ting slapped the little fatty on the head again. \u201cWhat did you say just now? Say it again.\u201d\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201dA wise man knows when to retreat. The little fatty hurriedly shook his head.The Li family disciple with a different surname, Duan Ling Tian, who was at the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage, killed the Fang family\u2019s Manager, Fang Qiang, who was a first level Core Formation martial artist, with only one sword strike. News of this quickly spread throughout the entire Fresh Breeze Town.This made Fresh Breeze Town once again see Duan Ling Tian in a new light.\u201cOnly fifteen but so monstrous; once he grows up, will Fresh Breeze Town still be able to hold him?\u201d\u201cForget about Fresh Breeze Town; with his natural talent, even in the large cities outside, how many of those large clans\u2019 genius disciples will be able to compete with him?\u201d\u201cWith only his seventh level Body Tempering cultivation and one sword strike, he killed a first level Core Formation martial artist\u2026 Unbelievable, truly unbelievable!\u201d\u201cI heard he even used a movement technique. Even in our Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s three families, I\u2019ve never heard of any family having a movement technique\u2026.\u201d\u201cI wonder where he learned his movement technique from.\u201d\u2026\u2026The news that spread across Fresh Breeze Town and gave rise to much discussion naturally spread to the Li family and every Li family member.\u201cLittle Jie!\u201dIn a spacious courtyard, a shrill and sorrowful cry sounded. With it came a trace of endless pain.\u201cBig brother!\u201dFollowing the first cry was a second slightly immature sorrowful cry.In the room, a youth whose body seemed as if it didn\u2019t have any bones lied on a bed. One of his hands was tightly grasping a bloodied dagger while the other hand\u2019s wrist had been cut open.The blood was still wet, so it was obviously cut open recently.At this moment, the youth breathed his last breath.\u201cNo, no\u2026 Little Jie, Little Jie!\u201dThis middle-aged man was in his prime, but now he looked like he had aged over ten years. His sideburns had become completely white thanks to the recent events.His face was filled with melancholy, but that quickly changed into a sinister expression. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, Duan Ling Tian\u2026 I want you dead, I want you dead!\u201dThis person was indeed the Li family\u2019s Seventh Elder, Li Kun.He didn\u2019t expect that his son would feel so much despair that he\u2019d commit suicide when he heard the news about Duan Ling Tian killing Fang Qiang instead of being killed.He knew that during these past few months, the only thing that made his son want to continue living was his desire to see Duan Ling Tian killed by Fang Qiang\u2026But who would have known that Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t be killed and was even living happily.He had even become the Li family\u2019s \u201cHero!\u201d\u201cDad, let\u2019s not fight with Duan Ling Tian anymore. Now even the Grand Elder stands at his side; we can\u2019t defeat him, we can\u2019t.\u201dLi Xin was drenched in tears as he persuaded his father.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s dominating demeanor caused him to feel despair.\u201cPa!\u201dLI Kun\u2019s face distorted as he raised his hand and slapped Li Xin on the head while coldly saying, \u201cYou useless thing, that\u2019s the person who caused your brother\u2019s death. He is our mortal enemy. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually talking like this. Are you worthy of your brother?\u201dLi Xin stood there in the side full of grievance, his eyes were red, but he did not dare to even breathe loudly.\u201cHelp your brother change his clothes. Once dad gets back, we\u2019ll bury him properly,\u201d Li Kun said to Li Xin before quickly walking out of the house without even turning back.\u201cDad, what are you going to do?\u201d Li Xin hurriedly asked, but Li Kun completely ignored him.Li Kun exited the courtyard, left the Li family estate, and walked straight toward the Fang family estate.A sinister expression filled his face. \u201cPatriarch, Grand Elder, don\u2019t blame me\u2026 If you want to blame someone, then blame yourselves for standing by a disciple with a different surname and giving up on my son!\u201dHe had a plan in his heart. He planned to tell the Fang family about the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s medicinal formula that was in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s possession.He was confident that the Fang family would surely be interested in the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. At that time, when the Fang family and the Li family starts disputing over the matter, combined with the Fang family\u2019s and Duan Ling Tian\u2019s grievances, the Fang family will surely not let Duan Ling Tian off.Seeing the Fang family estate in front of his eyes, the corner of Li Kun\u2019s mouth curled into a cold smile.For the sake of taking revenge for his son, he chose to betray his family\u2026But just when he was about to reach the main door of the Fang family estate, he felt his eyes go black and he lost consciousness.When he dizzily awoke, he noticed that he was in a sealed, secret chamber.In the chamber were two people looking at him calmly. When he recognized them, his expression couldn\u2019t help but change. \u201cPatriarch, Grand Elder, why are you two here?\u201d\u201cLi Kun, we gave you a chance.\u201dLi Nan Feng gazed at him with a complicated expression as he sighed.\u201cPatriarch!\u201dAs if he realized something, Li Kun\u2019s expression changed greatly, then he kneeled on the floor and started crying. \u201cI\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong! Patriarch, forgive me. I still want to keep my life to watch my son grow up!\u201d\u201cTake wrong one step, and every step after will also be wrong\u2026 Li Kun, you have been blinded by hatred. Have you ever truly thought about it? The conflict between your family and the Ninth Elder\u2019s family, where did it actually start from? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s only the fault of the Ninth Elder\u2019s family?\u201d Li Huo said indifferently. In his palm was a white flame that was slowly burning, emitting a trace of a terrifying aura.When Li Kun saw this, he instantly guessed what was going to happen next. His face distorted as he pleaded, \u201cGrand Elder, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026\u201dWhoosh!The white flame in Li Huo\u2019s hand jumped out and instantly expanded, enveloping Li Kun.Instantly, Li Kun wasn\u2019t even able to emit a shrill cry before he was completely vaporized, only leaving behind a pile of residue.An alchemist\u2019s Pill Fire was one of the hottest fires on Cloud Continent\u2026Only a weapons craftsman\u2019s Weapon Flame could be compared to it.\u201cLi Jie committed suicide?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly shocked when he heard of this, but he didn\u2019t feel any pity.At that time, if Li Jie hadn\u2019t proclaimed that he would cripple him, due to the fact they were both of the same family, he would not have been so merciless towards Li Jie.It could be said that what happened to Li Jie was all his own doing.What Duan Ling Tian was worried about now was the reaction of Seventh Elder Li Kun.Seventh Elder Li Kun was a third level Core Formation martial artist; if he really wanted to attack Duan Ling Tian, he could find a chance at any moment as they were both in the Li family estate.But Duan Ling Tian quickly heard that Seventh Elder Li Kun had gone missing; it was as if he had vanished into thin air.Outside Fresh Breeze Town.Two figures that were fatigued from their journey rode their horses into Fresh Breeze Town. One of them was a middle-aged man and the other a twenty-something-year-old young man.The young man\u2019s expression had a lofty arrogance as he said disdainfully, \u201cFourth Uncle, this broken down town isn\u2019t even as big as our Duan family estate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His bones made clear and melodious sounds as they rubbed against each other.Gripping his hands into fists, the corners of the youth\u2019s mouth curled up into a smile. \u201cThree more Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid baths and I should be able to break through to the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage. Once I break through, my strength will more than double!\u201dBecause his cultivation level was going up once again, the youth\u2019s mood was superb.After putting on some clothes, Duan Ling Tian walked out of his room.With narrow eyes, he looked at the young girl who was drenched in sweat and swinging the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword. His expression emitted a feeling of tender love.He had observed the painstaking cultivation that the young girl had gone through in these past few months, and his heart ached.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dWhen the young girl noticed Duan Ling Tian, she put her Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in the sheath on her waist and smiled sweetly as she went to greet him.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.He extended his hand and slightly dominatingly took the young girl\u2019s handkerchief from her, then he proceeded to wipe the sweat off the young girl\u2019s face with an expression of gentleness.There was only tenderness in his eyes.The young girl lightly shook her head. Her delicate and exquisite face had a smile of happiness.As far as she was concerned, for the sake of the Young Master, no matter how tired she was, it was worth it.\u201cBoss, Boss!\u201dJust when the youth and young girl were like a couple gazing at each other, two abrupt shouts from outside the courtyard broke the happy atmosphere.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but become grim.This damn fatty really knows how to choose his timing\u2026The young girl smiled lightly and considerately said, \u201cYoung Master, he\u2019s looking for you so urgently. Maybe there\u2019s an important matter.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded and replied, \u201cGet in here!\u201dThe little fatty walked in from outside and said to Duan Ling Tian, \u201cBoss, you have guests.\u201d\u201cAt my house?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed. He didn\u2019t understand what little fatty meant.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s some people from the Duan Clan. There were two them. I heard from outside the audience hall that Ninth Elder referred to a middle-aged man as \u2018Fourth Brother,\u2019 and he addressed Ninth Elder as \u2018Third Sister in Law,\u2019\u201d the Little fatty said. He had a look of wanting to seek credit.\u201cThird Sister in law? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart skipped a beat.Even in the past Duan Ling Tian\u2019s memories, there were none about his father.Obviously, ever since he was old enough to understand things, he had never seen his father, not even once.Towards that mysterious father of his, although Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t miss him, he was still curious in his heart\u2026He wanted to know what kind of man would be so merciless as to leave his wife and son!\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s go take a look.\u201dHolding the young girl\u2019s hand, Duan Ling Tian walked quickly out of his house.\u201cBoss, wait for me. You can\u2019t be ungrateful!\u201dSeeing Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er walking out in the blink of an eye, the little fatty started shouting loudly as he hurriedly followed behind them.The Li family\u2019s audience hall was close at hand.Suddenly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze fixed upon a figure walking towards him from the direction of the audience hall.It was a twenty-something-year-old young man with an expression of arrogance. It was as if the whole world owed him money.\u201cBoss, he is one of the Duan Clan members that arrived, and he\u2019s really arrogant; he was even looking down upon the Patriarch and Ninth Elder,\u201d the Little fatty said to Duan Ling Tian in a light voice when he noticed the young man walking over.Duan Clan!Duan Ling Tian gave him another glance.At this moment, the young man noticed the three of them.When his gaze fell upon the young girl beside Duan Ling Tian, his gaze couldn\u2019t move away. He stared at her with a burning gaze mixed with a trace of greed and lust.The young girl\u2019s willow-shaped eyebrows frowned. Just as she revealed a displeased expression, a figure stepped forward and like a mountain stood in front of her, blocking the person\u2019s gaze.It\u2019s like he was there to keep out the wind and rain, causing her heart to feel incomparable warmth.\u201cHmm?\u201dThe young man frowned and his expression turned grim.But when he noticed the facial features of the youth that blocked in front of the young girl, his pupils constricted; even his tone became more hurried.\u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian?\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed. After searching through the memories in his head, he couldn\u2019t find anything about the person in front of him.But why would the young man know him?\u201cHumph! You grew up to have the same moral conscience as your short-lived father,\u201d the young man grunted. His eyes started emitting a cold killing intent!Even Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t know why someone who he hadn\u2019t met before would emit such a killing intent towards him.His heart jerked as he remembered how the young man mentioned his father. Don\u2019t tell me this young man has an irreconcilable enmity and hatred towards that father that I have never met?\u201cIf I\u2019m not remembering wrongly\u2026 you\u2019re fifteen this year. Fifteen years old and at the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage. You must have inherited your short lived father\u2019s natural talent. But with only this amount of strength, in the eyes of I, Duan Ling Xing, you are no different from an ant!\u201dAs Duan Ling Xing spoke, he took a step forward\u2026His body moved like a flash of lightning straight towards Duan Ling Tian\u2026At the same time, a vast amount of Origin Energy gathered in his right hand, causing it to start shaking abruptly.Striking out a palm with immense force!Instantly, the forces of heaven and shook and eight ancient mammoth silhouettes developed above him.The strength behind this palm strike was actually equal to the strength of eight ancient mammoths!Duan Ling Xing was clearly a sixth level Core Formation martial artist\u2026Only a sixth level Core Formation martial artist at full strength would be capable of drawing upon the forces of heaven and earth to develop into six ancient mammoth silhouettes.Never would Duan Ling Tian have expected that the young man would suddenly come for his life. His face distorted as his body abruptly inclined backwards!Before he could fully dodge the attack, Duan Ling Xing\u2019s palm strike was already upon his chest.Instantly, he felt as if he was sent flying by a 10,000 pound stone!He was blasted out like an arrow leaving the bowstring\u2026As he was in the air, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s throat had a sweet taste. After lightly coughing, blood dyed the ground. It was unpleasant to the eye yet attention-drawing.\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cBoss!\u201dThe young girl and the little fatty\u2019s faces changed greatly as they flew towards Duan Ling Tian and supported him up.Their expressions were filled with rage as they looked at Duan Ling Xing.Duan Ling Tian took in a deep breath. If he hadn\u2019t used his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique to incline his body backwards earlier, Duan Ling Xing\u2019s palm strike could have easily taken his life.At the instant, the proximity of death caused a lingering fear in his heart.But after his heart stopped palpitating with fear, all he was left with was a belly full of rage!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression was grim as he stared at Duan Ling Xing. In an extremely low and deep voice, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any ill feelings between us, so why did you suddenly want to kill me?\u201dFrom the time the young man proclaimed his name, Duan Ling Tian was aware that the relationship between them wouldn\u2019t be simple, since their names were only different by one word.But, he couldn\u2019t understand why the young man would be so merciless towards him, going straight for his life.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you could actually dodge 80% of my palm\u2019s strength. I take back what I said earlier; you can compare to an ant.\u201dDuan Ling Xing took a step forward and looking condescendingly at Duan Ling Tian as a sneer appeared on his face. \u201cAs for what you said about no ill feelings, then you\u2019re extremely wrong! Your short-lived father didn\u2019t take the relationship between brothers into consideration that year, crippling my father\u2019s Dantian and causing him to live a lifetime of pain. Now, can you still say we have no ill feelings between each other?\u201dDuan Ling Tian drew in a deep breath. So that\u2019s how it was.Following which, he coldly glanced at Duan Ling Xing as he mocked, \u201cIf you\u2019re really capable, you can go ahead and find the person that crippled your dad and take revenge! Taking it out on me only means that you\u2019re incapable.\u201d\u201cThe son pays the debts of the father!\u201dDuan Ling Xing coldly laughed and waved his hand. As his body shot out, the same palm strike from earlier struck out once more. \u201cI want to see how you dodge my palm strike this time!\u201dWhoosh!At this moment, the young girl beside Duan Ling Tian moved.Sword Drawing Arts!An extremely swift violet sword flashed by, moving to intercept Duan Ling Xing\u2019s palm strike\u2026Duan Ling Xing\u2019s smile became even colder as his hands closed together and caught the young girl\u2019s sword.Origin Energy bursting forth, he struck the sword with his palm!Immediately, the young girl\u2019s delicate figure started trembling, then she spat out a mouthful of blood and her sword was sent flying.The young girl used the sword to support herself as she managed to stand up with great effort. Her face was as pale as paper.\u201cKe Er!\u201dThe young girl being injured caused Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face to change greatly and his eyes emitted strong killing intent.Using Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, he instantly appeared in front of Duan Ling Xing.With his right hand touching his waist, Sword Drawing Technique!\u201cHumph, you\u2019re overestimating yourself!\u201dDuan Ling Xing snorted coldly as his hands grabbed out once again.Immediately, Duan Ling Tian was blasted away just like the young girl was.Duan Ling Tian, who was already heavily injured, once again fiercely fell to the ground. It was difficult for him to even stand up.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Ke Er cried out sorrowfully. Her delicate body trembled and she fell to the ground due to the sword in her hand being unable to support her any longer.Although she fell to the ground, Ke Er, whose clear eyes were filled with tears, still crawled achingly towards Duan Ling Tian\u2026.When he saw this, an incomparable jealousy surged within Duan Ling Xing\u2019s eyes.His legs shook as he flew out towards Duan Ling Tian. Killing intent started emitting from his eyes as he sent out a palm strike with immense force!Above Duan Ling Xing were eight ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026\u201cBoss!\u201dJust at this moment, accompanied by a loud exclamation, a figure that was like a ball blocked Duan Ling Xing\u2019s path, taking his palm strike head on. He flew back more than ten meters before falling to the ground. He didn\u2019t make a single sound after.\u201cLi Xuan!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted and his expression changed greatly. His voice sounded wretched and cold, and his slightly immature face started to tremble.He never expected that Li Xuan would take Duan Ling Xing\u2019s palm strike for him!At this moment, infinite regret surged in his heart\u2026He hated himself for being incapable!He hated himself for not treating Li Xuan better!\u201cIs it painful?\u201dSeeing this, Duan Ling Xing laughed while looking at Duan Ling Tian with a mocking expression.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t say anything, but the gaze with which he looked at Duan Ling Xing was filled with a bloodthirsty coldness, and his body emitted a bloodthirsty killing intent.This killing intent suffused itself into the air, causing Duan Ling Xing expression to change. He subconsciously moved a step backwards.Duan Ling Xing was, after all, only a twenty-something-year-old young man.How could he all of a sudden be able to withstand Duan Ling Tian\u2019s bloody-thirsty killing intent from his infinite massacres in his previous life\u2026\u201cTrash!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up coldly, as if ridiculing Duan Ling Xing\u2019s cowardice.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Xing\u2019s expression turned grim. Never had he expected that he would be forced to step backwards by the imposing manner of a fifteen-year-old. The embarrassment made him instantly made him angry, then eight ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above him.A merciless palm strike was going straight towards Duan Ling Tian!\u201cYoung master!\u201dKe Er emitted a shrill and sorrowful cry\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just wanted to let my cousin repay some interest on that debt.\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dThe middle-aged man with a face full of stubble frowned and coldly shouted, \u201cLing Xing, if you want to act in such an unrestrained manner, you can scram back to the clan right now!\u201dDuan Ling Xing laughed dryly. \u201cFourth uncle, I won\u2019t say anymore.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Li Nan Feng, gritted his teeth, and said, \u201cPatriarch, hurry and take Li Xuan to see Grand Elder!\u201dOnly now did Li Nan Feng notice Li Xuan lying not too far from them. His face changed greatly as he carried Li Xuan and flew towards Grand Elder\u2019s residence.\u201cKe Er, Ke Er\u2026\u201dSubsequently, Duan Ling Tian came back to his senses and painfully crawled over to Ke Er, who was also crawling over to him. When he got close enough, he grabbed her hand and asked, \u201cKe Er, are you alright?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m fine.\u201dThe young girl firmly shook her head.Li Rou helped Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er up, then she took in a deep breath and looked towards the middle-aged man with the face full of stubble. \u201cTian, this is your fourth uncle.\u201d\u201cMom, I don\u2019t know him and I don\u2019t want to know him!\u201dDuan Ling Tian gazed coldly at the middle-aged man, his face full of disdain.\u201cTian, don\u2019t be disrespectful!\u201dLi Rou\u2019s willow-shaped eyebrows frowned.\u201cMom, respect is something that is given to a senior who is worthy of it\u2026 A person who doesn\u2019t treat their juniors fairly, on what grounds would I respect him on?\u201dDuan Ling Tian swept the middle-aged man with a cold and indifferent gaze.Ever since he appeared, the middle-aged man had not once reprimanded Duan Ling Xing. A person who wasn\u2019t impartial was unworthy of being his senior!\u201cFourth brother, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve spoiled Tian.\u201dLi Rou looked at the middle-aged man apologetically.\u201cThird sister in law, I understand; I don\u2019t blame Ling Tian.\u201dThe middle-aged man sighed before saying, \u201cWhat happened today was my fault. If only I hadn\u2019t suddenly felt the urge to come see third sister in law while I passed by Fresh Breeze Town, it wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 Never mind, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dThe middle-aged man looked apologetically at Duan Ling Tian as he finished speaking, then he took Duan Ling Xing and left.Before Duan Ling Xing left, he shot a cold and indifferent gaze at Duan Ling Tian. The corners of his mouth had a trace of a mocking smile of ridicule\u2026Crack\u2026crack\u2026crack\u2026crack\u2026crack\u2026Duan Ling Tian clenched his fist tightly. The sound of his bones rubbing against each other sounded constantly and his eyes were emitting a bloody-thirsty killing intent\u2026In his two lifetimes, it was the first time he had encountered such humiliation.This enmity and hatred was irreconcilable!Sooner or later, he will make Duan Ling Xing pay a hundred fold, a thousand fold!No matter who Duan Ling Xing was, no matter his identity, status, or the relationship between them\u2026Abruptly, as if he remembered something, Duan Ling Tian looked up towards his mother with an impatient expression. \u201cMom, I\u2019ll be going to Grand Elder\u2019s residence. I want to go see how Li Xuan is doing.\u201d\u201cTian, mom will support you and Ke Er back home to rest first,\u201d Li Rou said with concern.\u201cMom, I\u2019m aware of my injuries. I just need to get a grade nine Gold Injury Pill from Grand Elder and I\u2019ll be fine. You carry Ke Er back while I go see Li Xuan and bring Ke Er a grade nine Gold Injury Pill as well.\u201dAfter taking a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian released Li Rou\u2019s hand and gritted his teeth as he slowly walked away.\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d the young girl stubbornly said.\u201cKe Er, be obedient and go home.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young girl with a serious expression.Only then did the young girl nod. She went home with the support of Li Rou.Only after Duan Ling Tian arrived at the Grand Elder\u2019s residence and got a grade nine Gold Injury Pill from Li Huo did his injuries finally recover slightly.But he quickly noticed that Li Huo\u2019s face was getting uglier by the second, which made his heart jerk. \u201cGrand Elder, how\u2019s Li Xuan\u2019s injuries?\u201d\u201cXuan!\u201dJust when Li Huo was about to respond to Duan Ling Tian, a figure flashed into the room like the wind. When he noticed the blacked out Li Xuan, his expression became ugly. He looked towards Li Huo and said, \u201cGrand Elder, my son he\u2026\u201d\u201cLuckily, this kid has thick skin and thick flesh. His internal organs aren\u2019t injured, but his chest bone is almost completely shattered, so I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t last much longer\u2026\u201dLi Huo sighed.\u201cWhat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian and Fifth Elder Li Ting\u2019s faces both changed greatly.\u201cGrand Elder, is there any way to save him?\u201dLi Ting looked towards Li Huo. His heart was burning with anxiety.\u201cHe would survive if we gave him a Bone Formation Pill, but this pill went extinct years ago; I\u2019ve only seen it recorded in some ancient books.\u201dLi Huo shook his head with an expression of helplessness.Bone Formation Pill?When he heard this, Duan Ling Tian immediately searched through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories\u2026Eventually, he found the medicinal formula for the Bone Formation Pill.Duan Ling Tian looked toward Li Huo and said, \u201cGrand Elder, I have the Bone Formation Pill\u2019s medicinal formula!\u201d\u201cSplendid!\u201d Li Ting excitedly said. \u201cBut don\u2019t get happy too early. The Bone Formation Pill is a grade eight medicinal pill, so only a grade eight Alchemist or above is capable of refining it. Even if I have the medicinal formula, I\u2019m incapable of refining it\u2026\u201dLi Huo sighed, the difference between a Grade Eight Alchemist and a Grade Nine Alchemist was like the difference between heaven and earth.Subsequently, Li Huo looked at Duan Ling Tian. \u201cKid, in three days, can you get in contact with your teacher?\u201dTeacher?Duan Ling Tian was dazed.That grade seven Alchemist teacher of his was made up; there was no such person on this world.He could only laugh bitterly. \u201cGrand Elder, my teacher is secretive about his whereabouts. After passing on the medicinal formulas to me, he left Fresh Breeze Town and I have no way of finding him.\u201d\u201cThen I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Li Huo shook his head and sighed.\u201cGrand Elder, how long can my son hold on for?\u201d Li Ting asked.\u201cThree days at most.\u201d Li Huo replied.\u201cThree days?\u201d Li Ting\u2019s face changed greatly. \u201cThree days is too short. That\u2019s not enough time to notify his grandfather\u2026 Grand Elder, is there any way to prolong his life?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m powerless.\u201d Li Huo shook his head.\u201cI might have a way,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said before looking at Li Ting. \u201cFifth Elder, I can endeavour to lengthen Li Xuan\u2019s remaining time by a month, but can Li Xuan\u2019s grandfather find a grade eight Alchemist in such a short amount of time?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had long ago realized that Li Xuan\u2019s grandfather was no ordinary person, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he could invite a grade eight Alchemist over.\u201cI don\u2019t even need a month, half a month should be enough! Ling Tian, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dLi Ting turned around and walked out, only leaving behind his last sentence. He obviously trusted Duan Ling Tian without even a shred of doubt.The more he was like this, the more guilty Duan Ling Tian felt.\u201cKid, do you really have a way?\u201d Li Huo asked.\u201cGrand Elder, I have the medicinal formula for a type of medicinal liquid. As long as Li Xuan\u2019s body soaks in the liquid, it will be able to prolong his bones\u2019 vitality for another month,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cWhat materials are needed? I\u2019ll get someone to buy them.\u201d Li Huo\u2019s gaze shone.Duan Ling Tian wrote down the medicinal formula without further ado, including the medicinal material proportions. At this moment, he didn\u2019t care about concealing anything, and it was only a low grade medicinal formula anyway.Li Huo looked through the medicinal formula and couldn\u2019t help himself from gasping in admiration. \u201cMiraculous! Miraculous!\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, it\u2019s up to you.\u201dAfter finishing what he said, Duan Ling Tian got another grade nine Gold Injury Pill from Li Huo before leaving.Only after bringing the grade nine Gold Injury Pill home and confirming that Ke Er\u2019s injuries were not serious did he breathe a breath of relief.If anything had happened to Ke Er, he would never have forgiven himself.With Li Rou\u2019s Origin Energy assisting her to dissolve the pill, Ke Er\u2019s injuries were almost recovered by dusk.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s injuries were more serious, so he needed to rest for a few more days.\u201cTian, is Li Xuan alright?\u201dWhen she found out from Ke Er that Li Xuan also got injured, Li Rou was worried about Li Xuan\u2019s injuries.If it wasn\u2019t for Li Xuan, she might not have been able to see her son anymore in this lifetime.\u201cMom, he will be fine,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said seriously.\u201cMom believes you.\u201d Li Rou nodded.\u201cMom\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian looked towards his mother but hesitated to speak.He wanted to ask about the father he had never met, but he didn\u2019t know how to ask.\u201cTian, go back and rest. Mom will tell you about what you want to know tomorrow.Li Rou saw through Duan Ling Tian\u2019s thoughts.\u201cOK.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded before returning to his room to rest.Lying on his bed, Duan Ling Tian looked towards the ceiling. His eyes flashed coldly. \u201cI originally thought that with my current cultivation progress and my current natural talent, not even mentioning Fresh Breeze Town, even in the cities outside, there would not be many who could compete against me\u2026\u201d\u201cThat Duan Ling Xing is only twenty-something years old, but his cultivation has already stepped into the sixth level of the Core Formation stage. When he uses his full power, he is able to draw upon the forces of heaven and earth to develop eight ancient mammoth silhouettes! Today, if I hadn\u2019t used the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique to incline my body backwards in time, his first palm strike would have certainly killed me!\u201dAt this moment, only Duan Ling Tian realized how weak he was.Although he was able to kill a first level Core Formation martial artist out of luck, he was powerless against a sixth level Core Formation Duan Ling Xing.Even when he had attacked with Drawing Sword Arts at full strength, it was have easily been stopped by Duan Ling Xing.The difference in cultivation between him and Duan Ling Xing was like a chasm.\u201cDuan Ling Xing\u2026\u201dWhenever he thought of this name from now on, Duan Ling Tian would not be able to stop himself from having a flame burn in his heart and emitting a blood thirsty killing intent.For the first time ever, he strongly desired to kill a person.This desire was something he didn\u2019t experience even in his past life.After a moment, he thought about Li Xuan.To be honest, since the beginning, although he had accepted Li Xuan as a little brother on the surface, he was still a little distant from him in his heart.After all, in his previous life, he was betrayed by his best brother, causing him to be unable to easily trust a so called \u2018Brother\u2019.But this time, Li Xuan, with no regard for his own life, used his own body to help him block that lethal attack. This truly touched Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heartstrings\u2026At this moment, he really thought of Li Xuan as his brother!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was worn out from his journey. Following him was an old man in fine clothes.The old man had a face that reflected his experience in the vicissitudes of life, but in the middle of his brows, traces of worry could be seen.Under Li Ting\u2019s introduction, Duan Ling Tian found out that the old man was actually Li Xuan\u2019s grandfather, and a grade eight Alchemist.Now Duan Ling Tian finally understood why Li Xuan was so rich\u2026A grade eight Alchemist, someone who represented a huge amount of wealth!But the old man wasn\u2019t too amicable to Duan Ling Tian. His expression was grim as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian? I heard about how the only reason Li Xuan was injured is because of you. If anything happens to Li Xuan, I will not let you off!\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled bitterly. He was powerless to retort.Li Xuan was indeed injured because of him, and because of this he deeply felt guilty.After that, he took out the medicinal formula he had prepared earlier and passed it to the old man. \u201cSenior, this is the Bone Formation Pill\u2019s medicinal formula. We\u2019ve already prepared the medicinal materials, so you can start refining at any moment.\u201dThe old man took the medicinal formula. As he roughly looked through it, his murky eyes flashed with a brilliant light.Then Grand Elder Li Huo led him to a silent chamber.Starting pill refinement\u2026\u201cLing Tian, Xuan\u2019s grandfather has always been straightforward. What he said just now, don\u2019t take it to heart. \u201cFifth Elder gave Duan Ling Tian regretful smile.He never once blamed Duan Ling Tian for Li Xuan\u2019s injuries.He knew that it was his son\u2019s choice, and he would honor his son\u2019s choice; he even felt proud of his son\u2026From this incident, he noticed that his son had finally truly grown up and was able to take on responsibilities!\u201cFifth Elder, if you put it like that, I feel even guiltier. All of this only happened because of me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head, then his eyes flashed with a cold light. \u201cBut Li Xuan\u2019s enmity, one day, I will take revenge for him with my own two hands\u2026\u201d\u201cThat I believe.\u201dLi Ting nodded. He didn\u2019t have a shred of doubt.Three hours later, the old man finally walked out of the silent chamber.He fed the Bone Formation Pill to the fatty inside the medicinal bath.After he did so, he pressed his hand on Li Xuan\u2019s Dantian, causing vast amounts of Origin Energy to burst forth. This helped Li Xuan process the Bone Formation Pill.The people who were present could clearly see that Li Xuan\u2019s originally slightly sunken chest was slowly moving upwards, recovering to its normal state.After seeing this, the old man lightly slapped Li Xuan\u2019s chubby face, waking him up.For this period of time, to prevent Li Xuan from feeling pain, Grand Elder Li Huo gave him a type of medicinal pill which made him go into a deep sleep for half a month.For this past half month, Li Xuan\u2019s vitality was sustained only by relying upon the medicinal liquid.Suddenly, the little fatty woke up. After opening up his small eyes, he sat up with a perplexed expression.The first thing he saw was the familiar old man, so his eyes flashed with shock. \u201cGrandfather, how did you die too\u2026\u201dThe little fatty\u2019s first words on waking up caused the old man to be at a lost on whether to cry or laugh, so he then jokingly scolded, \u201cKid, you haven\u2019t seen your grandfather in so long, but you curse me the moment you see me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not dead?\u201dThe little fatty had an expression of disbelief as he pinched his arm and thigh.Only now did he realize that he really wasn\u2019t dead. He couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. \u201cI\u2019m really not dead! Grandfather, what\u2019s going on? Don\u2019t tell me what happened earlier was only a dream?\u201d\u201cYou stinking kid, you\u2019re not dreaming!\u201d Li Ting jokingly scolded.When he saw his son wake up, his heart, which was in his throat, finally eased up.Seeing this scene, Duan Ling Tian, who was standing at the door, let out a breathe of relief, then the corners of his mouth curled into a slight smile.He didn\u2019t want to disturb Li Xuan\u2019s family reunion, so he went home alone and entered his room.While lying there on the bed, his eyes flickered and Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze became slightly misted\u2026Thinking back to what his mother told him half a month ago, he still felt it to be unbelievable.It turned out that his father was a member of the Duan Clan in the Imperial City. Out of the direct line of disciples of the same generation, he was ranked number three, and he was one the Duan Clan\u2019s rare Martial Dao geniuses\u2026At the age of sixteen, he broke through to the Core Formation stage;At age twenty, he broke through to the Origin Core stage;At age twenty seven, he succeeded in stepping into the Nascent Soul stage!When his father broke through to the Nascent Soul stage, his mother got pregnant with him.But just at this time, a piece of grievous news reached the Duan Clan, overturning everything that was happy\u2026His father had brought along a few Duan Clan disciples and entered a mysterious place, but he never came out!The only reason his father went to that place was to find a type of medicinal catalyst called Serene Epiphyllum for his mother. He was going to invite an alchemist to refine it into a Breath of Life Pill for Li Rou to consume.With Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian naturally knew what a Breath of Life Pill was.It was an extremely rare medicinal pill. If consumed by a pregnant women, it would not only allow the fetus to be impervious to diseases, it would even be able to use the fetus\u2019s congenital Qi to help the mother alter her constitution and even increase her natural talent in the Martial Dao.This proved that everything his father did was for his mother and him.But unfortunately, his father paid the price of his life for his efforts.At least, all of the Duan Clan people thought of it that way\u2026His father was the backbone of their family. With his father being missing, it meant that the backbone of their family had crumbled.Some of the people who used to be envious of his father started use any means possible to create difficulties for his mother\u2026His mother was worried about the safety of Duan Ling Tian, who was still inside her belly, so in the end, she chose to return to her family, which was Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li family.As for Duan Ling Xing\u2026Duan Ling Xing\u2019s father was his father\u2019s second brother.Although both were direct line disciples, but they didn\u2019t have any blood relations.Duan Ling Xing\u2019s father was always arrogant and conceited, and he was always envious of his father.Once in a just and honorable sparring match, Duan Ling Xing\u2019s father continued to be overbearing even when he was losing.In the end, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s father accidentally crippled Duan Ling Xing\u2019s father\u2019s Dantian.\u201cLike father like son; equally arrogant and conceited!\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up in a sneer, his eyes emitting killing intent.At the same time, when he realize how difficult it must have been for his mother all those years ago, he felt even more heartache for her\u2026Even though he was actually the Weapons Specialist Ling Tian from Earth, after merging with the old Duan Ling Tian\u2019s memories, he had long ago become the real Duan Ling Tian. There was now no distinction between the two.So he felt all of this as if it happened to himself.\u201cI never thought that I had such a great father. If only he was still alive. But unfortunately\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh. His father has been missing without a trace for a full sixteen years.The chances of him being alive were extremely tiny.Sixteen years of time; if his father was still alive, he should have long ago come to look for his mother and him.\u201cDuan Ru Feng!\u201dHe deeply remembered this name in his heart.This was the name of his father\u2026\u201cBoss, Boss!\u201dWhile Duan Ling Tian was still pondering, a familiar cry sounded from outside.In the past, when he heard this voice, he would feel annoyed.But now his face had a warm smile.As he walked out of his room, Duan Ling Tian saw the little fatty who looked as if nothing had happened to him. \u201cYou just recovered and need to rest properly. If you want anything, you can wait until after you\u2019ve recovered.\u201d\u201cBoss, I heard everything from my dad. Thank you. If it wasn\u2019t for you, then I wouldn\u2019t be alive anymore.\u201dLittle fatty rubbed the back of his head as he smiled slyly.\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. You only got injured to save me. What I did was only to make amends.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.Recalling the scene from half a month ago, his eyes could not help but flash with a trace of being moved.\u201cThat day, why did you block that palm strike for me?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked the little fatty.\u201cEven I don\u2019t know.\u201d The little fatty smiled embarrassedly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think too much at that time; all I thought was that if Boss dies, then no one would teach me the inscription technique in the future\u2026 Grandfather said that I don\u2019t have the talent to be an alchemist, so if I want to earn big money, then I can only become an inscription master.\u201d\u201cYou scoundrel. So the reason you learned the inscription technique was to earn big money,\u201d Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but jokingly scold.\u201cBoss, I told you the truth. You won\u2019t stop teaching me the inscription technique, right?\u201d the little fatty asked worriedly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry; as long as you want to learn, even if you\u2019re as dumb as a log, I\u2019ll make you enlightened!\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.He quickly noticed the little fatty walking towards him, extending his hand, and touching him on the forehead\u2026\u201cDamn fatty, what are you doing?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned.\u201cBoss, you don\u2019t have a fever\u2026\u201dLittle fatty blinked his small eyes with an expression of disbelief.After hearing what he said, Duan Ling Tian shot him an angry stare.This damn fatty was really a contemptible wretch. He couldn\u2019t endure others being nice to him\u2026\u201cOh right, boss, my grandfather asked me to pass these silver bills to you.\u201dThe little fatty took out a stack of silver bills. There were at least a few hundred of them, each being a one thousand denomination.\u201cMy grandfather said that you can take it as payment for your Bone Formation Pill medicinal formula. There\u2019s a total of 100,000, Boss; you can count it.\u201dLittle fatty passed over the silver bills to Duan Ling Tian, but he noticed that Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t intent on receiving them. \u201cBoss, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.Although he lacked money, he knew what money he should take and what money he shouldn\u2019t.Li Xuan saved his life; this was more than enough for him to expend everything to repay Li Xuan, so it would be impossible for him to take Li Xuan\u2019s money.\u201cBoss, you should keep it,\u201d The little fatty said again. He guessed the reason why the usually money-loving Duan Ling Tian would reject it.\u201cWhat, you\u2019ve made so much progress that you don\u2019t have to listen to what your Boss says anymore?\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the little fatty a stare and started acting like he was angry.When little fatty saw this, he instantly waned. He put the silver bills back in his pocket.\u201cEnough, hurry up and scram back home to rest! In a few days, I\u2019ll come by your house and teach you inscriptions.\u201dDuan Ling Tian drove the little fatty out of the courtyard and let out a breath of relief.Luckily, Li Xuan was alright. If he wasn\u2019t Duan Ling Tian would\u2019ve blame himself for his entire life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her beautiful face was filled with tender love.\u201cKe Er, did you hear? We are going to be adults soon, so we can give birth to a grandson for mom to play with,\u201d the youth said to the young girl beside him.Her face instantly blushed bright red as she embarrassedly lowered her head. She was speechless.\u201cStinking brat, you really have a wild imagination!\u201d Li Rou gave the youth a stare and then continued saying, \u201cA granddaughter isn\u2019t bad either. She will be as beautiful as Ke Er in the future\u2026.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian saw his mother with a serious face, he stopped making fun of her, but once he heard the second half of what she said, he was thoroughly speechless.Could it be that it was hereditary?\u201cDid you hear that? Ninth Elder is going to hold her grandchildren soon. If you don\u2019t lose weight after the coming of age ceremony, I\u2019ll break your legs! With your current figure, what girl would dare to marry you?\u201dNearby, Fifth Elder Li Ting chided little fatty, who was beside him. The latter had an innocent expression as he looked at the instigator with resentment.Duan Ling Tian turned his head away, ignoring him.The coming of age ceremony was held by Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s three families once a year. The people who took part were all those youths and young girls who had recently turned sixteen\u2026 After today, Duan Ling Tian, Ke Er, and Li Xuan would be sixteen.In the Chen family\u2019s estate, Chen family disciples were surrounding the spacious Martial Arts Practice Hall.The Chen family\u2019s, the Li family\u2019s, and the Fang family\u2019s Patriarchs were all standing on the high stage. They were responsible for presiding over today\u2019s coming of age ceremony.The coming of age ceremony was no more than a simple ceremony. The most important part of it was the \u201cFriendly Battle\u201d after the ceremony.The so called Friendly Battle was a martial arts spar between the youths and young girls of Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s three families that attended the coming of age ceremony. At the end, the top ten, top three, and top one youths would be decided. They would receive prizes that were prepared respectively by the three families.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Duan Ling Tian?\u201dJust when over one hundred youths and young girls were gathered in the martial arts practice hall, some hawk-eyed Chen family disciples recognized one of the youths standing inside.\u201cRight, Duan Ling Tian happens to be participating in this year\u2019s coming of age ceremony.\u201d\u201cLooks like there isn\u2019t any suspense in this year\u2019s Friendly Battle; Duan Ling Tian will undoubtedly take first place!\u201d\u201cThat is certain. I\u2019m afraid no one would even dare fight him.\u201d\u2026\u2026The Chen family disciples started discussing.\u201cHe\u2019s Duan Ling Tian?\u2019One of the Chen family disciples looked at the youth from afar and was stupefied.Wasn\u2019t this youth the one that came to their Chen family weapon store to buy materials the other day? Wasn\u2019t he the one with a possibility of being backed by a weapon craftsman?The coming of age ceremony officially started!After the simple ceremony were the speeches from the three families\u2019 Patriarchs. They were no more than some words of encouragement\u2026\u201cSo boring.\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. He nearly fell asleep from hearing the speeches, causing the young girl beside him to be unable to contain herself and laugh while covering her mouth.The little fatty standing on the other side of Duan Ling Tian asked, in a low voice, \u201cBoss, can I use inscriptions in the friendly battle after the coming of age ceremony?\u201d\u201cBesides our Li Family members, using it on anyone else is up to you,\u201d Duan Ling Tian lazily said.\u201cBoss, if it\u2019s not the Li Family members, there\u2019s no reason for me to use inscriptions\u2026\u201dThe little fatty was so anxious that he seemed like he was about to cry.He could easily win against the youths and young girls of the Chen and Fang families, but the problem was that a few of the Li family\u2019s elder\u2019s children were also participating in the coming of age ceremony.Towards these few people, he was not confident!\u201cWho asked you to be lazy!?\u201dGiving the little fatty a stare, Duan Ling Tian felt fairly helpless.Although he concocted the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for Li Xuan, Li Xuan had an untamed disposition. He was completely unable to calm himself down and cultivate, which was why he was still only at the fourth level of the Body Tempering stage.The other elders\u2019 children that participated in the coming of age ceremony, although they only had the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, they had all stepped into the fifth level of the Body Tempering stage now.\u201cForget it. I have no chance of getting into the top three, but I should be able to get in the top ten.\u201dThe little fatty was quickly able to accept his fate.Gaining a place in the top three to him was just a matter of gaining face; he did not care about the extra prizes in the least.Finally, as the speeches of the three Patriarchs ended, the friendly battle finally officially began!The youths and young girls of the three families that participated in the coming of age ceremony amounted to a total of 121 people. They were divided into two divisions with sixty groups per division. This was to carry out the first round of the elimination battles.But this year\u2019s friendly battle had Duan Ling Tian, so it was bound to different\u2026After the three families\u2019 Patriarchs had a discussion, even though the Fang family\u2019s Patriarch wasn\u2019t extremely willing, he had to acknowledge Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength. They decided to directly award Duan Ling Tian this year\u2019s friendly battle\u2019s first place position!The youths and young girls present had no objections to this decision.What a joke! Duan Ling Tian had only just recently killed a first level Core Formation martial artist, so if he really participated in the friendly battle and they encountered Duan Ling Tian as their opponent, they would unconditionally concede.Fighting with an abnormal person like Duan Ling Tian was absolutely asking to be abused!Duan Ling Tian had surpassed the people of the same age in Fresh Breeze Town a long time ago.\u201cBoss, it must be so enjoyable for you. You don\u2019t even have to fight in the arena and can directly go to the top at get first place!\u201dThe little fatty, with his number 32 tag in hand, looked at Duan Ling Tian with an expression of jealousy and admiration.Ignoring the little fatty, Duan Ling Tian looked towards the young girl beside him and asked, \u201cKe Er, what number are you?\u201d\u201cNumber 7.\u201dThe young girl lightly smiled.After a short while, the friendly battle began.Seeing the youths and young girls throwing kicks and punches towards each other, Duan Ling Tian started to feel drowsy again.Only when it was Ke Er\u2019s turn did he slightly regain some spirit.The moment Ke Er went into the arena, she stood there gracefully.Due to her elegant and refined figure with a face like an angel, she quickly drew the attention of everyone\u2026\u201cSo beautiful!\u201d\u201cIf I could marry a wife like her, I would be willing to have my life shortened by ten years.\u201cStop daydreaming. Don\u2019t you know your own limitations? That is Duan Ling Tian\u2019s woman.\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding Chen family youths\u2019 eyes were shining, greedily staring at the young girl in the arena.\u201cEight level of the Body Tempering stage!\u201dOn the high stage, including the Li family\u2019s Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, all three family Patriarchs were dumbstruck as they saw through the young girl\u2019s cultivation with a glance.Ke Er\u2019s opponent was a slightly timid youth whose cultivation was at the third level of the Body Tempering stage. The youth\u2019s attacks were straight and normal, and after being knocked back with a casual palm strike from Ke Er, he conceded.From start to finish, Ke Er never used a martial skill\u2026Of course, the main reason was that Ke Er didn\u2019t know any martial skills.It wasn\u2019t because Duan Ling Tian was stingy; he gave her such a top ranked cultivation method like Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique after all. He just didn\u2019t care about other ordinary martial skills, and he didn\u2019t want Ke Er to split her focus.At this moment, one of the Chen family\u2019s elders fixedly stared at the young girl who was walking down the arena and exclaimed, \u201cEight level of the Body Tempering stage!\u201dHearing what he said, the surrounding Chen family disciples were instantly petrified!This young girl who had only recently turned sixteen was an eighth level Body Tempering martial artist?The entire martial arts practice hall quickly found out about the young girl\u2019s cultivation level, and everyone who heard about it became petrified, only regaining their senses after a long time.Everyone was looking towards the beautiful young girl who was embarrassedly chatting with Duan Ling Tian.\u201cShe is an eighth level Body Tempering martial artist? You\u2019re kidding, right\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was Third Elder who said so. Do you think he would be joking?\u201d\u201cF**k! Not only is this Duan Ling Tian himself a freak, even the people beside him are freaks!\u201d\u2026\u2026The friendly battle progressed like a raging fire. When dusk arrived later that day, the final result was out.First, Duan Ling Tian.Second, Ke Er.Third, Li Sheng.Fourth, Li Ke.Fifth, Li Qiu.Sixth, Li Xuan.\u2026\u2026Out of the top ten, the first six were all Li family members!The Li family\u2019s Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, had a face full of smiles. It was not one bit unexpected to him.The Chen family\u2019s Patriarch, Chen Li, had an astonished expression. Never had he thought that there would be such a result.The Fang family\u2019s Patriarch, Fang Yi, had a gloomy expression. In the top ten, the Fang family only took one spot.Next was the award ceremony.For first place, Duan Ling Tian received three hundred silver coins and two Body Tempering Pills.For second and third place, Ke Er and Li Sheng received two hundred silver coins and one Body Tempering Pill each.The other seven people only received a hundred silver coins.\u201cStingy, too stingy!\u201dDuan Ling Tian received the first prize which many people were jealous of, but he had an unsatisfied expression as he casually put the money in his pocket.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dMeanwhile, Ke Er cutely gave her prize to Duan Ling Tian.For a moment, the surrounding fiery gazes looked like they we going to burn Duan Ling Tian\u2026At a corner of the martial arts practice hall, Chen Mei Er, who was like the bright moon surrounded by stars, looked at the nearby couple while lightly biting her lips.When she looked at the young girl, her clear eyes flashed with a trace of jealousy and envy.As night fell, the coming of age ceremony came to an end.Both the Fang and Chen families\u2019 Patriarchs called for an emergency meeting that night. The purpose of the meeting was naturally to discuss the performance of the Li family\u2019s youths and young girls today.Out of the top ten spots of the friendly battle, six were taken by one family.In the history of Fresh Breeze Town, this was something that had never happened before!When something unusual happened, there was surely something strange going on!For a period of time after this, the two families started to investigate the ins and outs of the Li Family in secret.But in the end, all their efforts were for naught. They did not succeed in finding out anything.Li family estate, inside the audience hall.Patriarch Li Nan Feng looked at the youth and young girl in front of him as he said, \u201cLing Tian, Ke Er, the reason I called you here today is because I have a matter to discuss with you two.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, go ahead.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows raised.Li Nan Feng slowly said, \u201cWith the current accomplishments of you two, there are things which I can tell you now\u2026 Actually, our Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li family is only the branch family of Aurora City\u2019s Li Clan.Duan Ling Tian was slightly shocked.He had heard about Aurora City and he knew that there was a Li family there.He also knew that it was one of the big clans in Aurora City. Compared to Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li family, they were undoubtedly a colossus.But he never would have thought that Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li family and Aurora City\u2019s Li family had a relationship, nor that they were their branch family.Li Nan Feng continued, \u201cThe main clan has a rule for branch family disciples: any disciples who are alchemists, weapons craftsmen, inscription masters, or are able to step into the seventh level of the Body Tempering stage before the age of eighteen are eligible to enter the main clan and make a place for themselves in the main clan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When you\u2019re free, you can come visit any time.\u201dLi Rou gently smiled as she consoled him.\u201cOK.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.A few days ago, Patriarch Li Nan Feng called him and Ke Er to see him because he wanted to recommend them to the main clan.Only at the main clan would they have a better future.Fresh Breeze Town was too small.The beginning of the journey was quite calm\u2026After leaving Fresh Breeze Town for an afternoon\u2019s time, Li Rou\u2019s willow-shaped eyebrows slightly twitched as she said, in a low voice, \u201cLooks like some people don\u2019t want to let us go to Aurora City.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMom, is it the Fang family?\u201dThe horse carriage shook as it abruptly stopped.\u201cMa\u2026Madam\u2026\u201d the carriage driver called with slightly shaky voice.Drawing up the carriage\u2019s curtain, Duan Ling Tian instantly saw the person who was blocking their way, and his face instantly distorted!An old man was standing there.It was the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder, Fang Jun.He was at the seventh level of the Core Formation stage, one of the three publically acknowledged strongest people of Fresh Breeze Town.\u201cFang Jun!\u201dLi Rou got off the carriage. Her clear eyes were filled with an icy coldness and her voice was suppressed to a very low and grim tone. \u201cMy son has already decided to leave Fresh Breeze Town. He won\u2019t threaten your Fang family anymore, so why are you still being so overbearing?\u201d\u201cThe Fang family needs his blood to wash away our shame.\u201dFang Jun\u2019s reply was simple, emitting his determination to kill Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKe Er, you stay in the carriage.\u201d Duan Ling Tian said to the young girl before following his mother out of the carriage. He clenched his fists as his cold gaze was fixed on Fang Jun.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, don\u2019t worry; today I will send both you and your mother to hell, so you two can be companions in the netherworld.\u201dFang Jun looked towards Duan Ling Tian with a gaze as if looking at a dead man.Li Rou took a deep breath and anxiously said, \u201cTian, take Ke Er and leave right now!\u201dEven if she exerted all her strength, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for long against Fang Jun.\u201cMom, if we leave, we leave together.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s tone was extremely firm.\u201cEnough arguing\u2026 Today, none of you will be able to leave!\u201dFang Jun laughed coldly, then he stepped on the ground and flew out like lightning. His hands were thrusting forward like a roc unfolding its wings, enveloping both Duan Ling Tian and his mother.Ten ancient mammoth silhouettes emerged above his head\u2026Whoosh!Li Rou gracefully stomped the ground as she flew out to intercept his attack.Above her head were six ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026The three-foot-long sword in her hand unsheathed!Sword Drawing Arts!Whoosh!A sword shine flashed by at the exact moment Fang Jun raised his hand to block, tearing open his sleeves.\u201cWhat a marvelous sword skill!\u201dFang Jun\u2019s gaze flickered, then he struck with a palm strike that was like a mountain.Bang!Li Rou\u2019s jade-like hands shook and her delicate body trembled. A sweetness could be tasted in her mouth as her Fine Steel Sword\u2019s blade was broken into two by Fang Jun\u2019s palm strike.\u201cMom!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face changed greatly.Whoosh!Spirit Serpent Movement Technique! Duan Ling Tian seemed to have transformed into a spirit serpent as he went straight for Fang Jun.Sword Drawing Arts!A strand of violet that was locked on to Fang Jun\u2019s throat whistled through the air.\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating yourself!\u201dFang Jun was disdainful as he swung out his sleeve, sweeping Duan Ling Tian and his sword aside.\u201cDie!\u201dFang Jun\u2019s palms blasted through the air and came down towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest\u2026If he was hit by this attack, he would undoubtedly die!\u201cTian!\u201dLi Rou\u2019s face changed greatly. She wanted to save him, but there wasn\u2019t enough time.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dThe young girl jumped down from the carriage, disregarding everything as she rushed towards Duan Ling Tian. Her clear eyes were filled with tears and her heart felt like there was a dagger twisting within it.Bang!In the nick of time, a figure flew out from the lush trees on the side of the road, arriving in front of Duan Ling Tian and countering Fang Jun\u2019s palm strike head on with evenly matched strength.Above the head of the person were ten similar ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026\u201cGrand Elder!\u201dAfter he stabilized himself, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze shone brightly as he recognized the person that arrived.It was indeed the Li family\u2019s Grand Elder Li Huo.He knew that since Grand Elder has arrived, the danger that fell upon him could be considered as resolved.\u201cLi Huo, I didn\u2019t think that the dignified Li family\u2019s Grand Elder would actually be the escort for a disciple with another surname. Looks like this disciple with another surname has an extraordinary status in your Li Family\u2026\u201dAfter Li Huo\u2019s arrived, Fang Jun knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill Duan Ling Tian today.\u201cFang Jun, you\u2019re an old man, but you do not respect yourself and commit indecent actions. For actually trying to kill my Li family\u2019s disciple, today you will undoubtedly die!\u201dLi Huo\u2019s gaze seemed to be spitting fire from his extreme rage.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart felt warm. This was the first time he could ever recall the Grand Elder being so enraged.\u201cLi Huo, our strengths are comparable; even if you include Li Rou, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t able to stop me prevent me from escaping,\u201d Fang Jun said disdainfully.\u201cIf the two of them aresn\u2019t enough, how about if you include me?\u201dJust at this moment, two more figures revealed themselves and surrounded Fang Jun.\u201cPatriarch Chen.\u201dOut of the two people that appeared, Duan Ling Tian recognized one of them; it was the Chen family\u2019s Patriarch, Chen Li.The other person was an old man who seemed to be full of spirit and energy.\u201cChen Kun, this matter is between the Fang Family and Li Family, I hope you don\u2019t interfere in the matter.\u201dSeeing the old man, Fang Jun\u2019s face finally changed and he angrily shouted, \u201cChen Kun?\u201dThe Chen family\u2019s Grand Elder? Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze shone brightly.Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s strongest three were gathered here.\u201cFang Jun, you\u2019re wrong; this is a matter between my Chen family and the Li family with your Fang family.\u201dChen Kun smiled indifferently.\u201cYou all\u2026.\u201dFang Kun\u2019s expression was grim. He couldn\u2019t believe that all of this was real. \u201cChen Kun, what did the Li family give you that is valuable enough to persuade you to partner up with them and make a move against me?\u201d\u201cThe Chen family\u2019s future\u2026\u201dLi Kun only said five words, and at the moment he finished, his figure moved, abruptly attacking!Above his head, the energy of heaven and earth shook as it materialized ten ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026Whoosh!Li Huo, Li Ruo, and Chen Li followed behind, attacking.The four of them attacked in unison. Ancient mammoths were shaking in the air as they whistled out to suppress Fang Jun!In a moment, Fang Jun was in a disadvantageous position. After being hit by Li Huo\u2019s palm strike, his body started trembling. The hit made him he shoot out like an arrow leaving the bowstring, fiercely falling upon the ground. After spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, he was unable to continue fighting.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Fang Jun started laughing. His gaze was filled with coldness as he looked towards Chen Kun and Chen Li. With a voice as cold as ice, he said, \u201cYou two are really muddle-headed. Based on the Li family\u2019s disciples\u2019 performance during the coming of age ceremony, it won\u2019t be long before the Li family rises above you\u2026 You two are digging your own graves!\u201d\u201cFang Jun, you don\u2019t have to drive a wedge between us; the Li family was already planning to share their secret with our Chen family\u2026 And the conditions were to kill you!\u201dChen Kun sneered as he saw through Fang Jun\u2019s intentions, then his figure moved as if transforming into a fierce tiger, and pounced downwards to kill the heavily injured Fang Jun.At the moment of his death, Fang Jun\u2019s eyes were filled with a startled expression.Hearing what Chen Kun said, Duan Ling Tian seemed as if he had thought of something\u2026\u201cThank you Patriarch Chen, Elder Kun.\u201dLi Rou hurriedly thanked the two Chen family members before signaling with her eyes to Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s thanks followed.\u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201dThe young girl\u2019s tears had not dried yet, and her expression was full of concern.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dDuan Ling Tian casually grabbed the young girl\u2019s hand then lightly pinched her palm, comforting her.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if Elder Huo hadn\u2019t told me, I wouldn\u2019t have known that you have a grade seven Alchemist for a teacher.\u201dChen Li glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, your teacher is also a weapons craftsman, right?\u201dWeapons craftsmen?Duan Ling Tian was dazed. He didn\u2019t know what Chen Li meant by this.Li Rou and Li Huo looked towards Duan Ling Tian. Even they didn\u2019t know about this.\u201cA few months ago, you came to our Chen family weapon store to buy some materials. They were for weapon crafting, right?\u201dChen Li smiled lightly, as if he could see through Duan Ling Tian with a glance.Duan Ling Tian finally saw the light.So it was this matter\u2026However, the materials he bought weren\u2019t for weapon crafting but for inscriptions.Of course, he would not say this.\u201cPatriarch Chen, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve guessed wrong. The materials I bought were for my teacher to refine grade seven medicinal pills, not for weapon crafting.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.As far as he knew, no one present besides him was knowledgeable about a grade seven Alchemist\u2019s ability, so no matter what nonsense he spouted, no one would be able to discern truth from lies.As expected, Chen Li nodded in realization. \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a genius, as expected. With you, the Li family has a good chance at prospering, and my Chen family will be able to benefit from being allies with the Li Family.\u201dChen Kun glanced at Duan Ling Tian before lightly smiling.\u201cElder Kun, you flatter me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled modestly.\u201cSince the matter is resolved, it\u2019s time for us to take our leave,\u201d Chen Kun said as he left with Chen Li.Their figures quickly disappeared at the end of the road.\u201cKid, I decided by myself and promised the Chen family that after every fixed period of time, we will sell them some Six Treasures Body Tempering liquid\u2026 You won\u2019t blame me, right?\u201dLi Huo smiled towards Duan Ling Tian.It was this promise that made the Chen family willing to join hands with him and kill the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder.Duan Ling Tian had already passed the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid medicinal formula to Li Huo before leaving.\u201cGrand Elder, you must be joking; if you hadn\u2019t made your move today, I would have certainly died! The Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid formula can be used by Grand Elder however you please.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.To him, there was nothing more important that his family and his own life\u2026Moreover, as far as he was concerned, trading the Six Treasures Body Tempering liquid for the Fang family\u2019s Grand Elder\u2019s life was extremely worth it!\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t blame me, it\u2019s fine. Now that Fang Jun is dead, your journey should be safe\u2026 Remember, once you reach the main clan, compete whenever possible, because only when you reveal your worth will the main clan put effort into fostering your growth.\u201dLi Huo warned Duan Ling Tian before taking his leave.Duan Ling Tian nodded, remembering Li Huo\u2019s words.The following journey went smoothly and unhindered. They met a few bandits on the way, but they were easily scared off by Li Rou.At dusk, they finally reached their destination.Aurora City!A city that was ten times the size of Fresh Breeze Town.The city walls were ancient, emitting an aura that seemed to have experienced many events.Inside the city, horse carriages could be seen moving about. The stream of people and carriages was never-ending; this place was bustling with noise and excitement.\u201cSo busy\u2026\u201dWhen the young girl looked out of the carriage window, her clear eyes shined with a trace of brilliance and her mood was elated.On the other hand, Duan Ling Tian had a composed expression.Although Aurora City was busy, he had visited nearly every large city on Earth, and those large cities were something that Aurora City could not compare to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Collapsing Fist?Translator: / KurazyTolanzuraytor Editor: LucasOnly after arriving at the main clan did Duan Ling Tian understand how small Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s cranch family really was.In the branch family, when counting all disciples with the Li surname and disciples with different surnames, the total amount of people was around two hundred.The resources they controlled was only one third of Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s marketplace. Even the poor iron mine outside the town had to be shared with the other two families.However, the Li family\u2019s main clan was a large clan that contained thousands of members!Besides that, the clan controlled many stores in the busy areas of Aurora City, large plots of lands, and various ore veins\u2026The difference between the two was like heaven and earth!With his and Ke Er\u2019s eighth level Body Tempering cultivation, they were able to tower above the rest in Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li branch family.But in the main clan, their accomplishments weren\u2019t really exceptional.In the Li family\u2019s main clan, although stepping into the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage at sixteen was not common, but there were still people capable of it; there were even some who were at the ninth level at age seventeen.\u201cThey are worthy of being the Main Clan; they\u2019re wealthy and possess an extraordinary air.Duan Ling Tian sighed.The main clan disciples did not lack Body Tempering Pills and pills similar to the Thunder Flame Pill.In the Li branch family, not many people could afford Body Tempering Pills.But in the main clan, as long as the parents weren\u2019t lazy people, they would be able to afford to unceasingly provide their children with Body Tempering Pills and Thunder Flame Pills.As the main clan, the Aurora City Li family occupied a vast area, around half the size of Fresh Breeze Town.The Aurora City Li family disciples were separated into inner court disciples and outer court disciples.Each group was provided different treatment.People like Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er, who had just arrived at the Li family main clan, they would be outer court disciples, able to receive thirty silver coins a month each.\u201cYou two are better off than me. In Fresh Breeze Town, I only receive no more than twenty silver coins as my monthly compensation.\u201dAs Li Rou tidied up the courtyard the main clan provided to Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er, she sighed emotionally.\u201cMom, these thirty silver coins isn\u2019t easily received; branch family disciples must become inner court disciples by the age of nineteen, or else they will be sent back to the branch family.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled.Subsequently, he started sizing up the courtyard in and out, and was quite satisfied.The courtyard allocated to them was slightly larger than other small courtyards due to the fact that the two of them were living together, and thus there were three rooms.Normally, the small courtyards allocated to branch family disciples would only have two rooms.\u201cYoung Master, you will surely be able to become an inner court disciple,\u201d the young girl who was helping Li Rou said confidently to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKe Er, you should say \u2018both of us.\u2019\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled, extremely confident.\u201cTian, at the main clan you have to be even more hard-working. On the way here, Mom noticed many main clan disciples staring at Ke Er; if you don\u2019t work hard, she might get taken away.\u201dLi Rou teased Duan Ling Tian.Before Duan Ling Tian could say anything, the young girl got anxious first. \u201cMadam, I won\u2019t.\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at his mother complacently. She shook her head and sighed. \u201cI really wonder what love potion you gave Ke Er.\u201dWith the three of them working together, the courtyard and rooms were quickly tidied up.\u201cMom, you take a rest, I\u2019ll take Ke Er to look around.\u201dAfter notifying Li Rou, Duan Ling Tian brought the young girl and left the courtyard.Unknowingly, the two of them had arrived at the main clan\u2019s outer court martial arts practice field.On the martial arts practice field, many outer court disciples were diligently cultivating their martial arts; some used fists, some used palms, and some even used swords\u2026The appearance of the couple instantly drew the attention of many eyes.Even more gazes fell upon the young girl.The young girl\u2019s long, jet black hair was tied up into a bun and her elegant face was like a bloomed lotus flower that emitted an enticing, bright, red glow, delicate and charming.Willow-shaped eyebrows, apricot-shaped eyes, fine nose, red lips; everything combined equaled a flawless beauty.Her slightly inflated chest was like a budding flower, as if it would blood at any moment.Her slender and delicate waist that could be embraced with a single hand, raised and round buttocks, slender and long beautiful legs, made her look even more slim and graceful, incurring everyone\u2019s fondness.\u201cSince when did our outer court have such a beautiful little girl?\u201dAt the other end of the martial arts practice field, in a group of youths who had gathered to brag to each other, saliva was flying out of a youth\u2019s mouth. His eyes suddenly shone as his gaze fell upon the young girl, unable to move an inch.\u201cProbably just arrived from the branch family.A youth guessed.\u201cShe\u2019s too beautiful, not one bit inferior to Li Shi Shi.\u201dAnother youth\u2019s eyes shone as saliva came out of the corner of his mouth.Half a year ago, Li Shi Shi was a branch family disciple that arrived at Aurora City\u2019s main branch. She was publically acknowledged as the outer court\u2019s number one beauty.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go make friends with her.\u201dThe green-clothed youth quickly walked over.\u201cLi Xiao, I think she\u2019s taken,\u201d the youth that followed behind him said.Li Xiao disdainfully replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a new face as well. He\u2019s probably from the same branch family as her. You guys aren\u2019t such big pu**sies that you\u2019re even afraid of a branch family disciple, right?\u201d\u201cOf course we aren\u2019t afraid!\u201dImmediately, the group of people followed behind Li Xiao and walked over.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er were walking shoulder to shoulder as they passed the martial arts practice field.The group of youths walking over suddenly caused Duan Ling Tian to frown, but he ignored them and continued walking forward.The green-clothed youth in the front walked in big strides and blocked in front of Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced coldly at the green-clothed youth, his voice cold and indifferent.However, the green-clothed youth disregarded Duan Ling Tian.Li Xiao looked towards the young girl with a face full of smiles. \u201cYou must be the branch family disciples that just arrived at the main clan, right? I\u2019m Li Xiao, a main clan disciple.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Li Xiao\u2019s expression was filled with a sense of pride.Under the astounded gazes of Li Xiao and the youths following behind him, the young girl ignored them and instead looked towards the youth beside her. \u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s leave.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled and nodded, preparing to go around the group of people.\u201cStay right there!\u201dLi Xiao couldn\u2019t remain calm because he felt ashamed. Looking towards the young girl, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a main clan disciple; are you really not going to give me any face?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes emitted a cold light as he said, in a cold and indifferent tone, \u201cFace isn\u2019t something you gain by relying on others to give to it you; it is fight for by yourself\u2026 If there\u2019s nothing else, f**k off!\u201dF**k off?Li Xiao was struck dumb. He thought that he heard wrong. He looked backwards towards one of the youths. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear wrong, right? He asked me to f**k off?\u201dThe youth nodded. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear wrong; he asked you to f**k off.\u201dLi Xiao become extremely furious. \u201cKid, I want to fight you!\u201d he shouted loudly.The shout immediately attracted the attention of most of the people in the martial arts practice field. Now even more people were surrounding them, looking at the scene in intrigue.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested.\u201dAfter indifferently replying, Duan Ling Tian grabbed the young girl\u2019s hand and was prepared to leave.Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s actions, Li Xiao\u2019s eyes looked like they were emitting fire. \u201cYou don\u2019t even dare to accept my challenge? Looks like you\u2019re a coward and not a real man!\u201dThe surrounding crowd couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter as they looked at Duan Ling Tian in contempt.Weak people were always looked down upon.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword-shaped eyebrows frowned, then he finally turned around and said, \u201cAlthough I know you\u2019re just trying to prod me into action, since you want to challenge me, I\u2019ll accept. Ke Er, I\u2019ll be back in a second.\u201dAfter notifying the young girl, Duan Ling Tian walked towards Li Xiao and stood face to face with him.\u201cKid, I only need three moves to defeat branch family disciples like you!\u201dLi Xiao\u2019s looked like he was slightly older than Duan Ling Tian. His slightly robust body inclined backwards, his arms bent backwards, and his fists clenched tightly, making his bones release a crackling sound as they rubbed each other. This sound was clear and melodious but ear-piercing at the same time.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dNoticing Li Xiao\u2019s movement, Duan Ling Tian was slightly shocked. It actually was nearly similar to the Collapsing Fist starting movement.After a moment, Li Xiao\u2019s legs spread apart in a bizarre posture. He looked like a fierce tiger that was prepared to howl and begun the hunt.It brought a familiar sensation to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThis martial skill is far from something the middle grade Yellow Rank martial skill, Fierce Tiger Fist, can compare to.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression become slightly serious.\u201cLook at Li Xiao\u2019s starting movement. It looks like the middle grade Profound Rank martial skill, Howling Tiger Fist!\u201dA shocked cry sounded from the surrounding crowd.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s indeed the Howling Tiger Fist.\u201dMore and more people recognized the martial skill Li Xiao was about to use.\u201cHow could this be possible? Outer court disciples are only allowed to choose low grade Profound Rank skills in the Martial Repository Pavilion. How could Li Xiao know a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill?!\u201d\u201cYour information is too outdated. Who doesn\u2019t know that Li Xiao\u2019s brother, Li Zhong, is an inner court disciple? According to the clan rules, siblings are allowed to share their martial skills without breaking the rules.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. Looks like Li Zhong passed it down to him.\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing the crowd\u2019s discussion, Duan Ling Tian was finally enlightened.So it was a Profound Rank martial art!Heh!Li Xiao moved. His body, which seemed to have bent into a heavy bow, shot forward. His feet were moving swiftly like a flashing shadow with no fixed movement. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Duan Ling Tian.His fist howled as it surged through the wind, going straight for Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest!\u201cSo fast!\u201dDuan Ling Tian noticed Li Xiao execute a movement technique. After observing Li Xiao\u2019s shocking fist power, he didn\u2019t dare to overestimate himself and be careless.Using the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, he stepped two steps back.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian drew his arms back, his backbone taking the shape of a bow.His fist moved out like a landslide!Collapsing Fist!Against Li Xiao\u2019s violently approaching Howling Tiger Fist, Duan Ling Tian was not one bit scared. He swung out his right fist to meet the attack head on.Bang!Their fists violently collided together! After an instant, a sneer appeared on the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth as the force of his fist was absorbed by Li Xiao.Crack!The clear sound of bones breaking sounded. Li Xiao\u2019s face distorted. He was instantly forced back by Duan Ling Tian.The pain that spread out from his finger bones caused Li Xiao\u2019s cold sweat to flow out. Looking with and expression of disbelief at Duan Ling Tian, his voice trembled as he said, \u201cYou\u2026 Your Howling Tiger Fist is actually cultivated until mastery!\u201dHowling Tiger Fist!The crowd was in an uproar.Who was this person and how could he also know the Howling Tiger Fist?Moreover, Li Xiao said that his Howling Tiger Fist had been cultivated to mastery. How was this be possible?Regarding Profound Rank martial skills, cultivating them to the initial stage is easy, but to cultivate them to mastery is instead exceptionally difficult.After the youth finished up, he didn\u2019t even glance at Li Xiao; he grabbed the young girl\u2019s hand and he walked out of the crowd.Li Xiao\u2019s eyes flashed with coldness as he endured the pain and shouted, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cWhat, want to take revenge?\u201d The youth turned around and glanced at Li Xiao before indifferently saying, \u201cI\u2019m Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s branch family disciple, Duan Ling Tian!\u201d\u201cA Brand Family disciple and even a disciple with another surname?\u201dMost of the people were shocked.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I\u2019;; remember you. Once I master my Howling Tiger Fist, I will surely come and wash away this shame!\u201dLi Xiao\u2019s tone was metallic as the coldness in his eyes grew stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Profound Rank compared to Yellow Rank is an all new type of transformation\u2026 The might of a Yellow Rank martial skill is equal to the Military Boxing in my previous life. On the other hand, low grade Profound Rank martial skills are comparable to Form and Will Boxing.\u201dDuan Ling Tian felt enlightened.In the past, when he saw the Li branch family martial pavilion\u2019s low grade and middle grade Yellow Rank skills which were difficult to take seriously, he had an attitude that felt as if using his Form and Will Boxing would be enough and thus rejected all the martial skills of this world.But now he realized that even the Form and Will Boxing of his previous life was only comparable to this world\u2019s low grade Profound Rank martial skills.\u201cLooks like I need to start taking this world\u2019s martial skills seriously.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart twitched.\u201cMartial skills, on top of offensive martial skills and movement techniques, there are also defense techniques.\u201dThrough Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s horizons grew wider, and he gained knowledge of matters he wasn\u2019t aware of in the past.\u201cSo the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s War Sovereign\u2019s Nine Forms actually has three Heaven Rank martial skills merged within it\u2026 Offensive martial skill, Nine Dragons Radiant Flash; movement technique, Dragon Soaring The Nine Heavens; and defense martial skill, Nine Dragons Barrier!\u201dDuan Ling Tian took a deep breath. His mood was elated.The Spirit Serpent Movement Technique in the War Sovereign\u2019s Nine Form\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form was actually the basic section of the Dragon Soaring The Nine Heavens martial skill, a high grade Profound Rank movement technique.\u201cIf I step into the Core Formation stage, I\u2019ll be able to cultivate the basic section of the Nine Dragons Radiant Flash, which is a high grade Profound Rank martial skill called Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch!\u201d\u201cIf I step into the Origin Core stage, I\u2019ll be able to cultivate the basic section of the Nine Dragons Barrier, which is a high grade Profound Rank martial skill called Earth Dragons Shield!\u201dNoticing the smile on the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth, the young girl beside him couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYoung Master, what are you thinking about?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed. \u201cNothing. We\u2019ve been out for a while, let\u2019s go back so Mom doesn\u2019t worry.\u201dThat night, Duan Ling Tian returned to his room early and lied down on his bed.He looked at the ceiling while he was in a daze.In his heart he was thinking and pondering about the martial skills\u2026A mysterious door was slowly being opened in front of him.At dawn the next day, Duan Ling Tian brought the young girl out, leaving the Li Clan estate.He planned to buy some medicinal materials for the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid as well as for other uses.As for Thunder Flame Pills, Duan Ling Tian had already requested Grand Elder Li Huo to refine a few hundred for him before he left Fresh Breeze Town, more than enough for him and Ke Er to use until they advance to the Core Formation stage\u2026The two of them quickly arrived at the biggest trade market in the city.The young girl\u2019s extremely beautiful face attracted plenty of burning gazes from lascivious men. They followed the young girl with their eyes until she entered a luxurious medicine store.\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201dAs soon as Duan Ling Tian walked in with the young girl, the manager personally greeted them personally, his tone modest.He noticed the Li Clan crest on their clothes.The Li Clan was a colossus in Aurora City; even his medicine store was rented from the Li Clan\u2026After Duan Ling Tian finished telling him of the medicinal materials he needed for the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he continued, \u201cBesides that, prepare some Spirit Tempering Grass, Amber Lead, and Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi.\u201d\u201cCustomer, how much of these three spirit medicines do you need?\u201d the manager asked respectfully.\u201cTwenty pounds of Spirit Tempering Grass and Amber Lead each. As for the Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi, I\u2019ll take five pounds.\u201dDuan Ling Tian pondered for a moment before slowly replying, \u201cFive pounds of Fifty Years Old Blood Lingzhi?\u201dThe manager was stupefied. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard. \u201cCustomer, you\u2019re not kidding, right? The other spirit grasses you asked for are just common spirit grasses and not worth much\u2026 But Blood Lingzhi is, after all, fifty years old; just fifty grams is already worth a thousand silver, five pounds\u2026\u201d\u201c50,000 silver, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian reached into his pockets and withdrew a stack of silver bills with a thousand denomination and waved it around. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as you prepare the medicinal materials, your silver won\u2019t be any less.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dSeeing Duan Ling Tian withdraw so many silver bills that the manager\u2019s eyes sparkled. Without any further doubt, he hurriedly went to prepare the medicinal materials. \u201cRespected customer, please take a look if you need anything else.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cYoung Master, that Blood Lingzhi is so expensive. Is there anything special about it?\u201dThe young girl playfully stuck out her tongue, looking at Duan Ling Tian with a gaze filled with curiosity.\u201cThat\u2019s used as the medicinal catalyst for the medicinal liquid to cultivate defensive martial skills. Five pounds of Blood Lingzhi is only enough for us to use for two months.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.Two months?50,000 silver?The young girl was stupefied. She wanted to say something but was slightly hesitant. \u201cYoung Master, isn\u2019t this a bit too extravagant?\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head. \u201cKe Er, you must remember that if you want to improve your strength, you absolutely can\u2019t skimp on money\u2026 Money is a mere worldly possession; if you\u2019ve used it all, you can still find a way to earn more.\u201dThe young girl light nodded as if she had realized something and understood.\u201cBrother Li Yuan, after you buy some Blood Lingzhi, your Golden Bell Cover martial skill should be able to step into the initial stage, right?\u201dA sound transmitted in from outside the medicine store, getting close and closer.Golden Bell Cover?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart twitched.This defense martial skill was included in the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor as it was considered one of the best defensive martial skills in the middle grade Profound Rank.Once it\u2019s successfully cultivated, one can stand in place like an immovable mountain, as if a golden bell. Ordinary people wouldn\u2019t be able to break through the defense.\u201cYeah, once I buy two hundred and fifty grams of Blood Lingzhi this time, I will be able to step into the initial stage before the clan\u2019s martial meet starts.Another voice sounded. This voice had a trace of arrogance and callousness.The former sighed as he said enviously, \u201cBrother Li Yuan, I really envy you; that is worth five thousand silver\u2026 If only my father would spend so much on me, then my Iron Arm Technique wouldn\u2019t have taken so long and still not be able to enter the rudiments stage.\u201dThe latter said, \u201cYou do a comparison in this way: I\u2019m the only son in the family, but you have a big brother. I heard your brother, Li Zhong\u2019s, Iron Arm Technique was cultivated to the initial stage half a year ago.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe former\u2019s voice contained a trace a jealousy.\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201dDuan Ling Tian recognized the owner of the voice. It was actually the main clan disciple, Li Xiao, whom he defeated yesterday in the outer court martial arts practice field.He didn\u2019t expect Li Xiao, who had just had two or three of his finger bones broken by him, to actually be able to come out and walk around the market today with such vigor.With a quick thought, Duan Ling Tian understood.Based on the injury Li Xiao received yesterday, if he used a grade nine Gold Injury Pill, he would be healed in one night.Using a Gold Injury Pill on such a light injury.Main clan disciples were really extravagant!\u201cLi Xiao, I heard that you lost to a newly-arrived branch family disciple yesterday, and he even used the Howling Tiger Fist against you?\u201d\u201cBrother Li Yuan, don\u2019t mention it; I was really unlucky yesterday. Who knew that a newly arrived branch family disciple would be at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage and his Howling Tiger Fist would have even stepped into the mastery stage\u2026 But his Howling Tiger Fist seemed incomplete. If I\u2019m able to cultivate my Howling Tiger Fist to mastery soon, I can definitely defeat him!\u201d\u201cIt is really odd that a branch family disciple used a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention him. Right. Brother Li Yuan, the little girl beside him was really vivacious and beautiful, not one bit inferior to Li Shi Shi.\u201d\u201cNot inferior to Li Shi Shi? Are you sure?\u201d\u2026\u2026The two youths around the age of seventeen talked as they walked into the medicine store.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Li Xiao exclaimed in a low voice, looking at the couple who had their backs towards him. He recognized the view of their backs.Li Yuan also looked towards the couple and curiously asked, \u201cLi Xiao, you know them?\u201d\u201cBrother Li Yuan, he is the branch family disciple I told you about earlier, Duan Ling Tian!\u201d Li Xiao said in a low voice.\u201cLooks like there\u2019s some fate between us. Aurora City is so large, yet we are able to meet here.\u201d Duan Ling Tian brought the young girl along as he turned around and grinned.\u201cHumph!\u201d Li Xiao\u2019s expression turned slightly grim.However, Li Yuan besides him had his gaze fixedly staring at the young girl beside Duan Ling Tian, unable to move away anymore.The slim and graceful young girl with a drop-dead gorgeous face caused his heart to tremble.Li Yuan muttered to himself, \u201cShe\u2019s really not one bit inferior to Li Shi Shi, and at certain points even better than Li Shi Shi\u2026\u201dNoticing Li Yuan\u2019s unrestrained gaze, the young girl frowned.\u201cHi, I heard you\u2019re a branch family disciple who just arrived at the main clan. How about we become friends?\u201dWithdrawing his burning gaze, Li Yuan walked over in a polite manner, as if he was a completely different person from before.\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d The young girl\u2019s voice was cold and indifferent, seemingly unapproachable.\u201cThen let\u2019s get to know each other from this moment\u2026 I\u2019m Li Yuan, a main clan disciple. In the outer court, as long as you say my name, any person will give you some face and treat you well out of respect for me.\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s manner of speaking was filled with arrogance.\u201cOh? So that means that the outer court disciples don\u2019t dare to offend you?\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced deeply at Li Yuan.\u201cHumph! Duan Ling Tian, Brother Li Yuan\u2019s strength can rank at the top three in the outer court. If you were sensible, you would f**k off right now. Maybe Brother Li Yuan will take you under his wing since you\u2019re so sensible.\u201dBefore Li Yuan could speak, Li Xiao had already grunted.\u201cOh, really?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently. Disregarding Li Yuan\u2019s eyes that seemed to be burning, he grabbed the young girl\u2019s hand and walked away, ignoring the two of them.Li Yuan took a deep breath and said, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to be friends with me, I can give you a big gift. Fifty grams of Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi. how about it?\u201dThis was obviously said to the young girl beside Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian lightly laughed as he said to the young girl, \u201cKe Er, some people are really stingy, wanting to bribe you with only fifty grams of Blood Lingzhi.\u201d\u201cBumpkin, what do you know? Brother Li Yuan is talking about Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi; just fifty grams is worth two thousand silver\u2026 A bumpkin like you probably can\u2019t even produce a hundred silver coins, right?\u201dLi Xiao mocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As for the other medicinal materials, that is a total of 487 silver \u2026\u201dBefore the manager could finish what he said, Li Xiao had already started mocking Duan Ling Tian. \u201cBuying cheap medicinal materials, as expected of a bumpkin. So much medicinal materials but only costing 487 silver, not even half the cost of fifty grams of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi!\u201dAlthough Li Yuan didn\u2019t join in, the corners of his mouth had a mocking smile.The medicine store manager glanced indifferently at Li Xiao, but when he looked at Duan Ling Tian, he was extremely modest. \u201cRespected customer, to thank you for trusting our store. Seeing as this 487 silver is an odd number extra from the round total, you can consider this as our store giving you a favor. You only have to pay for the Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi,\u201d he said, under the stunned gazes of Li Xiao and Li Yuan.\u201cManager, here\u2019s 50,000 silver. You can count it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian withdrew a stack of one thousand denomination silver bills and counted fifty bills before passing them over.\u201cAll good. It\u2019s 50,000 silver, thank you! We will await your next visit.\u201dUnder the manager\u2019s modest gaze, Duan Ling Tian and the young girl took the pile of medicinal materials,walked past Li Xiao and Li Yuan, who had expressions of disbelief, and left the medicine store.Li Yuan and Li Xiao\u2019s gazes had already been frozen entirely and their hearts were violently trembling.They couldn\u2019t believe what they had just witnessed.Li Xiao pinched his thigh. When he felt the pain from his thigh, only then did he realize that he wasn\u2019t dreaming.With an expression that showed that he didn\u2019t dare believe what just happened, Li Xiao took a deep breath and asked, \u201cManager, the 50,000 silver was money for buying Blood Lingzhi?\u201d\u201cYes, that respected customer bought five pounds of Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi.\u201dThe manager nodded.Five pounds!Li Xiao looked like he had just been struck by lightning.Li Yuan\u2019s face was extremely ugly.No wonder Duan Ling Tian dared to call him stingy\u2026It was true that in front of five pounds of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi, not to mention the promise of gifting the young girl 50 grams of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi, the 250 grams of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi that he was going to buy for himself was still be nothing.After spending 5,000 silver and buying 250 grams of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi, the two of them left the medicine store.\u201cLi Xiao, are you sure he is a branch family disciple?\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s tone was low and heavy.50,000 silver!It would be difficult for even his father to fork out that amount of silver.\u201cBrother Li Yuan, I\u2019m absolutely sure he\u2019s a branch family disciple. Even I can\u2019t understand how he has so much money\u2026 Why don\u2019t we go to the branch family disciple registration office and look him up?\u201dLi Xiao felt it to be inconceivable as well.\u201cYeah, go and find out about his background. If he really is only a branch family disciple, then this time I want both his wealth and his woman!\"Li Yuan nodded. In the corner of his eyes, traces of greed could be seen.Even until now, he still couldn't forget about the young girl from before\u2026This feeling was even stronger than the time he saw Li Shi Shi for the first time!Unfortunately, Li Shi Shi was too dominating, and her strength was not below his.She normally wouldn't even look him in the eye. After trying to pursue her for some time, he had no choice but to give up.As far as he was concerned, the young girl that he took a liking for now would only require him to get rid of Duan Ling Tian. Anything besides that wouldn't be an issue.Moreover, he might even be able to obtain great wealth from Duan Ling Tian.With the help of this wealth, his strength would be able to progress at an even faster pace, maybe even netting an outstanding placing in the next martial meet of the clan, and allow him to win the prizes that he dreamed off.Li Clan estate.Duan Ling Tian started getting busy as soon as he returned.Besides concocting the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he had to concoct another type of medicinal liquid.This medicinal liquid was called Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid.The Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid was a body refinement medicinal liquid researched by the Rebirth Martial Emperor. It was able to assist in the cultivation process for defensive martial skills, enabling one to achieve double the results.Even though the medicinal catalyst for the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid could be directly consumed, the increase in speed of defensive martial skill cultivation was far from what the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid was capable of!The Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid was concocted from 50 grams of Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi combined with two other cheap medicinal materials.This made its medicinal effect comparable to consuming 250 grams of Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi.Moreover, it was much easier to absorb.\u201cKe Er, give me 200 grams of Spirit Tempering Grass, 190 grams of Amber Leaf, 50 grams of Blood Lingzhi\u2026 and 100 grams of clear water,\u201d Duan Ling Tian instructed the young girl.With the help of the young girl, he didn\u2019t have to do everything by himself.The first batch of Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid was quickly concocted successfully.\u201cKe Er, the Frost God's Sword Technique is a sword cultivation method, so it only has offensive sword skills\u2026 Starting from today, I\u2019ll pass on to you two other martial skills, a movement technique and a defensive martial skill.\u201dThe martial skills Duan Ling Tian passed on to the young girl were two high grade Profound Rank skills.These martial skills were the best skills the young girl could cultivate at the moment, and they wouldn\u2019t easily attract unwanted attention.Profound Rippling Steps, a high grade Profound Rank movement technique.When cultivated to mastery, the legs turn into shadows with matchless grace\u2026It is a movement technique extremely suited to women.Stealth Substitution, a high grade Profound Rank martial skill.Contrary to the typical head-on resistance of attacks that most defensive martial skills use, this defense martial skill stresses the use of a weaker force to counter a stronger force. It\u2019s based on cultivating the body until it is extremely delicate and flexible, allowing the user to divert the attacks that land on their body elsewhere.Most head-on resistance type defensive martial skills require the body to be cultivated until the muscles are firm as fine steel, thus causing it to be unsuitable for women.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t wish for Ke Er to become a muscle woman in the future.So this defense martial skill suited her well.\u201cKe Er, from now on, besides improving your cultivation, you have to spend some time on your movement technique. As for the defensive martial skill, with the help of the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid, you only need to set aside a little bit of time to cultivate it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards the young girl as he patiently guided her.Only Duan Ling Tian had such resolution.Even in the Li family main clan, there weren\u2019t many people who could unceasingly use Blood Lingzhi to assist in the cultivation of defensive martial skills.Most people only used the assistance of Blood Lingzhi when they were at the threshold to break through to the next stage.Just like Li Yuan.\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dThe young girl obediently nodded. She was only able to memorize the two martial skills Duan Ling Tian dictated after some time.After Ke Er returned to her room to cultivate, Duan Ling Tian pondered for a moment before going to see his mother.He passed on the two martial skills from earlier to Li Rou.\u201cMom\u2026 Once I step into the Core Formation Stage and refine a Spirit Containment Pill, you should dissipate your current Origin Energy. At that time, I\u2019ll pass on to you a cultivation method that\u2019s similar to Ke Er\u2019s Frost God's Sword Technique, and with the medicinal strength of the Spirit Containment Pill, it will only take a short amount of time for your Origin Energy to recover to its current peak state, or even surpass it,\u201d Duan Ling Tian told his mother.He had long since wanted to pass on a top rank cultivation method to his mother.But unfortunately, his mother had long since developed her Origin Energy, so in order to change to a different cultivation method, the current Origin Energy in the body had to be dissipated first.Dissipating the Origin Energy was a very dangerous affair unless the assistance from a Spirit Containment Pill was present.\u201cOK, Mom will listen to you.\u201d Li Rou dotingly nodded.Her son had grown up and was now able to take care of the family.\u201cFeng, can you see it? Our son has become an upstanding and dauntless man.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s gaze drifted and her face had an expression of happiness.Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh.Every time he saw his mother like this, he knew she was thinking about his father, so he didn\u2019t disturb her and left.After returning to his room, Duan Ling Tian started to search Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories for a suitable defensive martial skill to cultivate\u2026As for offensive martial skills, he didn\u2019t require one at the moment, as the Form and Will Boxing and Sword Drawing Arts he had mastered were more than enough to allow him to be one of the best among his peers.Once he reaches the Core Formation Stage, he will cultivate the high grade Profound Rank skill, Finishing Touch!As for movement techniques, he had the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique.Only his defensive martial skills were a blank slate.The Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s defensive martial skill, Earth Dragon Shield, required one\u2019s cultivation to be at least at the Origin Core Stage.To Duan Ling Tian, this was too far, and he couldn\u2019t wait that long!\u201cMountain Mimicry Technique\u2026 No, it\u2019s too passive, and it would be hard to use in unison with the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique.\u201d\u201cDrum Form\u2026 It won\u2019t do either!\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian earnestly searched through the high grade Profound Rank defense martial skills in Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories. He gradually started feeling slightly exhausted.Exhaustion that stemmed from his spirit.Reading the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor required a large consumption of spirit energy, so it was difficult to do it for prolonged periods.\u201cThis one!\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian was feeling drowsy, he finally found a martial skill, instantly becoming frenzied and jolting awake.Greater Teleportation, a high grade Profound Rank defense martial skill, a skill that stresses upon doing unto another what another does unto you!It was an alternative with similar effects to Stealth Substitution!The only difference being that Greater Teleportation had even harsher cultivation requirements. The cultivator was required to have a body that was soft as if without bones, only then would the cultivator be able to skillfully reverse the opponent\u2019s attack and use the power of teleportation to return it to the opponent.Duan Ling Tian, who had cultivated the Spirit Serpent Form of the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, happened to fulfill these requirements!After choosing his martial skill, Duan Ling Tian started his cultivation.First, he put the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid into the bath barrel and soaked his entire body inside.Feeling the bone-piercing coldness of the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression became serious as he started to circulate the Greater Teleportation mental cultivation method\u2026Greater Teleportation is a defensive martial skill that focuses mainly on the cultivation of the fleshly body, allowing the surface of the fleshly body to develop a defensive qi barrier.The attributes of the defensive qi barrier that are developed by the fleshly body change according to the defensive martial skill cultivated.Once the defensive qi barrier is cultivated, it will only appear on the body\u2019s surface when the defensive martial skill is circulated, revealing its formidable defensive capabilities.Under the assistance of the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Greater Teleportation cultivation nearly reached the rudiments stage in but just a night\u2019s time.The mastery of a martial skill was divided into four stages.Rudiments stage, initial stage, mastery stage, and perfection stage.The gap in strength of each stage is extremely wide.For example, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Form and Will Boxing\u2019s Collapsing Fist, it can be considered to be in the perfection stage.But because it\u2019s essence is that of a low grade Profound Rank martial skill and incomparable to the middle grade Profound Rank martial skill, Howling Tiger Fist, Li Xiao mistook it for Howling Tiger Fist cultivated to the mastery stage.\u201cIn one month, this Greater Teleportation will certainly smoothly enter the rudiments stage.The corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth had a trace of confidence.Of course, while he was cultivating Greater Teleportation, Duan Ling Tian did not forget to cultivate the Spirit Serpents Movement Technique\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The corners of his mouth curved into a faint smile.According to Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian knew that his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique was currently in the rudiments stage and would soon be able to step into the initial stage.When the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique steps into the initial stage, he will gain a qualitative change in speed\u2026Spirit Serpent Movement Technique is a high grade Profound Rank martial skill. Even at the initial stage, it is comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill at the mastery stage and a low grade Profound Rank martial skill at the perfection stage.Duan Ling Tian stopped cultivating in a timely manner as perseverance was key and results wouldn\u2019t be achieved overnight.He was prepared to return home and absorb the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to cultivate so that he can reach the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage as soon as possible.According to what he gathered, the yearly clan martial meet would be held two months from now.If he wanted to become an inner court disciple, he would need to show strength that greatly exceeded his peers\u2019 during the clan martial meet.The corner of the martial arts practice field that Duan Ling Tian chose was quite deserted.When he walked out and arrived at the central area of the martial arts practice field, he noticed a group of people standing scattered around and watching something.Influenced by his curiosity, he walked over.In the middle of the crowd, a beautiful and graceful figure stood there. In her hands was a three-foot-long blade that had transformed into a sword luster, skillfully revealing an extraordinary sword skill.This was a beautiful young girl around the age of seventeen. Her face was as fair as flowers and as beautiful as the moon.Since he arrived in this world, she was the only woman he had seen besides Ke Er and his mother with such an outstanding appearance.The young girl had soft and straight long hair which accompanied her figures movements, lightly fluctuating.Under the blazing sun\u2019s illumination, the three-foot-long blade in her hand flickered with a dazzling lustre.Abruptly, an ancient mammoth silhouette developed above her.Whoosh!Her sword struck out, leaving a string of afterimages behind as it swept past.Three leaves that dropped off a tree on the side were all cut in two, drifting down to the ground.When the girl finished, she was already drenched in sweat.Clap clap clap clap\u2026Immediately, the surroundings sounded with applause and cheers.\u201cAs expected of one of our outer court\u2019s top three, Big Sister Shi Shi. Her Perfect Stage Shadow Sword is too formidable.\u201d\u201cYeah, cutting three leaves which were not in a straight line with only one sword strike. In the entire outer court, I\u2019m afraid only Big Sister Shi Shi is capable of it.\u201d\u201cSeventeen years old and at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage. With the low grade Profound Rank martial skill, Shadow Sword, cultivated to the perfection stage, Big Sister Shi Shi is first on the list in our Li Clan\u2019s younger generation females.\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian heard the surrounding cheers and applause.Top three in the outer court?Big Sister Shi Shi?\u201cCould it be that she is Li Shi Shi?\u201dDuan Ling Tian recalled that when he went to the trade market medicine store a few days ago, Li Xiao and Li Yuan mentioned a girl called Li Shi Shi in their chat.Seeing her today, she really deserved her reputation!In terms of her appearance, she was just a fraction inferior to his Ke Er\u2026\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, wipe your sweat.\u201dA young girl lightly smiled as she passed a handkerchief to Li Shi Shi.After Li Shi Shi wiped off the sweat on her forehead, her clear pupils constricted as she noticed that one of the gazes from the crowd was different from the rest.All of the people present were practically lost in amazement towards her sword skill.But this person seemed to be thinking that her sword skill was not worthy to be taken seriously.In her heart arose a slight sense of loss and competitiveness.\u201cYou think my sword skill is ordinary?\u201dUnder the gazes of the surrounding people, Li Shi Shi arrived in front of the youth, her tone containing a trace of questioning.At this moment, the people present noticed the youth.\u201cEh, isn\u2019t he Duan Ling Tian?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him! I was there on that day.\u201d\u201cHe seems to be only sixteen\u2026\u201d\u201cEh, the young girl who\u2019s usually inseparable from him is actually not here. I heard that that young girl\u2019s beauty is even slightly above Li Shi Shi\u2019s.\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing the surrounding discussion, Li Shi Shi\u2019s clear eyes flashed with a trace of surprise.She had heard of what happened a few days ago.\u201cYour sword skill\u2026 is not bad. If you lessen the flair slightly, maybe it could become even stronger.\u201dDuan Ling Tian, who was the focus of the crowd, indifferently nodded.\u201cFlair?\u201dThe surrounding crowd roared in laughter.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian can\u2019t be thinking that just because his Howling Tiger Fist is formidable, he is capable of giving Big Sister Shi Shi guidance in her sword skills, right?\u201d\u201cJust a layman, but he dares to talk nonsense!\u201d\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi\u2019s Shadow Sword\u2019s cultivation stage is perhaps similar to his Howling Tiger Fist, but Big Sister Shi Shi\u2019s cultivation is one level higher than his; combined with the three-foot-long blade in her hand, she would be able to easily defeat him.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd started to defend Li Shi Shi against Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI only heard that your Howling Tiger Fist is formidable. Could it be that you\u2019re also proficient in sword skills?\u201dLi Shi Shi glanced at Duan Ling Tian with a profound gaze.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t expect that speaking the truth would give rise to public wrath.He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart.Sometimes it isn\u2019t easy to be a truthful person\u2026\u201cSword!\u201dWalking out in large strides, Duan Ling Tian unfolded his hand in front of Li Shi Shi.Li Shi Shi reacted and passed the her sword to Duan Ling Tian. Her gaze emitted astonishment as she guessed what Duan Ling Tian planned to do.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian still wants to display his slight skill in front of an expert?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s simply too rash!\u201dMost people who noticed this scene had a disdainful expression.Duan Ling Tian took no notice as the facts would be able to speak for themselves.In the next moment, Duan Ling Tian replaced Li Shi Shi. His hand grasped the three-foot-long blade as he stood in the middle of the crowd.The wind swept by and the leaves of the tree started drifting down.Whoosh!Under the gazes of everyone, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword moved.But everyone present, including Li Shi Shi, only saw a flowing shine flicker by.From start to finish, they weren\u2019t even able to see how Duan Ling Tian struck with his sword.\u201cHe\u2019s completed his sword strike?\u201dEveryone had doubt in their hearts.\u201cQuickly, look!\u201dSomeone seemed as if to have noticed something.What they saw was that from the the string of leaves that had drifted down from the tree earlier, there were more than ten that had been sliced into two, slowly dropping to the ground.Hiss!The people present couldn\u2019t help but exhale deep breaths of cold air.Only after Duan Ling Tian had returned the sword and left did Li Shi Shi finally regain her senses.Looking at the proud and aloof view of his back from afar, Li Shi Shi\u2019s heart had a feeling of defeat for the first time. The honor of being the top three in the outer court seemed like a title made to mock to her.Since the day she started cultivating, she had always used a sword.Towards sword skills, she had an intuition that exceeded common people.She knew in her heart that if she had to fight Duan Ling Tian one day, even if Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation was lower than hers by one level, Duan Ling Tian could easily defeat her or even kill her with that sword strike from before.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I\u2019ll remember you.\u201dLi Shi Shi silently said in her heart.Duan Ling Tian saw what happened earlier as something that was just casually done, not even worth mentioning.But using Li Shi Shi\u2019s low grade Profound Rank martial skill, Shadow Sword, as a reference, combined with Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2018s memories to estimate\u2026Duan Ling Tian came to a conclusion.His Sword Drawing Arts at full strength had a might comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank sword skill at the perfection stage, or comparable to a high grade Profound Rank sword skill at the mastery stage.If he took someone by surprise, it could even achieve the effect of a high grade Profound Rank sword skill.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian abruptly stopped walking as he looked towards the path home. The two figures were standing there.They seemed to have been waiting for him for a long time.LI Yuan, Li Xiao.Duan Ling Tian casually glanced at them before deciding to go around them.But who knew that they would be so overbearing, even blocking Duan Ling Tian\u2019s path once more.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light.He didn\u2019t want to create trouble, but it didn\u2019t mean he was scared of it.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, give us all the silver bills you have!\u201d Li Xiao grunted.Having Li Yuan, one of the top three in the outer court, to back him up, he was filled with confidence.If he knew of the marvelous sword skill that Duan Ling Tian had executed in the martial arts practice field earlier that even caused one of the top three in the outer court, Li Shi Shi, to feel admiration and her own inferiority, he would probably not have such thoughts as the one now.The affairs of the world were marvelously so.\u201cYou want all the silver bills I have?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed and patted his \u2018thick\u2019 chest. \u201cI did bring quite the amount of silver bills, but why should I give them to you?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dLi Xiao sneered, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to suffer, then be good and hand over all your silver bills. Also, from now on, make the young girl that\u2019s always by your side, Ke Er, accompany Brother Li Yuan.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s sword-shaped eyebrows twitched. His expression didn\u2019t seem angry, but it had an imposing manner, and an extremely terrifying killing intent instantly enveloped Li Xiao.Ke Er was like the reversed scale on a dragon\u2019s neck to him; touch it and he would go into a rage and kill the person!Li Xiao\u2019s expression became fearful and his legs started to shiver.Killing intent like Asura\u2019s caused his mental barriers to collapse.\u201cHmmph!\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked away in large strides with a snort.If he was at any other place, he would have long ago crippled or killed Li Xiao.But this was the Aurora City Li Clan; if he crippled or killed Li Xiao, even if the Li Clan disregarded the matter, Li Xiao\u2019s family would not let it go.After all, Li Xiao was a main clan disciple with deep roots in the Clan.He couldn\u2019t avoid having to think twice.\u201cBrother Li Yuan, why didn\u2019t you stop him?\u201d Li Xiao heaved a sigh of relief. He had a puzzled expression as he looked Li Yuan.\u201cLooks like we looked down upon this Duan Ling Tian. He isn\u2019t ordinary.\u201d Li Yuan\u2019s expression was heavy.Although Duan Ling Tian\u2019s killing intent was directed at Li Xiao earlier, he was lightly touched by it and it caused his heart to shake.\u201cSurely it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re just going to let it go like this?\u201d Li Xiao had an unwilling expression.Drawing in a deep breath, Li Yuan slowly said, \u201cWe can go look for him again once my Golden Bell Cover steps into the initial stage. For some reason, I don\u2019t have any confidence in winning right now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dLi Xiao\u2019s expression was filled with disbelief.He didn\u2019t expect that a mere branch family disciple, and a disciple with another surname at that, would actually be able to cause Li Yuan who was considered one of the top three in the other court to think twice.After hesitating for a while, Li Xiao asked, \u201cBrother Li Yuan, should we get my brother to make a move?\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s eyes flickered as he slowly said, \u201cWhat, don\u2019t tell me you want to let your brother get a share? According to what I know, although you two are siblings, your relationship isn\u2019t that good. Your brother has both openly and secretly called you trash. If he takes part in the matter, I\u2019m worried all the benefits of our efforts will be reaped by him.\u201dLi Xiao\u2019s expression turned grim.This was a real possibility.There was no one who was more clear of his brother\u2019s conducts than himself, dominating and fearless!\u201cOK then, we\u2019ll wait for Brother Li Yuan\u2019s Golden Bell Cover to step into the initial stage. Humph! We\u2019ll just let that Duan Ling Tian be complacent for a few more days.\u201dLi Xiao quickly made a decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ke Er, on the hand, continued her painstaking cultivation of the Sword Drawing Arts without stopping.If Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Sword Drawing Arts was considered to have stepped into the perfection stage, then Ke Er\u2019s Sword Drawing Arts could be considered to have reached the mastery stage.Of course, the reason Ke Er progressed so quickly was due to her painstaking cultivation.Since the day she started cultivating the Sword Drawing Arts until now, she spent at least five hours a day practicing it.People who put in painstaking effort were always rewarded.This was something even Duan Ling Tian did not find unexpected.Something worth mentioning was that during this past month\u2019s time, due to Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er always cultivating their movement techniques in the martial arts practice field, they became familiar with Li Shi Shi.Especially Ke Er; her and Li Shi Shi started calling each other sisters.Martial arts practice field.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s figure flashed as if he had no bones. He stopped for a moment and then moved at swift speeds like a spirit serpent that was flying out in a flash\u2026He was indeed cultivating the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!The beautiful young girl stood at the side, silently watching him with a slightly smiling expression of happiness.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er.\u201dAbruptly, a voice sounded from afar.Another beautiful young girl walked over with quick strides. Her hand grasped a sheathed Fine Steel Sword, making her seem valiant and heroic.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled as she greeted the person.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er, I\u2019m going to the trade market to buy some things. Come with me.\u201dThe person was indeed Li Shi Shi.Hearing what she said, Ke Er unconsciously looked towards the youth whose figure was flashing about, but she didn\u2019t disturb him. Instead, she silently waited.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I\u2019m borrowing Ke Er for a while. You don\u2019t mind, right?\u201dLi Shi Shi looked at the youth.Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s figure lightly jerked, taking advantage of force exerted to come to a stop. His forehead was emitting hot sweat.A fragrant smell entered his nose as Ke Er walked forward to help him wipe his sweat.She was like a lovely little wife.\u201cI really can\u2019t stand the two of you.\u201dLi Shi Shi had a nauseated expression.At this moment, no one noticed that deep within her gaze, a feeling of loss flashed quickly before disappearing.\u201cKe Er, go ahead. Take care of yourself.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled towards the young girl beside him.Besides himself, Ke Er had finally gotten a similar aged friend. Duan Ling Tian naturally would not restrict their contact.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your Ke Er won\u2019t even lose a hair.\u201dLi Shi Shi gave Duan Ling Tian a look before grabbing Ke Er\u2019s hand and walking off.On the way, they attracted many gazes from lascivious men.After the two girls left, Duan Ling Tian continued his cultivation\u2026Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!If anyone with a keen gaze was present, they would notice a barely visible defensive chi barrier on the surface of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body.Defensive Martial Skill!Duan Ling Ting seemed to have forgotten the time as he cultivated\u2026Every time his figure flashed about, he felt a comfortable feeling spreading through his entire body.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dSuddenly, a loud shout interrupted Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation.Duan Ling Tian frowned as he saw the two familiar faces coming over shoulder to shoulder.It was indeed Li Yuan and Li Xiao.In fact, Duan Ling Tian hadn\u2019t seen them for the past half month.He originally thought that they were scared stiff from the killing intent he emitted the other day and would not dare to cause trouble for him anymore.But now it seemed that it was not the case.\u201cWhat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at them with a calm expression.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, hand over what we want, or else today you will have to crawl home from here,\u201d Li Xiao said, in a cold voice.\u201cYou want my things? Sure\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.\u201cHuh?\u201dLi Xiao and Li Yuan were dumbstruck.Since when was this Duan Ling Tian so easy to deal with?Duan Ling Tian stopped for a moment better he added, \u201cDefeat me!\u201d\u201cOK, I\u2019ll make you sincerely hand everything over.\u201dLi Xiao walked out quickly, standing face to face with Duan Ling Tian.At this moment, the people in the martial arts practice field noticed the commotion over here and came over to spectate.The deserted corner of the martial arts practice field was quickly surrounded by people.\u201cIt\u2019s Li Yuan!\u201d\u201cLi Yuan and Big Sister Shi Shi are the same; they are the top three strongest disciples in our outer court. Is he going to battle Duan Ling Tian?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough Duan Ling Tian is only a branch family disciple, his sword skills have reached perfection; even Big Sister Shi Shi felt like she was inferior. Even though his cultivation is weaker than Li Yuan\u2019s, he\u2019s not necessarily not a match for Li Yuan.\u201d\u201cYou mentioned sword skills\u2026 Didn\u2019t you notice that Duan Ling Tian doesn\u2019t have a sword with him?\u201d\u201cHe can\u2019t be thinking of fighting Li Yuan empty-handed, right? Even though his Howling Tiger Fist has broken through to the mastery stage, everyone knows that Li Yuan\u2019s middle grade Profound Rank martial skill, Heart Destruction Palm, has also been cultivated to the mastery stage.\u201d\u201cMore importantly, Li Yuan is at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, whereas Duan Ling Tian is only at the eighth level!\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd\u2019s discussion didn\u2019t look favorably upon Duan Ling Tian, who didn\u2019t have a sword in hand.Some people who had swords wanted to lend them to Duan Ling Tian but were afraid of offending Li Yuan.Li Yuan was not simply a main clan disciple, he was also a Clan Elder\u2019s nephew.This was also the reason why even though he was only an outer court disciple, he cultivated the offensive martial skill, Heart Destruction Palm; defensive martial skill, Golden Bell Cover; and movement technique, Unfettered Steps, which were all middle grade Profound Rank martial skills!Others could only be envious of it.\u201cThe two of you come at me together.\u201d Duan Ling Tian shot a glance at Li Yuan before looking at Li Xiao.\u201cDon\u2019t overestimate yourself. Against you, I am more than enough.\u201d Li Yuan got angry from embarrassment as Duan Ling Tian looked down upon him.His figure abruptly moved\u2026Unfettered Steps!Li Yuan\u2019s legs stepped in a peculiar manner, quickly moving forward, arriving in front of Duan Ling Tian in a blink of an eye.Heart Destruction Palm!His palm struck out and shook the air as it brought along the force of heart destruction, flying straight towards Duan Ling Tian.At the same time, a strand of white mist congealed into an ancient mammoth silhouette above Li Yuan.\u201cInitial stage Unfettered Steps and mastery stage Heart Destruction Palm!\u201dExclamations sounded from within the crowd of spectators.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered as his upper body inclined backwards, his arms pulled back into the shape of a bow, and at the very moment he completed this action, he abruptly trembled.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian swung out his Collapsing Fist to intercept Li Yuan\u2019s Heart Destruction palm.Bang!The fist and palm collided!Immediately, Duan Ling Tian felt that Li Yuan\u2019s palm strike strength was stronger than his Collapsing Fist.Furthermore, a strand of a strange force actually followed through his fist, trying to enter into his arm\u2026Greater Teleportation!Without any hesitation, Duan Ling Tian activated his defensive martial skill, directing the strand of strange force, teleporting the force around, and causing it to shoot out in reverse.Do unto another what they do unto you!Bang!Duan Ling Tian stayed rooted as if he was a mountain, but Li Yuan, on the other hand, retreated two steps, and his expression was filled with disbelief.\u201cHow could this be possible!?\u201dLi Yuan was absolutely sure that his strength earlier was stronger than Duan Ling Tian\u2019s, and his heart destruction force was just about to flow into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body\u2026But just at this moment, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body emitted a defensive qi barrier that was actually capable of reflecting his heart destruction force back!It was like a mirror.\u201cWhat defensive martial skill is that?\u201dLi Yuan was shocked in his heart. This was the first time he had heard of such a bizarre defensive martial skill.\u201cLooks like your Golden Bell Cover has already stepped into the initial stage.\u201d Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eye narrowed slightly.LI Yuan\u2019s Heart Destruction Palm\u2019s might was in no way inferior to his Collapsing fist; combined with Li Yuan\u2019s cultivation being higher than his and possessing the strength of an ancient mammoth, in a head on battle, he was inferior to Li Yuan.But with Greater Teleportation reversing Li Yuan\u2019s heart destruction force, which suppressed him, he was still able to gain the upper hand in a head-on battle.Of course, although reversing the heart destruction force did force Li Yuan back, Li Yuan was able to execute Golden Bell Cover in time to block it.Based on the circumstances from before, it could be said that he and Li Yuan were equally matched.But, he still had an even stronger trump card\u2026\u201cLi Yuan\u2019s defensive martial arts has also stepped into the initial stage? He really is a monster!\u201dThe crowd sounded with exclamations.\u201cIf Li Yuan is a monster, then what would Duan Ling Tian be? He\u2019s got the upper hand.\u201dAfter this last voice spoke, the crowd became deathly silent.It was true that Li Yuan took the initiative and attacked, and Duan Ling Tian passively took him head on, but he still had the upper hand.As far as they were concerned, the superior and inferior side was instantly determined.In terms of attack, Li Yuan was inferior to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cBrother Li Yuan, I\u2019ll come help you!\u201dLi Xiao had the exact same thoughts as the others, so he wanted to join the battle.\u201cNo need.\u201dLi Yuan took in a deep breath as he stopped Li Xiao.Only he who had experienced it for himself knew the true reason why he was at a disadvantage. If he had circulated his defensive martial skill in time, he wouldn\u2019t have been forced back by his own strength.\u201cI have to say, your defensive martial skill is really bizarre, but everything is over now\u2026\u201dLi Yuan sneered.Unfettered Steps!His legs movement sped up and stepped in a peculiar manner, spinning around Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body. He seemed like he was trying to distort Duan Ling Tian\u2019s line of sight.\u201cLi Yuan\u2019s Unfettered Steps is a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill. Although it\u2019s only at the initial stage, it\u2019s comparable to a low grade Profound Rank martial skill at the mastery stage\u2026 If Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed is inferior to his, then he will certainly lose!\u201dA voice abruptly sounded from within the crowd.This voice received the acknowledgement of most of the people present.Of the martial skills under the heavens, only speed was unbeatable!Li Yuan being able to cultivate three types of martial skills to such high stages indeed placed him at the top of his peers, as there were hardly any peers of his capable of such a feat.In the outer court, there were only two people who were comparable to Li Yuan.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s offensive martial skill was strong, and his defensive martial skill was not bad either\u2026It was this reason that in most of the people present\u2019s view, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s movement technique should be his weak point.\u201cWant to compare in speed with me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.His pupils abruptly constricted and his legs shook.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!This high grade Profound Rank martial skill at the initial stage, comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill at the mastery stage, exceeded Li Yuan\u2019s movement technique by an entire stage.Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s figure moved like an agile spirit serpent, spinning around Li Yuan in reverse.No matter how Li Yuan\u2019s palm strikes whistled through the wind, they were unable to touch him in the slightest!The surrounding crowd was struck dumb.This Duan Ling Tian\u2026This speed\u2026Was simply monstrous.\u201cLi Xiao!\u201dLI Yuan\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. Although unwilling, he still chose to request help from Li Xiao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hand which struck out started to shake\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dAccompanied by a shrill cry, Li Xiao\u2019s body was blasted away like an arrow leaving the bowstring, fiercely plunging to the ground.Slumping on the ground, Li Xiao\u2019s face was pale white, and his gaze towards Duan Ling Tian was filled with dread.He didn\u2019t expect the entire force of the fist he struck Duan Ling Tian with to be reversed back upon him as if he had hit a mirror.Extremely depressing!If not for his timely circulation of his defensive martial skill, his entire arm might have been crippled.This scene shocked everyone present.Li Xiao\u2019s Howling Tiger Fist was a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill that had been cultivated to the initial stage.Duan Ling Tian could fully bear Li Xiao\u2019s Howling Tiger Fist just by using his defensive martial skill, showing that his defense martial was in no way inferior to Li Xiao\u2019s Howling Tiger Fist; at the very least it was similar to Li Yuan\u2019s initial stage Golden Bell Cover.Only an initial stage and above middle grade Profound Rank martial skill would be capable of blocking an attack from a middle grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill!In other words, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill was either a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill at the initial stage or a low grade Profound Rank martial skill at the mastery stage.However, no one considered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill to be a high grade Profound Rank martial skill.After all, a high grade Profound Rank martial skill was extremely rare even in the Aurora City Li Clan.\u201cBrother Li Yuan, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026\u201dLi Xiao laughed bitterly as he looked towards Li Yuan. In the beginning he thought that only Duan Ling Tian\u2019s offensive martial skills were more formidable than his.But only now did he realize that his attack was completely incapable of breaking Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defense.\u201cHmph!\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s expression turned grim. His icy gold gaze swept past Duan Ling Tian just like a blood thirsty poisonous snake\u2019s gaze.Only after Li Yuan and Li Xiao fled in shame did the crowd\u2019s gaze fall onto Duan Ling Tian.Their gazes were filled with reverence.At the age of only sixteen, he had the middle grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill, Howling Tiger Fist, at the mastery stage.As well as what was possibly a middle grade Profound Rank defensive martial skill at the initial stage, or maybe low grade Profound Rank defense martial skill at the mastery stage.And also what might be a middle grade Profound Rank movement technique at the mastery stage, or maybe low grade Profound Rank movement technique at the perfection stage.In the outer court, such accomplishments could perhaps only be compared to the outer court\u2019s top ranked disciple.Even Li Shi Shi was quite inferior to him.\u201cBased on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s current strength, he\u2019s completely surpassed Big Sister Shi Shi and Li Yuan.\u201d\u201cIn the outer court at present, his strength is probably only inferior to Li Kuang\u2019s.\u201d\u201cI feel like he can compete with Li Kuang. You all shouldn\u2019t forget that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strongest offensive martial skill isn\u2019t Howling Tiger Fist, but his sword skill which has attained perfection!\u201d\u201cYeah, with his sword skill combined with the assistance of a good long sword, I estimate that his strength won\u2019t be inferior to Li Kuang\u2019s.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd\u2019s discussion was generous with admiration.Hearing these praises, Duan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.This kind of scene was something he had experienced many times in previous life, so he had long ago become accustomed to it.As for the Li Kuang they spoke about, Duan Ling Tian had heard about him.The top ranked disciple in the outer court.But unfortunately, Duan Ling Tian hasn\u2019t had the chance to meet him.He heard that Li Kuang went to the Misty Forest to gain experience, and that he would only return to the Clan right before the martial meet begins.Just when Duan Ling Tian was about to go home, an anxious voice that was getting closer to him called out, \u201cDuan Ling Tian, Duan Ling Tian!\u201d\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the panting youth.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, Big Sister Shi Shi taught two Lin Clan outer court disciples a lesson. As a result, they called others over and now a group of people have surrounded them and blocked them in. Big Sister Shi Shi sent me back to deliver the news,\u201d the youth anxiously said.\u201cWhat?!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face instantly became grim. What he was worried the most about was Ke Er\u2019s safety.\u201cShow me the way!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s stern gaze stared fixedly on the youth.The youth felt a chill run down his spine. Not daring to look Duan Ling Tian in the eye anymore, he hurriedly walked in front and led the way.The surrounding outer court disciples cast a gaze at each other before following them.\u201cThe Lin Clan members actually dare to bully Big Sister Shi Shi? They are virtually courting death!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and teach them a lesson.\u201d\u201cDo they really think our Li Clan outer court disciples are so easy to offend?\u201d\u2026\u2026The outer court disciples that followed behind Duan Ling Tian were filled with righteous indignation.\u201cHurry up!\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned, then he grabbed hold of the youth\u2019s arm and brought him along as he flew forward, creating some distance between them and the crowd.\u201cPoint the way!\u201dThe crowd of outer court disciples behind could only hear Duan Ling Tian\u2019s loud shout from far away.\u201cCome on! We need to hurry up, don\u2019t lose them.\u201dThe crowd of Li Clan disciples each executed their movement techniques, flying out to follow up.But even then, they could only eat Duan Ling Tian\u2019s dust.It was also because Duan Ling Tian was bringing along another person.Or else it would be impossible for them to even follow Duan Ling Tian\u2019s figure with their speed.After leaving the Li Clan Estate, Duan Ling Tian saw the two girls being blocked in a large street in the trade market.When he saw Ke Er safely standing there, Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cLi Shi Shi, as long as you and the little beauty beside you accompany us for some drinks, we\u2019ll forget about today\u2019s matter. How about it?\u201dA coquettish voice entered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears from afar.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.Li Shi Shi\u2019s delicately shouted, \u201cLin Wei, you\u2019re dreaming!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry, the few of us will be forced to ruthlessly destroy some flowers!\u201dThe coquettish voice sounded again, this time with a trace of coldness.\u201cF**k off!\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand, grabbed a Lin Clan outer court disciple\u2019s shoulder, and pulled him backwards as he walked in large strides into the blockade.\u201cKid, you\u2019re courting death!\u201dThe Lin Clan outer court disciple\u2019s face distorted as he walked forward and attacked with a fist strike.Bang!As a result, his first struck the defensive qi barrier on the surface of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body, so the ruthless fist strike\u2019s force reversed back to him.\u201cAh!\u201dHe went flying backwards while emitting a shrill cry, plunging to the ground in a sorry state.The commotion over here could not be considered small, so it had attracted the attention of everyone.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dWhen Ke Er and Li Shi Shi noticed Duan Ling Tian, their beautiful faces emitted expressions of delight, as if the lover they had been waiting for had finally arrived.\u201cKe Er, are you ok right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked to the side of the young girl, his expression filled with concern.\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m alright.\u201dThe young girl lightly shook her head. \u201cBig Sister Shi Shi was here to take care of me.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded and smiled to Li Shi Shi.\u201cWhat are you thanking me for? I brought Ke Er out, so I naturally have to take responsibility until the end.\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s clear eyes flickered as she lightly shook her head.She sighed in her heart.\u201cCould it be that in his eyes, I\u2019m really not even slightly comparable to Little Sister Ke Er?\u201d\u201cKid, you dare to injure our Lin Clan members? Today, I, Lin Wei, will teach you a lesson!\u201dFrom behind the youth of was the Lin Family\u2019s leader, a youth of around seventeen years old flew out. His violently approaching palm was aimed at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest.The expressions of the two girls beside Duan Ling Tian distorted; they wanted to make a move to save him.Duan Ling Tian walked out in large strides, using his chest to meet the attack head on.Greater Teleportation!Defensive martial skill circulating.Bang!The youth\u2019s palm struck Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t budge an inch.\u201cAh!\u201dThe youth emitted a shrill cry as he was blasted away. His body was in a sorry state; he swayed a bit before being finally able to stand firmly.The pain the he felt coming from his arm caused cold sweat to flow out of him.When he once again looked at Duan Ling Tian, his gaze was filled with terror.Clap clap clap clap\u2026Just at this moment, the Lin Family\u2019s green-clothed youth in the lead started clapping.\u201cIf I\u2019m not guessing wrong, your defensive martial skill is a high grade Profound Rank martial skill, right?\u201dThe green-clothed youth glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.High grade Profound Rank martial skill?No matter whether it was the Lin Clan outer court disciples, or the Li Clan outer court disciples that had just arrived, all of them were struck dumb.Although the Lin Clan and the Li Clan both had high grade Profound Rank martial skills, a clan\u2019s high grade Profound Rank martial skills were only allowed to be cultivated by the genius martial artists that the clan was focusing on.Everyone looked at Duan Ling Tian with surprised gazes.\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s go home.\u201dDuan Ling Tian grabbed the girl\u2019s hand with a gentle expression and walked towards the outside of the enclosure. He walked through the enclosure as if he had entered a place where there was no one, or no one could resist him.Whoosh!The green-clothed youth\u2019s figure moved as if it had transformed into a gust of wind, blocking Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cYou beat up my Lin Clan members and plan to leave just like this?\u201dThe green-clothed youth had a carefree expression; his gaze, however, emitted a hint of playfulness.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze turned cold and his voice sounded like thunder. \u201cF**k off!\u201d\u201cIf your Li Clan members want to leave now, that is not a problem, but you have to fight with me\u2026 This is the precondition! In the past, I thought that the Li Clan outer court disciples only had Li Kuang who was worthy of fighting me, but only today did I find out that the there was someone like you.\u201dThe green-clothed youth\u2019s face was filled with confidence; it was as if everything was under his control.So arrogant.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as a cold light flashed within them.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, he\u2019s Lin Qi, the Lin Clan outer court\u2019s top disciple and the son of the Lin Clan\u2019s Patriarch,\u201d Li Shi Shi warned.Lin Clan outer court\u2019s top disciple?Lin Clan Patriarch\u2019s son?No matter which title he used, it was enough to cause this green-clothed youth to seem dazzling.The Lin Clan, similar to the Li Clan, were both colossi of Aurora City.\u201cHave you finished considering? After a battle between the two of us, no matter who wins or who loses, I\u2019ll allow your Li Clan members to leave.\u201dLin Qi lightly smiled as if he didn\u2019t feel the least bit angry about what Duan Ling Tian did earlier.Just for the chance to battle Duan Ling Tian!The injured Lin Wei\u2019s expression turned grim as he unwillingly said, \u201cBrother Qi, Li Shi Shi and her injured our people, you\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dLin Qi coldly glanced at Lin Wei, interrupting Lin Wei. \u201cAre you questioning my decision?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve heard of him, the top ranked Lin Clan disciple amongst the juniors. At the age of only seventeen, his cultivation is already at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, and he has even cultivated three high grade Profound Rank martial skills.\u201d\u201cThree high grade Profound Rank martial skills? Damn\u2026 The Lin Clan really expended a lot of resources on him.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the one confronting him?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a Li Clan disciple with another surname.\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding crowd discussed in low voices.Duan Ling Tian stared fixedly at Lin Qi with a serious expression.Facing Lin Qi caused him to feel a strand of pressure.Even when he faced the Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Fang family Manager, an existence at the first level of the Core Formation stage, he didn\u2019t feel even a trace of pressure.In other words, Lin Qi was more dangerous than Fang Qiang!Thinking though it would make it easily understandable.Families like the three families of Fresh Breeze Town only had high grade Yellow rank martial skills as their best martial skills.As for movement techniques, before Duan Ling Tian gifted the Li Family a movement technique, not one of the three families of Fresh Breeze Town had one.Defensive martial skills, on the hand, were something that were too far away for the three families to consider.Duan Ling Tian found out through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories that although martial skills were divided into four ranks, namely Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Yellow, Yellow Rank martial skills only encompassed offensive martial skills. No movement techniques or defensive martial skills were at the Yellow Rank.On Cloud Continent, the lowest ranked movement technique and defensive martial skills were at least Profound Rank.Whoosh!As if previously agreed upon, Duan Ling Tian and Lin Qi moved at the same time.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s figure was graceful; every movement he made was filled with a sense of supple beauty.His speed was so fast that the most of the people in the surrounding crowd couldn\u2019t help but gasp in admiration.Lin Qi\u2019s legs were like afterimages; even if they flew past a snowfield, there probably wouldn\u2019t be any traces left behind.Traceless Snowsteps!A high grade Profound Rank martial skill.\u201cWhere did this Duan Ling Tian come from? Since when did the Li Clan have such an incredible person? His movement technique\u2019s speed is actually not one bit inferior to Brother Qi\u2019s Traceless Snowsteps!\u201d\u201cBrother Qi\u2019s Traceless Snowsteps is a high grade Profound Rank martial skill that has been cultivated to the Initial Stage, comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank movement technique at the Mastery Stage, or a low grade Profound Rank movement technique at the Perfection Stage!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable! Besides the Li Clan\u2019s Li Kuang and the Xiao Clan\u2019s Xiao Yun, there is actually someone of the same generation that could compete with Brother Qi in movement techniques!\u201d\u201cHumph! This Duan Ling Tian is only at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage; didn\u2019t you all realize that Brother Qi hasn\u2019t even exerted his full strength,but instead suppressed his strength at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage to play with him?\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t say it, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. Brother Qi\u2019s current attacks aren\u2019t drawing upon the energy of heavens and earth to develop into an ancient mammoth silhouette.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd of Lin Clan outer disciples had complacent expressions.It was as if the person who was flying crisscross with Duan Ling Tian and had similar speeds was not Lin Qi but themselves.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, receive my palm strike!\u201d Lin Qi abruptly shouted loudly.Whoosh!The sound of a gust of wind pierced out coldly.Lin Qi\u2019s right hand abruptly slapped out; all that could be seen with the naked eye was a string of palm afterimages, enveloping towards Duan Ling Tian.More than ten palm afterimages descending at the same time made it extremely hard to identify the real strike.If judged wrongly, it would undoubtedly mean walking into danger.\u201cIt\u2019s the high grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill, Overlapping Afterimages, the famous martial skill of the Lin Clan!\u201d\u201cSupposedly, the Overlapping Afterimages allows the creation of ninety nine afterimages when cultivated to the Perfection Stage\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected of the Lin Clan\u2019s young genius, Lin Qi, being able to cultivate Overlapping Afterimages to the Initial Stage at the mere age of seventeen.\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding crowd didn\u2019t lack people who had their own unique views.\u201cSo this is a high grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart twitched.Through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, he had quite the understanding of high grade Profound Rank offensive martial skills.A high grade Profound Rank martial skill compared to a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill was a qualitative change. Not only was the might of the skill increased by a level, it even stressed upon using a certain method to confuse the enemy before executing a swift and hard strike.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted. Relying on the experience he gained from the battlefields in his previous life, he seemed to be able to see through the more than ten afterimages, pinpointing the palm strike which contained a trace of killing intent.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian drew his arms back before swinging out his right fist. His fist was aimed at one of the afterimages.Bang!The palm and fist strikes collided.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian and Lin Qi\u2019s bodies trembled, and Duan Ling Tian stepped three steps back whereas Lin Qi took five steps back.The surrounding spectators were stupefied.Lin Qi, who had suppressed his strength to the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage, was actually forced into a disadvantageous position.\u201cYour strength is actually stronger than an ordinary level eighth Body Tempering martial artist\u2019s by so much.\u201dLin Qi gazed at Duan Ling Tian with an astonished expression.Duan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.Because he cultivated in the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, on every occasion that his cultivation broke through, his strength would always be slightly stronger than someone of the same cultivation level.Just like now.An ordinary eighth level Body Tempering martial artist would have the strength of 5,000 pounds.But he, on the other hand, had a strength of 7,000 pounds.\u201cHaha\u2026 Satisfying! My view of you was not wrong. Besides Li Kuang and Xiao Yun, you\u2019re the first in the same generation of disciples of Aurora City capable of seeing through my true palm strike.\u201dLin Qi laughed loudly with a delighted expression.\u201cOnce more!\u201dLin Qi\u2019s body shook as he flew out once more.Traceless Snowsteps!This time, he and Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t purposely attack each other head on but instead flew out as they searched for their opponent\u2019s weak spots in order to defeat the opponent.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s entire body seemed to have transformed into a spirit serpent, flying forward as he found the best chance to blast a fist strike on Lin Qi\u2019s body.Even though the might of Collapsing Fist was unable to suppress Lin Qi\u2019s Overlapping Afterimages in a head on collision, in terms of combat experience, it would be impossible for Lin Qi to be on the same level as Duan Ling Tian.As the strongest Weapons Specialist on Earth in his previous life, in terms of combat experience, Lin Qi was obviously not on the same level as him.Bang!His fist descended, blasting on the defensive qi barrier that rose to the surface of Lin Qi\u2019s body.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian felt his right fist shake as if he had pounded his fist on a turtle\u2019s shell, and he was exposed to the force of the shock that was deflected back.Greater Teleportation!Without any hesitation, Duan Ling Tian circulated his defensive martial skill!Doing unto another what another does unto you.He reversed as much of the deflected force as possible back to Lin Qi.The deflected shock force was, after all, originally from Lin Qi\u2019s defensive qi barrier, so Lin Qi\u2019s defensive qi barrier didn\u2019t reject it\u2026Lin Qi\u2019s body trembled when the deflected shock force reached him. As if being struck by lightning, he retreated to the side in a slightly sorry manner.\u201cWhat defensive martial skills are you using?\u201dLin Qi looked at Duan Ling Tian as if he had seen a ghost.Although he was shocked by Duan Ling Tian\u2019s combat experience, what astonished him the most was Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill.It was actually able to return most of the force that his Profound Turtle Form had deflected to Duan Ling Tian.That deflected shock force originated from his defensive qi barrier, and as such his defensive qi barrier wouldn\u2019t react to reject it, so the force that was returned by to him by Duan Ling Tian caused him so suffer quite a loss.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill had thoroughly countered his defensive martial skill.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed and he slowly said, \u201cUse your full strength. You don\u2019t have to continue suppressing your strength. If you continue as it is, you will undoubtedly lose!\u201d\u201cFine, as you wish! I really didn\u2019t expect that in the same generation of Aurora City\u2019s three great clans, there would be someone besides Li Kuang and Xiao Yun capable of forcing me to exert my full strength. Be careful, once I exert my full strength, I will have the strength of an ancient mammoth. Compared to your current strength, it will be stronger by 3,000 pounds.\u201dLin Qi frankly laughed.He naturally knew that what Duan Ling Tian said was true.Considering Duan Ling Tian\u2019s rich combat experience and the defensive martial skill that had countered his, it was more than enough to defeat him when his strength was suppressed to be on the same level as Duan Ling Tian\u2019s.Instantly, the muscles on Lin Qi\u2019s body started to bulge up.Above his head, the energy of heaven and earth shook as an ancient mammoth silhouette became indistinctly visible.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian is really abnormal; he is able to force Lin Qi to use his full strength even though he\u2019s only at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage.\u201d\u201cAfter today\u2019s battle, Duan Ling Tian will still obtain honor even in loss!\u201d\u201cYeah, just now Brother Lin Qi was in a disadvantageous position when his strength was suppressed to the same level as Duan Ling Tian\u2019s. It\u2019s easily imaginable how if one day he breaks through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, Lin Qi probably won\u2019t be his match.\u201d\u2026\u2026The Lin Clan outer court disciples looked at Duan Ling Tian with dazed expressions.On the other hand, the Li Clan outer court disciples had radiant expressions.Duan Ling Tian really brought honor to their Li Clan!From today onwards, besides Li Kuang, the Li Clan outer court would have Duan Ling Tian.As Li Shi Shi gazed at Duan Ling Tian, her clear eyes had an extremely complicated expression.The young girl beside her, however, seemed to not be shocked in the slightest.As far as she was concerned, her young master would forever be the best, incomparable to anyone.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, be careful; once I exert my full strength, no matter whether it is strength or speed, it will all undergo a massive increase!\u201dAfter giving Duan Ling Tian a reminder, Lin Qi made his move.Traceless Snowsteps!Lin Qi\u2019s speed was at least 30% faster than before.Overlapping Afterimages!More than ten palm afterimages abruptly descended, enveloping towards Duan Ling Tian.Lin Qi at full strength had a speed that completely surpassed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s, and the might of his Overlapping Images also surpassed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist, causing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill, Greater Teleportation, to have difficulties in blocking the attack.Even if Duan Lign Tian\u2019s had an even richer combat experience and Greater Teleportation was even more miraculous, he would still end up in a disadvantageous position after a few moves.If the martial skills were considered as the software, then the strength of the user was the hardware.If the hardware was inferior, then even better software would be burdened by it.\u201cThe difference between strength is too great; Duan Ling Tian is about to lose.\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian passively defending and repeatedly being forced back, the Lin Clan outer court disciples had smiles on their faces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at Duan Ling Tian with an expression of dread.\u201cEh, did Duan Ling Tian use a sword just now?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026 But, he doesn\u2019t have a sword on hand right now. Where did he hide it?\u201d\u2026\u2026Not one of the Li Clan and Lin Clan outer court disciples were able to see how Duan Ling Tian had struck with his sword, or where he hid his sword.If they hadn\u2019t seen the sword shine, they might have even thought they were seeing things.\u201cLin Qi, I\u2019m going to counterattack.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze slightly focused and then he moved.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!His figure moved, flying straight towards Lin Qi.Whoosh!The violet sword shine appeared once again, flashing by before vanishing instantaneously as Lin Qi quickly retreated.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201d Lin Qi said, in a slightly panicked voice.Besides Li Shi Shi and Ke Er, the other people present were all struck dumb.Lin Qi admitted defeat?What\u2019s going on?\u201cBrother Qi, why did you admit defeat? You obviously had the upper hand.\u201dLin Wei looked at Lin Qi with a puzzled expression.\u201cIf Duan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t using a sword, I could have defeated him, but once he brings a sword out, I\u2019m not a match for him,\u201d Lin Qi replied in a very straightforward and simple manner.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, the speed at which you executed that sword skill is at a level that is difficult for me to reach\u2026 Unless I undergo an overall breakthrough, I can\u2019t even defend against a single sword strike from you.\u201dLin Qi sighed as he glanced at Duan Ling Tian with a complicated expression.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s marvelous sword skill caused admiration within his heart.\u201cAcknowledged.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, slightly increasing his view of Lin Qi.This was a person who could accept defeat.A person like this would surely be extraordinary in the future.Lin Qi\u2019s eyes flickered brightly as he proclaimed confidently, \u201cBut there will eventually be a day where I will defeat your sword skill!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\u201cI keep my promises. You can leave with your Li Clan members now.\u201dLin Qi\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cFarewell.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded towards Lin Qi before bringing along Ke Er and the crowd of Li Clan outer court disciples to leave the trade market together, walking towards the Li Clan Estate.The surrounding crowd slowly dispersed as well.In their hearts, they remembered a single name: Duan Ling Tian!The Li Clan had an outer court disciple whose strength was similar to or even surpassed Li Kuang\u2019s.\u201cBrother Qi, you haven\u2019t replied to me. Why did you admit defeat without reason?\u201dLin Wei frowned as he asked with a manner showing he wouldn\u2019t give up until he got to the bottom of things.The other Lin Clan outer court disciples also looked towards Lin Qi. They had the same question.\u201cSee for yourselves.\u201dLin Qi shook his head, he then raised his head to display his throat to everyone.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe Lin Clan outer court disciples were all dumbstruck.They could clearly see that there was a light white sword mark on Lin Qi\u2019s throat.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him showing mercy today, I would already be dead.\u201dLin Qi sighed.Lin Wei\u2019s eyes flickered as he ruthlessly said, \u201cBrother Qi, how dare that Duan Ling Tian, a mere Li Clan disciple with another surname, use such a killing move against you\u2026 If it was up to me, we could get our Lin Clan\u2019s inner court disciples to treat him a lesson.\u201dLin Qi\u2019s expression turned grim as he said, in a stern voice, \u201cLim Wei, I\u2019m warning you! From today onwards, Duan Ling Tian is my opponent, and I will take care of this matter myself. Don\u2019t try to be smart!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis was the first time Lin Wei had seen Lin Qi get so angry, so he hurriedly nodded and replied his acknowledgement.But, when he lowered his head, his eyes still flickered with a trace of unwillingness and ruthlessness\u2026Duan Ling Tian and the crowd on their way home.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, why did Lin Qi abruptly admit defeat?\u201d\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t notice him suffering any losses, so why would he abruptly admit defeat?\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, is there an inside story we don\u2019t know about?\u201d\u2026\u2026The Li Clan outer court disciples all gazed at Duan Ling Tian with puzzled expressions.\u201cWhat inside story could there possibly be? You all just didn\u2019t see it clearly. Stop talking nonsense.\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s willow-shaped eyebrows frowned.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, could it be that you know the reason?\u201dInstantly, all of the Li Clan outer court disciples shifted their gazes to Li Shi Shi.Only after looking at Duan Ling Tian and noticing that he didn\u2019t have any dissatisfaction did Li Shi Shi explain, \u201cDidn\u2019t all of you notice that there was a light white sword mark on Lin Qi\u2019s throat? Duan Ling Tian showed mercy on that sword strike, only piercing through the skin of his throat. If it was slightly deeper, he would undoubtedly be dead!\u201dFor a moment, all of the Li Clan outer court disciples were stupefied.Never would they have thought that Duan Ling Tian was so formidable\u2026Slicing the throat with a single sword strike!Although some of them had once seen Duan Ling Tian execute his sword skill, that sword strike that sliced more than ten falling leaves, they didn\u2019t think that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword skill would be so terrifying when used in actual combat.Only Duan Ling Tian knew that the only reason his attack went so smoothly was because he attacked unexpectedly.The Sword Drawing Arts that he executed had a might not inferior to a high grade Profound Rank martial skill at the Perfection Stage when attacking unexpectedly.The crowd dispersed after arriving back at the Li Clan estate.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er greeted Li Shi Shi before returning home.\u201cI wonder if he would be willing to teach the Sword Drawing Arts to me.\u201dLi Shi Shi had always been focused on sword skills and had even cultivated her low grade Profound Rank martial skill, Shadow Sword, to the Perfection Stage.As a Branch Family disciple, if she wanted to advance in her sword skills, she had to wait until she was an inner court disciple to choose a middle grade Profound Rank skill from the second floor of the Martial Repository Pavilion.During their time together, she heard from Ke Er that the Sword Drawing Arts\u2019 might was comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank sword skill.If attacking unexpectedly, its might was even comparable to a high grade Profound Rank sword skill!When they got home, Duan Ling Tian went to lie on his bed with his body spread open.Cultivating his movement technique and subsequently getting into an intense battle with Lin Qi today caused him to feel slightly exhausted.The young girl sat on the side of the bed, gently helping him massage his legs.Delightful!Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help to release a breath of foul air.Duane Ling Tian noticed the young girl\u2019s hesitation to speak, so he asked, while smiling, \u201cKe Er, is something the matter? What, you can\u2019t be still thinking of yourself as an outsider, right?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, Big Sister Shi Shi hoped I would ask you if you were willing to teach her the Sword Drawing Arts,\u201d the young girl said with slight hesitation.\u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea of hers\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me the reason why she started calling you sister was so that I would teach her the Sword Drawing Arts?\u201dDian Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered.\u201cYoung Master, Big Sister Shi Shi isn\u2019t that type of person.\u201dThe young girl lightly shook her head.\u201cThen, Ke Er, Are you hoping I teach the Sword Drawing Arts to her?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked while smiling.\u201cKe Er will listen to the Young Master\u2019s decision.\u201dThe young girl lightly smiled, her delicate face blushing slightly.Duan Ling Tian thought silently for a moment before slowly saying, \u201cHer low grade Profound Rank sword skill has already been cultivated to the Perfection Stage, so I can\u2019t blame her for wanting to cultivate a better sword skill. Since she\u2019s good to my Ke Er and took care of her, I\u2019ll pass down a different sword skill to her\u2026 As for the Sword Drawing Arts, I would never pass it out of the family!\u201dThe young girl blinked her clear eyes as she curiously asked, \u201cYoung Master, what sword skill are you going to pass down to Big Sister Shi Shi?\u201d\u201cSynchronous Shadow Sword!\u201dThis sword skill was a high grade Profound Rank sword skill.It was one of the complete sword skills that Duan Ling Tian had found inside the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor.It had a similar but slightly different effect from the Overlapping Afterimages that Lin Qi executed earlier, and its might was not a bit inferior to it.Originally, Duan Ling Tian was prepared to teach a middle grade Profound Rank sword skill to Li Shi Shi.But after a quick thought, he decided otherwise.Another one and a half months from now would be the yearly Clan Martial Meet.Based on Li Shi Shi\u2019s current strength, becoming an inner court disciple was a piece of cake.Becoming an inner court disciple would allow her access to the Martial Repository Pavilion\u2019s second level to choose a middle grade Profound Rank martial skill.It would be unnecessary of him to give her a middle grade Profound Rank sword skill.A few days later, Duan Ling Tian wrote down the Synchronous Shadow Sword and asked Ke Er to go get Li Shi Shi.\u201cSynchronous Shadow Sword, a high grade Profound Rank sword skill?\u201dAfter looking through the handwritten book Duan Ling Tian had written for her, her clear pupils constricted and she had an excited expression.\u201cDue to some reasons, I\u2019m unable to teach you the Sword Drawing Arts, so I\u2019ll give you this sword skill instead\u2026 But, I have a condition.\u201dAs he spoke up to here, Duan Ling Tian stared fixedly at Li Shi Shi.\u201cWhat\u2026 what condition?\u201dAt this moment, Li Shi Shi felt as if Duan Ling Tian\u2019s burning gaze was tearing her clothes apart, so her voice started to slightly tremble.\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone that it was I who gave you this sword skill. Remember, that means anyone!\u201dDuan Ling Tian told her his condition.\u201cOf course!\u201dLi Shi Shi hurriedly nodded as she heaved a sigh of relief in her heart.So it was just this condition.She even thought that\u2026Duan Ling Tian nodded to Li Shi Shi as he indifferently said, \u201cYou can go now.\u201dLi Shi Shi grit her teeth and thanked him again before leaving.After leaving, Li Shi Shi felt a sense of loss in her heart.She even doubted if her charm was turned to nothingness when in front of Duan Ling Tian.Since becoming familiar with Duan Ling Tian, he had not once looked at her properly.His gentleness was always only for the young girl beside him.Sometimes, even she didn\u2019t know if she was feeling admiration or envy.From an unknown time, or maybe since the time when he executed the Sword Drawing Arts for the first time, this man\u2019s shadow had appeared in her heart.Lying on his bed and looking at the ceiling, Duan Ling Tian laughed for no reason.Being the amorous weapons specialist who always went into a bush of flowers but came out without a single leaf on him, he naturally was able to notice the little feelings Li Shi Shi harbored towards him.Li Shi Shi was different from Ke Er after all.In Ke Er\u2019s entire world, there was only him.But Li Shi Shi had her own dreams to pursue; even if she had feelings for him, it was just a pure, young maiden\u2019s romance.Just like a law of nature.An outstanding male would always be able to attract a female with ease.Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that Duan Ling Tian had to stubbornly be faithful to only a single wife.If he met someone who truly loved him and was willing to give up everything for him, and he liked the girl as well, he wouldn\u2019t let it easily slip past him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/War Sovereign Soaring The HeavensChapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46: Misty ForestTranslator: / KurazyTolanzuraytor Editor: LucasBased on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s past estimations, five pounds of Fifty-Year-Old Blood Lingzhi concocted into Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid would be able to supply himself and Ke Er for two months.But now his mother was using it as well, and as the three of them didn\u2019t intentionally restrict their usage, the speed at which the Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid was expended increased significantly.After a month\u2019s time, the five pounds of Blood Lingzhi was completely expended.Of course, the expenditure without reservation did provide great returns.Besides his defensive martial skill, Greater Teleportation, being cultivated to the Initial Stage, Ke Er and his mother both cultivated their defensive martial skill, Stealth Substitution, to the Initial Stage as well.When any one of the three of them circulated their defensive martial skill, people of the same cultivation level who executed high grade Profound Rank martial skills at the Initial Stage, middle grade Profound Rank martial skills at the Mastery Stage, or even low grade Profound Rank martial skill at the Perfection Stage would be unable to do any harm to them.Of course, the precondition to this was that the opponent didn\u2019t use any weapon to execute their martial skills.If the opponent used a weapon, then it would be an entirely different story.He once again made a trip to the trade market to buy another eight pounds of Blood Lingzhi. Duan Ling Tian\u2019s remaining silver was almost fully spent, leaving behind only a few thousand.He originally had 130,000 silver, which he obtained in the Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li Family. The money was considered payment for his Thunder Flame Pill medicinal formula and the middle grade Profound Rank movement technique, Swift Wind Steps.After purchasing Blood Lingzhi twice, he almost finished spending all his silver.\u201cI haven\u2019t even broken through to the Core Formation stage yet, but I\u2019m almost out of silver. It\u2019s time I find a way to earn some money.\u201dAfter returning home and concocting the eight pounds of Blood Lingzhi into Blood Lingzhi Body Refinement Liquid with the help of Ke Er, Duan Ling Tian started pondering.Any random medicinal formula inside Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories had extraordinary value; they would easily able to be sold for a high price.But he wasn\u2019t willing to do this.A relatively common medicinal formula wouldn\u2019t sell for much.Whereas a medicinal formula that was nearly extinct in Cloud Continent, even if it sold for a high price, the large amount of wealth would surely incur unwanted attention.His current strength wasn\u2019t enough to handle such attention.He was self-aware.\u201cI have to do this.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Duan Ling Tian finally made a decision.In the Aurora City trade market, there were many medicine stores that sold medicinal liquids, but there were only a few stores that sold medicinal pills.After all, only graded alchemists were able to refine medicinal pills.Medicinal liquid, on the other hand, only required a medicinal formula, so anyone was capable of concocting some.Duan Ling Tian brought Ke Er along to the medicine store where he bought the Blood Lingzhi from.\u201cRespected customer, do you need anything?\u201d the manager enthusiastically greeted, his face glowing.As far as he was concerned, the youth before him was a huge customer, sweeping away thirteen pounds of his Fifty Year Old Blood Lingzhi in a short month\u2019s time.After removing his capital for obtaining his wares, the silver he earned from this youth was at least 20,000 silver.\u201cManager, this time I\u2019m not here to buy medicinal materials, but I want to put some medicinal liquid for sale here.\u201dDuan Ling Tian proclaimed his reason for coming.He planned to take out some of his completed Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to sell.Although the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was inferior to the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid Duan Ling Tian used, and the medicinal effect of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was only 10% of a Body Tempering Pill, the important thing was that the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was much easier to absorb compared to the Body Tempering Pill!An ordinary Body Tempering stage martial artist, even with the help of a Thunder Flame Pill, would require ten days to absorb one Body Tempering Pill\u2019s medicinal strength.But one portion of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, if with the help of a Thunder Flame Pill, would only require half a day to be fully absorbed.In other words, compared to consuming a Body Tempering Pill, using the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to assist in cultivation would allow a Body Tempering stage martial artist\u2019s cultivation to increase by an entire 100%.\u201cCustomer, you\u2026you\u2019re not joking, right?\u201dAfter hearing the medicinal effects of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, the manager was stupefied.To him, this was truly unbelievable.If it was really as the customer before him said, then wouldn\u2019t the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid be able to fully take over the market of the Body Tempering Pill?\u201cManager, if you aren\u2019t interested, I can look for another store.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled, with an expression that seemed like he was saying \u201cI won\u2019t force you.\u201dThe manager hesitated for a moment, then he looked at the Li Clan crest on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s clothes before finally gritting his teeth. \u201cCustomer, I\u2019ll take ten portions from you to sell first, and we\u2019ll see how it goes. How about it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, passing over ten portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to the Manager.\u201cCustomer, how much should each portion be sold for?\u201dThe manager inquired.\u201cA Body Tempering Pill is one hundred silver, correct? Manager, sell these ten portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for one hundred and ten silver each. You\u2019ll get ten silver for each sale. How about it?\u201dThe manager\u2019s pupils constricted.After all, a portion of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid only had a medicinal effect of a tenth of what a Body Tempering Pill had.Even Ke Er was shocked. She knew that the cost of the medicinal materials needed to concoct the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.A portion of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid required medicinal materials cost not even a silver coin.This was extremely profitable!\u201cManager, when you sell the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for me, I only have one request: don\u2019t let anyone know that it was I who entrusted them to you to be sold.\u201dAfter glancing deeply at the manager for a moment, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er left.\u201cTen portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s medicinal effect was only comparable to one Body Tempering Pill, but it requires 1,100 silver\u2026 A similar medicinal effect as a Body Tempering Pill, but the cost is a whole eleven times of a Body Tempering Pill.\u201dLooking at the youth and young girl from afar, the manager had a complicated expression.After leaving the medicine store, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er didn\u2019t return to the Li Clan Estate.They instead went to buy two horses, and ventured out of Aurora City.Their destination: Misty Forest!Exiting from the north city gate, the youth\u2019s and the young girl\u2019s horse\u2019s galloped forward.On the way, the young girl inquired curiously, \u201cYoung Master, you set such a high price for the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid; will anyone actually buy it?\u201d\u201cKe Er, let me ask you: if you had 10,000 silver, would you buy yourself a Body Tempering Pill or some Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid?\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t directly answer the young girl, but instead replied with a question.\u201cSix Treasures Body Tempering Liquid!\u201dThe young girl replied instantly without a need to ponder.Although the price for the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was ten times that of a Body Tempering Pill, the absorption of the medicinal effect had a speed that was double that of the Body Tempering Pill.Using the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to assist in cultivation would provide double the increase in speed as compared to a Body Tempering Pill!The young girl finally understood.But there was still a question in her heart.\u201cYoung master, you set such a high price for the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid; I\u2019m afraid not many people could afford to use it, right?\u201d the young girl inquired.\u201cI know.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe young girl was even more puzzled.\u201cKe Er, think about it; if I set the price of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid beneath the price of a Body Tempering Pill, would there be anyone who would buy Body Tempering Pills? At that time, not to mention it would affect the market of the Body Tempering Pills, it would initiate a series of adverse effects.\u201d\u201cEven I don\u2019t have the time to concoct that much Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2026 so I\u2019m only entering the high-end market. As for the people who are unwilling to buy the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, they can continue to buy the Body Tempering Pills,\u201d Duan Ling Tian explained.\u201cYoung Master is so intelligent.\u201dThe young girl felt enlightened.\u201cKe Er, once we enter the Misty Forest, no matter what happens, do not leave my line of sight,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said, with a serious expression.\u201cYes.\u201dThe young girl hurriedly nodded.Their horses galloped forward. Three hours later, Duan Ling Tian was finally able to see the Misty Forest.The Misty Forest is a primeval forest north of Aurora City, situated in the middle of three cities which included Aurora City.There would normally be many martial artists from the three cities who would enter deep into this primeval forest, hunting wild animals and ferocious beasts.The outer area of the Misty Forest is occupied by some fierce wild animals.Once the inner area is reached, only then can fierce beasts be encountered.Fierce beasts are unlike wild animals. Because of certain reasons, they transform into demons and undergo variation, so their strength is extremely terrifying.The weaker fierce beasts are comparable to a Core Formation martial artist, whereas the stronger fierce beasts are even comparable to an Origin Core martial artist.A Body Tempering Stage martial artist is only able to go around the outer area and hunt some wild animals.Duan Ling Tian had two objectives for coming to the Misty Forest.The first, earn money!The second, to temper Ke Er!In the Misty Forest, some of the stronger wild animals have fur and some body parts that are worth quite a high price.For example, hunting an adult rhinoceros.The rhinoceros\u2019 thick skin and hide can be sold to weapon stores to be forged into a type of defensive armor.The rhinoceros\u2019 penis, on the other hand, is a tonic for men, able to be sold to medicine stores.The two combined would be worth more than three hundred silver.Moreover, an adult rhinoceros wasn\u2019t even the wild animal that was the fiercest or had the most value in the entire Misty Forest\u2026The type of wild animals Duan Ling Tian was aiming for were wild animals like tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves. The wild animals that stood at the top of the food chain; only by hunting these types of wild animals would he be able to earn large amounts of silver while allowing Ke Er to get the tempering and training she needed.Although Ke Er was at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage and had sparred with Duan Ling Tian on many occasions, she has never experienced a battle where life and death were on the line.As far as Duan Ling Tian was concerned, if a martial artist wanted to become formidable, he or she had to experience the test of fire and blood.Just like the weapons specialists of his previous life!He knew quite a few weapons specialists during his previous life, and each one of those weapons specialists had been through battlefields and mountains of corpses and seas of blood.Maybe their strength was inferior to the current Ke Er\u2019s, but in a life and death battle with her, the one that dies would definitely not be them.To Duan Ling Tian, on this world, besides his mother, Ke Er was the closest person to him.He hoped that Ke Er would have the strength to protect herself.He wouldn\u2019t be able to always be by her side.After helping the horses settle down outside of the Misty Forest, Duan Ling Tian brought the young girl along as he entered the Misty Forest.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian took the lead.Profound Rippling Steps!The young girl followed behind.After a month\u2019s cultivation, the young girl successfully cultivated her movement technique to the Rudiments Stage, and only a short distance away from the Initial Stage.Duan Ling Tian and the young girl quickly encountered some prey.Adult wild wolves.A total of ten.An adult wild wolf\u2019s strength was comparable to a martial artist at the sixth level of the Body Tempering stage.Of course, the most terrifying part of its body was its jagged teeth.If a sixth level Body Tempering martial artist were to be accidentally bitten in the neck, no matter how strong the defensive martial skill was, there would only be a slim chance of survival.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While I attract their attention, you attack from behind and take care of the three in the back.\u201dSmiling to the young girl, Duan Ling Tian flew out.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!He directly crossed over to arrive near the wild wolves, attracting the attention of the ten wild wolves.The young girl whose delicate figure was slightly trembling, took a deep breath and grit her teeth as she suppressed the fear in her heart, flying out as she made her way to the back of the ten wolves.Sword Drawing Arts!Duan Ling Tian started his attack.Whoosh!The violet sword shine flashed before instantly disappearing.Puchi!A wild wolf howled before dropping to the ground as a pillar of blood sprayed out from it.The smell of blood caused the remaining nine wolves\u2019 eyes to become crimson red, growling as they rushed towards Duan Ling Tian.The six wild wolves that were at the front bared their fangs as they pounced towards Duan Ling Tian.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body was as flexible as a spirit serpent; his legs stepped swiftly as he skillfully dodged the wild wolves\u2019 pouncing strikes, seeming as if he was playing around with them.Each time his Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword swept out, it took with it a wild wolf\u2019s life.After a short moment, the wild wolves that pounced towards him had all died.On the other side.The young girl finally mustered up enough courage, holding back the three wolves in the back.Sword Drawing Arts!Whoosh!A violet sword shine appeared.Instantly, one of the wolves that pounced towards her had its throat sliced open, and warm wolf blood sprayed all over her face.The nose-piercing smell of blood caused the young girl\u2019s stomach to churn.\u201cBe careful!\u201dNoticing the other two wild wolves pouncing towards the young girl while she was filled with terror and unable to move, Duan Ling Tian moved.Whoosh!The two wild wolves were killed with merely a single sword strike.The young girl could not bear it any longer, vomiting out her breakfast as her face became pale.\u201cHmm?\u201dSuddenly, as if noticing something, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.Run!Without hesitation, Duan Ling Tian pulled the young girl into his arms before flying up a nearby tree.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!He coiled up the tree like a spirit serpent until he arrived at the tree\u2019s top.Howl!Howl!\u2026\u2026At this moment, near the corpses of the ten wild wolves were another few packs of wolves, and their amount was still increasing\u2026The howls of the wolves were filled with rage.Looking at the surroundings filled with wolf packs, Duan Ling Tian started feeling anxious.Holding the young girl tight in his arms, he jumped over to another tree.Using the trees as a road, he moved forward\u2026Suddenly, an eagle\u2019s cry sounded and was approaching.Duan Ling Tian abruptly raised his head, vaguely able to see a black figure swooping down from above.Its target was him and Ke Er!\u201cNot good!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cKe Er, are you feeling better?\u201dSubsequently, he looked towards the young girl in his embrace.The young girl lightly nodded.\u201cThen stand here and don\u2019t move.\u201dPutting the young girl down, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze turned slightly cold.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Using the tree\u2019s trunk as the ground, he used it to assist himself to fly upwards to meet the black figure that was swooping down.The eagle\u2019s cry was getting closer by the moment.The black eagle had wings like the clouds, its eyes emitting a swift and fierce gaze as it swooped down towards Duan Ling Tian. Under the burning sun, its pair of claws seemed to flicker with a sharp sheen.\u201cDie!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart was quiet like water with a cold gaze that stared fixedly at the eagle\u2019s claws.Sword Drawing Arts!Whoosh!Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword swept out without restraint.The ear piercing eagle cry sounded, mixed with a trace of shrillness.\u201cDamn, its speed is so fast.\u201dDuan Ling Tian had an astonished expression as the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword that he swept towards the eagle only sliced off one of its claws.Whoosh!The eagle went berserk with rage, flapping its wings as it moved to attack once more.Even when Duan Ling Tian send the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword piercing into its chest, before it died, it still spared no effort to slap its right wing towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest, creating an ear piercing wind howl.Greater Teleportation!Without hesitation, Duan Ling Tian circulated his defensive martial skill!Bang!The huge wing slapped onto Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body trembled and his throat tasted something sweet, then he spat out a mouthful of blood.Although Greater Teleportation blocked most of the force and even used the power of teleportation to throw the eagle\u2019s body far away, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s internal organs were still slightly injured from the shock.\u201cThe strength of this eagle was in no way inferior to mine, nearly comparable to a martial artist at the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage.Duan Ling Tian felt shocked.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re OK, right?\u201dThe young girl had finally recovered slightly. She stepped on the tree trunks and flew over, arriving at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re injured!\u201dWhen she noticed the trace of blood on the corner of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth, the young girl\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cIt alright, it\u2019s only a slight injury.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head. His heart slightly twitched as he thought this.A human martial artist required the increase of the stage of cultivation of a martial skill in order be able to better utilize their strength.But animals like the eagle that were birds of prey at the top of the food chain, living in nature\u2019s survival of the fittest, they long since tempered themselves to gain methods to fully utilize their strength.Tearing a tiger or leopard alive, catching a python by force, it was all possible.The method in which the eagle attacked Duan Ling Tian earlier, in terms of might was comparable to a Mastery Stage high grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill executed by a martial artist at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage!Luckily, Duan Ling Tian was able to kill it in time, causing it to not have enough strength to continue the attack.Or else Duan Ling Tian would have surely been heavily injured!\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s all because Ke Er is useless.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s eyes dripped with tears.\u201cWhat are you talking about? My Ke Er is very brave, killing a wolf on her first attack\u2026Take it slow, you can\u2019t rush it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian comforted her.The young girl lightly nodded, her clear eyes emitting a firm expression.Consuming a grade nine Gold Injury Pill, Duan Ling Tian brought Ke Er along as they continued to move forward slowly on the ground.When he left the Fresh Breeze Town Li family, Grand Elder Li Huo gave Duan Ling Tian quite a few grade nine Gold Injury Pills.Subsequently, throughout their journey, Duan Ling Tian noticed that the young girl seemed to have completed a metamorphosis in a short while. Even when killing tigers or leopards, her expression would only slightly change, no more vomiting out of disgust like before.The young girl\u2019s staunchness caused Duan Ling Tian to feel gratified, but at the same time he felt his heart ache.\u201cYoung Master, there\u2019s a lot of fog over there.The young girl looked to the front.The forest a few hundred meters away was enveloped in a white fog, as if wearing a mysterious mask.This was exactly the reason how Misty Forest got its name.\u201cThat should be the inner area of Misty Forest, the area where fierce beasts roam\u2026 Ke Er, we\u2019re more or less finished today, so let\u2019s go home and come back tomorrow.\u201dDuan Ling Tian and the young girl brought their spoils as they walked back on the same path as before.When they passed the place where the wolves were killed, they noticed that the wolf corpses had vanished, only leaving behind dried wolf blood.Probably taken care of by the wolf packs.Riding their horses back, the setting sun was going down when the couple finally arrived back at Aurora City.After taking care of their spoils in Aurora City, trading them for 1,300+ silver, the couple returned to the Li Clan Estate.Just when the Li Clan main door was in front of their eyes, a stern shout sounded from behind them.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dDuan Ling Tian stopped his footsteps.He recognized the owner of the voice.Li Xiao.He didn\u2019t expect Li Xiao to still dare to come and make trouble for him.Slowly turning around, Duan Ling Tian saw Li Xiao standing not far away. Beside him was another youth around the age of eighteen.The youth\u2019s appearance seemed slightly similar to Li Xiao\u2019s.\u201cBrother, he is Duan Ling Tian. You must help me teach him a lesson,\u201d Li Xiao said to the youth beside him.After hearing what he said, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze flickered as he guessed who the youth was.He had once heard Li Shi Shi talk about him. Li Xiao had a brother who became an inner court disciple in the Clan Martial Meet one year ago.Li Zhong, currently eighteen years old, stepped into the Core Formation Stage three months ago.\u201cCalling you trash was indeed not wrong; now you can\u2019t even defeat a little kid. Don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201dLi Zhong didn\u2019t give a shred of face to his own little brother.Li Xiao could only embarrassedly smile.\u201cSo it was you who beat up my little brother?\u201dLi Zhong looked coldly at Duan Ling Tian in a condescending manner.\u201cWhatever he said.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shrugged his shoulders.\u201cAlthough Li Xiao is trash, he is still my, Li Zhong\u2019s, little brother. You beating him caused me to lose face as well. Don\u2019t you think you should give me an explanation?\u201dLi Zhong sneered.In his heart, however, he was slightly shocked.He heard from his little brother that even Li Yuan was not a match for this youth.This youth was only sixteen.A sixteen-year-old eighth level Body Tempering stage main clan disciple wasn\u2019t something the Li Clan lacked.But there were none that could defeat Li Yuan.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t guess wrong, as an eighteen year old inner court disciple, you will participate in the Clan Martial Meet half a month from now\u2026 If you want to help your little brother and teach me a lesson, you don\u2019t have to be so anxious,\u201d Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he said indifferently.The Li Clan\u2019s Martial Meet was the stage for the younger generation.Li Clan disciples at the ages of sixteen through eighteen, no matter whether they were inner or outer court disciples, would all be allowed to participate.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t listen to him; he\u2019s purposely delaying,\u201d Li Xiao hurriedly said.Duan Ling Tian was straightforward, staring at Li Zhong as he slowly said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m delaying. I admit I\u2019m not a match for you now, but in half a month, who loses to who is still unknown.\u201d\u201cInteresting, truly interesting\u2026If you\u2019a at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage, in half a month you will be able to break through to the ninth level at most. I really want to see what you will rely upon to fight me half a month from now!\u201dLi Zhong\u2019s eyes narrowed into a line, disdainfully laughing as he turned around and left.\u201cBrother!\u201dLi Xiao was anxious.Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cold gaze sweeping over, Li Xiao\u2019s expression was slightly fearful. He hurriedly caught up to Li Zhong and left.\u201cThis Li Zhong is exactly as Li Shi Shi said, obsessed with martial arts.Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\u201cYoung Master, how do you know?\u201d the young girl beside him asked.\u201cMy Ke Er\u2019s appearance is like a flower\u2019s, but he actually didn\u2019t even take an extra glance. If he isn\u2019t obsessed with martial arts, then what is he?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed loudly.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re teasing me again.\u201dThe young girl instantly blushed.\u201cOK, let\u2019s go home. We can\u2019t let mom wait too long.\u201dDuring the time that Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er returned home.In the Aurora City trade market.\u201cThe three great clans\u2019 Clan Martial Meet is about to begin, and the Body Tempering Pills have all been swept clean, so unlucky!\u201dMuttering to himself, a youth of around sixteen and in embroidered clothing walked into the medicine store under the watch of his two middle-aged bodyguards.\u201cYoung Master Xiao.\u201dNoticing the person who arrived, the manager\u2019s face was full of smiles.There were three colossi in Aurora City, respectively being the Li Clan, the Lin Clan, and the Xiao Clan.He instantly recognized this person. It was indeed the Xiao Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s youngest son.\u201cManager, give me three sets of the medicinal materials to refine Body Tempering Pills,\u201d the youth in embroidered clothing said to the manager.The manager lightly smiled as he asked, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, I have a new batch of medicinal liquid here. Its effects are the same as Body Tempering Pill\u2019s, but its ability to increase the speed of cultivation is double compared to the Body Tempering Pill. Are you interested?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I still haven\u2019t broke through.\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. His face had a puzzled expression.For the past half month\u2019s time, on every occasion that he absorbed the Seven Treasure Body Tempering Technique, he was clearly able to feel the changes in his body as it underwent metamorphosis.But every time he felt he would soon break through, he would be unable to.\u201cCould it be that it has something to do with the Spirit Serpent Form\u2019s mental cultivation method?\u201dDuan Ling Tian curiously searched through the memories of the Rebirth Martial Emperor.He quickly found an answer!\u201cF**k!\u201dDuan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help himself from spitting out a vulgarity.It turned out to be that the madman Rebirth Martial Emperor had added an extra something in his self-created Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form\u2026According to his theory, when the Spirit Serpent Form is cultivated to the ninth level of Body Tempering Stage, a strength of three ancient mammoths would be achieved by just relying on the fleshly body!The strength of three ancient mammoths is 30,000 Pounds.Duan Ling Tian was currently at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage and had a strength of 7,000 pounds, 2,000 pounds above the strength of an average martial artist at the eighth level of the Body Tempering stage.But at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, he would be able to possess a strength of 30,000 pounds.An ordinary martial artist at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage only had the strength of 10,000 pounds.In other words, when he breaks through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, he will be three times stronger than an average ninth level Body Tempering martial artist.The strength of three ancient mammoths!An ordinary martial artist would only be able to possess this sort of strength by relying on the fleshly body and Origin Energy when they reach the second level of the Core Formation stage.\u201cNo wonder I was unable to break through; it was actually the exceptional ability in the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form. It was because of the Spirit Serpent Form that the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was constantly activating the potential in my body, creating a foundation for me to successfully possess the strength of three ancient mammoths when I break through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.How long will I have to endure until the tides turn\u2026The next day at dawn.When he exited his room, Duan Ling Tian noticed that his mother had prepared a sumptuous breakfast.\u201cMom, what\u2019s the happy occasion?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly shocked.\u201cTian, looks like you really are going to have to let Ke Er protect you\u2026 Ke Er broke through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage last night.\u201dLi Rou blinked her clear eyes as she teased him.\u201cReally?!\u201dDuan Ling Tian was startled.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dKe Er slowly walked out of her room.The slim and graceful young girl seemed to have added on some charm after a night\u2019s time.\u201cKe Er, looks like you\u2019ll have to protect me from now on.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled tenderly.Ke Er\u2019s breakthrough was something Duan Ling Tian expected.With the assistance of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid and the Thunder Flame Pill, and Ke Er\u2019s natural talent, it wasn\u2019t strange for her to break through.After all, the Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique was not as abnormal as the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2026After having their breakfast, Duan Ling Tian notified his mother before bringing Ke Er along as he left the Li Clan Estate.This time, he planned to spend a few nights in the Misty Forest with Ke Er.To get proper tempering!\u201cIf I had noticed the unusualness of the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have promised to battle Li Zhong half a month from now in the Clan Martial Meet.\u201dOn the way to the Misty Forest, Duan Ling Tian laughed bitterly in his heart.He originally thought that he would surely break through before the Clan Martial Meet.At that time, he thought that after breaking through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, he would possess around 15,000 pounds of strength, comparable to the strength of one and a half ancient mammoths.Compared to Li Zhong, who was at the first level of the Core Formation Stage, he would only be weaker by a few thousand pounds.If he attacked unexpectedly while relying on the Sword Drawing Arts, he had a good chance of defeating Li Zhong.But now\u2026The ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage was far, far away.If he wanted to let his fleshly body possess the strength of three ancient mammoths, even with the assistance of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, it would at least require half a year to be successfully accumulated.\u201cIt\u2019s really like how they say \u2018don\u2019t act like your great or you\u2019ll be struck by lightning,\u2019\u201d [1] Duan Ling Tian muttered to himself.\u201cYoung Master, what\u2019s this about getting struck by lightning?\u201dThe young girl looked over curiously.\u201cNo\u2026Nothing\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly.Entering the Misty Forest this time wasn\u2019t the same as before; everything seemed to progress easily from experience.After a journey of hunting wild animals, Ke Er and Duan Ling Tian finally arrived near the inner area of the Misty Forest when the sun was setting.The wild animals around this area were quite ferocious; if not for Ke Er breaking through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t be daring enough to bring Ke Er this deep into the Misty Forest.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Sword Drawing Arts!Duan Ling Tian was like a spirit serpent, and his Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword was like the tongue of a poisonous serpent. Every time it swept out, it would take the life of a wild animal with it.Profound Rippling Steps!Compared to the bizarreness of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s movement technique, Ke Er\u2019s figure seemed much more graceful\u2026That night in the Misty Forest, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er slept out in the open.As a former exceptional weapons specialist, sleeping out in the open was as normal as eating to Duan Ling Tian.But it was different for Ke Er. She was restless until late at night when she finally fell asleep while listening to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s stories.Sitting on the tree trunk, looking at the young girl soundly sleeping, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s curled up into a light smile.Maybe a life like this wasn\u2019t too bad.Dawn of the second day.Some noise entered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.Seven people, five men and two women, were approaching from afar.These people were young, only at the ages of seventeen or eighteen.When they noticed Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er, they were slightly shocked as they didn\u2019t expect there to be people younger than them that dared to pass the night in the Misty Forest.Moreover, they were only two people.The five youths\u2019 gazes fell upon Ke Er, emitting a slight burning gaze.When the two young girls looked at Ke Er, their eyes emitted a sense of envy.When the seven of them arrived near Duan Ling Tian, a tall youth asked, \u201cShould we get them to help us?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? Wouldn\u2019t two more people mean we have to share two more portions? It\u2019s only a Black Python; it will be easy to kill it with the seven of us working together!\u201d a short youth said as he frowned.\u201cYeah, if you\u2019re scared, you don\u2019t have to come. The six of us can share it,\u201d the young girl who was dressed in revealing clothing and had a face covered in makeup said.The tall youth went silent.The seven of them passed by Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er, walking towards a different area.\u201cBlack python?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.Searching through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories\u2026Black python, a fierce beast that evolved from a wild animal. Its strength is comparable to a Core Formation martial artist.Allegedly, the nest of the black python has treasures that are formed from the spirit qi of heaven and earth. There would be rare medicinal materials, or rare ores, or maybe even spirit fruits.\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s follow them and see what happens.\u201dOn the spur of the moment, Duan Ling Tian took Ke Er and followed the seven people from afar.The seven people quickly entered the inner area of the Misty Forest.The inner area of the Misty Forest was covered in fog all year round, turning the entire forest into a maze of fog.As they entered the inner area of the Misty Forest, the figures of the seven people slowly became indistinct.\u201cS**t, I lost them.\u201dAfter a moment, Duan Ling Tian frowned.Bang!Just at this moment, a loud bang sounded nearby on the left.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er silently went towards the sound.What they saw was a huge, multicolored tiger, fighting with the seven people from before on an empty field.The multicolored tiger had an enormous body, greatly exceeding that of an ordinary wild tiger, and its strength was at the first level of the Core Formation stage, extremely ferocious.\u201cFour of them are at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026. No wonder they dared to hunt the black python.\u201dLooking at the ancient mammoth silhouettes above three of the youth and one of the young girls, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hearts twitched.Finally, by paying the price of one of their ninth level of the Body Tempering members being injured, the seven of them eventually killed the huge, multicolored tiger.After collecting the valuable fur and other parts of the multicolored tiger, the seven of them continued forward.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er followed from afar.Finally, in front of a remote cave, the seven of them stopped.\u201cThe black python is inside?\u201dDuan Ling Tian brought Ke Er and hid on a nearby tree, watching from afar.Duan Ling Tian quickly saw one of the seven throw a stone into the cave.Instantly, an enormous figure flew out from inside. It was exactly an enormous python with an entirely pitch-black body.The black python was over ten meters long, with a pair of icy cold and piercing eyes, its tongue moving like lightning.\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201dImmediately, the figures of the seven of them moved, flying straight towards the black python and attacking with full force.Whoosh!The black python moved as well, as if transforming into a flash of black lightning. Its tail swung out and blasted a youth away. The youth dropped to the ground and fainted.Abruptly, the tall youth shouted, \u201cNot good. This black python isn\u2019t simply at the first level of the Core Formation Stage!\u201dThe young girl with heavy makeup looked towards the sword-wielding youth as she shouted in a delicate voice, \u201cWang Dong, pierce its weak spot!\u201d\u201cYou guys, hold him for a moment!\u201d the sword-wielding youth shouted in a low voice as he started to look for an opportunity.But the speed of the black python was not something they could compare to\u2026Another youth\u2019s head was quickly bit off by the black python\u2019s bloody mouth. The entire scene seemed incredibly bloody.Looking at this scene, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.But Ke Er beside him had a dreadfully pale expression and her delicate figure trembled.\u201cYoung Master, should we help them?\u201dKe Er\u2019s eyes emitted a trace of pity.\u201cIf we go help them, they might not even be willing, or maybe they would even think we wanted a share of the spoils.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.After a moment, with the help of the remaining five people who fought desperately, the sword-wielding youth eventually found an opportunity and pierced the weak point of the black python.But it seemed to be slightly off target.Bang!The black python went completely berserk\u2026The remaining five were either bitten to death or sent flying by the python\u2019s tail.Until the last person lied there lifeless, only then did the black python\u2019s enormous body finally drop heavily on the ground, its eyes emitting a sense of sorrow.Whoosh! Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er dropped to the ground, reaping the rewards at the earlier seven\u2019s expense. [2]At this moment, Duan Ling Tian noticed the black python raise its head and gaze at him. Its piercing eyes were actually emitting a begging expression.\u201cHuh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied.The black python suddenly raised its head and turned to look at the cave behind it. It shook its head as if it were begging for something.Only when he entered the cave did Duan Ling Tian understand what the black python was begging him to do.Inside the cave, besides three spirit fruits hanging on two bizarre plants, were two slightly cracked snake eggs that would hatch at any moment\u2026Out of the three spirit fruits, two were the same, whereas the other larger spirit fruit was slightly different.\u201cThis is\u2026 a Dark Spirit Fruit!\u201dThe memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor flashed inside his mind.Looking at the slightly large crimson red spirit fruit, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled and his face turned completely red.[1](TL Note \u2013 It\u2019s kind of like a Chinese rhyme saying, where the word \u2018act great\u2019 rhyme\u2019s slightly with the word \u2018struck by lightning\u2019 in the original Chinese text. It\u2019s something like an informal saying that means you will get retribution when you portray yourself beyond your ability. If you\u2019re curious its\u88c5\u903c &amp; \u96f7\u5288.)[2](TL Note \u2013 the idiom/saying Fisherman Reaps the Reward actually means the obtaining of a profit at another\u2019s expense which is how I translated it here.

Maybe this will be a turning point for me.\u201dDrawing in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian slowly suppressed the excitement in his heart.He didn\u2019t expect his luck would be so good.This pleasant surprise was really too huge.As for the other two dark violet spirit fruits, they were extremely rare spirit fruits as well.Violet Thorned Fruit.A type of extremely poisonous spirit fruit. If consumed by a human, it would cause instant death.But if consumed by a poisonous fierce beast, it would be a tonic to it.\u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s keep them.\u201dUnknowingly, the young girl had already taken the two fist-sized python eggs in her hand. She was looking at Duan Ling Tian with anticipation.\u201cSince their mother is dead, let\u2019s take them both home.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.The Violet Thorned Fruits were obviously ripe. The reason the black python still hadn\u2019t consumed it was probably because it was keeping it for its two offspring.After plucking the Violet Thorned Fruits and the Dark Spirit Fruit, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er left the cave.Ke Er\u2019s gaze never left the two python eggs in her hands. Her clear eyes were filled with motherly brilliance\u2026\u201cKe Er, wait for me over there.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked to the front of a passed out youth.His sensitive senses felt the suppressed killing intent emitted from the youth.A killing intent directed towards him!\u201cStop acting; your breathing sold you out,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said in a low voice, and in the instant that the youth\u2019s eyes emitted a terrified expression, his Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword had already silently pierced the youth\u2019s heart.At the beginning, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t expect he would bump into such a matter.So he and Ke Er didn\u2019t change their clothes which had the Li Clan\u2019s crest.Now, only with the death of this youth could he avoid any troubles in the future.As a former weapons specialist, Duan Ling Tian deeply knew the maliciousness of a person\u2019s heart.There was also the fact that the youth showed killing intent towards him.After taking a circle around, Duan Ling Tian noticed that four out of the seven had been killed by the black python. Adding on the one he just killed, there were still two more alive.Two extremely faint killing intents were indistinctly felt.They were obviously awake but pretended to be passed out.In the silence of the surroundings, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears slightly moved as he clearly heard their rapid and nervous breathing.Another two sword strikes went directly into their hearts!After finishing off the other two, Duan Ling Tian collected the more valuable spoils they had.He then glanced at the black python\u2019s corpse before giving up on the thought of cutting it up, then Duan Ling Tian slowly walked towards Ke Er.Half an hour later.The body of the short and stout youth who was supposed to have been pierced in the heart by Duan Ling Tian trembled. He struggled to open his eyes, then he removed a medicinal pill from his pocket with much difficulty and swallowed it.After a short amount of time.The blood flowing out of the short and stout youth\u2019s chest finally stopped.\u201cLi Clan\u2026 Member of Aurora City\u2019s Li Clan, you probably never would have imagined that my heart was naturally inclined sideways.\u201dThe short and stout youth struggled to sit up, his expression extremely grim.Because his heart was inclined sideways, he was able to keep his life.Suddenly, as if he had noticed something, the short and stout youth\u2019s expression change into an expression of terror as he hurriedly fled.After he fled.An enormous figure moved a thousand meters in an instant and abruptly descended, all while emitting a bizarre roar filled with rage\u2026Aurora City, Xiao Clan Estate.In a vast and luxurious courtyard, the youth in the embroidered clothing walked out. His expression seemed anxious.\u201cThat Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid is virtually godly! Based on my current cultivation level, consuming Body Tempering Pills would require at least around five days of consumption to achieve a breakthrough, but undergoing medicinal baths in that Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid will merely require two days of absorption before I can break through!\u201dThe youth dressed in embroidered clothing brought along his two bodyguards as he left the Xiao Clan and arrived at the trade market.\u201cManager, give me another hundred portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid!\u201dThe youth dressed in embroidered clothing entered the medicine store and directly proclaimed his needs.When the medicine store manager noticed the youth in embroidered clothing rushing over, he thought that the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was useless and the youth had come to sully the reputation of his store.But he never would have imagined that the youth would say this.A hundred portions?The manager\u2019s heart trembled.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, I\u2019m afraid It would be impossible today; I still haven\u2019t replenished my stock. How about two days from now?\u201dThe manager laughed bitterly.\u201cI really wonder what you were thinking. Such an excellent medicinal liquid and you didn\u2019t replenish extra stock. This is 5,000 silver as deposit. I\u2019ll come by to get it in two days.\u201dThe youth in embroidered clothing frowned, then he put down 5,000 silver before leaving in large strides.\u201cTwo days\u2026\u201dThe manager had a distressed expression.He was only casually mentioning the time earlier, and he was completely unaware when the Li Clan youth would return.Now he felt a bit of regret. If he had known earlier, he would have gotten more Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid from the youth.\u201cManager, what happened? Why the distressed face?\u201dJust at this moment, a voice sounded.The manager\u2019s gaze instantly shone brilliantly, as if he found his savior. He quickly went to greet the person.The person who arrived was indeed Duan Ling Tian!After leaving the black python\u2019s nest, he and Ke Er returned to Aurora City.They first went and took care of the spoils of their trip, exchanging it for 3,000 silver.Afterwards, out of a whim, he wanted to know how the sales of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was going, so he came to medicine store.\u201cManager, you\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the slightly discomposed manager with a puzzled expression.\u201cCustomer, the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid you put for sale in my store has been sold.\u201dThe manager took out a thousand silver and passed it Duan Ling Tian in a slightly agitated manner.Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he asked, \u201cThen, Manager, do you need more stock now?\u201d\u201cYes, yes! I want as much as you can give me!\u201d the manager hurriedly said, seemingly extremely afraid Duan Ling Tian would cut off his supply.\u201cDo you have an unused room here?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked the manager.\u201cWe do, Customer. You need it?\u201dThe manager was dazed.\u201cYes, I plan to concoct the medicinal liquid here from now on.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.The manager\u2019s pupils constricted as he asked in amazement, \u201cCustomer, you concocted the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a medicinal liquid. Is there any reason to get so excited over it?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.The corners of the manager\u2019s mouth twitched. He wondered if the youth in front of him had said that on purpose.A medicinal liquid that could thoroughly triumph over the Body Tempering Pill, was that an ordinary medicinal liquid?\u201cSince I\u2019m already here today, go prepare some medicinal materials for me. I\u2019ll concoct some for you now.\u201dAccording to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s request, the manager quickly finished preparing everything.Looking at the pile of cheap medicinal materials in front of him, and then looking at the large crock in the room, the corners of the manager\u2019s mouth started to tremble\u2026According to these proportions, the cost of manufacturing the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid was almost negligible.If this large crock was filled to the brim, it would at least produce around 2,000 portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, right?When Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er were about to prepare the medicinal materials, the manager suppressed the agitation in his heart as he self-consciously left the enclosed room and closed the door behind him.With the assistance of Ke Er, Duan Ling Tian finally finished concocting the large crock full of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid in an hour.He then walked out of the room and returning to the medicine store.\u201cManager, I\u2019ll trouble you to divide the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquids into portions.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled at the manager.The manager entered the small room for a moment before exiting once more with a glowing face.\u201cRespected Customer, that large crock of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid would at least be 2,000 portions\u2026 How bout I pay you the silver for 2,000 portions now, and we will sort out the difference later?\u201d the manager asked.\u201cOK, as for the cost of the consumed medicinal materials, just deduct it from the extra portions.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded as he received the silver bills from the manager.200,000 silver in bills felt heavy when held it.\u201cNo need. Those medicinal materials don\u2019t even cost a thousand silver combined, just take it as a gift from me.\u201dThe manager was very perceptive in the way he dealt with the situation.If it was in the past and someone had told the manager that medicinal materials that weren\u2019t even worth a thousand silver could be concocted into medicinal liquid worth 220,000 silver, he wouldn\u2019t believe it even if he was beaten to death.Now that the facts were laid out right before his eyes, he had to believe it.\u201cManager, since you\u2019re so frank, I\u2019ll take it. How about this: you can suitably increase the price of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. My bottom line is\u202680% for me and 20 for you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced deeply at the manager.\u201cThank you, Customer!\u201dThe manager took a deep breath.He knew that since the youth relented, he would naturally be able to change the price of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.\u201cOh yeah, before the end of our Li Clan Martial Meet, I won\u2019t come here again, so you better not sell off all the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid in a few days\u2026 Precious items are more valuable. Manager, you\u2019re an intelligent person.\u201dAfter saying one last thing to the manager, and under the manager\u2019s shocked gaze, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er returned to the Li Clan Estate.\u201cYoung Master, I didn\u2019t think silver was so easy to earn.\u201dKe Er\u2019s face was slightly red because she was mildly excited.\u201cHaha\u2026 Ke Er, not everyone has this sort of ability to earn money like your young master>\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed loudly.In the entire Cloud Continent, it would probably be only him and the Li Family\u2019s Grand Elder who knew how to concoct the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.Whereas only he knew how to concoct the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.After returning home and greeting his mother, Duan Ling Tian hastily returned to his room and consumed the Dark Spirit Fruit.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian felt a warm and boundless medicinal strength filling his entire body.His lifeblood was strengthening by leaps and bounds, and his fleshly body was undergoing a metamorphosis at full speed\u2026In the courtyard.\u201cKe Er, what type of egg is this?\u201dLooking at the two python eggs Ke Er placed on the table, Li Rou curiously asked.\u201cMadam, these are black python eggs.\u201dKe Er smiled.\u201cBlack python?\u201dLi Rou\u2019s pupils constricted.She of course knew of the bloodthirsty fierce beast, black python.\u201cKe Er, what happened?\u201d Li Rou asked.Ke Er obediently told her about what happened on her trip with Duan Ling Tian.\u201cSo it would seem that the two of you benefitted greatly simply by waiting for it to fall into your laps.\u201dLi Rou laughed.\u201cMadam, the young master didn\u2019t make a move to save them. Isn\u2019t that not nice?\u201dPuckering her pink, small mouth, Ke Er blinked her clear eyes as she looked at Li Rou.Although Ke Er didn\u2019t say anything in front of Duan Ling Tian, in her heart, she found it slightly difficult to feel at ease.In her pure and simple world, she felt that they should have helped those youths and young girls hunt and kill the black python.\u201cKe Er, I don\u2019t think Tian did anything wrong in this matter. Not to mention that the black python might have injured you, even if you really had helped them kill the black python, they might have joined hands to deal with you and Tian for the sake of obtaining the treasures that the black python guarded.\u201dLi Rou guided patiently and gently. She had experienced much more than Ke Er and thus knew of the maliciousness of a person\u2019s heart.For the sake of treasures, relatives killing each other could be found everywhere, let alone strangers.\u201cHmm, Ke Er didn\u2019t think so much about it at that time. Ke Er will listen to the young master in the future.\u201dKe Er lightly nodded as she slowly felt at ease.From this moment on, Ke Er would never doubt any of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s decisions in the future\u2026In her world, Duan Ling Tian was the heavens; he was everything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Take Ke Er and go register after you\u2019ve finished eating,\u201d Li Rou said to Duan Ling Tian as they had their breakfast.\u201cOK.\u201dAfter finishing their breakfast, Duan Ling Tian brought Ke Er along as he left.The young girl blinked her clear eyes as she slowly said, \u201cYoung Master, I heard from Big Sister Shi Shi that disciples who advance to the top few ranks will get quite the prizes during the Clan\u2019s yearly Martial Meet.\u201d\u201cOh? Did she say what prizes?\u201dDuan Ling Tian felt slightly curious.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi said that last year\u2019s champion, an inner court disciple, obtained a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi. Young Master, a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi should be much more precious than a fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi, right?\u201d she inquired.Three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.\u201cKe Er, I\u2019ll put it this way\u2026Fifty grams of fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi is worth a 1,000 silver; fifty grams of a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi would be worth at least 10,000 silver, and even at this price, there probably isn\u2019t any in the market.\u201dThrough the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, Duan Ling Tian knew the value of a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi.The Blood Lingzhi in the medicine stores were ordinarily around the fifty-year-old mark, and a hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi was rare.A three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi would be worth at least 10,000 for just fifty grams, comparable to ten pounds of fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi.A three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi would at least weigh a hundred grams, and be worth over 20,000 silver.If a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi was directly crushed and consumed, a mere fifty grams would be comparable to five pounds of fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi in terms of medicinal effects.However, the medicinal strength of five pound of fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi would require an ordinary person to spend an entire year to assimilate.Whereas a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi was different.Its medicinal strength could be fully assimilated in at most one month\u2019s time.If the former is compared to a tractor, then the latter would be a rocket!\u201cSo expensive?\u201dThe young girl\u2019s cherry lips slightly opened, obviously out of shock.\u201cIf the prize this time is a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi as well\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart twitched and his eyes emitted a burning gaze.If it was so, he was determined to obtain it!If he had a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi, he would be able to concoct even better medicinal liquids and increase the speed at which his defensive martial skill progressed by a lot.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er quickly arrived at the registration site.A stream of people was flowing in. After lining up for a moment, some \u2018inside information\u2019 entered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.\u201cLet me tell you guys, the disciples who get into the top ten in this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet will not only be able to enter the third floor of the Martial Repository Pavilion and choose a high grade Profound Rank martial skill, they will also obtain three one-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhis and 10,000 silver,\u201d an outer court disciple said mysteriously.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any news that leaked out so far. How do you know?\u201dImmediately, some people doubted him.\u201cHeh, you guys don\u2019t know this, but my cousin\u2019s neighbor\u2019s daughter-in-law\u2019s nephew is an inner court disciple; it was he who unintentionally overheard the discussion of a few Elders.\u201dThe outer court disciple from before complacently laughed.\u201cWhat\u2019s the prize for the top three?\u201d another person asked.\u201cThe prizes for the top three are nearly similar to last year. Besides entering the third floor of the Martial Repository Pavilion and choosing two high grade Profound Rank martial skills, they will also obtain a two-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi and 30,000 silver.\u201d\u201cHow about the champion?\u201d\u201cThe champion, on top of choosing three high grade Profound Rank martial skills, will obtain a three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi and 100,000 silver.\u201d\u201cOh my god, three hundred and fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi?\u201d\u201cThe prize for last year\u2019s champion was a three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi, and it was already shocking, I didn\u2019t expect that this year\u2019s prize for the champion would be even better.\u201d\u201cI heard last year\u2019s champion, Li Feng, used the three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi and cultivated his high grade Profound Rank martial skill to the Mastery Stage in one go. Among the youths below the age of twenty in the Clan currently, without using weapons, no one is able to break through his defense!\u201d\u201cYeah, Li Feng is a rare genius of our Li Clan, and he\u2019s only nineteen this year.\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing the discussion in his surrounding, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.Three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi?If he could obtain it and concoct it into medicinal liquid, it would be more than enough to assist him, Ke Er, and his mother\u2019s defensive martial skills to all break through to the Mastery Stage!\u201cIf I can break through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage before the Clan Martial Meet, becoming the champion won\u2019t be impossible!\u201dDrawing in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian made a decision in his heart to go all out!Spare no efforts to break through!The Clan Martial Meet was restricted to Li Clan disciples between the ages of sixteen and eighteen.Once one turned nineteen, it would be considered leaving the scope of the term \u201cyouth\u201d and they would be called \u201cyoung man.\u201dThis restricted from participating in the Clan Martial Meet.According to what Duan Ling Tian knew, in the inner court, disciples at the age of eighteen were mostly at the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, and a few had already stepped into the Core Formation stage.Unless he breaks through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, it will be extremely difficult to compete against them.Eventually, it was Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er\u2019s turn.At the registration site, the two of them registered and each got a number card.Duan Ling Tian was number 77.Ke Er was number 78.The Aurora City Li Family Main Clan had a population of almost 10,000. Youth disciples between the ages of sixteen to eighteen amounted to nearly 300 people.Besides a portion of inner court disciples, outer court disciples that met the criteria for registration amounted to over 200 people as well.For the first round of the Clan Martial Meet, the inner court disciples obtained a bye to the second round, whereas the outer court disciples would compete for thirty placements to directly become inner court disciples.The start of the second round would be the true fierce struggle.Deciding the top ten, top three, and even the champion!Winning matchless honor and generous prizes.The first round of the Clan Martial Meet competition would begin after ten days.For the next ten days, besides eating and sleeping, Duan Ling Tian was practically always cultivating the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique.Absorbing Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid in extremity, desperately assimilating the Dark Spirit Fruits medicinal strength\u2026For the sake of the three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi, Duan Ling Tian was really going all out this time!\u201cTomorrow is the Clan Martial Meet, but I still haven\u2019t broken through until now\u2026 Luckily, after the first round, the second round will only begin after three days. With my current strength, entering the top thirty of the outer court disciples in the first round isn\u2019t really a challenge.\u201dThinking up to this point, Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief.In these past ten days, besides cultivating, Duan Ling Tian did hear some rumors from Ke Er.The Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid had thoroughly become famous!Aurora City was going crazy over it!What the Li Clan outer court disciples discussed the most nowadays was the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.If anyone\u2019s parents bought them some Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, it would attract the jealousy and envy of many outer court disciples.Along with the arrival of Aurora City\u2019s three great clans\u2019 Clan Martial Meets, the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s supply could not meet the demand\u2026People who had no accumulated wealth in their homes would even go so far as to borrow money in order to be able to buy some Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for their children.The Clan Martial Meets affected the lives of many.If one was unable to become an inner court disciple by the age of nineteen, their life would be doomed to end without any accomplishments.As a parent, no one would hope for their children to face this.Of course, the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid did allow many eighteen-year-old outer court disciples to achieve a further breakthrough before the Clan Martial Meet, increasing their chances of advancing to become an inner court disciple.These examples that were plain for everybody to see caused the black market price of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to experience a price hike to 3,000 silver a portion.\u201cA bunch of madmen.\u201dAfter hearing about all this, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be amazed.It was lucky that he had long ago told the medicine store manager to keep his identity a secret.Or else, if anyone knew that he was the one who concocted the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, he would never get a shred of peace.In a wide courtyard of the Li Clan.Whoosh!An extremely swift figure stepped in at a peculiar pace. The figure flew past as if it had transformed into a gust of wind.The figure stopped and revealed itself.It was a youth at around the age of seventeen.It was precisely Li Yuan.\u201cHaha\u2026 Good! Yuan, your Unfettered Steps has finally stepped into the Mastery Stage. With this, besides Li Kuang, there will be no one in the outer court who can be your match. Even entering the top ten of the Clan Martial Meet wouldn\u2019t be impossible.\u201dA middle-aged man who stood at the side laughed.\u201cI will surely enter the top ten of the Clan Martial Meet! If I can obtain three one-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi, my Golden Bell Cover will be able to step into the Mastery Stage earlier.\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s eyes flickered, showing incomparable confidence!Quickly, a towering youth\u2019s figure flashed inside his mind.Duan Ling Tian!\u201cLast time, my movement technique was inferior to yours, allowing you to gain the upper hand.\u201cBut this time, my Unfettered Steps has been cultivated to the Mastery Stage. I will surely defeat you and mercilessly humiliate you!\u201dUnfettered Steps, a middle grade Profound Rank movement technique, when cultivated to the Mastery Stage, its speed will in no way be inferior to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Spirit Serpent Movement Technique.In a slightly cramped courtyard.Whoosh!An icy cold sword shine flew out accompanied by more than ten sword afterimages; it was as if a sword net had been condensed in the air, without an opening and extremely powerful.Clang!The three-foot-long blade entered its sheath.\u201cI have finally stepped into the Initial Stage before the Clan Martial Meet.\u201dThe green-clothed young girl stood still, her face had a light smile.A married woman with a slightly pale complexion was standing in front of the door, coughing twice before she slowly said, \u201cShi Shi, you need to properly thank the person that passed this sword skill to you.\u201d\u201cMom, why are you out here? Your body isn\u2019t well, so stay inside your room more often, and don\u2019t come out often.\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s face emitted a trace of reproach, supporting the married woman into the room.In another courtyard.\u201cYou really are trash. I passed the Howling Tiger Fist to you so long ago, but until now you still haven\u2019t broken through to the Mastery Stage!\u201dLi Zhong looked at Li Xiao with a gloomy expression.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLi Xiao lowered his head, not daring to retort.\u201cZhong, stop scolding your brother. He has already worked hard, it\u2019s just he\u2019s limited by his natural talent, which is far from yours.\u201dThe middle-aged man who was standing nearby couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer, so he interrupted.\u201cDad, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve spoiled him.\u201dLi Zhong frowned as he left Li Xiao behind and angrily returned to his room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have 100% confidence to enter the top ten in the Clan Martial meet.\u201d\u201cTop ten in the Clan Martial Meet? Looks like your Synchronous Shadow Sword has been cultivated to the Initial Stage.\u201dThe youth was slightly shocked of Li Shi Shi\u2019s ambition.Although Li Shi Shi\u2019s strength placed her at the top three in the outer court, the top ten of the Clan Martial Meet would require competing with many inner court disciples.Wanting to enter the top ten was no easy matter.\u201cYes.\u201dLi Shi Shi lightly nodded.\u201cIf you really want to thank someone, then thank Ke Er. It was because of her that I gave you that sword skill. Hmm, if there\u2019s nothing else, then I\u2019ll be returning to my room to cultivate.\u201dShrugging his shoulders, the youth turned around and returned to his room.Glancing at the youth\u2019s back, Li Shi Shi\u2019s gaze became complicated and she sighed faintly.\u201cEh, Big Sister Shi Shi, where\u2019s the Young Master?\u201dAn elegant and refined young girl entered the courtyard.\u201cHe\u2019s returned to his room to cultivate. Little Sister Ke Er, it\u2019s time for me to leave as well. Thank you. If it wasn\u2019t for you, Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t have taught me the Synchronous Shadow Sword.\u201dLi Shi Shi forced out a laugh before turning around and leaving.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi\u2026\u201dThe young girl noticed that something was wrong with Li Shi Shi.Li Rou had walked out of her room at an unknown time, shaking her head as she sighed while looked at Li Shi Shi\u2019s disappearing figure.As an experienced person, she naturally was able to discern Li Shi Shi\u2019s thoughts.At the crack of dawn the next day, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er arrived at the inner court Martial Arts Practice Field.The Clan Martial Meet would be held here.At a corner of the inner court Martial Arts Practice Field stood thirty combat arenas.The thirty combat arenas were in a circle. In the middle stood a high platform with seats laid on it.In front of the combat arena, a stream of people flowed.Along with the appearance of three aged Chief Judges, the noisy Martial Arts Practice Field became quiet.These three Chief Judges were all Li Clan Elders in charge of presiding over the Clan Martial Meet.Behind these three Chief Judges were thirty more judges; nearly all of them were young adults.The three Chief Judges were led by an old man with white eyebrows.Duan Ling Tian noticed an extremely dangerous aura emitting from the white-eye-browed old man.Duan Ling Tian understood that this person was definitely a powerhouse.Strong enough to slap the current him to death with a single stroke\u2026\u201cAs the lead Chief Judge, I\u2019ll introduce the rules for today\u2019s Clan Martial Meet\u2026 242 outer court disciples will be divided into thirty groups based on the number cards in their hands. Besides the first group having ten people, the rest will only have eight.\u201d\u201cThe thirty groups will each determine an arena master. As for the specific rules, the judges will let you all know. Of course, if you think your luck is bad and was divided into a strong group, you\u2019ll all have a chance later to challenge any one of the thirty arena masters. As long as you win, you will be the new arena master!\u201d\u201cWhen no one is left to initiate a challenge, the thirty arena masters will become inner court disciples.\u201dAfter the lead Chief Judge finished, the thirty judges started to divide the outer court disciples into groups.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er were divided into the same group.\u201cThis rules aren\u2019t too bad; they guarantee absolute fairness.\u201dDuan Ling Tian indifferently smiled.Duan Ling Tian was number 77 and Ke Er was number 78. They were placed in the tenth group.The tenth group had a total of eight people. Out of the other six, two of them recognized Duan Ling Tian.Earlier, when Duan Ling Tian defeated the Lin Clan outer court\u2019s top disciple, Lin Qi, they saw it with their own two eyes.Meeting Duan Ling Tian here, the two of them took the initiative and admitted defeat.Out of the other four, none of them could withstand a single move from Duan Ling Tian.As for Ke Er, her opponents wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to attack before her Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword had already descended upon their throats, causing her opponents to feel a chill run down their spines.Even the judges were speechless.The tenth group actually had two little freaks.In the end, it was up to Ke Er and Duan Ling Tian to determine the arena master of the tenth group.Gazes from the surrounding combat arenas descended on the two of them.On the central high platform.\u201cThe two of them look unfamiliar. Are they branch family disciples?\u201dOne of the Chief Judges was slightly shocked.\u201cThey are precisely branch family disciples; both of them are from the Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family, and they are both disciples with another surname. The youth among the two of them even the defeated the Lin Clan\u2019s Lin Qi a while ago in the trade market.\u201dAnother Chief Judge lightly smiled.\u201cLin Qi? The Lin Clan\u2019s Patriarchs youngest son? The top disciple in the Lin Clan\u2019s outer court, with a strength comparable to our Li Clan outer court\u2019s top disciple, Li Kuang?\u201dThe former Chief Judge was visibly moved.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it was him.\u201dThe latter Chief Judge nodded.\u201cA branch family disciple, and even a disciple with another surname\u2026such a pity.\u201dThe formed sighed.\u201cHumph! Branch family disciple, disciple with another surname, so what?! As long as they don\u2019t betray our clan, then they are members of our Li Clan.\u201dThe white-eye-browed old man grunted.Hearing this, the other two Chief Judged immediately went silent.Standing on the tenth combat arena, Duan Ling Tian indifferently said, \u201cI admit defeat.\u201dThis caused everyone, including the judges, to be disappointed.But Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er were together after all; although they were disappointed, they weren\u2019t shocked.Ke Er became the arena master for the tenth combat arena.After some time, an arena master appeared on each of the thirty combat arenas.Besides Ke Er, Duan Ling Tian recognized another three of these arena masters.Li Shi Shi, Li Yuan and Li Xiao.The three Chief Judges in the central high platform that was surrounded by the thirty combat arenas stood up.The white-eye-browed old man had an unchanging expression as he indifferently said, \u201cNow, those outer court disciples who failed to be chosen in their own group and are unwilling will now have a chance to challenge the other arena masters. If they win, they will become the new arena master. If they lose, they will lose the chance to become an inner court disciple.\u201dImmediately, noise erupted beneath the thirty combat arenas.After all, they only had one chance to challenge.They needed to spend some time to judge the strength of each of the arena masters before initiating a challenge.Whoosh!Quickly, a figure flew up onto the fifteenth group\u2019s combat arena, attracting the gazes of everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s Duan Ling Tian!\u201dMany outer court disciples recognized the figure.\u201cDuan Ling Tian? The outer court disciple that defeated the Lin Clan\u2019s outer court top disciple, Lin Qi, in the trade market?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cWith his strength, he could probably rival Li Kuang. How could he have been eliminated? Don\u2019t tell me he was eliminated by Li Kuang?\u201d\u201cNo, he gave the tenth group\u2019s arena master position to the young girl who never leaves his side, that young girl over there.\u201d\u201cSo beautiful! Even slightly more beautiful than the former top beauty of the outer court, Li Shi Shi.\u201d\u201cSince ancient times, heroes love beautiful women. No wonder he forfeited.\u201d\u2026\u2026On the fifteenth combat arena, Li Xiao\u2019s expression was gloomy.He didn\u2019t expect Duan Ling Tian to actually come challenge him. As far as he was concerned, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s decision was on purpose!\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dOutside the combat arena, Li Zhong\u2019s eyes emitted a fierce light.Although he always looked down upon Li Xiao, no matter what, Li Xiao was his younger brother; this was an unchangeable fact.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201dUnder everyone\u2019s gazes, Li Xiao took the initiative and admitted defeat.Even though the surroundings sounded with boos and caused his face to flush with shame, he still gritted his teeth and endured.By admitting defeat now, he would be able to conserve his full strength to battle another arena master.If he was defeated by Duan Ling Tian and Duan Ling Tian slightly attacks harder on purposed, once he gets injured, he would like lose any chance of becoming an inner court disciple.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, in three days, I will properly teach you a lesson.\u201dLi Zhong coldly glanced at Duan Ling Tian before walking to another combat arena with Li Xiao, helping Li Xiao to find an opponent.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed before closing and resting his mind.The arena master challenges progressed like a raging fire\u2026No one challenged Li Kuang, Li Yuan, and Li Shi Shi because these were the top three of the outer court. After forcing Li Xiao to admit defeat, no one came to challenge Duan Ling Tian either.Ke Er, on the other hand, had three people who one after the other challenged her.However, her Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword would always descend on the opponent\u2019s throat at the first possible moment, causing her opponent to be unable to move.\u201cThis young girl is similar to Duan Ling Tian; they are both freaks!\u201d\u201cI have a feeling that she might be even stronger than Li Shi Shi.\u201d\u201cYeah, in front of her, no matter if it\u2019s appearance or strength, Li Shi Shi is slightly inferior.\u201d\u2026\u2026The outer court disciples discussed with each other.Some of the inner court disciples who came to join in the fun were also slightly astonished as they took an extra glance at the young girl.\u201cBrother An, this little girl is really not bad. From today onwards, our inner court will have another female disciple whose appearance and natural talent is be able to rival Li Fei\u2019s,\u201d an inner court disciple said to the youth beside him.Li Fei, the top beauty in the inner court.The youth had a grey shirt with silver lining. His piercing gaze descended on the young girl and emitted a trace of greed and dominance.\u201cIt\u2019s Li An!\u201d\u201cIt really is him!\u201d\u2026\u2026When the surrounding outer court disciples recognized the grey-clothed youth, they were unable to keep themselves from exclaiming.Li An, a famous inner court disciple of the Li Clan.One year ago, when Li An was seventeen and with his cultivation at the ninth level of the Body Tempering stage, he participated in the Clan Martial Meet and entered the top ten. His final placing was sixth, merely inferior to four eighteen-year-old Core Formation stage youths and one more ninth level Body Tempering youth of the same age.Now, among the inner court disciples under the age of nineteen, his strength was publically acknowledged as number two.As dusk, the Clan Martial Meet came to an end.After admitting defeat in front of Duan Ling Tian, Li Xiao successfully challenged another arena master.The thirty arena masters advanced to become inner court disciples.For a moment, many people shook their heads and sighed, and many more felt dejected.Among them, some were already eighteen. Since they couldn\u2019t become inner court disciples this time, it meant they would forever lose the chance to become inner court disciples.If they were branch family disciples, they would be sent back to their respective branch families!Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er walked shoulder to shoulder.Ke Er held onto his arm; her face had a smile of happiness.Many gazes of jealousy and envy descended upon Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHmm?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian frowned.Looking forward, at an empty space that had been opened up by the crowd, stood two youths around the age of eighteen.The youth with grey clothes that stood in front looked at him with a gaze filled with enmity.Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t understand why someone who he didn\u2019t even recognize would look at him with such a gaze.When he noticed the grey-clothed youths gaze move from him and on to Ke Er, he was enlightened.So the reason turned out to be Ke Er.Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but laugh in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kacha!Quickly, the two python eggs broken open one after another. Two exquisite little pythons stretched their heads out and poked out their tongues before swallowing down the python egg shell fragments.Subsequently, they looked at each other with unsatisfied expressions before looking at Duan Ling Tian and then at Ke Er.The two pairs of tiny eyes emitted a deep sense of attachment\u2026As if they were looking at their parents.\u201cYoung Master, they don\u2019t look anything like a black python.\u201dKe Er sized up the two little pythons before her willow-shaped eyebrows lightly knit together.\u201cThey aren\u2019t alike\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was also sizing up the two little pythons.The two little pythons were black and white respectively.The white little python had silver markings on its body. The markings were extremely complicated, difficult to understand thoroughly.The black little python had gold markings on its body, exactly similar to the markings on the white little python.They both had one more similarity.Both of them had a small bulge on their heads.Duan Ling Tian searched through the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, but he didn\u2019t come across any memories that related to the two little pythons.In other words, even if Rebirth Martial Emperor was alive, he wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize the two little pythons.But, in the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, there was one type of python that had slightly similar overall characteristics to the two little pythons.That python was not a black python.But a fierce beast, the Snow Python.According to Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, the fierce Snow Python would be comparable to a Nascent Soul martial artist when it reaches adulthood\u2026A martial artist\u2019s cultivation after the Body Tempering stage was the Core Formation stage.After the Core Formation stage was the Origin Core stage.Only after the Origin Core stage was the Nascent Soul stage.A colossus such as the Aurora City Li Clan had many Origin Core martial artists.But Nascent Soul martial artists could be counted with one\u2019s fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the offspring of the black python was made with a Snow Python.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head, dispersing this absurd thought.Not to mention the difference between a black python and Snow Python, even the markings on the body of the two little pythons were not something neither the black python nor the Snow Python had.From this it could be determined that these two little pythons were not Snow Pythons nor black pythons.\u201cMaybe they are similar to their father. I wonder what type of python their father is. Rebirth Martial Emperor experienced the passage of two lifetimes and has a wide range of knowledge and experience, but even he couldn\u2019t recognize this type of python,\u201d Duan Ling Tian silently deduced in his heart.\u201cYoung Master, they seem to be hungry.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s voice caused Duan Ling Tian to come back to his senses.The two little pythons her their tiny eyes wide open, flickering with pitiable brilliance as if begging for something.Duan Ling Tian took out the two Violet Thorned Fruits that they brought back the other day from a corner of the room.The two Violet Thorned Fruits were precisely left behind for them by the mother of the two little pythons.Just as Duan Ling Tian brought the two Violet Thorned Fruits to Ke Er\u2019s side, the two little python\u2019s bodies trembled and they moved instantly.Whoosh! Whoosh!As if transforming into a bolt of white lightning and a bolt of black lightning, they flew straight towards the Violet Thorned Fruits in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand\u2026In a few moments, the two Violet Thorned Fruits had been completely nibbled by them until nothing remained.After eating their fill, the two little pythons fell soundly asleep.\u201cWhat type of snake are they?\u201dDuan Ling Tian and Ke Er glanced at each other, noticing the astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes.The speed of the two little pythons earlier, even if compared to their mother\u2019s, the black python, they wouldn\u2019t be much slower.An adult black python having such a speed was not strange.But these two little pythons had only just been born\u2026Duan Ling Tian\u2019s subconscious felt that these two little pythons were not so simple.After finding a box and poking a hole in it, Duan Ling Tian placed the two soundly asleep little pythons within. Only after doing this did he put on his outer garments, then he grabbed Ke Er\u2019s hand and walked out of his room.\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s go out for a walk.\u201dDuan Ling Tian and Ke Er walked out of their home, quickly arriving at the Martial Arts Practice Field.A corner of the Martial Arts Practice Field was currently surrounded by quite a few people.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201dDuan Ling Tian and Ke Er walked over.They supposed it would be someone sparring, but only when they approached did they notice it wasn\u2019t.A blue-clothed youth stood in the middle of the crowd, saliva flying from his mouth.Combined with his tone, he seemed to be a storyteller.\u201cAccording to what I heard, the adult Snow Python in the Misty Forest moved like a thunderbolt, killing a few Origin Core martial artists of Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan in seconds\u2026 In the midst of human martial artists, they were considered outstanding, but in front of the adult Snow Python, they couldn\u2019t even withstand a single blow!\u201dThe blue-clothed youth continued, as if he saw all this with his own two eyes.\u201cLi Yun, is there realty a Snow Python inside the Misty Forest?\u201dSomeone in the crowd asked.\u201cI, Li Yun, am famous in Aurora City for my ability to know everything, and my reputation is extremely good. News of this will spread throughout the entire Aurora City soon. At that time, you all will naturally know that what I said was true.\u201dLi Yun held his head high with a face full of confidence.\u201cLi Yun, you know every bit of news at the first moment, this we do not doubt. But this matter is truly unbelievable.\u201d\u201cYeah, according to reason, during this season, this python species of wild animals and fierce beasts should be hibernating, especially a top ranked fierce beast like the Snow Python. According to the records in books, among the python-type fierce beasts, the Snow Python has the highest level of somnolence.\u201dAnother person voiced their doubt.\u201cWhat you said isn\u2019t wrong, but according to the Origin Core stage lucky survivor of the Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan, that Snow Python seemed to have gone completely mad, killing anyone it saw, as if it was venting its anger\u2026\u201dLi Yun lightly nodded as he continued.The surrounding crowd were in high spirits. A few people even curiously asked, \u201cWhat do you think is the reason the Snow Python became like this?\u201d\u201cMy personal guess is either its mate was killed by humans, or its offspring have died,\u201d Li Yuan said.The speaker had no particular intention in saying it, but the listener understood.Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er glanced at each other before leaving the crowd.\u201cYoung Master, do you think that Snow Python is the father of the two little pythons?\u201dKe Er\u2019s clear eyes emitted a trace of compassion.\u201cThere is such a possibility.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered.The two little pythons were indeed possibly the offspring of the black python and Snow Python, and due to certain reasons, a variation occurred.Through the memories of the Rebirth Martial Emperor, Duan Ling Tian knew that variant fierce beasts existed\u2026\u201cYoung Master, should we send them home\u2026\u201d Ke Er said. Her clear eyes were slightly wet. She seemed to have thought of something.\u201cKe Er, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a worried expression.\u201cI thought of my mother. When my mom left me, I felt my whole world collapse\u2026 The feelings of that Snow Python right now are certainly the same as how I felt before.\u201dKe Er\u2019s voice slightly trembled as she spoke.Duan Ling Tian took advantage of the opportunity and embraced her in his arms, lightly patting her back as he gently said, \u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t you still have me?\u201d\u201cBeing able to meet Young Master is my good luck, but that Snow Python\u2026.\u201dKe Er\u2019s voice was almost in tears.Duan Ling Tian touched Ke Er\u2019s beautiful hair as he smelled the fresh fragrance it emitted and slowly said, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I promise you, after the Clan Martial Meet ends, we can send them back home.\u201dWhen he returned home, Duan Ling Tian noticed that the small box was empty.The two little pythons had vanished.Just when he and Ke Er were about to go looking for them.Whoosh! Whoosh!A black and a white bolt of lightning approached!The black little python coiled itself around Duan Ling Tian\u2019s wrist, and the white little python coiled itself around Ke Er\u2019s wrist, playfully flicking out their tongues at them.\u201cThey really are two little rascals.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head as he smiled.\u201cKe Er, give them names.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gazed at Ke Er.\u201cLet\u2019s call them Little White and Little Black.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled.\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re called Little Black.\u201dDuan Ling Tian raised his hand and looked at the little black python that was coiled on his wrist.At this moment, a strange scene took place.Duan Ling Tian saw that the little python actually looked at him and nodded its head, causing Duan Ling Tian to be dazed from shock.This little black python could understand human speech?After a moment, he noticed that the little black python was still continuously nodding. Only then did Duan Ling Tian realize that he had overthought things.The little black python seemed to have entangled itself with Duan Ling Tian and was unwilling to leave.The little white python was entangled with Ke Er as well.The two of them were helpless and could only bring them along at their side.After a moment of distinguishing, Duan Ling Tian noticed the little black python was male, whereas the little white python was female.That night, when Duan Ling Tian sat inside the bath barrel to cultivate, he noticed the little black python dive into the bath barrel, swimming across the surface of the water as it swallowed the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.At the same time, the gold markings on its body started to flicker in a dark gold lustre until it finished eating a full portion of the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. Only after it was satisfied did it fly out, then it lied on the corner of the bath barrel and slept.At this moment, the dark gold lustre on its body slowly dimmed.\u201cI wonder what this little python has varied into,\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.Two days passed.Tomorrow was the second round of competition for the Clan Martial Meet, and it was the true Clan Martial Meet.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation still wasn\u2019t able to break through.Although he could feel he was at a threshold, he still couldn\u2019t break through after a long time.He had already absorbed 80% of the Dark Spirit Fruits medicinal strength.\u201cIs it not my fate to get that three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.Hiss HissHe heard a light sound enter his ears. Only now did Duan Ling Tian notice that that little black python was contracted at the corner of the bed, flicking its tongue in what seemed like a greeting to him.Whoosh!In the next moment, the little black python\u2019s body trembled and it started wriggling.Sometimes slow, sometimes transforming into black lightning.Silent like a hermit, moving like a mad rabbit!At the beginning, Duan Ling Tian only used a curious gaze as he sized up the little black python.But slowly, the little black python\u2019s movements seemed to give him a certain enlightenment.His gaze became engrossed and dull.At this moment, the world in his eyes seemed to only contain the little black python that continuously flashed about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only then did he awaken.Only now did Duan Ling Tian notice that the clothes on his body were extremely dirty!A liquid similar to black oil had flowed out of his entire body. It was extremely sticky and rancid\u2026He removed his clothes and sat inside the bath barrel before cleaning his body with great effort.After cleaning up, he clenched his fists, slightly using some strength!Duan Ling Tian abruptly lifted his head.Hua!Above him, the forces of heaven and earth shook before developing into three ancient mammoth silhouettes. They were extremely lifelike.Lightly reducing the amount of strength exerted, one of the ancient mammoth silhouettes vanished.Reducing his strength once more, another ancient mammoth silhouette vanished.\u201cPerfect!\u201dDuan Ling Tian abruptly stood up and changed his clothes. His expression couldn\u2019t help but be filled with smiles.He succeeded!Before the Clan Martial Meet, he smoothly broke through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage.Possessing the strength of three ancient mammoths!The crazy theory of Rebirth Martial Emperor had perfectly been accomplished.Hiss hiss~A sound entered his ears as the little black python transformed into a bolt of lightning, coiled around Duan Ling Tian\u2019s wrist, and started nodding towards him.The little black python\u2019s actions, in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes, seemed to be it seeking credit for his achievement.\u201cAfter the Clan Martial Meet ends, I\u2019ll get you something good to eat.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly rubbed Little Black\u2019s body as he lightly smiled.Little Black closed its eyes with an expression of enjoyment.\u201cPlease leave, we don\u2019t welcome you here.\u201dSuddenly, Ke Er\u2019s voice sounded from outside, containing a trace of anger.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face distorted.Ever since Ke Er had started following him, it was the first time he heard her speaking with such a tone. Someone obviously had infuriated her.After opening his room\u2019s door, Duan Ling Tian walked out in large strides.With a glance, he noticed the two youths standing at the courtyard door. One of them was precisely the grey-clothed youth from before.\u201cBrother An asking you to follow him to the Martial Arts Practice Field is him thinking highly of you. I\u2019ve already been courteous to you, now don\u2019t push your luck.\u201dThe other green-clothed youth looked at Ke Er, getting slightly angry out of embarrassment.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dBut in the young girl\u2019s eyes, only the Young Master that had just walked out of his room in large strides mattered.The green-clothed youth\u2019s face turned grim as he shouted in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you!\u201d\u201cF**k off!\u201dDuan Ling Tian coldly swept the green-clothed youth with his gaze, his voice containing a trace of icy coldness.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dThe green-clothed youth\u2019s gaze turned cold and he was about to enter the courtyard to fight Duan Ling Tian.Smack!Just at this moment, the grey-clothed youth\u2019s hand descended upon the green-clothed youth\u2019s shoulder, stopping him.The grey-clothed youth looked at Duan Ling Tian in a condescending manner as he indifferently said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t worthy of her!\u201d\u201cSo you mean you\u2019re worthy?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.He had met arrogant people before, but never someone arrogant to this extent.Li An\u2019s eyes flickered as he threateningly said, \u201cOf course. I, Li An, at the age of eighteen, am the second strongest in the younger generation of the Clan. How could you, an uneducated bumpkin, compare to me? Kid, if you\u2019re sensible, hurry up and leave her side.\u201d\u201cSecond? If someone didn\u2019t know better, after seeing how brazen you are, they would think you were number one. So it turns out you\u2019re only number two.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cSay what you want, but in the Clan Martial Meet, I will certainly drench my three foot blade with your blood! Don\u2019t think that you can look down on others just because you\u2019ve broken through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage. The Core Formation Stage is only the beginning of the path of Martial Dao\u2026The current you is only an ordinary martial artist.\u201dLi An ridiculed him before leaving with the green-clothed youth.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed and a cold light flashed within.Drench his three foot blade with blood?\u201cYoung Master, you broke through?\u201dKe Er was slightly startled.\u201cYes, I just broke through.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he nodded.\u201cKe Er, what happened earlier?\u201d Duan Ling Tian inquired.\u201cThey asked me to go to the Martial Arts Practice Field with them. I rejected them, so the green-clothed youth kept pestering me.\u201dWhile mentioning the two of them, Ke Er\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of disgust.\u201cNext time, you don\u2019t have to bother with senseless people like them; just ignore them directly.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.\u201cOK, Young Master. I\u2019ll go help Madam in the kitchen.\u201dKe Er nodded before transforming into a gust of wind and entering the kitchen.During breakfast.\u201cTian, that Li An will certainly be gunning for you during the Clan Martial Meet. Be careful,\u201d Li Rou reminded Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI know, Mom,\u201d Duan Ling Tian replied with an unconcerned expression.\u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you killed Fang Qiang in Fresh Breeze Town you can act outrageously\u2026 Although Fang Qian was a martial artist at the first level of the Core Formation Stage and possessed the strength of two ancient mammoths, due to the limitations of his martial skills, his strength wasn\u2019t even half of Li An\u2019s,\u201d Li Rou continued.Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled.He naturally knew all this.Maybe when Fang Qiang attacked, his overall state would have been the same as Li An\u2019s, both being first level Core Formation martials artists and therefore able to draw upon the forces of heaven and earth, developing it into two ancient mammoth silhouettes.However, due to the difference between their martial skills, in a head on battle, Li An could kill Fang Qiang in a single move.If Li An circulated his defensive martial skill, he could just stand there. Even if Fang Qiang hit him until he collapsed from exhaustion, Fang Qiang wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt a single hair on his body.If Li An circulated his movement technique, Fang Qiang would only be able to eat his dust.This was exactly the difference in martial skills.The higher the martial art\u2019s rank is, the better its ability to perfectly exert the strength of the cultivator\u2019s entire body.Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled. As Li Rou saw it, he was unconcerned and persisting to do things his own way.\u201cKe Er, hurry up and persuade him.\u201dLi Rou quickly decided to get Ke Er to help.\u201cMadam, I believe in the Young Master.\u201dThe young girl replied with a single sentence, showing her confidence towards Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI really wonder what magic potion Tian gave you.\u201dLi Rou had a helpless expression.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry and be at ease. Your son will only let others suffer losses; he himself won\u2019t suffer any. After the Clan Martial Meet ends, I\u2019ll bring back the prize for the champion and let you see it properly.\u201dAfter eating his fill, Duan Ling Tian left behind this short line before leaving with Ke Er.They proceeded to the Martial Arts Practice Field.\u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s Big Sister Shi Shi.\u201dOn the way, the two of them met Li Shi Shi.The two became three.\u201cIn the Clan Martial Meet, the 30 newly advanced inner court disciples will compete with the other 56 inner court disciples\u2026 According to what I know, five of the inner court disciples have already stepped into the Core Formation Stage.\u201dLi Shi Shi shared the information that she knew of.Duan Ling Tian lightly nodded.\u201cSo we don\u2019t have any chance for the top three. The Core Formation Stage isn\u2019t something the Body Tempering Stage can compare to. What we can do now is strive to enter the top ten. To Little Sister Ke Er and you, it isn\u2019t really difficult. So how about it? Are you confident you can defeat Li Kuang and win over a spot in the top six?\u201dLi Shi Shi looked at Duan Ling Tian.Sixth?Duan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled.\u201cWhat?\u201dLi Shi Shi was puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being the sixth,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said indifferently.\u201cThen what position are you interested in?\u201d Li Shi Shi asked.\u201cThe champion!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of confidence.Li Shi Shi was instantly struck dumb.Champion?This Duan Ling Tian really dared to imagine.\u201cHahahaha\u2026.\u201dJust at this moment, loud laughter sounded from behind the three of them. The laughter was filled with disdain.Two figures quickly passed by the three of them.It was precisely the two brothers, Li Zhong and Li Xiao.Obviously they overheard what Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you want to be the champion, then you have to defeat me\u2026 I\u2019ll be waiting!\u201dLi Zhong glanced at Duan Ling Tian, his face filled with a mocking expression.Duan Ling Tian ignored Li Zhong.He liked to use facts to prove everything; debating was meaningless.Duan Ling Tian and the two girls quickly arrived at the inner court Martial Arts Practice Field.The thirty combat arenas remained.Presently, the thirty combat arenas were fully surrounded by people. Some were inner court disciples who were participating in the Clan Martial Meet and there were some Li Clan disciples who came to join in the fun.After a short moment, the three Chief Judges appeared.The thirty judges, on the other hand, got each on the thirty combat arenas.\u201cSilence.\u201dThe white-eye-browed old man in the lead\u2019s voice clearly transmitted into the ears of everyone present.For a moment, the noisy Martial Arts Practice Field became completely silent.\u201cCondensing Origin Energy into sound, this is something only a martial artist above the seventh level of the Origin Core Stage is capable of.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the white-eye-browed old man with a slightly startled expression.\u201cToday, the inner court disciples between the ages of sixteen and nineteen will carry out the final part of the Clan Martial Meet. This competition will decide the top ten, top three, and the champion, all of whom will obtain the generous prizes of the Clan,\u201d the white-eye-browed old man said slowly.Subsequently, another Chief Judge started narrating the prizes for the top ten disciples of this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet, the prizes of the top three, and finally the champion\u2019s prize.Duan Ling Tian knew of this since long ago.But the prizes that the Chief Judge spoke of still aroused the morale of most of the inner court disciples that were participating.\u201cToday\u2019s Clan Martial Meet will be conducted on a point basis where everyone begins with a single point. Every victory increases their points by one, while every defeat reduces their points by one. Finally, the ranking will be listed based upon the accumulated points. As for the question of fairness, you can all be at ease; out of the 86 inner court disciples, unless accidents happen, everyone will need to battle 85 times.\u201dThe Chief Judge explained the rules.For a moment, many people drew in a breath of cold air.85 battles\u2026Wouldn\u2019t that mean that they would have to battle every single inner court disciple?That pace would exhaust people to death!\u201cThis year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet will be divided into three days. The Clan has already planned out your battle order, pushing down the amount of battles per person per day down to thirty or below,\u201d the Chief Judge continued.Only now did the crowd of inner court disciples heave a sigh of relief.\u201cNow, the people called upon by the judge, enter the relevant arena. If you don\u2019t appear within five minutes, it will be considered as a forfeit,\u201d the Chief Judge said.The thirty judges on the combat arenas quickly started calling names.The first battle of the first round had a familiar face to Duan Ling Tian.Li Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were no possible shortcuts.Li Yuan walked off the combat arena in large strides. When he noticed Duan Ling Tian looking at him, he met Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze, and the corners of his mouth emitted a provoking and cold smile.Duan Ling Tian retracted his gaze, indifferent.If it was before he broke through, the current Li Yuan might be someone he would confront seriously.But now\u2026Li Yuan was not on the same level as him.To the extent that in his eyes, the current Li Yuan was weak and fragile like a child.In terms of strength, Duan Ling Tian was currently comparable to a martial artist at the second level of the Core Formation Stage.On the thirty combat arenas, the inner court disciples contended against each other like a raging fire.After each of the inner court disciples determined the victor, the judges would start recording their points\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dFinally, the judge called upon Duan Ling Tian\u2019s name.Combat arena number 3.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body moved towards the arena.His opponent was a slightly straightforward and robust youth.\u201cI\u2019m Li Zhen. Please go easy on me.\u201dThe robust youth naively smiled.\u201cI\u2019m Duan Ling Tian.\u201dDuan Ling Tian returned a smile.Across the entire surrounding combat arenas, the inner court disciples that competed would practically start fighting the moment they entered the arena. It was rare for them to speak to each other.Everyone wanted to swiftly defeat their opponent and win points.Li Zhen, however, was a special case.Whoosh!Li Zhen moved. His robust figure didn\u2019t not seem one bit heavy and cumbersome.With the strength of an ancient mammoth exploding out, Li Zhen\u2019s entire body seemed to have transformed into a gust of wind that blew towards Duan Ling Tian.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian moved to meet him head on.In terms of speed, Duan Ling Tian was slightly faster than the robust youth\u2026Of course, this was under the precondition that Duan Ling Tian suppressed his strength at the strength of an ancient mammoth.Li Zhen attacked a few times, unable to touch Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI admit defeat.\u201dAbruptly, Li Zhen\u2019s figure stopped.\u201cUp till now, only my speed was faster than yours, but you\u2019re already admitting defeat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly startled.\u201cThis is enough. If your speed is faster than mine, you\u2019ve already placed yourself in an invincible position. Continuing would be meaningless.\u201dLi Zhen naively laughed. He was extremely straightforward. He then jumped off the combat arena.Duan Ling Tian faintly smiled.This Li Zhen was really clear-cut.He followed and jumped off the combat arena.\u201cEh, where\u2019s Ke Er?\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian noticed that the young girl wasn\u2019t where she was earlier, he couldn\u2019t help himself from looking around to find her.After a short moment, on the neighboring combat arena, Duan Ling Tian saw the young girl\u2019s figure.Whoosh!The young girl stood there as the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in her hand soundlessly stuck itself to the side of her opponent\u2019s neck.If she used an ounce of strength, her opponent would surely lose his life.Her opponent\u2019s body slightly trembled as his cold sweat poured out, then he said, in a flustered tone, \u201cI\u2026 I admit defeat.\u201dOnly then did the young girl withdraw her sword. Under the burning gazes of the surrounding people, she descended the combat arena and returned to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side.The heavenly couple instantly attracted the attention of many people.Even more of those gazes were filled with jealousy and envy.\u201cHumph!\u201dNot far away, the grey-clothed youth who achieved one more victory after his opponent took the initiative and admitted defeat gazed coldly through the air descending upon Duan Ling Tian.Up till now, he had already won two matches.As a Core Formation martial artist, the opponents he met wouldn\u2019t even have the guts to fight him; they all admitted defeat before the fight started.A day\u2019s time quickly passed.Duan Ling Tian won a 27 straight matches, accumulating 28 points.Ke Er won a 28 straight matches, accumulating 29 points.The overall results for today were quickly released.On the notice board, today\u2019s results for the 86 inner court disciples were displayed for everyone to see. They were ranked according to the total accumulated points.\u201cEh.\u201dDuan Ling Tian quickly found a problem.Besides him and Ke Er, there were still over ten people who were similar to them, having maintained a thirty win streak.Among them were quite a few people Duan Ling Tian knew.Li Shi Shi, Li Yuan, Li Zhong, Li An.Placed at the front were all those who had obtained 30 points, a total of five people, all having a streak of 29 wins.Among the five were Li Zhong and Li An.\u201cThe battles arranged by the Clan today did not cause any of the relatively stronger inner court disciples to battle. They obviously purposefully arranged it this way so that the stronger disciples could battle towards the end of the Martial Meet.\u201dDuan Ling Tian could guess the reason why so many people maintained a winning streak.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er, you\u2019re so formidable, obtaining 29 points.\u201dLi Shi Shi arrived besides Ke Er.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, I only participated in an extra match compared to you. If your match count was higher by one, then our points would be similar.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled.Li Shi Shi was similar to Duan Ling Tian, having a streak of 27 wins, obtaining 28 points.\u201cThe Clan purposefully arranged it like this for sure. Look, the five people who were ranked at the top with a score of 30 points, they are all the Clan\u2019s below nineteen Core Formation Stage inner court disciples\u2026 But this is normal. They had the easiest time today. Without even having to make a move, their opponents admitted defeat,\u201d Li Shi Shi slowly said.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows knit.All at the Core Formation Stage?Besides Li Zhong and Li An, which he had met before, he had never once seen the other three.His gaze fell upon the notice board.Li Qing, Li Fei, Li Hu.These three people were the other three Core Formation Stage inner court disciples.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you can consider yourself lucky for now, but we will meet each other sooner or later. At that time, I will properly \u2018entertain\u2019 you!\u201dLi Zhong had brought Li Xiao to walk past Duan Ling Tian. When they were close, the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.\u201cIdiot!\u201dDuan Ling Tian indifferently spat out a word.\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dLi Zhong\u2019s body jerked, the smile on his face froze, and he slowly turned around. A pair of flaming eyes stared fixedly at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cKe Er, let\u2019s go home.\u201dIgnoring Li Zhong, Duan Ling Tian held the young girl\u2019s hand and walked off.Li Shi Shi glanced at Li Zhong with an odd gaze before catching up to Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er.Li Zhong\u2019s body was shaking.The gazes of ridicule from the surroundings caused his expression to turn extremely gloomy.\u201cHehe\u2026 Li Zhong, he called you an idiot and you actually endured it. I really admire you.\u201dJust at this moment, the grey-clothed youth arrived beside Li Zhong and indifferently laughed.\u201cLi An, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re aiming for; stop trying to sow discord here! In the next two days, I will meet him sooner or later and will defeat him, and then I\u2019ll mercilessly humiliate him. It doesn\u2019t require your concern.\u201dAfter coldly sweeping a gaze at Li An, Li Zhong took Li Xiao and left.Li An\u2019s expression turned grim, turning angry from embarrassment.On the way home.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er, did you see Li Fei today?\u2019 Li Shi Shi asked the young girl beside her.\u201cLi Fei?\u201dThe young girl was dazed.\u201cYeah, Li Fei, the number one beauty of the inner court. But now that there\u2019s Little Sister Ke Er, her title of number one beauty of the inner court might not only be her\u2019s anymore.\u201dLi Shi Shi lightly smiled.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, you\u2019re teasing me again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d\u2026\u2026As the two girls talked, their topic slowly moved to Li An.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you have to be careful of that Li An. At least ten inner court disciples were crippled by him in last year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet,\u201d Li Shi Shi said to Duan Ling Tian with a serious expression.Crippled?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed coldly.Who gets crippled when the time comes isn\u2019t certain yet\u2026\u201cIn the Clan\u2019s younger generation, Li An\u2019s strength is only below Li Qing\u2019s. He\u2019s stronger than the other three Core Formation disciples.\u201d Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s unconcerned expression, Li Shi Shi warned again.\u201cAmong the five Core Formation disciples, the strongest, Li Qing, what\u2019s his cultivation?\u201dDuan Ling Tian finally said something.But it wasn\u2019t to discuss Li An, rather it was moving the conversation topic to the strongest in the Clan\u2019s younger generation, Li Qing.\u201cHe\u2019s naturally at the first level of the Core Formation Stage. The reason Li Qing is the most formidable is because he cultivated the high grade Profound Rank martial skill, Strongman\u2019s Finger, to the Mastery Stage. Combined with his Perfection Stage middle grade Profound Rank movement technique and defensive martial skill, he sweeps through all opposition! He is publically acknowledged as the disciple with the highest comprehension ability in the current younger generations of the Clan.\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of respect as she slowly said this.High natural talent increases the speed at which one\u2019s cultivation level progresses.High comprehension ability increases the speed at which the martial skill cultivation progresses.It has to be said that Li Qin was indeed a person with an extremely high natural talent and comprehension ability.\u201cPerfection Stage middle grade Profound Rank movement technique and defensive martial skill\u2026 Comparable to a Mastery Stage high grade Profound Rank movement technique and defense martial skill. In terms of movement technique and defense techniques, he slightly surpasses me! In terms of offensive martial skills, relying on Sword Drawing Arts, I\u2019m not afraid of his Strongman\u2019s Finger!\u201d Duan Ling Tian lightly muttered to himself.\u201cBut if I fully exert the strength of three ancient mammoths, even with my movement technique and defensive martial skills being lower than his by a stage, I will still be able to compete with him!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone brightly, slightly filled with anticipation.This time, no matter what, the Clan Martial Meet\u2019s champion prize would be his for sure.Not for honor but only for the sake of the three-hundred -fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi.After just returning home and entering the courtyard.Whoosh! Whoosh!A black and white bolt of lightning greeted them, respectively descending upon Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er\u2019s wrists, coiling together.The two little pythons nodded to them like normal humans.\u201cThese two little things, I really do feel a little unwilling.\u201dThinking about how he would have to send them home after the end of the Clan Martial Meet, Duan Ling Tian sighed.\u201cI\u2019m not willing either\u2026But if we don\u2019t send them home, their father will surely be extremely sad.\u201dKe Er couldn\u2019t bear to part with them either.Hiss hissThe two little pythons seemed like they didn\u2019t even notice their vexation, happily flicking out their tongues.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tomorrow will be the most exciting moment!\u201dAn inner court disciple sighed.Everyone deeply felt the same. According to the current situation, tomorrow would surely be an intense struggle\u2026Just after arriving home, Ke Er entered the kitchen to help Li Rou prepare some food.Duan Ling Tian hadn\u2019t even sat down for a while before he was greeted by an unexpected guest.\u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian?\u201dThe person in the lead seemed to be an astute middle-aged man.\u201cYou are?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m the outer court manager, Li Yi. After you became an inner court disciple, the Clan arranged a new residence for you in the inner court. It was just cleared up today, so I brought a few people along to see if you needed any help moving over.\u201dThe middle-aged man\u2019s tone was filled with courtesy without any airs, communicating with Duan Ling Tian in an equal manner.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength was something he had heard off and he knew that this youth would achieve great things in the future, so he could not offend him lightly.\u201cThank you, Uncle Li. We don\u2019t really have anything that needs to be moved.\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly expressed his gratitude.After notifying the two beauties in the kitchen, their family moved into the inner court.The two beauties entered the kitchen of their new home, continuing their unfinished dinner preparations.After sending Li Yi off, Duan Ling Tian sized up their new home.The new home was extremely large and its courtyard was extremely wide, more than a few times larger than the courtyard of the previous house.\u201cFrom now on I don\u2019t have to go to the Martial Arts Practice Field to cultivate my movement technique.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as his body moved.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!He quickly started to cultivate his movement technique in the wide courtyard\u2026Flexible like a spirit serpent, swift like a bolt of lightning!Whoosh! Whoosh!The two little pythons flew out, coiling up the large tree in the courtyard. They were extremely lively.The black and white bolts of lightning entered Duan Ling Tian\u2019s field of vision.Enlarging limitlessly!Spirit Serpent Movement Technique was originally made by Rebirth Martial Emperor based on serpents, and thus has an extremely close interwoven relationship with snakes.\u201cThe other time, I observed Little Black\u2019s movements and was filled with enlightenment. Only then was I able to coordinate with the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid and Dark Spirit Fruit and cultivate my Spirit Serpent Form to the highest stage in a single night, breaking through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage! The Spirit Serpent Form is related to serpents, and Spirit Serpent Movement Technique is similarly related to serpents,\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.\u201cMaybe\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian quickly gazed at the flexible bodies of the two little pythons who were playing on the large tree, learning their movements to the best of his ability.Slow at times, swift at times!After an unknown amount of time, Duan Ling Tian deeply felt that\u2026This method really worked!Although he was still quite far from breaking through to the Mastery Stage of the Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, Duan Ling Tian could still feel his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique progressing by leaps and bounds.\u201cOnce the Clan Martial Meet is over tomorrow, I\u2019ll get something good for you two little things to eat.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gazed at the two little pythons, his mood elated.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dA familiar voice sounded from outside the courtyard.\u201cHow did you know we moved over here?\u201dAfter arriving outside the courtyard and seeing Li Shi Shi, Duan Ling Tian was slightly shocked.\u201cIt isn\u2019t only you who moved over. Don\u2019t you forget, I\u2019m now an inner court disciple as well.\u201dLi Shi Shi smiled.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was startled.\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors from now on.\u201dLi Shi Shi continued.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, you moved in next door?\u201dAt this moment, Ke Er, who was carrying some food out, heard what Li Shi Shi had said. She became slightly excited as her small face blushed.\u201cYup, Little Sister Ke Er, we can see each other more often from now on.\u201dLi Shi Shi lightly smiled as she nodded.As she spoke to Ke Er, she didn\u2019t forget to cast a glance at Duan Ling Tian.But she was bound to be disappointed.\u201cKe Er, you two continue chatting. I\u2019ll go help Mom carry the food out,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said to Ke Er before entering the kitchen.After the food had been carried out.\u201cShi Shi, come eat with us.\u201dLi Rou looked towards Li Shi Shi as she invited her.\u201cAunt Rou, that\u2019s not necessary; my Mom is waiting for me at home. Little Sister Ke Er, I\u2019ll be going home now. See you tomorrow.\u201dLi Shi Shi politely declined Li Rou\u2019s invitation before returning home.After the food.Duan Ling Tian continued to cultivate his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique in the courtyard.He understood the principle of striking the iron while it was hot!Dusk the next day.Escorted by Ke Er and Li Shi Shi, Duan Ling Tian went towards the Martial Arts Practice Field.On the way, he naturally could not avoid drawing many envious gazes.If a gaze could kill, Duan Ling Tian would probably have died countless times over.Since their home was in the inner court, it wasn\u2019t far from the Martial Arts Practice Field. They arrived in a few moments.\u201cSo many people!\u201dAfter arriving at the Martial Arts Practice Field, Li Shi Shi couldn\u2019t stop herself from exclaiming.The current Martial Arts Practice Field was filled with streams of people flowing about. There were youths, young adults, and even many middle-aged and old people.Not only that, but on the high platform surrounded by the thirty combat arenas, there was an extra middle-aged man and a few old people beside the three Chief Judges.Duan Ling Tian gazed over.The middle-aged man had a firm expression with an imposing manner and he wore a green robe with gold borders, seeming to have an extraordinary bearing.He sat at the middlemost seat on the high platform. His identity was obvious\u2026The Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Ao.As for the other few old people, they certainly had extraordinary identities as they were able to sit on Li Ao\u2019s sides.He reckoned they were figures of the elder level.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that even the Patriarch would come personally.\u201dDrawing in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart slightly stirred.\u201cSilence!\u201dAfter a short while, the Patriarch Li Ao stood up. He had condensed his Origin Energy into sound and transmitted it into the ears of everyone present.Condensing Origin Energy into sound again!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled.This Patriarch that appeared to be around fifty years old was actually a powerhouse who was at least a seventh level Origin Core martial artist!Although streams of people were flowing about, the entire Martial Arts Practice Field was currently deathly silent.Everyone\u2019s gaze descended onto Patriarch Li Ao.Among these gazes, some were fanatical, some were filled with reverence, and some we startled\u2026\u201cI\u2019m extremely happy that every year, I\u2019m able to witness the unparalleled demeanor of my Li Clan\u2019s younger generation. After today, this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet will officially come to an end. The disciples ranked in the top ten, top three, and the champion will receive prizes personally distributed by me. I won\u2019t waste time with anymore nonsense. Fellow judges, begin!\u201dLi Ao sat back down after finished.Streams of people flowed, surrounding the thirty combat arenas.The two people whose names were called would enter the combat arena and proceed to battle intensely.The winner would obtain a point and the loser would have a point deducted.After a morning\u2019s worth of time passed.Although he met with some opponents that were quite strong in the later matches, Duan Ling Tian still maintained his winning streak.At noon, he had already accumulated 73 points.The maximum number of points was 86 points.He still hadn\u2019t lost up till now.In other words, among the 86 inner court disciples, there were only 13 other people who hadn\u2019t met him in battle yet.Ke Er maintained a winning streak as well.Until now, there was still no one who could dodge the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in her hand.After a short moment, Ke Er was back on the arena again.This time, her opponent was\u2026Li Yuan!On the combat arena, Li Yuan gazed at the slim and graceful young girl, appearing somewhat embarrassed.The young girl stood on the spot with a tranquil expression.Li Yuan moved.Unfettered Steps!The strength of an ancient mammoth fully exerted as he flashed towards the young girl.Sword Drawing Arts!The young girl moved as well, then the violet sword shine flashed before vanishing, moving towards Li Yuan.In the air, an ancient mammoth silhouette was indistinctly visible.Hu!Li Yuan hastily moved aside. The light but piercing cold sword howl caused his expression to instantly change, not daring to face the young girl\u2019s edge head on.\u201cHe actually dodged!\u201d\u201cIn these three days, Li Yuan is the first person able to dodge her sword.\u201d\u201cAs expected of the former top three in the outer court. He indeed has some strength.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd surrounding the combat arena discussed together.Some people guessed that maybe Ke Er would lose.Only Duan Ling Tian had a tranquil expression.No one was clearer of Ke Er\u2019s strength than him.Besides the Sword Drawing Arts that was comparable to a Mastery Stage middle grade Profound Rank sword skill, Ke Er\u2019s high grade Profound Rank defense skill, Stealth Substitution, and her movement technique, Profound Rippling Steps, were all cultivated to the Initial Stage.Ke Er\u2019s natural talent and comprehension ability was something that even he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked by.In terms of cultivation, Ke Er and Li Yuan were comparable.In terms of movement technique, there was little to no difference.In terms of defensive martial skills, she completely dominated Li Yuan!In terms of offensive martial skills, she completely dominated Li Yuan!Until now, Ke Er had been executing her Sword Drawing Arts back and forth, and she hadn\u2019t executed any other martial skill.On the combat arena.Li Yuan\u2019s figure flashed unceasingly, as if he was looking for Ke Er\u2019s weak point.In the blink of an eye, his gaze shone.Heart Destruction Palm!He slapped out his palm strike which carried along the force of heart destruction, blasting onto Ke Er\u2019s back.Just when most of the people thought that Ke Er would be seriously injured, and even some people started scolding Li Yuan for being merciless and ruthless.Stealth Substitution!On Ke Er\u2019s body, a faint qi barrier flickered.Bang!Li Yuan\u2019s full force palm strike blasted onto Ke Er\u2019s defensive qi barrier. Instantly, all the force he exerted was diverted by her defensive qi barrier, sweeping towards an empty space. The defensive qi barrier shattered directly after, and although the young girl\u2019s light green dress lightly moved, she was without a scratch!Whoosh!Sword Drawing Arts appeared again.The Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in the young girl\u2019s hand descended onto Li Yuan\u2019s throat, just a sliver away from slicing it open.At this moment, Li Yuan had a dull expression.He was unable to regain his senses for a long time.\u201cKe Er is victorious!\u201dThe judge emitted an astonished expression as well, taking a long time before finally reacting and hurriedly announcing the results.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe crowd surrounding the combat arena was dumbstruck, unable to believe that what they saw was real.Such a weak and delicate figure was actually able to block Li Yuan\u2019s Mastery Stage middle grade Profound Rank martial skill Heart Destruction Palm\u2026Unbelievable!Only Duan Ling Tian had a tranquil expression.He had long since guessed the outcome.Ke Er didn\u2019t even need to use her movement technique to defeat Li Yuan.Ke Er\u2019s Stealth Substitution was a high grade Profound Rank defensive martial skill at the Initial Stage, comparable to a middle grade Profound Rank defense martial skill at the Mastery Stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She and that Duan Ling Tian were recommended by the Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family. The Branch Family of Fresh Breeze Town have really done a great merit this time.\u201dThe lead Chief Judge, namely the white-eyebrowed old man, lightly smiled.\u201cDuan Ling Tian? I heard that some time ago, when this kid was at the eighth level of the Body Tempering Stage and by relying upon his marvelous sword skill, he defeated the Lin Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s youngest,\u201d said another one of the elderly people beside Li Ao as his eyes shone brightly.\u201cThat did indeed happen.\u201dThe white-eyebrowed old man nodded with a light smile.\u2026\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian, Li Kuang!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice transmitted out, attracting the attention of many outer court disciples.For a period of time, the crowd of outer court disciples started surging over, surrounding the combat arena Duan Ling Tian and Li Kuang were on.It was extraordinarily bustling.They greatly looked forward to this battle.No matter whether it was Li Kuang or Duan Ling Tian, they weren\u2019t strangers to them.Li Kuang, the former top disciple in the outer court.Duan Ling Tian, a Branch Family Disciple that arrived at the Main Clan two months ago, having once defeated Lin Qi, who was considered equal to Li Kuang.Thanks to that battle, he became famous in the outer court.Li Kuang was a name Duan Ling Tian had heard of many times.Today, however, was the first time seeing him in the flesh.Li Kuang was around the age of seventeen, with a tall and thick build, and a pair of eyes that were brimming with radiating vigor.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I returned from the Misty Forest a few days ago, and then I heard about your deeds\u2026I have to say, you being able to defeat Lin Qi really caused me to be surprised. But if you think you can rely on that to defeat me, then you\u2019re extremely mistaken!\u201dLi Kuang spoke in a clear-cut, straightforward manner without the slightest amount of beating around the bushes.\u201cReally?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.On the high platform.\u201cThis one is Duan Ling Tian?\u201dThe Patriarch, Li Ao, took a few extra glances at the violet-clothed youth in the combat arena.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s him. The other day, he used his eighth level Body Tempering cultivation to defeat Lin Qi\u2026 Now that has even broken through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, Li Kuang probably isn\u2019t his match.\u201dThe white-eyebrowed old man slightly nodded.\u201cThat isn\u2019t certain. Li Kuang allegedly stayed in the Misty Forest for a few months. After fighting with wild animals throughout those days, he certainly would have had a breakthrough.\u201dAnother elderly person disapproved.In the combat arena.Li Kuang\u2019s body jerked as he moved like thunder.Whoosh!His arm\u2019s jerked as his body flew out like a gust of wind, like a roc spreading its wings, flying towards Duan Ling Tian.Above his head, an ancient mammoth silhouette dashed out with him, in a threatening manner.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.At the instant Li Kuang\u2019s body moved, he noticed.Li Kuang\u2019s movement technique\u2019s cultivation stage was comparable to the cultivation stage of his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique.Alkaid Palm!Li Kuang arrived in front of Duan Ling Tian in the blink of an eye, bringing with him a palm strike that carried the force to split open a mountain, flying straight towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest in full fury.\u201cIt\u2019s time to end this.\u201dDuan Ling Tian muttered to himself.Instantly, an ancient mammoth silhouette formed above him!He casually placed his right hand on his waist\u2026Duan Ling Tian stood on the spot, immovable like a mountain.Facing Li Kuang\u2019s palm strike without an intention to dodge.As if planning to withstand Li Kuang\u2019s palm strike head on.The spectators that surrounded the combat arena were stupefied.Has this Duan Ling Tian gone mad?Li Kuang\u2019s Alkaid Palm was a middle grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill at the Perfection Stage, so splitting mountains and shattering rocks was nothing difficult for it.Was this Duan Ling Tian thinking of using his fleshly body to withstand the strike forcefully?On the high platform.\u201cWhat\u2019s this kid trying to do?\u201dPatriarch Li Ao had a startled expression. Across his lifetime, it was the first time he had ever seen such a bizarre scene.\u201cCould it be that his defensive martial skill\u2019s cultivation level is on par with Li Kuang\u2019s Alkaid Palm?\u201dThe elderly person on his side was dumbfounded as well.On the combat arena.\u201cIf you want to seek death, then I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201dThe corners of Li Kuang\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer as his palm blasted down, only a meter away from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest\u2026As far as Li Kuang was concerned, unless Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive martial skill was on par with his Alkaid Palm, it would be impossible for Duan Ling Tian to withstand his palm strike forcefully.However, in the entire Aurora City Li Clan\u2019s disciples below the age of twenty, there was only one person able to cultivate his defensive martial skill\u2019s cultivation stage to be on par with his Alkaid Palm.That person was already nineteen this year.Whereas Duan Ling Tian was only sixteen.In his opinion, the chances of this happening were too slim.\u201cHas he gone mad?!\u201dAt the side of the combat arena, different from Ke Er\u2019s absolute confidence towards Duan Ling Tian, Li Shi Shi had an expression filled with worry.Li Kuang was an existence stronger than her.Even if her high grade Profound Rank sword skill, Synchronous Shadow Sword, was cultivated to the Initial Stage, relying upon her three-foot-long blade, she had no confidence whatsoever to defeat Li Kuang.Under the gazes of everyone present.At the critical moment.Duan Ling Tian moved.The arm which he had casually placed on his waist earlier abruptly moved in a circle, swinging directly outwards\u2026Without using any martial skill.Just a casual circular swing.Bang!In the next moment, everyone saw.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s right arm mercilessly slammed upon Li Kuang\u2019s chest, shattering the defensive qi barrier that appeared instantaneously on Li Kuang\u2019s body.Li Kuang\u2019s palm strike was just a hair\u2019s distance away from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest, but unable to descend in the end.Whoosh!Li Kuang\u2019s body was blasted flying by Duan Ling Tian\u2019s arm, which swung at him in a circular motion. He flew like arrow leaving the bowstring and collided into the side of the high platform before continuously spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood. Only then did he drop to the ground.Satisfying!Duan Ling Tian spat out a mouthful of foul air.Although he didn\u2019t use any martial skills, he did, however, use 18,000 pounds of strength\u2026Under the precondition of not drawing upon the forces of heaven and earth and developing it into the second ancient mammoth silhouette, swinging out his right arm and solidly blasting Li Kuang\u2019s chest causing him to be blasted flying!It has to be said that this type of feeling\u2026.Was f**king satisfying!A feeling that made his blood boil.He quickly noticed that including the Patriarch and his fellow elders on the high platform, everyone who saw the battle between him and Li Kuang was maintaining a dumbstruck expression.Until he jumped off the combat arena, only then were they able to react.\u201cF**k! Freak!\u201d\u201cA casual swing of the arm without even using martial skills was able to break Li Kuang\u2019s Mastery Stage defense martial skills and blast Li Kuang flying\u2026 Is this Duan Ling Tian really only a Body Tempering martial artist?\u201d\u201cIs he really a human?\u201d\u201cFreak!\u201d\u2026\u2026The people who were able to regain their senses were all stupefied.If Duan Ling Tian was a Core Formation martial artist who could rely on his Origin Energy and fleshy body, such a feat would not leave them shocked.But Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t use Origin Energy; he only relied upon the strength of his fleshly body to casually swing his arm\u2026It was truly unbelievable.How did he do it?On the high platform.Patriarch Li Ao and the elders all glanced at each other.In their hearts, they had the same question.\u201cCan it be that he has innate superhuman strength?\u201d One of the elderly people took a deep breath as he guessed.\u201cThere could only be this possibility\u2026 I could feel that the casual circular motion he swung his arm in contained a force exceeding 15,000 pounds. I reckon it was just a slight distance away from drawing upon the forces of heaven and earth to develop a second ancient mammoth silhouette.\u201dLi Ao nodded, agreeing to this.\u201cNormally, even if it was innate superhuman strength, at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, their strength would at most be 2,000 pounds higher than the average person\u2019s. This Duan Ling Tian is indeed bizarre,\u201d another elderly person said.On the side of the combat arena, the crowd split open a path.\u201cIt won\u2019t affect your ability to compete for the top ten, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked to the panting Li Kuang, who was leaning on the side of the high platform.He was smiling in an amicable manner. After all, he didn\u2019t have any enmity with Li Kuang.\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201dLi Kuang took a deep glance at Duan Ling Tian.He was lucky that his defensive martial skill had helped him withstand most of the force, or else his injuries would not be so light.He had to respect Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength!As far as he was concerned, Duan Ling Tian was virtually a freak.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded and smiled.\u201cIt was all thanks to you showing mercy and not using martial skills, or else I probably would have lost my chance to make it into the top ten.\u201dLi Kuang sighed.Duan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly before returning to Ke Er\u2019s side.\u201cWhat, is there something on my face?\u201dNoticing Li Shi Shi\u2019s strange gaze from beside Ke Er, Duan Ling Tian stared blankly.\u201cFreak!\u201dAfter holding back for a while, Li Shi Shi finally spat out a word.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help but freeze.Actually, it wasn\u2019t only Li Shi Shi who thought this way.Among the surrounding people, most of them sized up Duan Ling Tian with a gaze that seemed like they were looking at a freak.\u201cBrother, after he broke through to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, Duan Ling Tian actually became so much stronger\u2026.\u201dNearby, Li Xiao looked towards Li Zhong. His expression was ugly.\u201cEven I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201dLi Zhong\u2019s eyes flickered and the corners of his mouth smiled faintly.As far as he was concerned, only now did it have a sense of meaning. If Duan Ling Tian was too weak, it would be boring.\u201cBrother, the other day you shouldn\u2019t have\u2026.\u201dLi Xiao suppressed his voice to a low sound, his tone had a hint of complaint.\u201cWhat, have you grown your wings? Are you daring to question my decisions?\u201d Li Zhong\u2019s tone turned grim, interrupting Li Xiao.\u201cNo\u2026It\u2019s not like that!\u201d Li Xiao\u2019s expression had a sense of fear as he hurriedly denied it.Even if it was true, he wouldn\u2019t dare admit it.On the other side.\u201cBrother An, this kid\u2019s strength isn\u2019t something to take lightly. He defeated Li Kuang without using any martial skills,\u201d the green-clothed youth said to the grey-clothed youth beside him.\u201cHumph! So what? Just like I said before, until the day he steps into the Core Formation Stage, he can only be considered an ordinary martial artist.\u201dThe gray-clothed youth laughed in disdain.\u201cOf course, Brother An, you\u2019re a Core Formation martial artist; no matter how strong this kid is, he is still at the Body Tempering Stage. He will naturally not be a match for you.\u201dThe green-clothed youth seized the opportunity to kiss the grey-clothed youth\u2019s ass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You wouldn\u2019t lose to Li Kuang in any other area. We will enter the Misty Forest and fight wild animals more often in the future, then your combat experience will naturally be abundant.\u201dDuan Ling Tian comforted her.\u201cOk.\u201dThe young girl obediently nodded.As time went by, the Clan Martial Meet finally entered its climax.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, Li Zhong!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded outwards.\u201cLi Zhong?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he had a smile on his face as his body flashed up the combat arena.Li Zhong entered the combat arena before mocking him. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, we finally bumped into each other. Today, let me see what capability you have since you have the audacity to talk nonsense that you want to seize the title of champion in the Clan Martial Meet!\u201dDuan Ling Tian competing against a Core Formation inner court disciple had attracted the attention of many spectators.After hearing what Li Zhong said.The crowd went into an uproar.\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026 Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ambition is so huge! Is he actually thinking of seizing the title of champion in the Clan Martial Meet?\u201d\u201cDoes he really think a mere Body Tempering martial artist like him can defeat a Core Formation martial artist?\u201d\u201cPsh! No matter how strong the Body Tempering martial artist is, it will still be impossible to be a match for a Core Formation martial artist. Even if it\u2019s only a first level Core Formation martial artist who\u2019s merely initially developed Origin Energy, the strength they possess would be equal to an ancient mammoth.\u201d\u201cYeah, the strength of two ancient mammoths can be exerted at the first level of the Core Formation Stage. Although this Duan Ling Tian is quite strong, he won\u2019t be strong enough until he can draw upon the forces of heaven and earth to develop two ancient mammoth silhouettes.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too arrogant. Does he really think the five Core Formation inner court disciples are paper tigers?\u201d\u201cNow, let Li Zhong destroy his delusions, and let him sober up properly!\u201d\u2026\u2026Even Duan Ling Tian never thought that a single sentence from Li Zhong would put him at the cusp of public opinion, attracting the disdain of so many people.But he understood.Now he could only rely on his own strength to prove himself; only then will he be able to make these people shut their mouths for good.Clan Martial Meet champion.He was determined to win it!He will use his strength to prove everything.Duan Ling Tian stared fixedly at Li Zhong as he indifferently said, \u201cLi Zhong, whether I have the capability or not, you\u2019ll know once you try.\u201d\u201cI will naturally try! Not only will I try, I will defeat you in one move and let you properly experience the difference between the Core Formation Stage and the Body Tempering Stage!\u201dLi Zhong sneered.One move?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.Whoosh!Li Zhong moved and the Origin Energy in his feet burst forth. He immediately using the strength of two ancient mammoths, flew out with a leap, and flashed straight towards Duan Ling Tian.His speed was practically double of when Li Kuang executed his movement technique!The movement technique Li Zhong executed was a high grade Profound Rank movement technique, Crossing River On A Reed.It was his prize for battling his way into the top ten during last year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet.He spent a year\u2019s time to cultivate it to the Initial Stage.He always took pride in this achievement.\u201cYour speed is quite fast.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze brightened as his body jerked, abruptly flashing backwards.Suddenly.Bang!Duan Ling Tian stomped his feet on the ground. His entire body seemed to have transformed into a cannonball, flying straight out.An ancient mammoth silhouette slowly formed, appearing in the space above him.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian transformed into a bolt of lightning, moving to greet the violently approaching Li Zhong.No matter whether it was Patriarch Li Ao, the elders in the high platform, or the spectators, they all couldn\u2019t help but hold their breath.Looking at this stance, it was clear that Duan Ling Tian was planning to fight Li Zhong head on.As he flashed forward, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s upper body tilted backward into the shape of a bow, as if transforming into a strong, heavy bow.Whereas opposite of him, Li Zhong underwent largely similar movements.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian swung his right fist out in a straight line, bringing along with it thunder-like force.Howling Tiger Fist!LI Zhong attacked as well; his fist swung out like a collapsing mountain.Bang!Their fists collided.Li Zhong sneered as the force in his fist drained out!As far as he was concerned, in terms of martial skill cultivation stage, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Howling Tiger Fist was only at the Mastery Stage.But his Howling Tiger Fist had already stepped into the Perfection Stage.In terms of strength, his fleshly body and Origin Energy at full exertion were comparable to the strength of two ancient mammoths.Although Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t bad, it didn\u2019t reach the strength of two ancient mammoths, and thus was far inferior to his.At this moment.It was as if he could hear Duan Ling Tian\u2019s arm bones shattering.It was as if he could see the scene of Duan Ling Tian being blasted flying.\u201cHumph!\u201dNoticing the sneer on the corners of Li Zhong\u2019s mouth, how could Duan Ling Tian not know what he was thinking?Instantly, the force in his fist drained out as well, colliding with the force of Li Zhong\u2019s fist.Li Zhong\u2019s fist force instantly suppressed and destroyed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s fist strength, blasting towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s right arm.In this instant, if it was not remedied quickly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s right arm would at least break a few bones or even become crippled!Greater Teleportation!Duan Ling Tian was prepared; he instantly circulated his defensive martial skill.After all, Li Zhong\u2019s fist force had collided with his, so while suppressing and destroying his fist force, it had weakened considerably.The Initial Stage Greater Teleportation\u2019s defensive qi barrier was more than enough to fully withstand this fist force.Not only that, but even using the power of teleportation to return most of the force\u2026Do unto another what they did unto you!Presently, the scene on the combat arena was something extremely bizarre to the spectators.Seeing Li Zhong\u2019s fist strike breaking past Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strike, soon to blast Duan Ling Tian flying\u2026Just at this instant.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body slightly jerked and then did not budge an inch more.On the other hand, Li Zhong\u2019s expression turned grim as he was blasted flying like an arrow leaving the bowstring, dropping on the corner of the combat arena, nearly falling off.The surroundings of the combat arena was extremely silent.Most of the people couldn\u2019t understand why Li Zhong, who seemingly had the upper hand, would be abruptly blasted flying.Could it be that he was throwing the match?On the high platform.\u201cThe high grade Profound Rank defensive martial skill Duan Ling Tian cultivated is completely different from the martial skill cultivated by the little girl beside him. It seems to be even stranger\u2026.\u201dPatriarch Li Ao\u2019s eyes flickered.With his cultivation base, it was easy to notice some clues.\u201cAren\u2019t they Branch Clan disciples from Fresh Breeze Town? How could it be possible to have so many high grade Profound Rank martial skills? Moreover, these martial skills seem to be much more remarkable than our Main Clan\u2019s martial skills.\u201dAnother elderly person on the side was slightly startled.\u201cDon\u2019t forget, they are disciples with another surname. This Duan Ling Tian is even of the Duan surname! The Duan surname is well-renowned in our Crimson Sky Kingdom,\u201d the white-eyebrowed old man slowly said.\u201cWhat you mean to say is\u2026 the Imperial City\u2019s Duan Clan?\u201d\u201cIf Duan Ling Tian is really a member of the Imperial City\u2019s Duan Clan, having so many remarkable martial skills isn\u2019t something strange. But I\u2019m curious; if he\u2019s really a disciple of the Duan Clan, for what reason could he have possibly come from the Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family and even be recommended by them to our Li Family Main Clan?\u201d\u201cMaybe there were certain reasons behind it. After the Clan Martial Meet, I will send some people over to the Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family to do some digging.\u201d\u2026\u2026At a corner of the combat arena.\u201cUseless thing! Really throwing the face of us Core Formation martial artists.\u201dThe grey-clothed youth swept a cold and indifferent gaze at Li Zhong.\u201cLi An, you seem to be extremely resentful towards that Duan Ling Tian.\u201dA hearty laughter approached as a green-clothed youth walked in large strides towards him.\u201cLi Hu!\u201dLi An\u2019s pupils constricted when he noticed who it was.LI Hu was like him, also a Core Formation inner court disciples that was participating in the Clan Martial Meet.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Not enough confidence?\u201dLi Hu laughed.\u201cHow could that be possible? All he can do is play with trash like Li Zhong.\u201dLi An disdainfully laughed.On the other side.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength is quite good,\u201d said a slim and graceful young girl wearing light violet clothes. Her charming red lips slightly moved with a tone that had a trace of shock.The young girl had shining eyes and white teeth, having peerless elegance.\u201cHumph! Just a Body Tempering martial artist.Beside the young girl stood a proud and aloof white-clothed youth.His manner of speaking seemed to portray that he looked down upon everyone.\u201cLi Qing, he isn\u2019t any simple Body Tempering martial artist. When you were at the Body Tempering Stage, could you have achieved a feat like this? I\u2019m slightly interested in him. Such an interesting person.\u201dThe young girl faintly smiled, her clear eyes flickered with an enchanting brilliance.The young girl, however, didn\u2019t notice that at this moment, after hearing what she said, the white-clothed youth beside her had a completely gloomy expression.His eyes even gazed upon the violet-clothed youth on the combat arena, flickering with a slight malicious gleam.Nearby.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er, have you always known that Duan Ling Tian was so abnormal?\u201dLi Shi Shi noticed that the young girl beside her was not one bit shocked with Duan Ling Tian\u2019s performance.\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, how can you say something like that about Young Master?\u201dThe young girl was slightly displeased.\u201cOK, OK, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201dLi Shi Shi hurriedly smiled apologetically, her gaze once again descending upon the violet-clothed youth in the combat arena.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I really wonder how many lifetimes of fortune you accumulated to get a girl like Ke Er to be by your side.\u201dLi Shi Shi sighed faintly.She understood that based solely on this fact, no one could possibly replace Ke Er\u2019s position in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201dLi Xiao\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. His brother was actually forced into a disadvantageous position by Duan Ling Tian in a head-on battle.On the combat arena.Li Zhong drew in a deep breath, slowly calming down his agitated mood.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I have to admit, your defensive martial skill is really peculiar\u2026 But everything is over.\u201dAs his voice dropped, Li Zhong moved once more.Crossing River On A Reed!His entire body jumped agilely, like a swift gust of wind\u2026\u201cUnless your speed is faster than mine, I\u2019ll be in an invincible position. Once I find your weak point, you will undoubtedly lose!\u201dLi Zhong\u2019s voice spread out, as if coming from the surroundings.His body flashed about on the combat arena, disrupting Duan Ling Tian\u2019s line of sight.\u201cAre you really so confident?\u201dDuan Ling Tian started laughing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing it today, it really has a well-deserved reputation.\u201cThe sword skill he executed is exactly similar to the young girl\u2019s beside him, but the stage at which she executes it is inferior to him.\u201d\u201cMaybe the young girl\u2019s sword skill was passed down to her by Duan Ling Tian.\u201d\u201cDefeating a first level Core Formation inner court disciple with a cultivation at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026This Duan Ling Tian has really set a new record in our Li Clan!\u201d\u201cYeah, in our Li Clan, such a feat is unprecedented!\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd surrounding the combat arena discussed animatedly.At this moment, no one dared to question Duan Ling Tian\u2019s desire to seize the championship.Duan Ling Tian had this sort of strength.On the high platform.\u201cThe sword skill of that little girl has already made me hold her in high esteem, but I didn\u2019t expect that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword skill was even more formidable. It\u2019s hard to imagine how a mere sixteen-year-old can cultivate his sword skill to such a stage.Patriarch Li Ao heaved a sighed.\u201cYeah, our Li Clan has never once had someone with such extraordinary talent like him.\u201dOne of the elderly people on the side nodded in deep agreement.\u201cHaving such strength at sixteen, I wonder to what extent he will grow in another two years.\u201dThe white-eyebrowed old man\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of slight anticipation.After jumping off the combat arena, Duan Ling Tian returned to Ke Er\u2019s side.Quickly, Duan Ling Tian noticed that besides Li Shi Shi, there was another young girl at Ke Er\u2019s side.The young girl was around the age of eighteen. She was wearing light purple clothes and had a waist that could be embraced with a single arm. Her body was seductive in many aspects with every detail perfect, without a single strand of excess flesh.Her appearance was not inferior to Ke Er\u2019s, but compared to Ke Er, she had a more mature charm.She had pair of beautiful, clear eyes that seemed to be infused with boundless charm.With just a glance, she would be able to hook away the souls of men.Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be dazed when he crossed eyes with the young girl.\u201cWhat a seductive beauty!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart jerked, his lower regions slightly burning.Since arriving in this world, he was always under the condition of abstinence, long since causing him to feel restless and intolerable\u2026If only he was a little virgin in his previous life, but he just had to be a distinguished weapons specialist who couldn\u2019t be happy without women.Drawing in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian slightly calmed the restlessness in his heart.At this moment, he knew who this young girl was.It was surely the inner court\u2019s top beauty, Li Fei.Duan Ling Tian noticed that there was a white-clothed youth behind Li Fei.The white-clothed youth was about the same age as Li Fei and had a face full of arrogance. From start to finish, he never once looked Duan Ling Tian in the eye.\u201cYoung Master, this is Big Sister Li Fei.\u201dKe Er introduced her with a light smile.\u201cI\u2019ve guessed. The inner court\u2019s top beauty lives up to her reputation.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded. When his gaze descended on Li Fei, it was a slightly burning gaze.Li Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows slightly knit.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was something she wasn\u2019t a stranger to. Whenever she walked out of the Li Clan Estate, she would notice this type of gaze everywhere.This type of gaze was also the gaze she hated the most.People who had this type of gaze seemed to wish they could pounce on her and strip her.Instantly, an icy coldness arose in her heart.She even thought he would be different.But she didn\u2019t imagine he would also be lecherous!\u201cKe Er, Shi Shi, we\u2019ll talk again when we\u2019re free.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s clear eyes that stared fixedly at Duan Ling Tian had an extra icy coldness, but when she looked at the two girls on the other side, the ice melted as if spring had come.As soon as she finished speaking, she walked away slowly with grace.\u201cHumph!\u201dOnly at this moment did the white-clothed youth behind Li Fei have his gaze descend upon Duan Ling Tian with a sense of warning.Duan Ling Tian naturally ignored him.\u201cYoung Master, look at you, frightening Big Sister Li Fei away. She even wanted me to introduce you to her earlier\u201dKe Er\u2019s attractive red lips pouted, beautiful and loveable, causing others to wish they could go kiss and suck on them.Obviously, even she noticed the coquettish gaze Duan Ling Tian had when he looked at Li Fei earlier.\u201cLittle Sister Ke Er, Big Sister Li Fei was scared away by him?\u201dLi Shi Shi was slightly late in realization.When Ke Er dragged her to a side and whispered secretively, only then did she come to understand.Her gaze when she looked at Duan Ling Tian had an extra sense of hidden bitterness.But unfortunately, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s attention was not on her.\u201cHer impression towards me doesn\u2019t seem so good\u2026\u201dLooking at Li Fei\u2019s shadow from afar, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth held a slight smile.He had to admit that since coming to this world, Li Fei was the second girl that aroused his interest.The first was naturally Ke Er.However, Ke Er and Li Fei were complete opposites.If it was said that Ke Er was pure lily, then Li Fei would be a burning hot, red rose full of boundless temptation.The Clan Martial Meet went on like a raging fire.At this time, Ke Er and Li Shi Shi both met Core Formation inner court disciples at the same time, being Li Zhong and Li Hu respectively.Once they went on the combat arena, they instantly admitted defeat.They weren\u2019t Duan Ling Tian after all.\u201cI admit defeat.\u201dWhen the judge called upon Ke Er and Li An, Li An stood on the combat arena and waited for Ke Er with anticipation, but the young girl didn\u2019t even glance at him, directly admitting defeat below the combat arena.He looked from afar at the young girl holding the violet-clothed youth\u2019s hand, chatting and laughing but regarding him as nothing.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dLi An\u2019s face burnt with jealousy as he gnashed his teeth.The voice of the judges continued to rise and fall.\u201cLi Zhong, Li Hu!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded from the combat arena in front of Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLi Hu?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered. He heard Li Shi Shi mention that Li Hu was one of the Core Formation inner court disciples.Duan Ling Tian quickly noticed that before Li Hu and Li Zhong entered the combat arena, the surrounding crowd had already surrounded them\u2026With a quick thought, Duan Ling Tian understood.The battle between Li Zhong and Li Hu would be the first battle among the Core Formation disciples during this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet.Duan Ling Tian saw Li Hu. He was a strong-looking youth with a trace of cynicism between his brows.In the combat arena.\u201cLi Zhong, just give up. You can\u2019t even defeat a Body Tempering disciple; could it be you still hope to defeat me?\u201dLi Hu had a lazy expression, his manner of speaking containing a hint of mockery.\u201cThat will depend on your capability.\u201dLi Zhong laughed coldly.This Li Hu had to bring that up and touch a tender spot, completely enraging him.Crossing River On A Reed!Li Zhong seemed to transform into a gust of wind as he pounced towards Li Hu.The two of them were quickly entangled in an intense battle.Accompanying their movements were the two ancient mammoth silhouettes above each of them, dashing out with them with an imposing manner that could pierce through the sky.They were equally matched.Finally, Li Zhong saw through a weak point of Li Hu, blasting Li Hu off the combat arena.\u201cDespicable!\u201dLi Hu gave vent to a torrent of insults, but just when he wanted to rush up the combat arena for another round with Li Zhong, the judge stopped him.\u201cLi Hu, didn\u2019t you say I can\u2019t even defeat a Body Tempering disciple? Now you can\u2019t even defeat I, who can\u2019t defeat a Body Tempering disciple. How do you feel?\u201dLi Zhong started laughing with an expression of exaltation after attaining his purpose.At this moment, many people of the surrounding crowd couldn\u2019t bear to hold their laughter.After a short while, Duan Ling Tian entered the combat arena once again.All his opponents admitted defeat one after the other, allowing him to fully enjoy the treatment of a Core Formation disciple.Until he met Li Hu.The moment Li Hu entered the combat arena, Duan Ling Tian could clearly notice his restless mood.\u201cLooks like he probably wants to defeat me to wash away the shame from Li Zhong earlier.\u201dDuan Ling Tian guessed the reason in his heart.But even if Li Hu was defeated by Li Zhong due to carelessness, the difference in strength between the two of them really was little to none.Even Li Zhong wasn\u2019t a match for Duan Ling Tian, so Li Hu naturally was no exception.Duan Ling Tian quickly defeated Li Hu, continuing to maintain his dominating winning streak.\u201cLi Fei, Li Zhong!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded behind him. Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze slightly twitched as he held Ke Er\u2019s hand and walked out in large strides.The battle between Li Fei and Li Zhong.Li Fei\u2019s figure seemed to have transformed into a flashing red rose, attracting infinite gazes and becoming the focus of attention.As a woman, being able to step into the Core Formation Stage at the age of eighteen was indeed rare.What caused Duan Ling Tian to be shocked was that Li Fei\u2019s strength was actually better than Li Zhong\u2019s\u2026After two moves, Li Zhong was forced to admit defeat repeatedly.\u201cInteresting.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a faint smile.He didn\u2019t expect this beautiful and seductive young girl would have such strength.\u201cLi Hu, Li An!\u201dAnother battle between Core Formation disciples.What caused Duan Ling Tian to be astonished was that Li An defeated Li Hu in a single move.Of course, he knew that this was related to Li Hu\u2019s morale.From entering the combat arena to being defeated by Li An, he seemed to be somewhat distracted, obviously still unable to walk out of the shadow cast over him earlier.\u201cLi Zhong, Li Qing!\u201dThe battle between Core Formation disciples continued.\u201cHe is Li Qing?\u201dLooking at the white-clothed youth on the combat arena, Duan Ling Tian was startled.This guy, wasn\u2019t he the shameless \u2018lackey\u2019 that followed behind Li Fei\u2019s ass?Then he noticed that Li Fei didn\u2019t seem to like paying attention to him.This Li Qing was obviously in a one sided love affair.\u201cLi Zhong, just admit defeat.\u201dOn the combat arena, Li Qing raised his head in an arrogant manner. He looked at Li Zhong in a condescending manner and spoke with a domineering tone.Li Zhong\u2019s expression turned grim and his eyes emitted a feeling of rage.Just when the Origin Energy in his legs were about to burst forth and he was prepared to attack.Abruptly, his pupils constricted and his body couldn\u2019t help but tremble as his Origin Energy completely dissipated.\u201cI\u2026admit defeat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all shocked by the cultivation revealed by Li Qing.\u201cSecond level of the Core Formation Stage, huh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed and the corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile.The Clan Martial Meet was getting increasingly interesting.As the burning sun slowly dimmed, the Clan Martial Meet was coming to an end.Two figures flashed onto the combat arena.Li An, Li Fei.Li An had a slight advantage when the two battled, defeating Li Fei.Li Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows slightly knit, seeming to be slightly displeased.After a few more battles.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, Li Fei.\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded from afar.On the combat arena.\u201cWe meet again.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as his burning gaze sized up Li Fei\u2019s pretty appearance and hot body without restraint.\u201cHumph! Pervert!\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze, Li Fei grunted and her beautiful face blushed.Outside the combat arena.\u201cOh my god, what did I just see? Li Fei blushed\u2026she actually blushed!\u201d\u201cF**k, it\u2019s really true\u2026 Could there be a relationship between her and Duan Ling Tian? Why else would she blush the moment they met?\u201d\u201cThey certainly have some sort of relationship.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian really has good fortune in love affairs, already having a young girl whose appearance is not one bit inferior to Li Fei\u2019s beside him, and now even capturing Li Fei\u2019s heart.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd was in an uproar.Li Fei, the Li Clan\u2019s famous beauty who had countless pursuers but would rarely look a man in the eye was now blushing towards a man.If it was another person using the same gaze Duan Ling Tian used to size her up, it would only incur her murderous rage gaze.But now\u2026Facing Duan Ling Tian, she actually blushed!Unbelievable!Li An arrived beside Li Qing and slowly said, \u201cLi Qing, you pursued Li Fei for so long, but she was indifferent\u2026 Now she seems to be interested in that Duan Ling Tian.\u201dAs he spoke, his burning gaze swept past the nearby young girl.But the young girl\u2019s gaze was now completely on the violet-clothed youth in the combat arena, completely not noticing him.His expression couldn\u2019t help but turn gloomy.\u201cHumph! Just him, is he even worthy to compete with me?\u201dLi Qing sneered disdainfully.His speech showed how he completely looked down upon Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. You have broken through to the second level of the Core Formation Stage now, so in terms of strength, Duan Ling Tian cannot catch up to you no matter how hard he tries\u2026 But you should still be careful; he is skilled in sweet-talking women. Even Li Shi Shi seems to have her eyes on him,\u201d Li An said exageratively.\u201cLi An.\u201dSuddenly, Li Qing looked at Li An with a cold and indifferent gaze.\u201cHuh?\u201dLi An was dazed momentarily.\u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, you\u2019re interested in the young girl beside Duan Ling Tian, right? What, you\u2019re not confident to deal with him so you want to use me?\u201dLi Qing saw through Li An\u2019s thoughts.\u201cJust him? Don\u2019t joke around. It just depends on whether he meets you or me first. If he meets me first, I\u2019ll surely make him not have the strength to continue another battle, and you can save some strength too.\u201dLi An didn\u2019t feel ashamed about being seen through.\u201cSame here. If he meets me first, he\u2019ll surely have no chance to battle with you after me.\u201dLi Qing\u2019s gaze descended on the violet-clothed youth in the combat arena, killing intent flashing.On the combat arena.Li Fei naturally was able to hear the crowd\u2019s discussion, so she was ashamed and angry.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dWhen Li Fei noticed that Duan Ling Tian was still using that sort of gaze to size her up, her clear eyes stared at him fixedly as she gnashed her teeth and let out a shout of shame and rage.\u201cHuh? Is something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian came back to his senses and was dazed.This scene drew in a wave of cordial laughter.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you\u2019re unwilling to destroy a flower, then admit defeat,\u201d someone from the surrounding crowd said.\u201cAdmit defeat? Little Fei, do you need me to admit defeat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled as he gazed at Li Fei.Little Fei?For a moment, the people present looked at the two of them with dubious gazes.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s gaze turned gloomy and cold and the Origin Energy in his body became restless as if ready to swallow him up.On the combat arena.Li Fei couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, so she attacked in rage.She never would have thought that Duan Ling Tian would be such a scoundrel, actually calling her nickname\u2026Of course, she was curious in her heart about how could Duan Ling Tian have known her nickname.Wanderer\u2019s Flash!Li Fei\u2019s seductive and gracefully slender figure moved, as if transforming into a bolt of lightning, going straight for Duan Ling Tian.Above her, two ancient mammoth silhouettes dashed in and followed.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.Li Fei\u2019s speed was even slightly faster than Li Zhong\u2019s.\u201cHmm?\u201dQuickly, Li Fei noticed.She had already gotten close to Duan Ling Tian, but he actually didn\u2019t have any intention of dodging or attacking.\u201cLooking down on me, huh\u2026.\u201dA sense of shame and anger arose in Li Fei\u2019s heart.Starfall Fist!Under her violet clothes, her fist swung out like a falling star, descending towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered.His fleshly body instantly exerted a strength of 28,000 pounds\u2026Greater Teleportation!He circulated his defensive martial skill in preparation to take Li Fei\u2019s punch head on.Bang!Li Fei\u2019s fist slammed onto Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest in the next moment.Li Fei was dazed.Duan Ling Tian actually really didn\u2019t dodge, allowing her fist to slam into him with its full force.She felt slightly regretful. Was her attack too heavy-handed?\u201cThe strength of two ancient mammoths!\u201dSuddenly, Li Fei heard a wave of shouts of alarm enter her ears.Before Li Fei could even react, she felt like the fist which she slammed on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s chest actually wasn\u2019t even able to break through his defensive qi barrier.\u201cThis\u2026 How is this possible?!\u201dLi Fei\u2019s beautiful eyes constricted as her charming and beautiful face was filled with an expression of disbelief.She unconsciously raised her head and clearly saw.In the space above Duan Ling Tian, two ancient mammoth silhouettes were indistinctly visible\u2026Ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, the strength of two ancient mammoths?Her beautiful and charming face had only just emitted an expression of shock when\u2026In the next moment, she felt a boundless force reflect back from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s defensive qi barrier, flowing into her fist.This force was extremely familiar to her.It was precisely the force exerted by her Starfall Fist\u2026\u201cRetreat!\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. He realized that he might have taken things too far, so his body jerked and he hurriedly retreated.Li Fei, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t able to retreat in time.Although Duan Ling Tian restrained most of the reflective force from his Greater Teleportation, there was still a small amount that ignored the defensive qi barrier on Li Fei\u2019s body, going through her right arm before blasting onto her body.Immediately, Li Fei\u2019s face turned deathly pale.She flew out like an arrow leaving the bowstring, descending towards a corner of the combat arena.\u201cNot good!\u201dSuddenly, a startled shout sounded from outside the combat arena.Duan Ling Tian glanced forward and his expression instantly turned grim.Presently, the deathly pale Li Fei was powerless, unable to move her body in the air.And the head of her dropping body was on a collision course towards the pillar at the corner of the combat arena\u2026The square pillar\u2019s sharp edge was directly facing Li Fei\u2019s head.If Li Fei were to collide with it, it would lead to unimaginable consequences!On the high platform.Patriarch Li Ao\u2019s expression turned grim as he prepared to rescue Li Fei.But he was quickly dazed on the spot again.At this moment, it wasn\u2019t only him; even everyone who was spectating Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei\u2019s battle were all dumbstruck.At this moment, they seemed to have even forgotten about Li Fei, who was in imminent danger.On the combat arena, the youth that seemed to transform in a spirit serpent as he flashed out, revealing a shocking speed\u2026In the air above him, three ancient mammoth silhouettes abruptly formed. They were exceptionally dazzling.\u201cNo\u2026Impossible\u2026It\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201dSeeing this scene from afar, Li An shook his head in disbelief.He wasn\u2019t willing to believe this to be real.On the combat arena.Noticing Li Fei was in imminent danger, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t bother about anything else, so he exploded forth with his full unrestrained strength, revealed his maximum speed, and flew towards Li Fei.But, when he was halfway, he noticed that his speed was slightly slower than required.\u201cNo!\u201dInstantly, Duan ling Tian\u2019s eyes turned a crimson red and he let out an unwilling roar.On the high platform, Patriarch Li Ao and the elders noticed this, so their expressions distorted.But at this time, even they wouldn\u2019t be able to reach Li Fei in time\u2026The distance was too great.Li Fei, who was blasted flying, had a trace of despair flash in her eyes.\u201cAm I going to die?\u201dSuddenly, she saw the violet-clothed youth who had a ferocious expression as he desperately flew towards her\u2026At this moment, the youth\u2019s insanity caused a sense of warmth to arise in her heart.So it turned out that he wasn\u2019t really that detestable\u2026\u201cAh!!\u201d Duan Ling Tian, who was flashing at high speed, abruptly shouted.The muscles in his entire body bulged and his veins started moving about\u2026Bang!He stomped on the ground once more to gain momentum.At the instant his legs touched the ground, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mind flashed with a scene.In the scene, a white and a black little python were agilely flying about like bolts of lightning flashing by\u2026Vaguely, Duan Ling Tian seemed to have caught on to something.At the instant his body dropped on the ground to gain momentum, his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique underwent a change due to being forced by circumstances\u2026Mastery Stage!Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed explosively increased, flashing by and arriving beside the pillar before Li Fei.But Li Fei\u2019s head\u2019s distance to the corner of the pillar was extremely close, without much empty space in between.Duan Ling Tian grit his teeth and directly forced his body straight in between her and the pillar.Bang!Before he could even circulate his defensive martial skill, Li Fei\u2019s body had already descended, smashing into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s embrace.The piercing pain coming from his back caused Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face to become deathly pale and he grunted\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was without a scratch. She lifted her head and looked at Duan Ling Tian with concern.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s desperate measures to save her were still vivid in her mind.He had deeply moved her.\u201cBig Sister, can you get down off me first. You\u2019re so heavy, you should lose some weight\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly, then the piercing pain coming from his back caused his cold sweat to pour out.Luckily, he had cultivated to the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, so his flesh and bones had undergone a metamorphosis that was far above an ordinary ninth level Body Tempering martial artists, so he didn\u2019t really injure his muscles and bones.Li Fei\u2019s face blushed.She was puzzled in her heart. Was she really that heavy?Under the dubious gazes casted over, Li Fei got off Duan Ling Tian.\u201cYou\u2026 are your injuries serious?\u201dShe extended her hand and helping Duan Ling Tian up. When she noticed that the flesh on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s back was ripped open, her expression instantly turned pale.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t die.\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief, shakily standing up.Li Fei was silent for a moment before she said, \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cCan I get something more realistic\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian slyly smiled.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201dLi Fei was dazed.\u201cHow about you pledge yourself to me\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze burned once more.\u201cPei!\u201dLi Fei blushed; it was as if her face would drip blood at any moment.\u201cCough, cough\u2026\u201dThe judges\u2019 light cough sounded, destroying the romantic atmosphere around the two of them.\u201cThe two of you, do you still want to continue?\u201dObviously, the judge couldn\u2019t bear to continue watching the two lovers tease and flirt with each other.\u201cNo need, I admit defeat.\u201dLi Fei shook her head, following which she supported Duan Ling Tian down the combat arena in a careful manner, afraid that she might affect Duan Ling Tian\u2019s injuries.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201dKe Er and Li Shi Shi greeted him with an expression filled with worry.For a moment, Duan Ling Tian was surrounded by three girls.Innumerable gazes of jealousy and envy shot at Duan Ling Tian from all around.Every man that was present wished the one injured wasn\u2019t Duan Ling Tian but themselves instead\u2026\u201cFei Fei, are you alright?\u201d LI Qing arrived beside Li Fei as he asked concernedly.\u201cLi Qing, how many times have I told you to call me Li Fei?\u201dLi Fei frowned as she was slightly displeased. She concentrated on working together with Ke Er to help Duan Ling Tian dress the wound on his back\u2026From start to finish, she didn\u2019t even glance at Li Qing.Li Qing\u2019s expression turned gloomy as he took a deep breath.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I hope this small injury won\u2019t cause you to forfeit your battles later on.\u201dLi Qing\u2019s gloomy gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my target is becoming the champion.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked Li Qing in the eye without a shred of fear.\u201cHumph!\u201dLi Qing turned around and left after snorting coldly.He was afraid that if he stayed there for a moment longer, he would be unable to restrain himself from trying to kill Duan Ling Tian.After the danger to Li Fei was resolved, the attention of the people present moved towards Duan Ling Tian.Today, Duan Ling Tian gave them an immense shock.Firstly defeating a Core Formation inner court disciple with a cultivation of the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage.Afterwards, he even drew upon the forces of heaven and earth and formed two ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026Possessing the strength of two ancient mammoths at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage.This was something that they had never heard of before!But even this wasn\u2019t the end of it.In the end, to save Li Fei from danger.Duan Ling Tian exploded forth once more, even causing the third ancient mammoth silhouette to appear\u2026Since the beginning, they hadn\u2019t once seen Duan Ling Tian use Origin Energy.In other words.Duan Ling at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage possessed the strength of three ancient mammoths.If they didn\u2019t see it with their own two eyes, they wouldn\u2019t believe that what they saw was real even if someone beat them to death.\u201cNo wonder Duan Ling Tian proclaimed he would compete for the champion prize; it turned out that he was so strong.\u201d\u201cYeah, although Li Qing is at the second level of the Core Formation Stage, Li Qing at full strength is only comparable to the strength of three ancient mammoths\u2026 based on this fact, Duan Ling Tian isn\u2019t one bit inferior to him.\u201d\u201cMoreover, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s martial skills are all extremely formidable, so defeating Li Qing isn\u2019t impossible.\u201d\u201cI believe in Duan Ling Tian as well.\u201d\u2026\u2026Among the crowd\u2019s whispers and discussions, many people looked favorably towards Duan Ling Tian.These words in Li Qing\u2019s ears were exceptionally piercing.His expression turned gloomy as killing intent flashed in his eyes, clenching his fist tightly until the veins in his fist jumped about\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dEven though Duan Ling Tian possessing the strength of three ancient mammoths caused him to be shocked, he still looked down upon Duan Ling Tian.As far as he was concerned, Duan Ling Tian was only a little kid in the end, and having this sort of strength would undoubtedly be due to some sort of fortuitous gain.He was only just a lucky Branch Family disciple.How could he be a match for him, this genius of the Li Clan.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that this Duan Ling Tian had concealed such strength. Being defeated by him isn\u2019t an injustice anymore.\u201dLi Zhong had a complicated gaze as he sighed.Following which he looked towards the dumbstruck Li Xiao beside him.\u201cBehave yourself properly from now on; don\u2019t go offend him anymore! He isn\u2019t someone we can offend.\u201dLi Zhong warned.\u201cYes.\u201dLi Xiao bitterly laughed as he nodded.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect his true strength to be so formidable; to think I even took him for an opponent at the beginning.\u201dAs Li Yuan looked at the violet-clothed youth that was far away, his mood couldn\u2019t calm down for a long time.He originally thought that cultivating his Unfettered Steps to the Mastery Stage would be enough to defeat Duan Ling Tian.But now it would seem that this was just a joke.On the high platform.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that this Duan Ling Tian was capable of utilizing the strength of three ancient mammoths by relying upon a cultivation of the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026\u201dPatriarch Li Ao\u2019s expression was slightly serious.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s real strength was completely exceeding his expectations.\u201cAccording to common sense, he would surely have gotten some sort of fortuitous gain, obtaining some type of natural treasure which allowed him to gain his abnormal strength,\u201d an elderly person on the side guessed.\u201cI think so too.\u201dThe white-eyebrowed old man nodded in agreement.The Clan Martial Meet continued.\u201cLi Qing, Li Fei!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded out.For a moment, everyone\u2019s gazes descended upon Li Fei, who was helping Duan Ling Tian tend to his injuries.\u201cI admit defeat.\u201dLi Fei didn\u2019t even raise her head, continuing to carefully tend to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s injury.\u201cLI Qing is victorious!\u201dAlthough Li Qing won, he didn\u2019t have a trace of pleasure on his face.His gloomy gaze never left the nearby violet-clothed youth.Not far away.\u201cI hope Duan Ling Tian meets with Li Qing first.\u201dLi An\u2019s heart was restless and worried.When Duan Ling Tian made his move and drew upon the forces of heaven and earth to form three ancient mammoth silhouettes, he felt a wave of powerlessness in his heart.He knew his own limitations.Duan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t someone he could deal with.\u201cBrother An, this Duan Ling Tian really deeply concealed his strength.\u201dThe green-clothed youth beside him shuddered at the thought about when he nearly attacked Duan Ling Tian the other day.Thinking about it now, cold sweat poured out of his forehead.Hu!After Ke Er and Li Fei had tended to his wounds, Duan Ling Tian consumed a Grade Nine Gold Injury Pill, and his injuries finally started recovering.After all, he didn\u2019t injure any muscles or bones, so he quickly recovered. His injuries had healed to a degree that wouldn\u2019t affect his following battles.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, Li An!\u201dThe judge\u2019s voice sounded at this moment.Li An\u2019s face instantly turned slightly grim.What he was worried the most about really happened.\u201cBe careful.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian was about to go up to the combat arena, Li Fei lightly reminded him.\u201cLooks like getting injured like this was worth it. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let anything happen to myself. I still have lots of things I haven\u2019t done\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at Li Fei with a burning gaze. Only when she gave him a disdainful glance did he finally go up to the combat arena.Li Shi Shi held Ke Er\u2019s hand and dragged her to a corner, avoiding Li Fei before asking, in a low voice, \u201cKe Er, this Duan Ling Tian is a philanderer. Aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cBig Sister Shi Shi, as long a corner of the Young Master\u2019s heart is mine, I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled.Hearing what she said, Li Shi Shi was speechless.Where did this Duan Ling Tian get such charm to cause Ke Er to be so committed towards him?On the combat arena.Duan Ling Tian looked at Li An with a tranquil expression.Li An took a deep breath. His mind was filled with the scene of Duan Ling Tian drawing upon the forces of heaven and earth to form three ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength was comparable to someone at the second level of the Core Formation Stage!As for martial skills cultivation stage, he was not one bit inferior to him.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201dAlthough unwilling, Li An still made this decision.If they were to battle, he didn\u2019t know how Duan Ling Tian would react towards him. If he purposefully attacked ruthlessly, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.He didn\u2019t dare to take this gamble.Immediately, the surroundings sounded with loud booing.Li An\u2019s strength was publically acknowledged as number two in the entire LI Clan younger generation.But now he didn\u2019t even have the courage to battle Duan Ling Tian.\u201cToo Pu**y!\u201dNoticing the disdainful gazes from the surroundings, Li An took a deep breath and suppressed the shame and anger in his heart.His eyes that were filled with hate and ice coldness swept pass Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLi An, Li Qing!\u2019After a few more battles, the judge\u2019s voice sounded once more.This time, Li An directly admitted defeat once again.Li Qing was victorious!As time went by, night soon fell.\u201cLi Qing, Duan Ling Tian!\u201dThe most brilliant moment that everyone looked forward to had finally arrived.Two youths who possessed the strength of three ancient mammoths were going to lift this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet to its peak climax\u2026His white clothes drifting in the wind, Li Qing was already waiting on the combat arena.His condescending gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian, full of disdain and contempt.\u201cThis Li Qing is really arrogant!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression was slightly gloomy.But just when he was about to walk out and enter the combat arena\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dA condensed voice entered his ears.But he quickly noticed that the surrounding people seemed to not notice the voice.In other words, only he could hear this voice.Through Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s, Duan Ling Tian found out.Martial artists with a cultivation level above the seventh level of the Origin Core Stage were all capable of condensing their Origin Energy into sound before condensing the sound into a line.The owner of the voice was none other than the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Ao.Duan Ling Tian slightly lifted his head to look at Li Ao, who was on the high platform. He had a puzzled expression, wondering what Li Ao wanted.Li Ao was also looking at him.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, this battle, I hope you can admit defeat\u2026\u201dWhat Li Ao said caused Duan Ling Tian to frown.Admit defeat?Impossible!His target was the champion\u2019s prize, the three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi. Asking him to let go of it now was something he couldn\u2019t do.\u201cI know asking this will make it difficult on you, but I promise you, I will privately compensate the champion\u2019s prizes to you. How about it?\u201dLi Ao\u2019s voice transmitted into his ears once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The white-clothed youth that looked at him in contempt really caused him to feel extremely displeased.He could imagine how complacent the youth would be at the moment he admits defeat.On the high platform.Li Ao frowned when he noticed that Duan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t swayed by his offer. He took a deep breath as if he had made up his mind on something.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, besides compensating you for the champion\u2019s prizes, in addition, I\u2019ll give you a promise. In the future, I will agree to help you with a matter that is within my ability and conforms to reason. How about it?\u201dLi Ao gave the final concession.Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be moved.Patriarch Li Ao\u2019s promise\u2026That was something even 10,000 gold wouldn\u2019t be able to get you!He didn\u2019t expect that Patriarch Li Ao would provide such a concession just to allow Li Qing to obtain the champion\u2019s position in the Clan Martial Meet.Of course, he could guess why Li Ao was doing so.The Li Clan\u2019s yearly Martial Meet has always been an event of great importance.If the Li Clan Martial Meet champion was obtained by a disciple with another surname, if the news spread out, the Li Clan was bound to be ridiculed\u2026The Li Clan couldn\u2019t accept such a disgrace!No matter what, Li Ao was still the Li Clan\u2019s PatriarchIf Duan Ling Tian wanted to continue staying in the Li Clan, no matter what, he had to give Li Ao some face.In addition, Li Ao had already made such concessions.If he was still unwilling, it would be hardly justifiable.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201d under everyone\u2019s gazes, Duan Ling Tian said, in a calm manner, following which he returned to the side of the three girls.His goal was to obtain the three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi.Now that he\u2019s obtained the Blood Lingzhi, it could be considered as a satisfactory outcome.As for the reputation of champion, he didn\u2019t really care about it.Admit defeat?The people who were waiting for the match between Li Qing and Duan Ling Tian with extreme anticipation were struck dumb.Duan Ling Tian admitted defeat?This\u2026Since Duan Ling Tian appeared, he had the bearing of a dark horse, sweeping through all opposition in a domination manner, without any fear whatsoever.But now he actually admitted defeat.This kind of drastic change caused most of the people present to be unable to accept it.On the combat arena.Hearing Duan Ling Tian admit defeat, Li Qing was dazed for a moment.\u201cTo think I even took you as an opponent, but now it looks like you\u2019re not worthy to be my opponent.\u201dLi Qing looked at the nearby violet-clothed youth that was surrounded by the three girls. The disdain in his eyes was ever stronger, vaguely containing a trace of envy.Below the combat arena, it was a wave of noise.\u201cDuan Ling Tian actually admitted defeat, truly unexpected!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve judged him wrongly. I thought he would have the courage to battle Li Qinf.\u201d\u201cTo think he even possess the strength of three ancient mammoths; looks really can be deceiving.\u201d\u201cThere really is a difference between the Core Formation Stage and the Body Tempering Stage in the end.\u201d\u201cLI Qing deserves to be our Li Clan\u2019s top disciple in the younger generation. He has a well-deserved reputation!\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowds discussion was one-sided.Even the people who looked favorably upon Duan Ling Tian earlier had now turned around and belittled Duan Ling Tian to their hearts\u2019 content, praising Li Qing.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, why did you admit defeat?\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s beautiful eyebrows frowned, unable to understand Duan Ling Tian\u2019s decision.She even felt like the current Duan Ling Tian was that much more unfamiliar\u2026The Duan Ling Tian she knew, the Duan Ling Tian she liked, was not the type of person to run before a battle.In a blink of the eye, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s image in her heart suffered a disastrous decline.\u201cI felt like admitting defeat, so I admitted defeat,\u201d Duan Ling Tian casually said.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Shi Shi was flustered and exasperated, stomping her feet as she walked away angrily.\u201cAren\u2019t the two of you curious?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at the two young girls beside him who had not spoken up till now.\u201cSince Young Master decided to do this, then surely Young Master has own intentions.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled.\u201cYou got a considerable amount of rewards from the Patriarch, right?\u201dLi Fei glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cYou\u2026how did you know?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dumbstruck. He looked at the seductive and beautiful young girl with a slightly shocked expression.The young girl smiled mysteriously.\u201cFei Fei!\u201dUnknowingly when, Li Qing had arrived at Li Fei\u2019s side, his burning gaze descending upon Li Fei.Li Fei, however, ignored him.\u201cFei Fei, this Branch Family disciple that doesn\u2019t even have the courage to battle me isn\u2019t worthy of you.\u201dLi Qing took a deep breath, his tone filled with disdain.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes turned cold.\u201cLi Qing, whether he is worthy of me or not has nothing to do with you\u2026 But I know, that I will never choose you, so you\u2019d be better off forgetting about me and stop annoying me.\u201dLi Fei look at Li Qing in detest.\u201cLet\u2019s go over there.\u201dLi Fei called Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er over.Duan Ling Tian nodded. Before leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to smile at Li Qing in a threatening manner.His smile caused Li Qing\u2019s expression to turn gloomy, and killing intent started to pour from his eyes.Duan Ling Tian!The killing intent emitted from Li Qing\u2019s eyes was naturally noticed by Duan Ling Tian.But killing intent at that level, in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s opinion, was just like child\u2019s play.This Li Qing probably hasn\u2019t even killed a man before.His killing intent lacked blood thirst.Following the end of Li Qing and Duan Ling Tian\u2019s battle, where Duan Ling Tian admitted defeat, the Li Clan Martial Meet entered its finale.The final results were released.This year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet top ten were as follows:Champion, Li Qing, 86 points.Second, Duan Ling Tian, 84 points.Third, Li An, 82 points.Fourth, Li Fei, 80 points.Fifth, Li Zhong, 78 points.Sixth, Li Hu, 76 points.Seventh, Li Kuang, 74, points.Eight, Li Shi Shi, 72 points.Ninth, Ke Er, 70 points.Tenth, Li Yuan, 68 points.Ke Er didn\u2019t enter the arena for the battle between Li Shi Shi, directly admitting defeat.As far as she was concerned, she was best friends with Li Shi Shi, so she wasn\u2019t willing to cross blades with her\u2026After this was the the moment where the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch personally distributed the prizes.When they went home, Duan Ling Tian was still in a group of three, only Li Shi Shi wasn\u2019t within it now.Li Fei had replaced Li Shi Shi.Inner court Martial Arts Practice Field.As Li Qing stood there, his body emitted a frightful presence.He was looking from afar at the violet-clothed youth and Li Fei chatting as their shadows faded in the distance\u2026\u201cLi Qing, how about we join hands and find an opportunity to teach that Duan Ling Tian a lesson?\u201dUnknowingly when, Li An had arrived beside Li Qing and voiced his suggestion.\u201cHumph!\u201dLi Qing coldly swept Li An with his gaze, his expression filled with disdain.\u201cLi An, you\u2019re the same as him, both opponents that have suffered defeat at my hands\u2026 Do you think I would join hands with a defeated opponent to deal with another defeated opponent?\u201dLi Qing was extremely arrogant, using a condescending tone as he spoke with Li An.\u201cSince you\u2019re not interested, then forget it.\u201dLi An laughed embarrassedly before turning around and leaving.At the instant he turned around, his expression was extremely ugly, and his eyes flickered with a frightful coldness.Duan Ling Tian and the two girls had just returned home.Whoosh! Whoosh!The two little pythons flew towards Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er, coiling around their wrists.After which, they extended their small heads to size up the young girl with a seducing body and beautiful appearance. Their eyes were filled with curiosity\u2026\u201cThese are\u2026 snakes you two are raising?\u201dLi Fei was slightly startled when she saw them.\u201cSo cute.\u201dUnder Duan Ling Tian\u2019s slightly dazed gaze, Li Fei extended her hand to touch the little black python that was coiled on his wrist.The little black python closed its eyes in enjoyment.After a short moment, the little black python\u2019s body flashed as it actually coiled itself around Li Fei\u2019s wrist.\u201cPervert!\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the little black python with an envious gaze.\u201cTian, Ke Er, who is this?\u201dAt this moment, Li Rou walked out of her room, her gaze completely attracted by Li Fei.Li Fei was really too outstanding.In terms of appearance, she was not even slightly inferior to Ke Er.Moreover, because of her age being eighteen, she had fully revealed her womanly charms.\u201cMom, this is your future daughter-in-law.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly.\u201cHello Aunt Rou, I\u2019m Li Fei.\u201dGiving Duan Ling Tian an angry look, Li Fei lightly smiled as she greeted Li Rou.\u201cGood, good. You all talk, I\u2019ll go prepare dinner.\u201dLi Rou\u2019s face seemed to bleed like a flower as she entered the kitchen.\u201cMadam, I\u2019ll help you.\u201dKe Er followed behind.\u201cLittle Fei, you still haven\u2019t told me how you knew that I obtained rewards from the Patriarch and purposely admitted defeat.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes stared fixedly at Li Fei.\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glare.\u201cYou\u2019re my future wife, what\u2019s with all the why\u2019s?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly.\u201cPei! You\u2019re shameless. Who\u2019s your future wife.\u201dLi Fei ignored Duan Ling Tian altogether, extending her jade-like hand to lightly play with the little python.The little python wasn\u2019t even slightly shy with stranger, playing happily on Li Fei\u2019s hand.As a amorous weapons specialist who swept through the flower bushes, Duan Ling Tian was naturally able to notice that since he saved Li Fei on the combat arena, Li Fei\u2019s attitude towards him was completely different.If he was so coquettish to her before, she would surely get enraged.He believed that as long as he put in a bit more effort, he would surely be able to completely conquer the peerless seductive beauty before him\u2026Not long after, someone paid them a visit.Someone had sent over an extremely long box.Duan Ling Tian opened it and smiled in satisfaction at what he saw.He didn\u2019t expect Patriarch Li Ao to have such high efficiency, sending over the items so quickly.\u201cThis is\u2026three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi?\u201dLi Fei recognized the Blood Lingzhi that lay in the box. She was startled for a moment before looking at Duan Ling Tian in disbelief.\u201cDidn\u2019t you already guess it?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.\u201cYour prizes this time are even better than Li Qing\u2019s. Li Qing only got the prize for the champion, but you not only obtained the champion\u2019s prize, you also got the prize for the top three.\u201dLi Fei glanced at Duan Ling Tian in admiration.\u201cHow about it? Me being your man won\u2019t bring shame to you, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly, his burning gaze descending upon the two jade-like hills on Li Fei\u2019s chest. His lower regions became slightly hot.\u201cWhere are you looking?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows knit together as her seducing face blushed until her neck.\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s breathing became rapid, he took a deep breath before finally being able to ease up his restless mood.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cEven pearls aren\u2019t so real.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I need to lose weight?\u201d\u201cI lied.\u201d\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you interested?\u201d\u201cAsking me to be a third wheel? I won\u2019t go.\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance.\u201cThen forget it. I was even thinking of bringing you along to see a Snow Python\u2026 Hehe, a fierce beast comparable to a Nascent Soul powerhouse. That\u2019s something that is rarely seen in anyone\u2019s lifetime.\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh on purpose.\u201cWhat? Snow Python?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s clear eyes shone and her beautiful and seductive face emitted a slight excitement.She had heard of the news from before.A Snow Python had appeared in the Misty Forest. This news caused her to feel incomparably shocked, and in her heart she was filled with curiosity and yearning.Duan Ling Tian lowered his head, busy playing with the little black python on his own\u2026\u201cHey, you really have a way to meet the Snow Python?\u201d Li Fei asked in a light voice.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t raise his head as if he didn\u2019t hear her.\u201cHey!\u201dLi Fei groaned.Duan Ling Tian had a lazy expression as he slowly said, \u201cHey what?

You\u2019re not allowed to shamelessly go against your word!\u201dLi Fei\u2019s seducing and beautiful face emitted a smile that showed that her scheme had succeeded.\u201cI got cheated!\u201dOnly now did Duan Ling Tian realize, and he had a bitter smile on his face.Li Fei and Ke Er were complete polar opposites\u2026Maybe it was this that caused him to fall in love with Li Fei at first sight.That night.After dinner, Duan Ling Tian sent Li Fei home.Only now did he notice that Li Fei\u2019s house was right behind his, only divided by a small alley.Even if he walked through the main door, circling around wouldn\u2019t even be a few tens of meters distance.And if he were to directly leap over the wall, he could even save on the extra distance.After returning home, Duan Ling Tian entered his room and started to cultivate.The Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Spirit Serpent Form mental cultivation method had already been cultivated to the highest stage.What he needed to do now was to cultivate the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s second form.Raging Python Form!Now that his fleshly body had reached the peak of the Body Tempering Stage, Duan Ling Tian noticed that the Seven Treasures Body Tempering Liquid had become completely useless to him.What he needed to do now was cultivate his Raging Python Form mental cultivation method to develop Origin Energy.Once he develops his Origin Energy, he will be a Core Formation martial artist.His strength would once again increase!\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll go buy some Origin Gathering Pills. It\u2019s going to cost me an arm and leg\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a painful expression.The Origin Gathering Pill is a Grade Eight Medicinal Pill.A type of medicinal pill that assists Body Tempering martial artists in increasing their speed of developing Origin Energy. It\u2019s a medicinal pill used for stepping into the Core Formation Stage, so it\u2019s extremely expensive.A single pill costs 10,000 silver!Martials artists with good natural talent need to consume at least ten Origin Gathering Pills if they want to step into the Core Formation Stage in a short amount of time.Martial artists with bad natural talent, on the other hand, need at least tens of pills.Of course, it wasn\u2019t necessary\u2026But if not consumed, even a martial artist with good natural talent would need to spend a few years of bitter cultivation in order to break through to the Core Formation Stage.For example, the Core Formation martial artists of the Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family, including its Patriarch, Li Nan Feng, and all its elders.When all of them cultivated from the Body Tempering Stage to the Core Formation Stage all those years ago, even the individuals among them with good natural talent used three to five years of time, whereas the individuals with bad natural talent used seven to eight years of time.Not due to any other reason, but just because they didn\u2019t have the capability to use Origin Gathering Pills.During this year\u2019s Clan Martial Meet, including Li Fei, the five youth geniuses were only able to step into the Core Formation Stage at the mere age of eighteen because besides having good natural talent, they consumed Origin Gathering Pills.Medicinal pills were capable of changing a person\u2019s life.This was the reason alchemists had such a lofty position in Cloud Continent.The higher the alchemist\u2019s grade, the higher his status. They are figures that are fought over for by various powers.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that I haven\u2019t developed my Origin Energy. Once I do so, I\u2019ll be a Grade Nine Alchemist!\u201dDuan Ling Tian sighed in his heart.If an ordinary person wanted to become an alchemist, even with extremely high alchemist natural talent and with the guidance of a master, it would still require a few years of painstaking cultivation to master the rudiments.However, Duan Ling Tian possessed the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor.Rebirth Martial Emperor was a Royal Grade Alchemist.In terms of alchemy, he could be considered the second Rebirth Martial Emperor.As long as his Origin Energy fulfilled the required conditions, he would be an alchemist with extremely abundant experience.What other alchemists knew, he knew.What other alchemists didn\u2019t know, he still knew.\u201cThe pressing matter at the moment is developing Origin Energy and stepping into the Core Formation Stage so that I can become an alchemist. At that time, I can refine medicinal pills that increase the Core Formation Stage cultivation, and even let mother undergo a metamorphosis, allowing her to cultivate a top ranked cultivation method.\u201dDuan Ling Tian drew in a deep breath.His attention quickly returned to the Raging Python Form mental cultivation method.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dAfter looking through the Raging Python Method mental cultivation method for a while, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.As expected of the cultivation method created by Rebirth Martial Emperor who had undergone two lifetimes; this Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s second form, Raging Python Form, besides allowing the cultivator to develop Origin Energy like ordinary martial artists, it also allowed the cultivator to temper the fleshy body with Origin Energy, causing the fleshy body to undergo another metamorphosis!Once Duan Ling Tian cultivated to the first level of the Core Formation Stage by relying upon the Raging Python Form, besides controlling similar Origin Energy as ordinary martial artists, he could still use his origin energy to temper his fleshly body, allowing his fleshly to once again undergo a metamorphosis.The mere strength of the fleshly body would transform from the current strength of three ancient mammoths to a strength of four ancient mammoths.Adding on the Origin Energy which was comparable to the strength of an ancient mammoth.In other words, the moment he steps into the first level of the Core Formation Stage, he will possess the strength of five ancient mammoths.The strength of five ancient mammoths\u2026Compared to the fourth level of the Core Formation Stage, it was slightly weaker.Compared to the third level of the Core Formation Stage, it would be slightly stronger.Drawing in a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian started to cultivate.But without Origin Gathering Pills, his cultivation process was extremely slow.Until late into the night, there wasn\u2019t any obvious progress.\u201cI\u2019m still too impatient.\u201dShaking his head, Duan Ling Tian went off to sleep\u2026He slept until the sky was bright.Morning the next day.After eating breakfast, he brought Ke Er along and left.He arrived once again at the medicine store in the Aurora City trade market that he sold his Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid at.\u201cCustomer, you\u2019ve finally arrived.\u201dSeeing Duan Ling Tian, the manager seemed as if he had found his savior. He hurriedly came over and greeted him.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re all sold out?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s all sold out, an entire 2,000 portions, completely sold\u2026\u201dThe manager nodded, withdrawing a stack of silver bills from his pocket and handing them over to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed.\u201cCustomer, you concocted 2,000 portions of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid the other day. I sold them at a price of 200 silver a portion, but the supply wasn\u2019t enough to meet the demand. According to our agreement, you get 80% of the sales, which totals to 320,000 silver. Deducting the 200,000 silver I gave you the other day, this is the balance 120,000 silver.\u201dThe manager explained.\u201c200 silver a portion?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was startled, following which he shook his head and laughed.You really need to be shrewd to do business!\u201cCustomer, since you\u2019re here, how about you concoct the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid once more?\u201dThe manager looked at Duan Ling Tian with anticipation.\u201cI came here this time because of that. Help me prepare the medicinal materials.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cThey are already ready.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er entered the small room and saw the two large crocks and the large pile of medicinal materials, they were both stupefied.This time, he spent an entire two hours to concoct the two large crocks of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.After checking the wares, the manager was slightly worried as he said, \u201cCustomer, I don\u2019t have much liquid funds on hand, so I\u2019ll only be able to give you 200,000 silver in advance. How about it? Once these medicinal liquids are sold out, I\u2019ll give you the remaining silver.\u201dAfter all, no matter which medicine store Duan Ling Tian brought this batch of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid to, he would still be able to sell it and maybe even get a higher price.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, of course. I trust you, Manager.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, putting away another 200,000 silver bills.Sometimes, trust went two ways.\u201cManager, it can\u2019t be that you alone divided the large crock of Six Treasure Body Tempering Liquid from last time into 2,000 portions, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the manager with a strange gaze.\u201cOf course not. I couldn\u2019t trust others, so I got people from my family members to divide it.\u201dThe manager laughed.\u201cOh yeah, Manager, do you know which medicine store in the Aurora City trade market sells Origin Gathering Pills?\u201d Duan Ling Tian inquired.\u201cOrigin Gathering Pills? I\u2019m afraid you probably need to go to the branch medicine stores that are under the three great Clans of Aurora City\u2026 Customer, your Li Clan\u2019s branch medicine store, Spirit Reserves Pavilion, is just at the street in front.\u201dThe manager pointed outside.Duan Ling Tian nodded as he took Ke Er along and left the medicine store.After a short moment, he arrived at the Spirit Reserves Pavilion the manager spoke about.As expected of the Li Clan\u2019s branch medicine store, the total area of the Spirit Reserves Pavilion was extremely large, and even divided into two floors.\u201cCustomer, may I know what you need?\u201dAfter just entering the door, an attendant greeted in a respectful tone.\u201cI want some Origin Gathering Pills.\u201dDuan Ling Tian proclaimed his reason for coming.\u201cThe Origin Gathering Pills are on the second floor. Customer, please follow me.\u201dThe attendant brought Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er to the second floor.\u201cThis customer here needs some Origin Gathering Pills,\u201d the attendant told the female attendant behind the counter before returning to the first floor.\u201cCustomer, may I ask how many Origin Gathering Pills you need?\u201dThe female attendant had average looks, but her smile was extremely cheerful and bright.Duan Ling Tian patted the silver pills in his pocket before slowly saying, \u201cGive me 32 pills.\u201dHearing what he said, the female attendant was shocked.But she quickly reacted anyway.\u201cCustomer, are you sure it\u2019s 32 pills? One Origin Gathering Pill is\u2026\u201dThe female attendant was slightly hesitant.\u201cIs 10,000 silver, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently as he withdrew the stack of silver bills he got from the medicine store manager, directly throwing it on the counter.\u201cCustomer, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll go prepare them for you right away!\u201dAfter seeing so many silver bills, she knew that the youth wasn\u2019t joking. The female attendant let out a breath of cold air before replying to him and going to prepare the Origin Gathering Pills\u2026\u201cYoung Master, what medicinal pill are you buying? It\u2019s so expensive.\u201dKe Er playfully poked out her tongue with an expression of shock.Duan Ling Tian smiled as he said, \u201cThe Origin Gathering Pill, it\u2019s a medicinal pill that can help us to break through to the Core Formation Stage earlier.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her gracefully slender figure charmed all living creatures.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s lower regions were burning.This Li Fei was really an attractive beauty.\u201cEh?\u2019Suddenly, Duan Ling Tian withdrew his greedy eyes and instead gazed toward Li Fei\u2019s right hand.At this moment, on the slender fingers of Li Fei\u2019s white, jade-like hands, besides her thumb, they all had pitch black rings on them\u2026These rings were interconnected to each other, looking simple and unadorned.\u201cSpirit Weapon,\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart. His face had a shocked expression.Besides being a Royal Grade Alchemist, Rebirth Martial Emperor was also a Royal Grade Weapons Craftsmen.Duan Ling Tian inherited his memories, so he was able to recognize with a glance that the rings on Li Fei\u2019s hand was a Spirit Weapon.Grade Nine Spirit Weapon.He remembered that during the Clan Martial Meet yesterday, Li Fei didn\u2019t use this Spirit Weapon.Or else Li An would certainly not be her match.Li Fei quickly noticed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze descending upon her right hand. She couldn\u2019t help but be visibly moved as her heart jerked.Could it be that he recognized that the thing on her hand was a Spirit Weapon?After a moment, Duan Ling Tian gave her the answer.\u201cLittle Fei, during the Clan Martial Meet, why didn\u2019t you use this Grade Nine Spirit Weapon? If you had used it, Li An would not necessarily be your match.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he gave her a spurious smile.\u201cI wanted to use it, but my Grandfather took it away saying it would be unfair to the others,\u201d Li Fei said with a slight, hidden bitterness.She was slightly shocked in her heart.This Duan Ling Tian was actually able to identify the Spirit Weapon on her hand with only just a glance.After all, only a weapons craftsmen with great experience and eyesight could do so.Otherwise, even if the cultivation of the martial artist was extremely high, they would still only be able to notice and identify the Spirit Weapon when it was utilized.She suddenly felt that it was even harder to see through this youth than before.There seemed to be a cloud of mist surrounding him.For a moment, a boundless curiosity arose in her heart. She yearned to open up this cloud of mist and completely see through Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian nodded as he slowly said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Your Spirit Weapon, although it\u2019s a Grade Nine Spirit Weapon, the abilities it amplifies is nearly on par with a Grade Eight Spirit Weapon\u2026 I assume the Grade Nine Weapons Craftsmen that refined this Spirit Weapon for you has already touched the Grade Nine threshold.\u201dThe words that Duan Ling Tian spoke struck her like lightning.The fact that her grandfather was soon to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen was something she only recently found out.She was certain that besides her and her grandfather, there was absolutely no third person that knew about this in the entire Li Clan.But now the youth who had only glanced at the Spirit Weapon on her hand was able to ascertain hat her grandfather was soon to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen?\u201cYou\u2026 How did you notice?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s tone was hurried, slightly impatient to know the answer.\u201cYou want to know?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled mysteriously.Li Fei hurriedly nodded.\u201cThis is my secret. Besides my women, I won\u2019t tell anyone else\u2026\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled up into an evil smile.She said, in an angry manner, \u201cYou! If you don\u2019t want to say, then don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really care.\u201dHow could Li Fei not realize that Duan Ling Tian was flirting with her?\u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked again.\u201cDon\u2019t care!\u201dLi Fei was currently angry, so she replied in a very straightforward manner.Dian Ling Tian purposely sighed as he slowly said, \u201cOK, then forget it. I originally wanted to warn you that although the weapons craftsman that refined this Spirit Weapon for you is soon to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen\u2026 I still hope you advise him not to forcefully increase the grade of his Weapon Flame for the time being.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s seductive and beautiful face slightly turned pale.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t answer Li Fei\u2019s question but instead said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong\u2026 Recently, every day deep into the night, the weapons craftsman feels the Origin Energy inside his body having a burning feeling. It\u2019s so bad that he even has a hard time falling asleep\u201dLi Fei\u2019s face turned slightly red as she angrily said, \u201cHow did you know the current condition of my grandfather? You crossed over the wall to peek into our house?\u201dThis was something she knew about, and she even specially got some soothing medicines for her grandfather, but they were all useless.\u201cDo I seem like such a bored person?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was speechless. He was kindly trying to warn Li Fei but instead was unjustly accused. He didn\u2019t continue to say anything more.He admitted that he was amorous, but he wouldn\u2019t commit such a vulgar act.Li Fei noticed that Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t have any intention of paying attention to her anymore. This made her realize that she might have unjustly accused him\u2026Could it be that everything Duan Ling Tian said was through what he observed from the Spirit Weapon on her hand?But this was truly unbelievable.Drawing in a deep breath, Li Fei turned to Ke Er for help.\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t be angry anymore. Big Sister Li Fei didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\u201dKe Er persuaded him with a light smile.\u201cKe Er, everyone needs to be responsible for what they have done. You can help her for a time, but you can\u2019t help her for a lifetime,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said indifferently.Ke Er realized that the Young Master was really angry. She could only look at Li Fei with an expression that showed that she was powerless to assist her.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Fei\u2019s face turned red out of anger. Her clear eyes contained tears.\u201cThis again?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at her with a cold and indifferent gaze as he ignored her.\u201cYou\u2019re bullying me! Wuwu\u2026\u201dLi Fei finally exploded, her tears flowing as she cried, unable to be stopped.F**k!She\u2019s really crying.Duan Ling Tian was slightly speechless.He didn\u2019t feel wronged after being unjustly accused, but this little girl, what was she feeling wronged about\u2026Anyone who didn\u2019t know would think he really did bully her.\u201cTian, did you bully Fei?\u201dLi Rou walked out of the kitchen and looked at Duan Ling Tian with a frown.\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was helpless.\u201cEnough, I won\u2019t fuss about it with you. Stop crying.\u201dIn the end, Duan Ling Tian choose to compromise.\u201cWuwu\u2026You bullied me.\u201dBut Li Fei\u2019s tears were pouring down like the rain, completely without any intention of stopping.\u201cIf you want to continue crying, you can wait for something to happen to your grandfather.\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian saw that being gentle didn\u2019t work, he directly went with the brutal method.This method was indeed effective.As Duan Ling Tian\u2019s voice sounded and ended, so did Li Fei\u2019s crying.\u201cWhat did you say? You said something might happen to my grandfather?\u201dLi Fei voice was shaking.Her parents were met with an accident when she was still extremely young.So she and her grandfather had only each other to keep company. In her heart, her grandfather was even more important than herself.\u201cI sensed a trace of ruthless qi In the Spirit Weapon he refined\u2026If I\u2019m not wrong, your grandfather probably used an unorthodox method to forcefully increase the grade of his Weapon Flame. After a prolonged period, the root of his problems have long since been buried deep within him,\u201d Duan Ling Tian slowly said.At this moment, he seemed to be like a richly experienced weapons craftsman, speaking with reason and evidence.\u201cThen what should I do?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s pretty face turned pale and extremely anxious.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t any method. Ask him to temporarily not increase his Weapon Flame\u2019s grade, or else he won\u2019t live for more than three months\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s tone was tranquil.\u201cEnough. You go and warn your grandfather, I and Ke Er will wait for you outside the north city gate. Get your own horse.\u201dHe notified Li Fei before returning to his room.After Li Fei left, Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er brought the two little pythons along as they left their house and left the Li Clan Estate.They galloped their horses out of the north city gate and waited for Li Fei.After half an hour, Li Fei arrived.Li Fei seemed valiant and heroic in bearing as she galloped over.But her expression wasn\u2019t really well.\u201cWhat?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned.\u201cMy grandfather\u2026my grandfather said\u2026\u201dLi Fei was hesitant to speak.\u201cHe didn\u2019t believe me, and even said that I\u2019m just a kid. What would I know\u2026right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was not one bit surprised.Li Fei lightly nodded.\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dDuan Ling Tian spread out his hands to express that he had the heart to help but was powerless.\u201cMy grandfather promised me that before we return, he won\u2019t try to increase the grade of his Weapon Flame. After we return, can you go take a look at my grandfather?\u201dAs Li Fei finished speaking, she had a begging expression.Duan Ling Tian took a deep glance at Li Fei as he asked, \u201cWhat, now you believe me?\u201dLi Fei hurriedly nodded.\u201cOK, I\u2019ll promise you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Following which, he brought along the two young girls who were beautiful like flowers straight towards the Misty Forest.After arriving at the Misty Forest, Li Fei\u2019s mood was much better.But she lacked a bit of the liveliness that she used to have.After all, her grandfather\u2019s matter had already become a knot in her heart.After entering the Misty Forest, Ke Er asked, \u201cYoung Master, how should we find Little White\u2019s and Little Black\u2019s father?\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t know either. Let\u2019s go to the Black Python\u2019s nest from before. Maybe we can meet the Snow Python there,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cWhat you mean is\u2026 Little Black and Little White are the offspring of the Snow Python?\u201dLi Fei was slightly shocked.\u201cThat is our current guess.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group quickly arrived at the Black Python\u2019s nest.Presently, there were only traces of dried blood outside the Black Python\u2019s nest. The Black Python\u2019s corpse and the corpse of the few youths and young girls had all vanished, probably eaten by fierce beasts.Whoosh! Whoosh!Suddenly, the two little pythons that were coiled around Duan Ling Tian and Ke Er\u2019s wrists flashed out.They went directly into the depths of the Misty Forest.\u201cLet\u2019s follow them!\u201dDuan Ling Tian brought Ke Er and Li Fei along as he followed them.Duan Ling Tian guessed that the two little pythons might have sensed the presence of their father.\u201cThis is already the inner area. If we go any deeper, there will be plenty of fierce beasts.\u201dLi Fei warned.\u201cI know, we\u2019ll journey from atop the trees.\u201dDuan Ling Tian brought the two girls along as he climbed up a large tree to the side. Using the dense tree branches as a road, he followed the two little pythons.Although the treetops didn\u2019t lack bird-type fierce beasts, their numbers were not large as mammal-type fierce beasts.Overall, the top of the trees were much safer.\u201cRoar!\u201dSuddenly, a beast roar sounded.An enormous fierce beast blocked the path of the two little pythons. Looking fiercely at the two little things, its sharp fang flickered with devilish brilliance.\u201cNot good!\u201dNoticing the enormous fierce beast, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.\u201cIt\u2019s the Savage Tiger. Its strength is comparable to a martial artist at the fourth level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s face was slightly pale.\u201cLittle White, Little Black\u2026\u201dKe Er\u2019s face was filled with worry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whoosh!The two little pythons ignored the Savage Tiger, continuing to hurry on with their journey. After transforming into two white and black bolts of lightning, they gradually disappeared ahead.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dDuan Ling Tian suppressed his shock and hurriedly followed.Li Fei and Ke Er both had shocked expressions.In front of the Savage Tiger, the extremely small little guys were actually able to make the Savage Tiger submit itself. It was truly inconceivable.Duan Ling Tian, however, thought of a possibility\u2026If the two little pythons were really the offspring of the Snow Python, they would surely have the Snow Python\u2019s aura on their bodies.As a fierce beast that was comparable to a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse, the Snow Python was surely one of the leader-ranked existences in the Misty Forest.Intimidating all beasts was a simple matter to the Snow Python.Thus, because the two little pythons possessed the aura of the Snow Python, the Savage Tiger naturally didn\u2019t dare act rashly.It has to be said that the luck of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group was quite good.During the entire journey hurrying atop the large trees, they didn\u2019t meet any terrifying bird-type fierce beasts.Although the two little pythons bumped into a few mammal-type fierce beasts, they were all threatening but not dangerous encounters, and the Snow Python\u2019s aura frightened those fierce beasts.Everywhere they passed, all beasts submitted themselves.If he didn\u2019t see it for himself, Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t dare believe all this to be true.Eventually, under the lead of the little pythons, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group arrived at the deepest area of the Misty Forest.Bang!Suddenly, a loud sound echoed from afar, causing the ground to quake and hills to tremble.The large trees beneath Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group shook slightly, but they stabilized themselves with great difficulty.Continuing forward.The area in front of them suddenly cleared up.A shocking scene appeared before their eyes.Ahead, on a vast empty space.A gigantic python that was fully snow white and was twenty or thirty meters long was battling a grey-clothed old man.The python\u2019s body was smeared with blood stains, obviously having suffered considerable injuries.The old man was also in a sorry state, and his aura was in disorder.Whoosh!The old man\u2019s gaze turned cold as he abruptly lifted his hand.The three-foot-long blade flickered with a dazzling brilliance.Instantly, a wisp of sword qi condensed into form, accompanying the three-foot-long blade as it was waved out, piercing through the air as it flashed straight towards the gigantic python.At the same time, the force of heaven and earth shook above the old man and a thick, white mist condensed, transforming into numerous ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026At least a few hundred!Whoosh!The gigantic python\u2019s tail flashed out as if transforming into a white bolt of lightning. Its tail was covered in a layer of force that seemed similar to white mist as it collided with the sword qi.Once again a few hundred ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above the gigantic python, drawing upon the forces of wind and lightning.Bang!The sword qi dissipated and white mist fell.The man and python were equally matched.\u201cOrigin Energy discharge\u2026Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse!\u201dLi Fei face was drenched in sweat and her breath become slightly hurried.Only a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse was capable of discharging Origin Energy.\u201cNot good!\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian seemed to have noticed something. His face turned slightly grim as he flew down.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Before the two little pythons who didn\u2019t understand things rushed into the battlefield, he caught up to them and grabbed them with his hands.Hiss hiss~The two little pythons had eyes filled with anxiousness.\u201cLittle guys, I know you\u2019re worried, but if you go in, it will only cause your father to be distracted.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t know if the little pythons would understand, Duan Ling Tian still explained it to them.Hiss hiss~The two little pythons restlessly watched the nearby python and man that were battling.Meanwhile, Ke Er and Li Fei came down as well.They arrived beside Duan Ling Tian and concealed themselves behind a large tree together.\u201cSnow Python, instead of hibernating properly, you came out and killed six of my He Clan Origin Core disciples, causing my He Clan\u2019s vitality to be injured\u2026Today, I, He Zu Dao, will certainly kill you. I will then shower the souls of my He Clan disciples with your blood!\u201dThe grey-clothed old man\u2019s sword flashed like lightning as he battled the Snow Python; his voice was cold and indifferent.\u201cHe Zu Dao!\u201dLi Fei exclaimed in a low voice as her eyes flashed with a cold light.\u201cYou know of him?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked curiously.\u201cI heard my grandfather speak of him. He\u2019s the Supreme Elder of Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan, and a formidable Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse\u2026I didn\u2019t expect that he would actually move out to take revenge for his He Clan\u2019s disciples!\u201dLi Fei\u2019s tone was slightly more hurried.Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan?Only now did Duan Ling Tian think of the news that spread about a while back. The few Origin Core martial artists that were killed by the Snow Python were supposedly from Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u2026\u2026The battle continued.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group was dazed as they watched.He Zu Dao\u2019s and the Snow Python\u2019s speed was just too swift.\u201cLooks like if I want to kill you today, I must pay a price\u2026 Being able to die under this inscription can also be considered your good fortune!\u201dHe Zu Dao\u2019s cold and indifferent voice was mixed with boundless confidence.Whoosh!He directly flashed towards the Snow Python, moving towards its bloody mouth.\u201cDie!\u201dHe Zu Dao\u2019s voice was cold as ice. The three-foot-long blade in his hand abruptly glowed with a layer of blood qi as it flew out and entered the Snow Python\u2019s bloody mouth.\u201cNot good!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.He recognized the inscription on He Zu Dao\u2019s Spirit Weapon.Bang!A loud noise sounded as blood burst forth from below the Snow Python\u2019s head.A terrifying force was spreading through the Snow Python\u2019s entire body. Strands of blood shot out from every corner of the Snow Python\u2019s body, causing it to feel extreme pain and go completely berserk.This was also its last struggle before death.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u2026\u2026The berserk Snow Python swept its tail wildly, continuously smashing upon He Zu Dao\u2019s body, blasting him down to the ground.The python\u2019s tail descended over and over again, causing the Origin Energy on He Zu Dao\u2019s body to be completely destroyed.His aura was dispirited and on the verge of death.Only after the Snow Python\u2019s enormous body finally smashed onto the ground did the seriously injured He Zu Dao show a smile.He had succeeded!Exchanging the life of the Snow Python for himself being seriously injured, it was worth it.As long as he slightly gathered his breath, he could withdraw a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill and recover his injuries.Whoosh! Whoosh!The two little pythons broke away from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s control the moment the Snow Python\u2019s body smashed to the ground, flashing towards the Snow Python.Hiss hiss~They arrived in front of the Snow Python and crossed eyes with it. Their eyes gleamed with tears.After the two little pythons appeared, the Snow Python\u2019s cold and emotionless completely melted\u2026Transforming into strands of doting.Being able to see its children before it died, it didn\u2019t have any regrets.At this moment, Ke Er and Li Fei had arrived before the Snow Python. Ke Er took the little white python in her hand as she gently said to the Snow Python, \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of them.\u201dThe Snow Python\u2019s eyes emitted a trace of gratitude before they slowly dimmed down.Hiss hiss~The two little python\u2019s eyes flickered with the gleam of tears, slowly becoming wet.The seriously injured He Zu Dao who was far away heard their voices and his face turned grim.The current him was extremely weak, so even an ordinary person was capable of killing him\u2026He quickly noticed that a violet-clothed youth had arrived in front of him.His gaze descended upon the Li Clan crest on the chest of the youth.\u201cYou\u2019re a member of Aurora City\u2019s Li Clan? I\u2019m good friends with your Li Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder Li Qiu. Hurry up and feed me the medicinal pill in my hand for me to consume\u2026 I will properly reward you; whatever you want, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dHe Zu Dao\u2019s tone was slightly hurried, as if deeply afraid that the youth would attack him.Presently, he didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a hand.Duan Ling Tian lowered his head and looked.On He Zu Dao\u2019s palm, a jade green medicinal pill appeared out of thin air.His eyes abruptly shone.It wasn\u2019t because of being shocked by the medicinal pill.Although a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill was valuable, he inherited the memories of the Rebirth Martial Emperor after all, so he didn\u2019t consider a Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill to be worthy of his notice.His attention descended upon the simple ring on He Zu Dao\u2019s finger.He discerned it to be a Spatial Ring.The Spatial Ring was different from a normal ring. It was a type of marvelous ring that contained a space within, able to contain items conveniently.On Cloud Continent, only a weapons craftsmen at grade seven or above was capable of refining a Spatial Ring.Even the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch didn\u2019t own a Spatial Ring.Maybe only the Li Clan\u2019s Ancestor had one.Squatting down, Duan Ling Tian took the Grade Seven Gold Injury Pill in his hand.\u201cQuickly\u2026quickly\u2026give me\u2026consume\u2026\u201dHe Zu Dao\u2019s eyes flickered with a light of anticipation.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he asked, \u201cIf I let you consume this medicinal pill, are you willing to remove your ownership of the Spatial Ring and gift it to me?\u201dOnce a Spatial Ring was dripped with one\u2019s blood, it formed an ownership, meaning only the owner would be able to use it.Unless the owner removed the ownership of his own free will, or the owner died, others wouldn\u2019t be able to use the Spatial Ring.Instantly, He Zu Dao\u2019s pupils constricted.The most valuable item on him was undoubtedly the Spatial Ring\u2026His breathing became hurried and a killing intent flashed in his eyes.In the end, he painstakingly eased up the agitation in his heart.\u201cGift\u2026 I\u2019ll gift it.\u201dHe Zu Dao agreed.Who was Duan Ling Tian?A man who lived through battlefields. How could he not have noticed the killing intent that flashed in He Zu Dao\u2019s eyes.Duan Ling Tian sneered in his heart as he place his hand on his waist, touching the hilt of his Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword.Just when he was preparing to kill He Zu Dao and seize his Spatial Ring.\u201cDon\u2019t believe him!\u201dLi Fei walked over.\u201cHuh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed.\u201cHe Zu Dao can\u2019t be trusted. Sixty years ago, he even killed his companion who went out on adventures with him. He killed him without hesitation just for a Spirit Weapon,\u201d Li Fei said.\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you\u2026\u201dHe Zu Dao\u2019s pupils constricted.This secret was something that in the entire world, only he should know.\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t know, but one of the people you killed that year wrote down a blood letter before death and concealed it within his personal belongings\u2026 That person was the father of my grandfather\u2026 You probably won\u2019t forget him for your entire lifetime.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s eyes emitted a dense hatred.\u201cLi\u2026Li Hua?\u201dGlancing at the Li Clan crest on Li Fei\u2019s clothes, He Zu Dao\u2019s breathing became rapid.\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve guessed it.\u201dLi Fei sneered.\u201cSo it turns out that you killed my future wife\u2019s great grandfather? You can only blame yourself for being unfortunate\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face had a fiendish smile.This was a timely opportunity for him to make use of.Whoosh!His Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword soundlessly entered He Zu Dao\u2019s chest, piercing through his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face couldn\u2019t help but curl into a smile.Possessing Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s lifetime worth of memories allowed Duan Ling Tian to use the Spatial Ring like how he directed his arm\u2026\u201cF**k, so small!\u201dWhen his thoughts entered into the Spatial Ring, he saw that there was a mere one cubic meter of space. He was dazed for a moment before he couldn\u2019t stop himself from shouting in vulgarities.\u201cYou\u2019re the He Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder, but you\u2019re actually using the lowest grade Spatial Ring.\u201dAs he said this, Duan Ling Tian glanced in contempt at He Zu Dao\u2019s body.It was imaginable that if He Zu Dao wasn\u2019t dead, he would certainly be angered to the point of spitting blood\u2026\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll just improvise.\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t wear the Spatial Ring on his hand but instead kept it in his pocket.The Spatial Ring wasn\u2019t something that could be exposed in public.Only once he steps into the Core Formation Stage and becomes a weapons craftsman, he can alter the Spatial Ring\u2019s outer appearance; only then could he publically use the Spatial Ring.\u201cHow is this the He Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder? He\u2019s virtually a pauper! Besides a few Grade Seven Gold Injury Pills and a few cultivation methods ond martial skills, there is actually only a bit over 100 silver of spare change\u2026\u201dAfter examining the items inside the Spatial Ring, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but mock him.Duan Ling Tian, however, didn\u2019t know that as the He Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder, He Zu Dao had an extraordinary status.If he wanted money, the He Clan would spare no effort to fulfill his request, so he didn\u2019t have a need of keeping silver on his body.His face represented an enormous wealth.Following this was destroying the corpse and obliterating all tracks.Duan Ling Tian lit a fire and directly burned He Zu Dao\u2019s corpse.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Snow Python\u2019s nest?\u201dAfter looking for a long while, Duan Ling Tian was unable to locate the Snow Python\u2019s nest. His treasure hunt completely came to nothing.\u201cDamned He Zu Dao, not to mention you yourself are poor, you even destroyed the Snow Python\u2019s body to such an extent\u2026 The Blood Explosion Inscription, you were actually willing to use it!\u201dLooking at the Snow Python\u2019s badly destroyed body, Duan Ling Tian had a pained expression.As the king of the fierce beasts, the Snow Python\u2019s entire body was filled with treasures, but it was completely destroyed by He Zu Dao.\u201cEh?\u201dJust at this moment, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone.On the Snow Python\u2019s body, a white ball that flickered with a faint brilliance floated up.\u201cBeast Core?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s breathing became rapid. He didn\u2019t expect that the Snow Python\u2019s Beast Core was actually completely unharmed.Just when he walked out and wanted to fetch the Beast Core.The smile on his face froze completely.Whoosh! Whoosh!The two little pythons flashed out, quickly dividing and consuming the Snow Python\u2019s Beast Core.\u201cNever mind. Even if I took the Beast Core, I would have no use it for it in the near future. I might as well let them take it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian quickly got over it.A human was unable to directly consume a fierce beast\u2019s Beast Core.If consumed, the lighter consequence would be qi deviation, whereas the heavier consequence would by death by explosion.Humans could only use fierce beast Beast Cores as medicinal catalysts; only after being combined with other valuable medicinal materials to refine into a medicinal pill can they be consumed.A Beast Core of a formidable fierce beast like the Snow Python that was comparable to a Nascent Soul martial artist would at least require a Grade Seven Alchemist to refine\u2026Grade Seven Alchemist.To Duan Ling Tian, it was quite a distance away.After burning the Snow Python\u2019s corpse as well, Duan Ling Tian brought Ke Er and Li Fei along as he left the Misty Forest.On the way back.\u201cThat Spatial Ring\u2026\u201dLi Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian with a spurious smile.Duan Ling Tian glared as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about the Spatial Ring, it\u2019s mine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. Even if I had any ideas about it, it would be of no use. I\u2019m just curious\u2026 If someone knew you had that Spatial Ring, what would happen?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s charm-filled eyes flickered with a faint smiling expression.\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as the corners of his mouth curled into grin.A bad omen arose in Li Fei\u2019s heart.As expected.\u201cHeh, looks like someone doesn\u2019t want me to help her grandfather get well\u2026 Never mind, I\u2019ll save my energy.\u201dDuan Ling Tian mischievously smiled.Li Fei\u2019s face turned pale as she angrily said, \u201cYou, you\u2026 you rascal! You plainly promised me.\u201d\u201cDid I promise? Why, don\u2019t I know\u2026 Ke Er, did I promise her?\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at Ke Er with a slight smile.At this moment, Ke Er was taking care of the two little pythons that had gone into a deep slumber after consuming the Snow Python\u2019s Beast Core.Her beautiful, clear eyes emitted a motherly brilliance.\u201cYoung Master, I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201dKe Er naturally stood on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side.\u201cYou two\u2026You two are bullying me.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s eyes turned red as if they were about to tear up again.\u201cEnough, as long as you keep today\u2019s matter a secret, I will surely return a healthy grandfather to you. Not only that, I can even allow him to smoothly become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen without leaving behind any aftereffects.\u201dDuan Ling Tian compromised.\u201cRascal!\u201dLi Fei smiled through her tears.\u201cRight, since your grandfather knows that He Zu Dao killed his father years ago, why didn\u2019t he make the blood letter public? That would allow everyone to clearly see He Zu Dao\u2019s true face.\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked about the uncertainty in his heart.\u201cDid you think my grandfather didn\u2019t want to? But when my grandfather found the blood letter, He Zu Dao had already become Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan\u2019s Grand Elder and had extraordinary status. Even if my grandfather made it public, it would be impossible for the Li Clan to offend the He Clan\u2019s Grand Elder over a disciple who had died years ago.\u201d\u201cMoreover, my grandfather was also worried that once the blood letter was made public, it would cause He Zu Dao to get angry from embarrassment and even take revenge \u2026 At that time, my grandmother just happened to be pregnant with my father, so my grandfather chose to bear it patiently, and this matter slowly became a knot in his heart.\u201dLi Fei heaved a sigh.\u201cNow the knot in your grandfather\u2019s heart can be unlocked because this future son-in-law of his has taken revenge for him!\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly.\u201cWho would want to marry you?\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance as her enchantingly beautiful face blushed.Deeply afraid that Duan Ling Tian would notice, she hurriedly turned around.Under the setting sun, the outline of Aurora City eventually appeared before them.Duan Ling Tian and the two young girls returned directly to the Li Clan Estate.After asking Ke Er to take the two little pythons home first, he followed Li Fei and arrived at Li Fei\u2019s home.\u201cFei, you\u2019re back?\u201dIn the vast courtyard stood an old man that was over seventy years of age.The old man had a thin figure; it was as if he would be blown down by the wind.\u201cGrandfather, I have good news to tell you.\u201dLi Fei walked into the courtyard and grabbed the old man\u2019s hand. Her face emitted a light smile.The old man had a doting expression as he smiled and asked, \u201cWhat good news?\u201dLi Fei put her mouth close to the old man\u2019s ears and lightly said, \u201cGrandfather, He Zu Dao is dead.\u201dInstantly, the old man\u2019s body shook as if struck by lightning, and his breathing became hurried\u2026The old man took in a deep breath and slowly said, \u201cFei, you can\u2019t joke about things like this.\u201dEven though he knew that this granddaughter of his had never lied to him before, what his granddaughter said right now was really too inconceivable.\u201cGrandfather, He Zu Dao was killed by him. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask him.\u201dNoticing the old man didn\u2019t believe her, Li Fei instantly became anxious and hurriedly looked at Duan Ling Tian with an expression that said that she was begging for help.\u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian?\u201dThe old man\u2019s cloudy gaze instantly flickered with a sharp light and descended upon Duan Ling Tian as if trying to see through him.But unfortunately, he was bound to be disappointed.Duan Ling Tian stood there, unmoved, like an immovable mountain.\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re worthy of your reputation. I now believe that you have the strength to defeat Li Qing.\u201dThe old man nodded.\u201cGrandfather.\u201dDuan Ling Tian greeted the old man.Instantly, the old man was dumbstruck.Li Fei\u2019s face instantly blushed as she fiercely glared at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dNoticing his granddaughter\u2019s expression, the old man seemed to have understood something and laughed out loud.\u201cGrandfather, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Li Fei explained in panic.\u201cFei, you don\u2019t have to be shy. Men should get married and women should be married\u2026 Moreover, I think this kid isn\u2019t bad; he has the qualifications to be my grandson-in-law. Although sometimes he likes to talk big, these are just small problems and are not a big deal.\u201dAs the old man finished speaking, he seemed to contain a hidden meaning pointing to something.\u201cGrandfather, whether I\u2019m talking big or not, you\u2019ll know soon. I\u2019ll first testify on behalf of Li Fei that your personal enemy who killed your father, He Zu Dao, is indeed dead. He was killed my sword strike\u2026This Spatial Ring is the best evidence.\u201dDuan Ling Tian withdrew the Spatial Ring from his pocket as he spoke, then he handed it over to the old man.The old man\u2019s hands trembled as he received it and sized it up.The old man was agitated.\u201cRight\u2026 Right, this is indeed He Zu Dao\u2019s Spatial Ring! What exactly happened?\u201d he asked after returning the Spatial Ring to Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian quickly told the entire story to the old man.\u201cSnow Python? Haha\u2026The heavens aren\u2019t blind, the heavens aren\u2019t blind\u2026\u201dThe old man laughed loudly and joyfully.The knot in his heart for many years had finally been unlocked.For a moment, his face glowed as if becoming a few years younger.The old man gathered his breath before sincerely saying to Duan Ling Tian, \u201cLing Tian kid, thank you.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re family, so you don\u2019t have to be so courteous, Grandfather\u2026 If I\u2019m not wrong, besides having a burning sensation in your Origin Energy lately and having a hard time sleeping, when you refine weapons, you frequently feel restless and even feel like you have the heart but not the strength to complete the refinement, right?\u201d Duan Ling Tian said, with a serious face.The old man took a deep breath before asking in disbelief, \u201cLing Tian kid, you can really notice my hidden injuries from forcefully increasing my Weapon Flame\u2019s grade just by looking at the Spirit Weapon I refined?\u201d\u201cOf course. Not only can I notice the hidden injuries, I can even help grandfather heal them, but you have to wait until I step into the Core Formation Stage,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cWhy?\u201dThe old man was puzzled.\u201cBecause only when I step into the Core Formation Stage will I be able to condense a Pill Flame from my Origin Energy and refine a medicinal pill which can help grandfather\u2019s hidden injuries heal,\u201d Duan Ling Tian slowly said.\u201cLing Tian, kid, even if you have an alchemist\u2019s natural talent, becoming an alchemist isn\u2019t so simple\u2026\u201dThe old man laughed bitterly as he that felt Duan Ling Tian was reaching beyond his grasp.\u201cGrandfather, no matter what I say now, you wouldn\u2019t believe me. In two months at most, you will know whether what I said is true or false.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s body emitted strong self-confidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe\u2026\u201dThe smile on the old man\u2019s face disappeared as he lightly muttered to himself, seeming to be pondering about something.In a quiet room.Duan Ling Tian sat cross-legged on his bed and consumed an Origin Gathering Pill.Then he began cultivating.Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Raging Python Form!The medicinal strength of the Origin Gathering Pill transformed into a warm current, flowing into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body.Duan Ling Tian guided the warm current with the Raging Python Form mental cultivation method, circulating it around his body as he tried his best to develop Origin Energy.Even with Origin Gathering Pills, the development of Origin Energy wasn\u2019t something that could be completed in a short period of time.Until late at night, Duan Ling Tian still had no obvious progress\u2026Duan Ling Tian understood that the increase of his cultivation wasn\u2019t something that could be accomplished in a single night.As such, he stopped cultivating after a while and went to sleep.He slept until the sky was bright.The following few days peacefully went by.Life went on with a planned rhythm\u2026Every morning, Duan Ling Tian would cultivate his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique in the courtyard.In the afternoon, relying upon the medicinal liquid concocted from the three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi, he increase the cultivation of his defensive martial skill, Greater Teleportation.At night, he consumed the Origin Gathering Pill and cultivated the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique to develop Origin Energy.His movement technique, the Spirit Serpents Movement Technique, had already broken through the threshold and stepped into the Mastery Stage earlier when he saved Li Fei.Presently, when executed it, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed was swift to a shocking degree, but it was still a distance away from stepping into the Perfection Stage.His defensive martial skill, Greater Teleportation, had the assistance of the medicinal liquid concocted from the three-hundred-fifty-year-old Blood Lingzhi, so it advanced at a tremendous pace.Duan Ling Tian was confident in cultivating his Greater Teleportation to step into the Mastery Stage within two months.As for his cultivation, as time went by, due to the abundant cultivation experience of Rebirth Martial Emperor, Duan Ling Tian had already sensed the feeling of Origin Energy inside him.He believed that it wouldn\u2019t take him long before being able to successfully develop his Origin Energy.The flight of time was like a fleeting, white pony\u2019s shadow flashing past a crevice.A month later.Dawn.\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ve broken through.\u201dThe young girl in light green clothes walked out from her room and lightly smiled to the youth in the courtyard.The youth was cultivating his movement technique.After hearing what she said, he stopped and stood there.The Origin Energy flickering on the young girl\u2019s hands cause the youth to be stunned.The young girl\u2019s natural talent had once again shocked him.\u201cKe Er, from today onwards, you can officially start cultivating the sword skills of the Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique.Ke Er\u2019s breakthrough was slightly out of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expectations.Duan Ling Tian was happy for her.According to what Ke Er said, she only consumed seven Origin Gathering Pills before successfully completing her breakthrough.According to the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, In terms of natural talent, Ke Er\u2019s present speed in breaking through to the Core Formation Stage would be ranked in the top even in the entire Cloud Continent.Up till now, Duan Ling Tian had already consumed nine Origin Gathering Pills, and was only halfway to the Core Formation Stage.It would still be some time before he would be able to complete the final breakthrough!Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s natural talent was inferior to Ke Er\u2019s.After all, they both cultivated different cultivation methods.Even though Ke Er broke through to the first level of the Core Formation Stage, in terms of strength, she wasn\u2019t any different from an ordinary first level Core Formation martial artist.So she was far from being comparable to the current Duan Ling Tian.Afternoon.The two beauties at home went out to buy groceries, leaving Duan Ling Tian alone.He was greeted an unexpected guest.The guest proclaimed himself to be from the Xiao Clan, and he came to send an invitation card.The invitation card had an air of dominance. On the front page, a five-clawed godly dragon was weaved with silver threads. It had a lifelike appearance.Duan Ling Tian had only just opened the invitation card and had not even read it when\u2026\u201cLooks like you received the Hidden Dragon Invitation.\u201dA young girl wearing light violet clothes with a devilish body and an angel\u2019s face slowly walked into the courtyard.\u201cLittle Fei, what\u2019s a Hidden Dragon Invitation?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young girl with a puzzled expression.\u201cEvery year, Aurora City holds a gathering for the young geniuses of Aurora City\u2019s clans. Only our Aurora City\u2019s three great clans\u2019 youths who seized the top five positions in their respective clans\u2019 Martial Meet are qualified attend the gathering. Young geniuses from the other clans will also be attending, but those families only have one allocated place.\u201cThis gathering is hosted by the three great clans of Aurora City on a rotation basis, and this year is the Xiao Clan\u2019s turn to host,\u201d Li Fei explained.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this gathering?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.\u201cTo re-rank the Hidden Dragon List.\u201dLi Fei lightly smiled as her clear eyes flashed with a trace of burning desire.\u201cHidden Dragon List?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied.In his memories, since arriving at the Li Clan a few months ago, he seemed to have heard someone mention this Hidden Dragon List before.But he didn\u2019t try to understand it in detail.He didn\u2019t know what this Hidden Dragon List was.\u201cThe Hidden Dragon List is a ranking list aimed at ranking the younger generation geniuses of Aurora City in terms of strength. The ranking is considered to have an extremely high worth. The individuals who are listed are all the most outstanding young geniuses of Aurora City\u2026 For example, our Li Clan\u2019s Li Feng, who was the champion of last year\u2019s Clan Martial meet, was the third youth genius in last year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List.\u201cThe Xiao Clan sending out the invitation cards means that the Hidden Dragon List will be re-ranking the placements\u2026 In the gathering, the young geniuses of Aurora City will gather to interact and spar. In the end, based on personal strength, the new Hidden Dragon List will be made,\u201d Li Fei explained.Duan Ling Tian nodded as he finally understood.He opened the Hidden Dragon Invitation and read it.The gathering date was three days from now.The venue was in the Xiao Clan\u2019s Estate, on the Star Observation Platform.\u201cBoring.\u201dDuan Ling Tian casually threw the Hidden Dragon Invitation aside as he yawned.\u201cYou\u2026what are you doing?\u201dLi Fei was dumbstruck.After all, most people were fighting with all they had just to obtain an invitation, but they weren\u2019t qualified.But this guy just threw the Hidden Dragon Invitation aside like throwing trash.Suddenly, as if he had thought of something, Duan Ling Tian asked Li Fei, \u201cRight, you said earlier that there were only five Hidden Dragon Invitations in the Li Clan?\u201d\u201cYeah, not anyone can receive a Hidden Dragon Invitation.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s tone sounded slightly complacent and she had an expression that said \u201cyou\u2019re ignorant.\u201d\u201cSo it could be said that each Hidden Dragon Invitation has an extraordinary value?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eye shone.\u201cOf course, almost every youth of the younger generation in Aurora City wants to participate in the yearly young genius gathering, but because the Hidden Dragon Invitation\u2019s threshold is too high, they can only be denied entrance at the door. After all, as long as a young genius is able to participate in the gathering, even if they are unable to be ranked on the Hidden Dragon List in the end, they will still be able to experience the demeanor of the other young geniuses, maybe even gaining benefits from it and allowing their own cultivation to break through.\u201dLi Fei had an \u2018it goes without saying\u2019 expression.She quickly noticed Duan Ling Tian picking up the Hidden Dragon Invitation.She naturally thought that after hearing what she said, Duan Ling Tian started to take the Hidden Dragon List ranking gathering seriously.But who knew that he instead muttered to himself.\u201cAfter hearing what you said, this Hidden Dragon Invitation should be worth a lot of money, right? Looks like I can think about holding a private mini auction to sell off this Hidden Dragon Invitation. Who knows, I might be able to get some money out of it\u2026 Yes, I\u2019ll do it like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026You\u2026Could it be that you have no intention whatsoever to be ranked on the Hidden Dragon List?\u201dAfter hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, Li Fei was so angry that her breathing became rapid.In her opinion, including her, as long as it was a young genius of Aurora City, who wouldn\u2019t want to be ranked on the Hidden Dragon List?Being ranked on the Hidden Dragon List was an extremely great honor.Someone on that list could even possibly leave their name behind in Aurora City, allowing the future generations to look at it with reverence.This Duan Ling Tian, however, seemed to think that it was beneath contempt.\u201cIt\u2019s only some fame and reputation, so I\u2019m not interested.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head, not caring one bit.In his previous life, as the strongest weapons specialist on Earth, he carried tons of honor and glory and was too high to be touched.Towards this sort of reputation, he had long since been indifferent to it.After hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, Li Fei had a complicated gaze.What kind of man was this? His age wasn\u2019t old, but he seemed to contain boundless life experiences.Duan Ling Tian seemed to have thought of something as he hurriedly asked, \u201cRight, I nearly forgot. Little Fei, the Hidden Dragon list ranking, does it have any prizes? For example, the first ranked can obtained some valuable medicinal material or precious items\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLi Fei\u2019s serious expression was instantly destroyed by Duan Ling Tian. She was at a loss on whether to laugh or cry.\u201cOf course there are prizes. People ranked inside the top ten of the Hidden Dragon List will be able to obtain corresponding prizes\u2026These prizes are provided by Aurora City\u2019s three great clans, and they\u2019re even better than the prizes from the earlier Clan Martial Meet.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at Li Fei with a slightly blaming gaze as he put away the Hidden Dragon invitation as if it was a precious treasure.\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance.\u201cLooks like you don\u2019t understand this future husband of yours enough. Yes, we should exchange our feelings more\u2026 Come, come in my room to exchange.\u201dDuan Ling Tian greedily sized up Li Fei\u2019s hot body as he grinned.\u201cRascal! Thick-skinned.\u201dLi Fei was so ashamed that she turned around and fled.\u201cIn three days, I\u2019ll come find you. We\u2019ll go to the Xiao Clan Estate together,\u201d she said as she left.\u201cThis little girl is getting more and more attractive\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian took a deep breath. The burning sensation that came from his lower regions slightly eased up.He wished he could catch up to her and \u201cpunish\u201d her on the spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A group of little kids.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows knit, ignoring the gazes that could kill from the surroundings. He extended his hand and dominatingly grabbed onto Li Fei\u2019s soft, jade-like hand as if he was putting on a show of force to the surrounding youths.Open your eyes wide and look properly\u2026This is my woman!Li Fei was suddenly surprised by Duan Ling Tian\u2019s actions. Her devilish body unnoticeably trembled, and her angel-like face blushed.Li Fei used a voice that was almost like a mosquito as she said, \u201cLet go of me\u2026\u201d\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want these little kids staring at my future wife.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was extremely persistent.\u201cRascal!\u201dAfter struggling for a while and being unable to struggle free from Duan Ling Tian, Li Fei stared at him slightly angrily.\u201cEven then, you would be the only one who could call me \u2018rascal;\u2019 other women are not worthy.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was very straightforward.\u201cReally?\u201dLi Fei slightly doubted him.\u201cEven pearls aren\u2019t so real.\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a wide grin.Li Fei\u2019s clear eyes narrowed as she derided, \u201cHow about Ke Er?\u201d\u201cKe Er is different, she\u2019s an exception,\u201d Duan Ling Tian grunted. His tone was filled with a dominating bearing.\u201cNinth level of the Body Tempering Stage?\u201dGazes of jealousy and envy descended upon Duan Ling Tian one by one. All the youths present quickly saw through Duan Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation.Every single one of them was at the Core Formation Stage.A Body Tempering martial artist suddenly appearing in their midst attracted the attention of everyone.Most importantly, this Body Tempering martial artist was actually asking for a beating by holding the hand of one of the three great beauties of Aurora City, the Li Clan\u2019s Li Fei.Some of the youths instantly had unwilling expressions.As far as they were concerned, a ninth level Body Tempering guy had no ability to possess Li Fei.\u201cHmph! The Aurora City youth gathering is really getting worse year by year\u2026 Even a pretty boy who doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to obtain a Hidden Dragon Invitation can actually rely on a woman to sneak in.\u201dA slightly robust youth sneered at Duan Ling Tian.His voice wasn\u2019t soft, destroying the short silence in the Star Observation Platform.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he asked the young girl beside him, \u201cPretty boy? Little Fei, am I really that handsome?\u201d\u201cPei! They are insulting you\u2026\u201dEven Li Fei felt ashamed for Duan Ling Tian\u2019s thick face.\u201cKid, you\u2019re jealous, right? You should know that it isn\u2019t easy to be a pretty boy. With your idiotic look and that black face of yours\u2026 you probably won\u2019t even be able to find a wife in the future .\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at the robust youth as he lightly smiled.Immediately, the other youths looked at the robust youth with strange expressions that had a trace of pity.He just had finished calling a pretty boy as an insult, but a second later that person retaliated and said that he couldn\u2019t even compare to a pretty boy.\u201cKid, I want to challenge you!\u201dThe robust youth exploded in rage, then he started walking towards Duan Ling Tian in large strides and in full fury.\u201cHumph!\u201dJust at this moment, a cold grunt sounded from afar.Three youths quickly walked over.The one that grunted was precisely the cold youth in the lead.The youth was around the age of eighteen with a cold and reserved bearing, and his sharp eyes were filled with arrogance and unyieldingness.\u201cYoung Master Yu.\u201dThe robust youth\u2019s expression distorted; it was as if he was a mouse that saw a cat. He was so intimidated that he retreated back.\u201cYoung Master Yu.\u201dAt this moment, the other youths hurriedly greeted the cold youth.Their tones were filled with respect.The cold youth ignored them as he walked by himself towards Li Fei and Duan Ling Tian.Just when everyone thought that he was about to greet Li Fei, an unbelievable scene unfolded.\u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian? I\u2019m very interested in you.\u201dThe cold youth\u2019s gaze descended onto Li Fei, and his sharp eyes flickered full of determination.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not interested in you\u2026 My orientation is very normal.\u201d As Duan Ling Tian said this, he raised up the hand that held Li Fei\u2019s jade-like, small hands and grinned.Li Fei blushed. She wanted to struggle, but she noticed that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand was like an iron pincer\u2026\u201cMy orientation is very normal as well\u2026 Li Fei, one of the three great beauties of Aurora City, you have a well-deserved reputation.The corners of the cold youth\u2019s mouth slightly trembled. His gaze moved from Duan Ling Tian to Li Fei as he nodded, he then proceed to walk towards the innermost pergola in the Star Observation Platform.That was the host\u2019s place of rest.On the Star Observation Platform, all the youths present gazed at Duan Ling Tian with disbelief.This Body Tempering kid could actually cause the cold youth to take him seriously? This was beyond their expectations.\u201cWho is this kid?\u201d\u201cNinth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026 Could it be that he is the Branch Family disciple Duan Ling Tian who seized second place in the Li Clan\u2019s Martial Meet one month ago?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be. According to what I know, there should be five Core Formation disciples in the entire Li Clan younger generation.\u201d\u201cYeah, how could they allow a ninth level Body Tempering disciple seize second place when they have five Core Formation disciples attending? This is impossible and I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cI heard of this news as well, and I don\u2019t believe it! Something surely went on behind the scenes.\u201d\u201cI think so too. Young Master Yu was probably cheated as well, or else he wouldn\u2019t pay special regard to this kid.\u201d\u2026\u2026These youths looked at Duan Ling Tian with even more disdainful gazes.\u201cWho is he? He seems so arrogant,\u201d Duan Ling Tian curiously asked Li Fei.\u201cXiao Yu, the young genius who was second on last year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List\u2026 At the time, he was seventeen. A year has passed since then, so his strength has long since advanced by leaps and bounds. Rumors say he\u2019s on the verge of breaking through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s clear eyes had a sense of reverence.\u201cI take it that he was stronger than our Li Clan\u2019s Li Feng last year?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cYes, he defeated Li Feng with only nine moves during last year\u2019s gathering\u2026 Finally, because of a small mistake, he lost to the Lin Clan\u2019s Lin Hong, who went on to become the top ranked young genius on the Hidden Dragon List. At that time, Lin Hong admitted that if he were the same age as Xiao Yu, he would definitely be inferior to him.\u201d\u201cXiao Yu is the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Dao genius that is hard to come by in a hundred years. If nothing unexpected happens, this year\u2019s top rank in the Hidden Dragon List will certainly be his!\u201d Li Fei slowly said.\u201cSo it would seem that he\u2019s much stronger than Li Qing.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.Li Fei shook her head as she said, \u201cLi Qing? They aren\u2019t even on the same level. Li Qing participated in last year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List ranking battles as well, but he wasn\u2019t even qualified to be ranked on the list.\u201d\u201cI have to admit, hearing you speak so highly of Xiao Yu, even I am getting slightly jealous.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he put on an act that he was slightly unhappy.\u201cI\u2019m just speaking of the truth. If you don\u2019t want to hear it, then defeat him\u2026 At that time, I\u2019ll naturally stop praising him.\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance.\u201cIf I defeat him, are there any rewards?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.\u201cWhat naughty ideas are you thinking off?\u201d Li Fei said vigilantly.\u201cWhat naughty ideas could I think off\u2026 Looks like you think I can defeat him, or else you wouldn\u2019t be so vigilant against me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.Noticing Duan Ling Tian using the opportunity to continuously flirt with her, Li Fei was slightly speechless.\u201cLi Qing has arrived!\u201d\u201cLi Qing was the champion in the Li Clan Martial Meet one month ago. He is the fully-deserving champion of the LI Clan\u2019s younger generation! Allegedly, his cultivation has already stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201d\u201cSecond level of the Core Formation Stage? Isn\u2019t that similar to Young Master Yu?\u201d\u201cEven if they are both at the second level of the Core Formation Stage, there is still a difference\u2026Young Master Yu has cultivated three high grade Profound Rank martial skills; his offensive martial skill has been cultivated to the Perfection Stage, and his defensive martial skill and movement technique were both cultivated to the Mastery Stage.\u201d\u201cYeah, Li Qing has only recently stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage; however, Young Master Yu broke through half a year ago.\u201d\u201cOne year ago, Young Master Yu was ranked second on the Hidden Dragon List whilst Li Qing didn\u2019t even have the qualification to be ranked\u2026 The difference between the two are like heaven and earth!\u201d\u2026\u2026The white-clothed youth that came alone naturally heard the discussions of the people on the Star Observation platform.His expression slowly turned gloomy.\u201cXiao Yu!\u201dHis gaze descended upon the innermost pergola onto the cold youth\u2019s shadow that was within.But unfortunately, ever since he appeared, Xiao Yu had not once glanced his way.LI Qing\u2019s gaze turned slightly cold.He had set a target for himself before coming to this year\u2019s gathering.Defeat Xiao Yu and be ranked at the top of the Hidden Dragon List!\u201cXiao Yu, I\u2019ll let you be complacent for now, but I will surely defeat you\u2026for sure!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s eyes were filled with a brutal light.\u201cHmm?\u201dSuddenly, as if noticing something, Li Qing\u2019s gaze descended upon the youth and young girl that were in front of him.A youth in violet clothes and a young girl in light violet clothes were standing together; they looked like a pair, a heavenly couple.Especially since their hands were held together\u2026\u201cFei Fei!\u201dA burning rage arose in Li Qing\u2019s heart. He couldn\u2019t bear with it anymore and directly walked over.\u201cTake your hands away, or else I\u2019ll cripple you!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s cold gaze which was filled with killing intent descended onto the youth in violet clothes, seeming ready to swallow him up.\u201cI\u2019m curious though, how do you plan on crippling me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently as if he didn\u2019t take notice of Li Qing\u2019s threat.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s right hand was suffused with Origin Energy and his eyes emitted a dense coldness as he prepared to attack Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLi Qing! I\u2019ve already told you, I\u2019ll never ever be with you, so stop wasting time on me.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s expression turned grim as she snapped.\u201cFei Fei, once I cripple this trash, then you\u2019ll know who is worthy of being your man.\u201dLi Qing took a deep breath. He felt it difficult to suppress the rage in his heart.As he took a step forward, his imposing manner seemed to pierce through the sky!\u201cLi Qing!\u201dJust at this moment, an extremely cold voice sounded, causing Li Qing\u2019s body to stop in place.\u201cLI Qing, if you dare to attack before the gathering begins, I\u2019ll ask you to leave, and this year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List will have no relation to you anymore.\u201dUnknowingly when, Xiao Yu walked over in large strides, his voice icy cold and bone-piercing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said something to the youth beside him before the two of them walked over quickly.This scene also fell into the eyes of the youth genius present in the Star Observation Platform.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dLin Qi greeted Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly nodded.\u201cThis is my elder brother, Lin Zhou\u2026 Elder brother, he is Duan Ling Tian.\u201dLin Qi introduced Lin Zhuo to Duan Ling Tian and vice versa.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I have long since heard my little brother mention you. Relying merely on your eighth level Body Tempering cultivation to defeat him who was at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage at the time was truly shocking!\u201dLin Zhuo lightly smiled to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI too have long since heard of your name, the Lin Clan\u2019s number one of the younger generation. Nice to meet you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian replied with a smile.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I heard that during the Li Clan Martial Meet, you could exert the strength of three ancient mammoths even though your cultivation is only at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026Is this true?\u201dLin Qi\u2019s eyes flickered as he gazed fixedly into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes.It was as if he was trying to see something thru Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes.But he was bound to be disappointed.Duan Ling Tian only smiled mysteriously. From start to finish, his eyes were tranquil, without any changes.\u201cLittle Qi, whether it is true or not, you will find out once the gathering begins. You\u2019re still worried you won\u2019t be able to see it?\u201dCompared to Lin Qi, Lin Zhuo was much calmer.The two brothers took their leave a short while after and walked to another empty pergola.\u201cThis Duan Ling Tian seems to really be not so simple. Could it be that the rumors were true?\u201d\u201cEven Lin Zhuo took the initiative to greet him, so his reputation is great.\u201d\u201cYeah, Lin Zhuo didn\u2019t even pay attention to the Li Clan\u2019s champion of the younger generation; he directly went to greet Duan Ling Tian.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t Lin Zhuo\u2019s little brother, Lin Qi, defeated by Duan Ling Tian? Why wasn\u2019t there any hostility between them when they met?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even understand this? The proverb is correct: a friendship grows from the exchange of blows. Maybe they are already friends.\u201d\u201cYou have a point.\u201d\u2026\u2026The young geniuses from Aurora City\u2019s clans started whispering in discussion.\u201cHumph!\u201dWhen Li Qing heard all this, his face became even gloomier.\u201cLi Qing, this is you best opportunity to cripple that Duan Ling Tian.\u201dUnknowingly when, Li An arrived beside Li Qing and instigated.\u201cIt isn\u2019t your place to make remarks on how I do things, f**k off!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s gaze turned cold and his voice was icy.Li An\u2019s face froze.He took in a deep breath before turning around and leaving.Li An\u2019s face was extremely ugly. As one of the outstanding Li Clan younger generation disciples, he had his pride.Ever since he started cultivating, among the Li Clan\u2019s younger generation, Li Qing suppressed him at every moment.He had long since been unsatisfied with Li Qing.Now, Li Qing shaming him in such a way caused a killing intent to uncontrollably rise in his heart.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s sensitive senses noticed a killing intent.When he raised his head and looked over.\u201cLi An?\u201dDuan Ling Tian saw Li An leaving from where Li Qing sat.The killing intent came from Li An and was pointed at Li Qing.\u201cThis Li An isn\u2019t simple.\u201dVigilance arose in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart.Although in terms of strength Li Qing was stronger than Li An, in terms of the level of danger, it would be impossible for Li Qing to reach Li An\u2019s level.For example, if Li Qing was a wild wolf, then Li Ain would be the poisonous snake that was hiding in the dark\u2026The latter was much more terrifying than the former.Suddenly, there was a stir in the Star Observation Platform.\u201cXiao Lan is here!\u201d\u201cEqually famous as Li Fei and Lin Yu Huan, she is one of the three great beauties of Aurora City. Her reputation is well deserved!\u201d\u2026\u2026The sounds of exclamations rose and fell.The burning gazes of the youths descended on the young girl who was walking over from afar.The young girl had a head of soft and smooth long hair; it was like a pouring waterfall flying about with the wind.Her drop dead gorgeous face seemed to have gone through the care and precision of a sculptor.Under the hazy morning mist, the young girl seemed to transform into a fairy that came down from heaven.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was also drawn by the young girl who was walking over from afar.Xiao Lan?He had heard of this name.One of the three great beauties of Aurora City, equally famous to Li Fei.In the beginning, he didn\u2019t quite believe it.In his opinion, no matter whether it was Ke Er or Li Fei, they were both rare drop dead gorgeous beauties.Other women couldn\u2019t possibly compare with them.But seeing Xiao Lan today, Duan Ling Tian realized his mistake.This Xiao Lan\u2019s looks were indeed not one bit inferior to Li Fei\u2019s.Xiao Lan seemed to be around the age of eighteen. Her actions were elegant and her smile was like a flower. Every smile or frown emitted an exalted and refined charm.If Li Fei was a red rose, charming like fire.Then Xiao Lan would be pure like a snow lotus.Although their appearances were on par, their dispositions were completely different, being two complete opposites.What a excellent girl of respectable descent!Duan Ling Tian secretly praised her in his heart.\u201cAh!\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian felt a jolt of pain from his thigh, and he was unable to stop himself from shouting out.Only now did he realize that Li Fei was angrily staring at him and had extended her hand to mercilessly pinch his thigh.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that other women are not worthy?\u201dLi Fei was slightly vexed.\u201cMy good Fei, everyone loves a beauty. Hurry and take away your hand, I wont look anymore.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled bitterly.But in his heart, however, he was busting with joy.Li Fei\u2019s attitude undoubtedly indicated that she was jealous, in other words, although she wasn\u2019t willing to admit it, in her heart she had already tacitly approved of him being her man.Otherwise, why would she be jealous?After freely moving about the flower bushes in his previous life, Duan Ling Tian was extremely familiar with the thoughts of women.\u201cHumph!\u201dLi Fei grunted resentfully. Only then did she let go.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze descended upon the young girl beside Xiao Lan.Compared to Xiao Lan, the young girl was outshone.It wasn\u2019t that she was ugly.In terms of appearance, she was absolutely on par with Li Shi Shi.But compared to Xiao Lan, she was quite inferior.Duan Ling Tian watched Xiao Lan and the young girl enter the innermost pergola.At this time, Xiao Yu greeted them.He extended his hand and held Xiao Lan\u2019s hand, bringing her into the pergola.\u201cSo it turned out that she was Xiao Yu\u2019s woman\u2026But these guys still dared to look at her unrestrainedly. Aren\u2019t they afraid that Xiao Yu will come for them later?\u2019Duan Ling Tian noticed that most of the youths still had their gazes fixed upon Xiao Lan.\u201cOnly you have such complicated thoughts. Xiao Yu and Xiao Lan are siblings, twins.\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a disdainful glance.Twins?For an unknown reason, after hearing what Li Fei said, Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.\u201cThe young girl beside Xiao Lan seems to be not so simple\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze descended on the young girl beside Xiao Lan.He was sure that this young girl that was around the age of seventeen was not a Body Tempering martial artist but had already stepped into the Core Formation Stage.\u201cOf course. She is the Xiao Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s daughter, Xiao Yun, the former top disciple of the Xiao Clan\u2019s outer court. Equally famous to our Li Clan\u2019s Li Kuang and the Lin Clan\u2019s Lin Qi,\u201d Li Fei said.Duan Ling Tian felt enlightened.He finally recalled.When he fought Lin Qi that day, Lin Qi had mentioned Xiao Yun.After a short while longer, everyone had finally arrived.At this time, as the host, Xiao Yu walked out and arrived at the center of the Star Observation Platform.\u201cEveryone, before the gathering starts, I have a good news to tell everyone\u2026 This year, our Aurora City\u2019s three great clans have produced many good things as prizes for the young geniuses that will be ranked in this year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List,\u201d Xiao Yu slowly said.On the Star Observation Platform, the sounds of hurried breathing could be heard.Especially the youths that weren\u2019t from the three great clans, all of their eyes shone and they became slightly decomposed.Seeing this, Duan Ling Tian was able to understand their feelings.The three great clans of Aurora City practically monopolized all forms business.Meaning the other small clans could only pick up the scraps.To the young geniuses of these small clans, the prizes that were obtained from being ranked in the Hidden Dragon List were prizes that even if their clans spared no efforts to obtain, they would be incapable of getting their hands on it.\u201cYoung Master Yu, what prizes are there? Tell us.\u201d\u201cYeah, Young Master Yu, we want to know.\u201d\u2026\u2026The young geniuses from the small clans asked one after the other.\u201cHumph! A bunch of bumpkins.\u201dLi Qing, who was standing alone at a corner, had a disdainful smile on the corners of his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you don\u2019t, when the gathering starts, I welcome all of you to challenge me!\u201dLi Qing completely turned a blind eye to their enraged gazes.Seeing this, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but feel speechless.This Li Qing actually really thought himself to be peerless under the heavens.Li An watched this from afar with an expression of disdain.\u201cBoorish!\u201dUsing a voice only he could hear, Li An muttered to himself.\u201cSince everyone wants to know, then I\u2019ll tell\u2026\u201dAs Xiao Yu finished speaking, the gazes of all the young geniuses were drawn towards him.Even Duan Ling Tian was no exception.The reason he came to participate in this genius gathering wasn\u2019t for the ranking, the Hidden Dragon List, or whatever; he didn\u2019t have a sliver of interest in those.The only thing that mattered to him were the material prizes!\u201cAfter the deliberation of our three great clans\u2019 Patriarchs, it was decided that the one who is ranked first in this year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List will receive three high grade Profound Rank martial skills, ten Origin Increasing Pills, ten Grade Eight Gold Injury Pills, three 300-year-old Blood Lingzhis, and 300,000 silver.\u201dOn the Star Observation Platform, the sounds of people letting out breaths of cold air rose and fell.This year\u2019s prizes were much better than last year\u2019s\u2026\u201cSeems to be not bad.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed and a greedy light flashed within before vanishing instantaneously.Three high grade Profound Rank martial skills, no matter where, were considered items of great value.The Origin Increasing Pill was the medicinal pill Core Formation martial artists used to increase their cultivation level, so it was extremely valuable.Grade Eight Gold Injury Pills, even in the Fresh Breeze Town Li Branch Family, there were only two then. After using one on Duan Ling Tian, there was only one remaining, easily showing how rare and valuable it was.Three 300-year-old Blood Lingzhis were more than enough to provide a huge increase to the cultivation stage of a defensive martial skill.The 300,000 silver was even more practical.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, but you need to obtain it first.\u201dLi Fei provoked.\u201cLittle Fei, if I can get the first rank in this Hidden Dragon List, you\u2019ll become my wife. How about if?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it when you really are the firstt.\u201dLi Fei didn\u2019t take it seriously.Although Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength was extremely bizarre, as Li Fei saw it, his strength was at most slightly stronger than Li Qing\u2019s, maybe even slightly inferior to the Lin Clan\u2019s Lin Zhuo, let alone the Xiao Clan\u2019s Xiao Yu.Of course, she believed that in the future, Duan Ling Tian would undoubtedly surpass Lin Zhuo and Xiao Yu.After all, Duan Ling Tian was only sixteen this year.On the other hand, Lin Zhuo and Xiao Yu were two full years older than him.If it was the Hidden Dragon List ranking of next year, she believed that Duan Ling Tian would be able to be the first.This year, however, she didn\u2019t look favorably at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it as you\u2019ve agreed.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.His burning gaze once again descended upon Li Fei\u2019s hot and charming body. His lower regions were burning as they had a reaction again.Truly an attractive and alluring young girl.\u201cIf it\u2019s like this, isn\u2019t it slightly unfair?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s clear eyes emitted a sly expression.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s fair?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked.\u201cIf you can\u2019t obtain the first rank in the Hidden Dragon List, no matter what ranking you obtain, your prizes must be given to me.\u201dLi Fei blinked her beautiful eyes with an expression that said \u201clet\u2019s see if you dare to agree or not.\u201d\u201cLittle Fei, you really are greedy. When I marry you, I don\u2019t have to worry about suffering any losses anymore\u2026 OK, I agree.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.Hearing Duan Ling Tian agree, the smile that was on the corners of Li Fei\u2019s mouth froze.This money grubber actually agreed?Could it be that he really was confident?Or maybe\u2026He concealed his strength?At this instant, Li Fei\u2019s thoughts couldn\u2019t help but cause a sense of regret to be aroused in her heart.Duan Ling Tian noticed Li Fei\u2019s constantly changing expression, so he asked in vigilance, \u201cLittle Fei, you won\u2019t go back on your word, right?\u201d\u201cHumph! We\u2019ll discuss it when you\u2019ve really got the first place in the Hidden Dragon List,\u201d Li Fei grunted.At this moment, the young geniuses in the Star Observation Platform had slightly calmed their moods.\u201cYoung Master Yu, the other two people who are ranked in the top three, what are their prizes?\u201d another youth asked.\u201cThis year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List\u2019s second and third ranked will each get two high grade Profound Rank martial skills, five Origin Increasing Pills, five Grade Eight Gold Injury Pills, two 300-year-old Blood Lingzhis, and 200,000 silver,\u201d Xiao Yu answered.Although the prizes of the second and third ranks were significantly lesser than the first, to most of the people present, they were still filled with temptation\u2026\u201cAs for the other seven young geniuses that are ranked on the Hidden Dragon List, they will each get one high grade Profound Rank martial skill, three Origin Increasing Pills, three Grade Eight Gold Injury Pills, one 300-year-old Blood Lingzhi, and 100,000 silver,\u201d Xiao Yu continued.The Star Observation Platform was filled with a rising determination.As long as they were able to be ranked on the Hidden Dragon List, besides being well-known in Aurora City, they would still be able to obtain such abundant prizes\u2026Everyone was rubbing their hands together and were eager to have a go.\u201cNow the gathering begins.\u201dAfter finishing the announcement, Xiao Yu returned to the innermost pergola in the Star Observation Platform to stand shoulder to shoulder with his sister, Xiao Lan, and prepare for battle.\u201cBrother, unless something unexpected happens, the first rank for this year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List will surely be yours.\u201dXiao Lan smiled faintly, seeming noble and elegant.\u201cIf it was a month ago, I could be certain that nothing unexpected would happen\u2026 But now there\u2019s an unknown and unstable element.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head.His gaze directly descended upon the violet-clothed youth far away.\u201cHe is?\u201dXiao Lan looked over as well.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s pupils constricted as a battle intent surface from his body.\u201cDuan Ling Tian? The ninth level Body Tempering martial artist that took second place in the Li Clan\u2019s Martial Meet? According to the rumors, it\u2019s said that he can exert the strength of three ancient mammoths with a cultivation at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage\u2026 Brother, didn\u2019t you feel it to be too exaggerated?\u201d Xiao Lan analyzed.\u201cLan, since there are rumors, then it wouldn\u2019t be a groundless rumor\u2026 Moreover, there were so many Li Clan members who saw it with their own two eyes that day, how could this be faked? Also, you should know well of my intuition; it has never once been wrong\u2026\u201d Xiao Yu slowly said.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201dA startled expression surfaced on Xiao Lan\u2019s beautiful face.The intuition of her twin brother was something she was extremely clear of. It could be considered to be a miraculous ability that came naturally.Ever since they were small, her twin brother\u2019s intuition had never once been wrong.\u201cYou\u2019re right, my intuition is telling me that he is extremely dangerous. It\u2019s difficult to even compare Lin Zhuo with him.\u201dXiao Yu nodded.\u201cBut\u2026 he seems to only be sixteen.\u201dXiao Lan\u2019s face was slightly red and her breathing was hurried for a second.\u201cSo what if he\u2019s sixteen? In our Crimson Sky Kingdom\u2019s history, there have been many young geniuses that stepped into the Core Formation Stage at the age of sixteen. The appearance of someone abnormal like Duan Ling Tian isn\u2019t rare,\u201d Xiao Yu said.At this moment, Xiao Yun, who stood beside Xiao Lan, couldn\u2019t help herself and spoke. \u201cBrother Yu, in the Li Clan\u2019s Martial Meet, didn\u2019t this Duan Ling Tian lose to Li Qing?\u201d\u201cI heard of this too.\u201dXiao Lan nodded.\u201cLose to Li Qing? Who told you? That was him admitting defeat.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head as if he was thoroughly familiar with the circumstances of the Li Clan\u2019s Martial Meet.\u201cIf he can defeat Li Qing, why would he admit defeat?\u201dXiao Yun was reluctant to concede.\u201cLittle Yun, let me ask you\u2026If our Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Meet\u2019s champion was taken by a Branch Family disciple that was a disciple of another surname, what would happen?\u201dXiao Yu didn\u2019t directly answer Xiao Yun but instead gave her a question.\u201cBrother, what you mean is\u2026someone asked Duan Ling Tian to admit defeat?\u201dXiao Lan reacted at the first moment.\u201cThat is my guess.\u201dXiao Yu nodded.\u201cBrother Yu, everything you said is only just your guess.\u201dXiao Yun was still slightly unwilling to concede.In her entire life, she only admired one person in terms of the Martial Dao, and that person was Xiao Yu.Xiao Yu caused her to feel that she was not his equal.But now Xiao Yu said that someone might have the strength to defeat him. Moreover, it was a sixteen-year-old youth, so it was difficult for her to accept this.\u201cLittle Yun, whether or not my guess is correct, you\u2019ll know very soon.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head. He didn\u2019t debate with Xiao Yun.Presently, on the Star Observation Platform, there was a young genius from a small clan that had won three consecutive victories. His imposing manner shot towards the sky.The youth looked towards the surroundings as he slowly said, \u201cIs there anyone else who wants to battle me?\u201d\u201cMe!\u201dA Xiao Clan youth flew out and stood to face the youth.After a moment, the two fought.Merely in a single move.The Xiao Clan youth defeated the other youth.\u201cIt was a good fight.\u201dThe Xiao Clan youth cupped his hands.\u201cThis Xiao Yong took the fifth place in the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Meet last month\u2026In other words, among the five Xiao Clan young geniuses present today, his strength is the weakest.\u201d\u201cAs expected of a disciple from a large clan; the weakest had such formidable strength!\u201d\u201cLooks like I don\u2019t have a chance of being ranked in the Hidden Dragon List.\u201d\u201cBeing able to witness the young geniuses of the three great families striving for the top rank could also be considered as a pretty good gain.\u201d\u2026\u2026Some of the small clan young geniuses were slightly dejected.Of course, there were some small clan young geniuses who had a fearless battle intent and went up to challenge Xiao Yong.After a short while, Xiao Yong defeated another three opponents.Li Fei smiled as she said, \u201cThis Xiao Yong\u2019s strength is pretty good, not inferior to Li Zhong\u2019s.\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201dDuan Ling Tian yawned.\u201cDidn\u2019t you sleep enough last night?\u201dLi Fei was slightly dazed.\u201cI naturally didn\u2019t sleep enough as I had no wife to hug.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled playfully.\u201cRascal!\u201dLi Fei glared at Duan Ling Tian.In this short amount of time, Xiao Yong had defeated another opponent.\u201cIs there anyone who wants to battle this Xiao?\u201d Xiao Yong said politely.\u201cMe!\u2019A voice sounded from one of the pergolas on the Star Observation Platform.A green-clothed youth around the age of eighteen walked over.The youth had a robust build and had a straightforward appearance. If only looking at his outer appearance, he would be thought to be an honest person.But with a closer look, it could be noticed that the youth\u2019s eyes were extremely intelligent, and they occasionally flashed with a cunning brilliance.Xiao Yong lightly smiled as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, brother?\u201dThe youth blinked his eyes as he said, \u201cMeng Quan.\u201d\u201cBrother Meng Quan, I beseech your guidance.\u201dXiao Long went into stance.\u201cEh.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was originally drowsy, but his spirit was refreshed the moment he saw Meng Quan.\u201cWhat\u2019s different about this Meng Quan?\u201d noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s change, Li Fei asked curiously.\u201cInteresting, interesting\u2026 Xiao Yong is going to lose.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\u201cWhat have you noticed?\u201dLi Fei pursued.\u201cCall me Brother and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\u201cPei! You wish\u2026shameless! Stinking Rascal!\u201d\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he flashed towards Meng Quan, he slapped out a palm of accumulated force. His attack was bold and unconstrained, and with Origin Energy raging.Devastating Ox Fist!When Meng Quan swung out his fist, his origin energy burst apart and caused a surge of invisible currents of air as it moved to intercept Xiao Yong\u2019s palm strike.Above both of them were two ancient mammoth silhouettes each, which dashed out and collided together with a loud bang.Meng Quan\u2019s body lightly trembled.\u201cAh!\u201dXiao Yong emitted a shrill cry as he was blasted flying.\u201cI\u2019m not a match for you.\u201dXiao Yong slowly stood up and nodded to Meng Quan. He was sincerely convinced and thus retreated.\u201cHehe, it was a good fight.\u201dMeng Quan scratched the back of his head and smiled foolishly.But his eyes that flickered with a shrewd light sold him out.\u201cYou had already noticed earlier that Xiao Yong wasn\u2019t a match for him?\u201dLi Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian as if wanting to get the answer from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face.\u201cThis Meng Quan concealed his strength. His true strength is probably on par with Li Qing\u2019s.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stared fixedly at Meng Quan.It was difficult to discern the cultivation of a martial artist at the Core Formation Stage and above only by looking because of the presence of Origin Energy. The only way to determine an approximate cultivation level was to base the estimation on the ancient mammoth silhouettes that were developed by the martial artist from drawing upon the forces of heaven and earth\u2026But Duan Ling Tian, who had merged with the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, was equivalent to a living Rebirth Martial Emperor.His eyesight was unique.He could discern that Meng Quan wasn\u2019t a first level Core Formation martial artist.The feeling Meng Quan gave him was similar to Xiao Yu, Lin Zhuo, and Li Qing.The second level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201cEven though he can defeat Xiao Yong, that only shows that his martial skills have a high cultivation stage\u2026 Up until now, he has only exerted the strength of two ancient mammoths. How did you see through his concealed cultivation?\u201dLi Fei obviously didn\u2019t believe him.Duan Ling Tian shook his head and smiled, opting to not debate on the matter with Li Fei.It wouldn\u2019t be long before the facts proved everything.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dThe corners of Xiao Yu\u2019s mouth curled into a smile. Obviously he noticed as well.\u201cXiao Yong is really useless!\u201dXiao Yun\u2019s beautiful eyebrows knit as her body jerked before lightly descending nearby to Meng Quan.Xiao Yu couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly at this scene.\u201cBrother, can Xiao Yun defeat him?\u201d Xiao Lan asked in a light voice.\u201cBased on my estimation, among the young geniuses currently present in the Star Observation Platform, there are at most three people who might have a chance at defeating him\u2026 So much as there might not even be three people.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head.Xiao Lan\u2019s elegant and refined face emitted a shocked expression. She didn\u2019t expect that besides Duan Ling Tian, there was another who her brother would regard so highly.\u201cBig guy, I\u2019ll fight you,\u201d Xiao Yun shouted in a delicate voice.\u201cWoman? I don\u2019t bully women.\u201d Meng Quan frowned.\u201cYou!\u201dXiao Yun\u2019s face turned red from anger and her delicate body started to wildly tremble.\u201cDoes this Meng Quan think that defeating Xiao Yong makes him peerless under the heavens? One month ago during the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Meet, Xiao Yong wasn\u2019t Xiao Yun\u2019s match either, yet he actually dares to look down upon Xiao Yun.\u201d\u201cThis bumpkin probably doesn\u2019t even recognize Xiao Yun.\u201d\u201cSince when did the Meng Clan have such a figure?\u201d\u2026\u2026Some of the youths from the small clans started to discuss together.\u201cGo die!\u201dXiao Yun shouted in a delicate voice as her graceful figure transformed into a gust of wind that flew towards Meng Quan.In terms of speed, she was faster than the earlier Xiao Yong, even having a speed comparable to Meng Quan\u2019s.\u201cEh.\u201dMeng Quan was slightly shocked. Not daring to continue looking down upon Xiao Yun, he moved to intercept her.Devastating Ox Fist!This time, Meng Quan and Xiao Yun collided head on and were equally matched.\u201cThis Xiao Yun\u2019s strength is quite good.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly shocked.\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Among the younger generation females of the Xiao Clan, her natural talent isn\u2019t inferior to Xiao Lan\u2019s.\u201d Li Fei said.Duan Ling Tian laughed as he asked, \u201cHow about compared to you?\u201d\u201cMore or less\u2026\u201d Li Fei said.\u201cXiao Yun is about to lose.\u201dAbruptly, Duan Ling Tian saw the slight movements of Meng Quan and his eyebrows raised up.This guy finally couldn\u2019t hold back any longer\u2026He could clearly see the Origin Energy on Meng Quan\u2019s fist instantly increase explosively, surpassing the scope of a first level Core Formation martial artist.But it did not reach the second level of the Core Formation Stage, thus it did not draw upon the forces of heaven and earth to develop the third ancient mammoth silhouette.But even so, it wasn\u2019t something Xiao Yun could compare to.Devastating Ox Fist!Meng Quan attacked once more, its sound and force like thunder.Bang!Xiao Yun was knocked backwards and her face turned deathly pale as she looked at Meng Quan in disbelief.She noticed that the strength of this big guy seemed to instantaneously increase a level, completely suppressing her and causing her to feel powerless.\u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201dMeng Quan grinned.Xiao Yun glared in return, angrily returning to Xiao Yu and Xiao Lan\u2019s side.\u201cGood!\u201dAll the young geniuses form the smaller clans had expressions of disbelief and couldn\u2019t help themselves from cheering.Although they had compassion towards women, Meng Quan was, after all, a young genius from the smaller clans like them, so Meng Quan\u2019s accomplishments allowed them to gain pride and satisfaction.\u201cI\u2019ll battle you!\u201dA figure flew out.It was precisely Li Zhong.Although Li Zhong\u2019s strength was pretty good, it was still difficult for him to withstand the might of a single punch from Meng Quan, so he lost quickly.\u201cOK, you guys play first, I\u2019ll take a short rest.\u201dAfter defeating Li Zhong, Meng Quan returned to the pergola and started gobbling down the light refreshments and tea prepared by the Xiao Clan.As time flew by\u2026Most of the people present had commenced a battle.Only a few youths of the three great clans were yet to commence a battle.Among them were Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei.Whoosh!Li Fei flew out and descended in the center of the Star Observation Platform, attracting many burning gazes.In terms of appearance, Li Fei was on par with Xiao Lan.But the two of them were completely different types.Compared the Xiao Lan, who was like a fairy that transcended the mundane, Li Fei was the other extreme.With a devilish body and a face of an angel, she was even more attractive to men.\u201cXiao Lan.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s gaze descended upon Xiao Lan as she called her name in challenge.Both being one of Aurora City\u2019s three beauties, none of them were willing to give in, as they both wanted to defeat the other in an aspect.For a moment, the gazes of the people present all shone.A spar between two of the three beauties of Aurora City was a rare scene indeed.They all felt that this trip wasn\u2019t for naught.Xiao Lan moved with graceful steps, coming to face Li Fei.Two unrivalled beauties standing together caused the atmosphere in the Star Observation Platform to become silent. No one was willing to disturb this beautiful scene.Duan Ling Tian naturally wouldn\u2019t miss their fight, and he watched on with a fixed gaze.Wanderer\u2019s Flash!Li Fei moved, seeming like a flashing red rose, her speed fast like a bolt of lightning.Cloud Prancing!Xiao Lan moved as well. Her transcendent figure seemed to flutter.Above each of the two young girls were two ancient mammoth silhouettes that dashed out, seeming to be cheering for them.In terms of speed, the two young girls were on par.Starfall Fist!Li Fei\u2019s fist smashed down with Origin Energy bursting forth, transforming into a fist silhouette that seemed to be a falling shooting star. It was difficult to distinguish its genuineness.Cloud Dispelling Palm!Xiao Lan\u2019s palm swept out with a shapeless current filled with Origin Energy that dispersed out as if transforming into a group of white clouds. They seemed tranquil but actually contained killing intent.Bang!Among the fist silhouettes, Li Fei\u2019s true fist strike blasted out, creating a surge of explosions in the air.Whoosh!After the group of clouds, Xiao Lan\u2019s fine, jade-like hands appeared as a palm suffused with vast amounts of Origin Energy descended.Bang!The palm and fist collided with each other.The bodies of the two girls jerked before both retreating three steps.Noticing Li Fei\u2019s body jerking, Xiao Lan seemed to want to continue attacking.\u201cLittle Fei, leave it at this. Even if you continue, it would only result in you two being equally matched. How about stopping here?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.Li Fei glared at Duan Ling Tian.But she knew that what Duan Ling Tian said was a fact.Xiao Yu stood out as well as he said with a smile, \u201cYeah, you two will be considered as tied. If the two of you go at it head to head, the result would be both of you being injured.\u201dAfter returning to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side, Li Fei asked in a questioning manner, \u201cWere you worried that I\u2019d injure her?\u201d\u201cSlander\u2026I absolutely didn\u2019t have such thoughts. I was only afraid she would injure you and affect your ranking in the Hidden Dragon List.\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly provided an explanation.\u201cReally?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s expression eased up slightly.\u201cOf course!\u201d Duan Ling Tian said decisively.\u201cEh, that Meng Quan\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Li Fei lifted her head and looked afar.Duan Ling Tian looked over as well.Meng Quan, who had eaten his fill, burped before returning to the center of the Star Observation Platform.His gaze descended upon a proud and aloof figure that stood afar.\u201cThat\u2019s right, no doubt about it. You are\u2026 Li Qing, right? Didn\u2019t you say we were all bumpkins and we could challenge you? I\u2019ll now represent us bumpkins and challenge you, the Li Clan\u2019s genius.\u201dMeng Quan was speaking to Li Qing.Li Qing\u2019s expression turned gloomy as he walked out quickly.\u201cAre you sure you want to challenge me?\u201dThe corners of Li Qing\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer as if he had heard the joke of the century.\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the nonsenses? Let\u2019s fight!\u201dMeng Quan had an impatient expression.\u201cGood, very good\u2026I will quickly make you regret your decision.\u201dLi Qing turned angry from embarrassment.Whoosh!Li Qing\u2019s body flashed towards Meng Quan as three ancient mammoth silhouettes instantly formed above him.His speed was shockingly fast.\u201cI heard long ago that the Li Clan\u2019s number one in the younger generation, Li Qing, had cultivated his high grade Profound Rank movement technique, Swimming Dragon Steps, to the Mastery stage. Seeing it today, he really has a well-deserved reputation as expected!\u201d\u201cSince Meng Quan dared to challenge him, his courage deserves compliment\u2026But unfortunately, before Li Qing, who\u2019s at the second level of the Core Formation Stage, it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, Meng Quan is fighting for us.\u201d\u2026\u2026The young geniuses of the smaller clans discussed with each other.\u201cFinally, I have a worthy opponent,\u201d Meng Quan said in a slightly lazy manner, his body moving straight after.Whoosh!Instantly, three ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above him\u2026Bang!Meng Quan\u2019s legs stomped on the ground as he transformed into a cannonball that had a speed not one bit inferior to Li Qing\u2019s, moving to intercept him.\u201cThe strength of three ancient mammoths\u2026\u201dOn the Star Observation Platform, besides Duan Ling Tian and Xiao Yu, everyone else was dumbstruck.This Meng Quan was actually a second level Core Formation martial artist!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His state of mind was obviously startled by Meng Quan\u2019s sudden change.Devastating Ox Fist!Meng Quan\u2019s full force punch had even denser Origin Energy,Dark Nether Finger!Origin energy twisted around Li Qing\u2019s right index finger and condensed into a bizarre Origin Energy whirlpool, then he pointed out his finger as if all his energy was gathered on it.This finger strike touched Meng Quan\u2019s fist.Suddenly, Meng Quan\u2019s expression focused as his body flew backwards, causing a surge of piercingly cold wind.Meng Quan\u2019s eyes flickered with intelligence as he said indifferently, \u201cAs expected of the Li Clan\u2019s famous high grade Profound Rank martial skill, Dark Nether Finger. You were able to cultivate it to the Mastery Stage, so your comprehension is really good\u2026 But a Dark Nether Finger only at the Mastery Stage, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s unable to defeat me!\u201d\u201cBulls**t!\u201dLi Qing shouted harshly as his body flashed, seeming to transform into a gust of wind blowing towards Meng Quan.At this moment, Meng Quan turned around and pounced towards the side.\u201cHe\u2019s going for the weapons!\u201dInstantly, many people perceived what Meng Quan was planning.Meng Quan was precisely moving towards the weapon racks.\u201cHumph!\u201dSeeing this, Li Qing didn\u2019t pursue but instead stood on the spot.To him, even if he pursued and won, it would still be an undignified victory, so he disdained doing so.What he wanted to do was to defeat his opponent head on!Only then would he be able to trample on his opponent\u2019s dignity, receive gazes of veneration from the surrounding spectators, and satisfy his conceited heart.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dMing Quan lifted his hand and grabbed a weapon off the weapon rackA black iron rod!Li Qing moved.Swimming Dragon Steps!He flashed towards Meng Quan as if transforming into a dragon that was swimming swiftly like a flash and drawing upon the forces of wind and lightning.\u201cCome at me!\u201dMeng Quan released a loud shout as the black iron rod in his hand shook, lightly trembling.Thousand Shadow Rod!Instantly, the black iron rod trembled and was swung out along the course of Meng Quan\u2019s hand. A string of rod shadows descended straight towards Li Qing, who was moving towards him, menacingly approaching.\u201cThat\u2019s all you got?\u201dLi Qing\u2019s feet stomped on the ground in a hurry, avoiding the black iron rod as he pointed his finger out. His finger strike tore through space as it went straight for Meng Quan.Dark Nether Finger!If his finger that contained a whirlpool of Origin Energy were to touch Meng Quan, the consequence would be obvious.\u201cDon\u2019t get happy too early.\u201dMing Quan smiled indifferently.An ominous premonition arose in Li Qing\u2019s heart.Whoosh!A strong gust of wind came from behind.Li Qing\u2019s expression distorted as he hurriedly withdrew his Dark Nether Finger and exerted strength with his legs.Swimming Dragon Steps!Not only that, he even instantly circulated his defensive martial skill.Golden Bell Cover!Bang!The black iron rod menacingly approached and shattered the defensive qi barrier on the surface of Li Qing\u2019s body, descending upon his back and blasting him flying.Bang!Li Qing was unable to maintain his balance and dropped to the ground in a sorry state. His back faced the sky while his face faced the ground, eating a mouthful of dust.Meng Quan glanced at Li Qing as he indifferently said, \u201cThe middle grade Profound Rank defense martial skill, Golden Bell Cover, at the Mastery Stage isn\u2019t enough to withstand my Thousand Shadow Rod. But it was fortunate that you circulated Golden Bell Cover in time and nullified half of the force from Thousand Shadow Rod. If you hadn\u2019t this rod strike would have been more than enough to shatter your spine!\u201d\u201cRight, bear in mind not to insult others as bumpkins\u2026 Your current circumstances would only cause others to think you\u2019re even inferior to a bumpkin.\u201dThe flames of annihilation and fierceness disappeared from Meng Quan\u2019s eyes, and his serious expression quickly returned to his earlier straightforward appearance.If everyone hadn\u2019t experienced the resolute and ruthless side of him earlier, they might really be cheated by his harmless appearance.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Qing had only just recovered slightly from his injuries with the assistance of a Grade Nine Gold Injury Pill. Hearing what Meng Quan said caused him to nearly faint from anger.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Meng Quan\u2019s strongest move to not be his middle grade Profound Rank martial skill, Devastating Ox Fist, but the high grade Profound Rank Thousand Shadow Rod, and his Thousand Shadow Rod seems to have stepped into the Mastery Stage.\u201d\u201cIn our Aurora City, only the Li Clan possesses the Thousand Shadow Rod, right? Could it be that he has some sort of relationship with the Li Clan?\u201d\u201cHe was so blunt to Li Qing. Do you really think he has any relationship with the Li Clan?\u201d\u201cI nearly forgot about that.\u201d\u201cSatisfying! This Li Qing said that we were bumpkins earlier, but now he\u2019s even inferior to a bumpkin.\u201d\u201cHa ha!\u201d\u2026\u2026The young geniuses of the smaller clans had expressions filled with pride and satisfaction as they looked at Li Qing.Li Qing\u2019s expression turned even uglier, gloomy to the point that it seemed that water would drop out.Li Qing looked at Meng Quan as he said, in a cold voice, \u201cMeng Quan, don\u2019t be complacent. I was only careless earlier. If not for thatm you might not have been able to defeat me.\u201dAs far as he was concerned, his offensive martial skills and movement technique were on par with Meng Quan\u2019s.The reason he lost was because he was prejudiced by his first impression of Meng Quan and looked down upon him.\u201cWhat, do all of your Li Clan members like to act shamelessly? If it was a life and death battle earlier, and I followed up my victory by pursuing you, you would undoubtedly have died!\u201dMeng Quan laughed.\u201cYeah, even if you were careless, that is your problem.\u201dOne of the young genius from a small clan couldn\u2019t help himself from speaking in support.\u201cHumph! In the Hidden Dragon List competition, victory is decided in a single battle, so I will naturally abide by this rule\u2026 But after today, I will sooner or later find you for a battle and wash away the shame of today!\u201dLi Qing grunted.\u201cYou think I will waste more of my physical strength on you? This won\u2019t do, I\u2019m hungry again.\u201dMeng Quan quickly ran back into the pergola and started gulping down the light refreshments inside, causing the people present to be amazed.Could it be that this Meng Quan was the reincarnation of a Hungry Ghost?\u201cThis Meng Quan is interesting.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and laughed.\u201cHurry up and tell the truth. Did you notice since the beginning that he was at the second level of the Core Formation Stage?\u201dLi Fei looked towards Duan Ling Tian with an expression that said \u201cleniency to those who confess and severity to those who resist.\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh, and said, with a slight lingering fear, \u201cLittle Fei, you\u2019re not even my wife yet and you already have the appearance of a household affairs manager\u2026 Heh, if you become my wife in the future, won\u2019t I be entirely controlled by you?\u201d\u201cGo to hell!\u201dLi Fei gave Duan Ling Tian a glare before extending her delicate, jade-like hands to pinch his thigh.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face turned green\u2026In the innermost pergola on the Star Observation Platform.\u201cBrother Yu, you saw through Meng Quan since the beginning, right? And you didn\u2019t even warn me, causing me to go and bring misfortune to myself,\u201d Xiao Yun said, slightly dissatisfied.\u201cLittle Yun, my intuition told me he wasn\u2019t simple\u2026 As for the matter of him being at the second level of the Core Formation Stage, even I only found out when he fought Li Qing.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dJust at this moment, a voice broke the momentary silence of the Star Observation Platform.Lin Qi flew out and his gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows raised.Under the gazes of everyone present, Duan Ling Tian unhurriedly walked out of the pergola and slowly walked to face Lin Qi.Compared to the way Lin Qi made an appearance, it formed a distinct contrast.\u201cA Body Tempering martial artist will always be a Body Tempering martial artist. Even if the rumors were even more exaggerated, it wouldn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s only a Body Tempering martial artist.\u201dMany youth geniuses from the smaller clans glanced at Duan Ling Tian in disdain.Of course, their eyes obviously emitted a trace of envy.The corner of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth had a faint smile on it. He guessed the reason why these people were against him.That little girl, Li Fei, was really a source of trouble\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian, rumors say you can exert the strength of three ancient mammoths by merely relying on your ninth level Body Tempering cultivation\u2026 Today, I really want to experience it for myself.\u201dLin QI looked at Duan Ling Tian as his battle intent increased.\u201cThat would depend on whether you\u2019re capable of forcing me to use the strength of three ancient mammoths.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.Lin Qi had a serious expression but didn\u2019t reply. His body flashed as he exploded forth with his full strength of two ancient mammoths!Traceless Snowsteps!Duan Ling Tian noticed that Lin Qi, who had broken through to the first level of the Core Formation Stage, had a speed increase of an entire two times compared to the speed he had when he fought with Duan Ling Tian the other day.But Lin Qi\u2019s high grade Profound Rank movement technique, Traceless Snowsteps, was still at the Initial Stage.However, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s movement technique had already broken through to the Mastery Stage!Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian moved, he suppressed his strength to around 19,000 pounds, so the second ancient mammoth silhouette didn\u2019t appear.As the spectators saw it, he was only using the strength of one ancient mammoth.However, relying on a strength that was 1,000 pounds lower that Lin Qi.In terms of speed.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Mastery Staged Spirit Serpent Movement Technique utterly defeated Lin Qi\u2019s Initial Staged Traceless Snowsteps.\u201cF**k! I admit defeat.\u201dLin Qi pursued Duan Ling Tian for a moment, but after noticing that he was completely unable to catch up to him, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from spouting out a vulgarity.He was clear of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s skills.Under the condition that he was unable to catch up to Duan Ling Tian, Duan Ling Tian could easily defeat him.Since he knew the ending, he didn\u2019t continue to persist.Persisting would only lead to an even greater loss of face.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, your movement technique seems to already be higher than my Traceless Steps by a stage.\u201dLin Qi glanced at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cNice insight.\u201dDuan Ling Tian grinned.\u201cThe strength this guy used earlier was absolutely approaching the strength of two ancient mammoths\u2026\u201d Lin Qi thought in his heart.He realized that Duan Ling Tian was purposefully concealing his weakness.\u201cWhat movement technique did this Duan Ling Tian execute? He only used the strength of one ancient mammoth and was able to be faster than Lin Qi, who exerted the strength of two ancient mammoths!\u201d\u201cMy speed is inferior to his.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m inferior as well.\u201d\u2026\u2026The young geniuses of the smaller clans didn\u2019t dare to look down upon Duan Ling Tian anymore.\u201cDoes anyone else wish to provide their guidance?\u201dSince he was already in the arena, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t plan to leave straight away.After all, walking up and down was quite tiring\u2026Li Qing\u2019s expression was gloomy.He wanted to battle Duan Ling Tian, but his injuries still needed a while longer to heal.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you won\u2019t be complacent for long.\u201d Li Qing took a deep breath as he swore in his heart.\u201cI\u2019ll try!\u201dA figure flashed over from afar, descending in front of Duan Ling Tian.Lin Zhuo!\u201cThere\u2019s a common saying: hunting a tiger requires the cooperation of brothers\u2026 Looks like you plan to imitate our forefathers, Lin Zhuo.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.Lin Zhuo, the Lin Chan\u2019s top disciple in the younger generation.The ninth ranked in last year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked at Duan Ling Tian full of interest.\u201cThis rascal\u2026\u201dLi Fei lightly grit her teeth as her eyes that were clear as water looked at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLet\u2019s start this.\u201dLin Zhuo nodded to Duan Ling Tian, after which his body flashed.Swift Lightning Steps!Lin Zhuo\u2019s body flashed accompanied by the sound of thunder striking, approaching in full fury.Noticing this, Duan Ling Tian moved as well.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!His entire body seemed to transform into a spirit serpent as he scurried towards Lin Zhuo.\u201cEat this!\u201d Lin Zhuo shouted in a low voice. His hand was like palm-leaf fan as it slapped down abruptly.Heaven\u2019s Net Palm!Lin Zhuo\u2019s palm descended like a net that covered the heavens and earth, enveloping Duan Ling Tian within and causing him to be unable to flee.The hearts of the people present trembled as they saw this scene.Lin Zhuo\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Net Palm had almost completely enveloped Duan Ling Tian\u2019s upper body.Just when everyone thought Duan Ling Tian could only choose to fight Lin Zhuo head on.Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body inclined to a degree that seemed like he would fall flat at any moment.This scene caused everyone\u2019s heart to be in their throats.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body that was about to touch the floor jerked and abruptly stood up straight, then it seemed to transform into a spirit serpent as he leapt behind Lin Zhuo.He actually dodged it!On the Star Observation Platform, every gaze was filled with disbelief.Is this Duan Ling Tian human?Able to complete a movement of such high difficulty.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian fixed his eyes on Lin Zhuo\u2019s back and his gaze turned cold. His entire body seemed to bend into a heavy bow as he swung out a straight punch with force that was exerted like a landslide.Causing a surge of shapeless wind!Lin Zhuo\u2019s eyes flashed with astonishment. Feeling the wind coming from behind him, he increased his speed.The strength of three ancient mammoths completely exploded forth!Swift Lightning Steps!His speed surged as fast as lightning, dodging Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Collapsing Fist with ease.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you want to defeat me, merely relying on a strength that\u2019s close to the strength of two ancient mammoths isn\u2019t enough.\u201dLin Zhuo noticed with a glance that Duan Ling Tian was purposely suppressing his strength.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t reply. His body flashed once more.Instantly, two ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above him.29,000 pounds of strength exploded forth!He was only 1,000 pounds of strength short from forming the third ancient mammoth silhouette.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Instantly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed experienced an increase.He was not one bit slower than Lin Zhuo\u2019s Swift Lightning Steps.In terms of movement techniques, his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique and Lin Zhuo\u2019s Swift Lightning Steps were both high grade Profound Rank movement techniques and both were cultivated to the Mastery Stage.In terms of strength, he was only 1,000 pounds weaker than Lin Zhuo, so his speed was not visibly slower than Lin Zhuo\u2019s.\u201cEat this!\u201dAccompanied by the sound of thunder, Lin Zhuo once again rushed towards Duan Ling Tian, slapping out a palm that raged with Origin Energy.Heaven\u2019s Net Palm!This time, the net formed of palm silhouettes that covered the heavens and earth nearly completely enveloped Duan Ling Tian\u2019s entire body, causing him to have no way out.\u201cDuan Ling Tian can\u2019t dodge it this time!\u201dMany people on the Star Observation Platform thought in their hearts.Li Fei\u2019s heart rose to her throat as well.Under everyone\u2019s gazes, Duan Ling Tian, who was in a sticky situation, finally moved. His hand flashed past his waist.Sword Drawing Arts!A violet sword shine appeared.Om!The flexible sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand seemed to have grown a pair of eyes as it directly slapped towards a sword silhouette at the side.Bang!The flat side of the sword slapped out and a clear ringing sounded.Lin Zhuo\u2019s face distorted.Swift Lightning Steps.He hastily retreated.The sharp pain coming from his palm caused Lin Zhuo to unconsciously flip his palm over and take a glance.On his palm was a two finger-wide bruises caused by a sword blade.This scene was caught by many of the people present.\u201cOh my god, Duan Ling Tian actually broke Lin Zhuo\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Net Palm with a single sword strike!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable!\u201dNo matter whether it was the young geniuses of the three families or the young geniuses of the smaller clans, they all presently had an expression filled with disbelief.\u201cI lost.\u201dLin Zhuo was stupefied for a moment before glancing at Duan Ling Tian with a face filled with a bitter smile.He understood that Duan Ling Tian had showed mercy.If Duan Ling Tian hadn\u2019t used the flat side of the sword but used the blade instead, his palm would surely have been sliced in half.\u201cIt was a good fight.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled to Lin Zhuo.The surrounding young geniuses didn\u2019t dare look down on Duan Ling Tian anymore.A martial artist at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage exerting the strength of two ancient mammoths\u2026It was absolutely unbelievable!Not only that, he even relied upon the strength of two ancient mammoths to defeat Lin Zhuo, who was at the second level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, no wonder the rumors say that your sword skill is marvelous. Seeing it today, its reputation is well-deserved as expected.\u201dXiao Yu walked out in large strides. Xiao Lan and Xiao Yun followed behind him.At this moment, the two girls looked at Duan Ling Tian with gazes that emitted a trace of admiration\u2026In terms of age, this Duan Ling Tian was younger than them.\u201cBrother Xiao you\u2019re too kind.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled. His gaze descended upon Xiao Lan, who was beside Xiao Yu, and nodded to her.\u201cMy brother rarely gives out praise, Duan Ling Tian. You\u2019re worthy of it!\u201dXiao Lan smiled beautifully, like a fairy that had fallen to the mortal realm.\u201cYeah, brother Yu has never once praised me.\u201dXiao Yu deeply approved.\u201cThen I\u2019m even more terrified\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cRascal!\u201dA sweet fragrance invaded his nose as a young girl with a devilish body and angelic appearance arrived beside Duan Ling Tian. Her hand secretly arrived at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s waist, lightly twisting\u2026A sharp pain descended.The corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth jerked.This overly jealous girl\u2026\u201cBrother Xiao, I expended some physical strength earlier, so I\u2019ll go get some rest first.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled to Xiao Yu.He could imagine how if he was slightly hesitant, Li Fei would surely use even more force\u2026\u201cYeah, Xiao Yu, among the young geniuses on the Star Observation Platform, it seems like only you and Li An haven\u2019t had a battle yet\u2026 Why don\u2019t the two of you have a battle?\u201dLi Fei suggested.\u201cI naturally have no problem with that, but I wonder if Li An would grant me this honor.\u201dXiao Yu looked at the nearby Li An.\u201cYoung Master Yu, spare me, please. How could I be a match for you?\u201dLi An hurriedly shook his head in disapproval.Xiao Yu\u2019s eyebrows knit.What he disdained the most was the type of person who didn\u2019t even have the courage to fight him.In his opinion, this of person wouldn\u2019t have any great achievement in their lifetime!Besides natural talent and comprehension, courage was the most important trait for a martial artist.\u201cXiao Yu!\u201dJust at this moment, a white-clothed, proud, and aloof figure returned to the arena.Li Qing!Li Qing\u2019s gaze swept past Li Fei just in time to see her walking away shoulder to shoulder with Duan Ling Tian\u2026His expression was ugly and his gaze turned grim and cold.Xiao Yu naturally caught Li Qing\u2019s actions.\u201cLi Qing, have the injuries from your battle with Meng Quan healed?\u201d Xiao Yu asked, as he was reluctant to take advantage of him.\u201cIt\u2019s only external injuries. They all healed after I consumed a Grade Nine Gold Injury Pill.\u201dLi Qing nodded. His gaze was still cold and grim.\u201cOK.\u201dXiao Yu nodded, then he moved to confront Li Qing after asking the two girls beside him to stand back.\u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201dXiao Yu looked at Li Qing. His cold figure was unmovable like a mountain.It was as if he was waiting for Li Qing to make the first move.Li Qing\u2019s gaze descended upon Xiao Yu.\u201cIf I can defeat Xiao Yu\u2026 Fei Fei will surely hold me in high esteem, so much so that she might leave Duan Ling Tian and choose me,\u201d Li Qing thought in his heart, his gaze fanatical.Battle intent rising!Defeat Xiao Yu.Swimming Dragon Steps!Li Qing\u2019s body jerked as he fully exerted his strength of three ancient mammoths and rushed towards Xiao Yu.He noticed that Xiao Yu standing before him without any intention of making a move.\u201cXiao Yu, I\u2019ll defeat you in one move!\u201dLI Qing\u2019s gaze was cold as his hand shook and swept past the sky in full fury.Dark Nether Finger!His Origin Energy condensed into a whirlpool at the tip of his finger as he pointed it out, whistling through the air as it approached Xiao Yu.Right at the instant Li Qing attacked, Xiao Yu moved.Above him, two ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared\u2026He shook his sleeve as he moved to intercept Li Qing\u2019s Dark Nether Finger.Instantly, Li Qing\u2019s expression distorted.He noticed that his finger strike seemed to have hit a ball of cotton; he had absolutely nowhere to exert the force within.In the next moment, he realized the danger involved and hurriedly withdrew his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201dA cold voice entered Li Qing\u2019s ears.Instantly, Li Qing\u2019s sight turned black and he was blasted flying by Xiao Yu\u2019s sleeve, shocking his internal organs and causing him to feel something rush forth into his throat.The pride in his heart made Li Qing forcefully swallow this mouthful of blood.\u201cWhat a strong martial skill!\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly moved.Xiao Yu\u2019s action of swinging his sleeve seemed casual, but in reality it contained a terrifying martial skill which countered strength using softness.It was virtually identical in nature to Tai Chi from his previous life.But unfortunately, the Tai Chi from his previous life had long since declined. At least Duan Ling Tian had never met a true Tai Chi master.Tai Chi, it only appeared in the morning exercise of elderly people in parks.Having form but not the spirit.\u201cCould it be that the martial skill Young Master Yu executed earlier was the Xiao Clan\u2019s strongest high grade Profound Rank martial skill, Sleeve Dimension?\u201d\u201cToo terrifying, breaking Li Qing\u2019s Mastery Staged Dark Nether Finger with just a swing of the sleeve.\u201d\u201cCompletely not on the same level.\u201d\u201cLooks can be deceiving\u2026 Now I believe that Duan Ling Tian absolutely didn\u2019t willingly admit defeat that day!\u201d\u2026\u2026On the Star Observation Platform, the group of young geniuses started discussing animatedly and did not suppress their voices one bit.These voices felt like sharp needles as they entered Li Qing\u2019s ears!\u201cI will defeat Duan Ling Tian in front of everyone, and let you all know the disparity between him and me!\u201d Li Qing swore in his heart.Li Qing looked towards Xiao Yu and asked, in a heavy voice, \u201cXiao Yu, your Sleeve Dimension has been cultivated to the Perfection Stage?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dXiao Yu nodded lightly.\u201cNo wonder\u2026 Next time, once my Dark Nether Finger steps into the Perfection Stage, I will surely come battle you once more! I want to see if your Sleeve Dimension stronger or if my Dark Nether Finger stronger.\u201dLeaving these remarks, Li Qing moved aside.Xiao Yu had a cold expression as he indifferently said, \u201cI\u2019ll naturally accompany you.\u201d\u201cSleeve Dimension?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly moved.What a domineering martial skill!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The straightforward smile on his face had vanished and was replaced by a serious expression.\u201cAlthough I know I might not be a match for you, I still want to try\u2026 I want to know the disparity between me and you, the publically acknowledge number one youth in Aurora City\u2019s younger generation.\u201dMeng Quan had an earnest expression.Suddenly, he moved.Three ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above him.Arriving in front of Xiao Yu in the blink of an eye, the black iron rod in his hand trembled, whistling through the air as it descended.Thousand Shadow Rod!His rod strike transformed into tens of rod shadows as it descended, smashing straight towards Xiao Yu.Xiao Yu still did not move; he stood there, immovable like a mountain.Facing Meng Quan\u2019s head on blow, his sleeve moved once again. Faint Origin Energy almost completely twined the sleeve as it lightly jerked.Sleeve Dimension!He swung his sleeve out to intercept Meng Quan\u2019s menacingly approaching rod strike.Meng Quan\u2019s black iron rod jerked, avoiding Xiao Yu\u2019s sleeve, and instantly changed directions to a horizontal sweep at Xiao Yu\u2019s waist.\u201dWhoosh!Shapeless waves of air vibrated, as the might of Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike was extremely ferocious.If a normal person were to be smashed by this rod strike, it would lead to paralysis, or even death!\u201cHuh? Xiao Yu is actually not dodging\u2026.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly surprised. He noticed that if Xiao Yu wanted to dodge the attack from Meng Quan, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult.But he instead didn\u2019t dodge, and he didn\u2019t execute Sleeve Dimension again.It was as if he was waiting for Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike to smash down.\u201cIs Young Master Yu planning to receive Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike head on?\u201dMany people had their eyes wide open with expressions of disbelief.Among the people present, only the four Xiao Clan youths and young girls, including Xiao Lan and Xiao Yun, had tranquil expressions. It was as if they were not one bit surprised.Bang!Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike finally smashed onto Xiao Yu\u2019s waist, or more accurately, it smashed the defensive qi barrier on Xiao Yu\u2019s body.The defensive qi barrier abruptly shuddered.In the next moment, it completely shattered.And at the exact moment the defensive qi barrier shattered, Meng Quan let out a shrill cry as he was blasted flying along with his rod, both falling on the ground in a sorry state.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.Wasn\u2019t this his defensive martial skill, Greater Teleportation?How could Xiao Yu also know it?Moreover, Xiao Yu\u2019s Greater Teleportation was at a higher stage than his, already being cultivated to the Mastery Stage.That\u2019s why he was able to take Meng Quan\u2019s Thousand Shadow Rod head on.After all, they were both high grade Profound Rank martial skills at the Mastery Stage.\u201cIt\u2019s Star Shift! I heard that the Xiao Clan possesses a heaven-defying high grade Profound Rank defensive martial skill that is able to give someone a dose of their own medicine\u2026 Young Master Yu was able to use Star Shift to counter Meng Quan\u2019s Thousand Shadow Rod head on. He surely has cultivated Star Shift to the Mastery Stage!\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026 Perfect Stage Sleeve Dimension, Mastery Stage Star Shift, Young Master Yu\u2019s comprehension ability is truly shocking.\u201dMany people recognized the defensive martial skills Xiao Yu executed.\u201cStar Shift? So that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.The Greater Teleportation he cultivated and Xiao Yu\u2019s Star Shift were martial skills that had an almost identical effect.\u201cThe defensive martial skill you cultivate is also Star Shift?\u201dHearing the discussions, Li Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian with a strange expression.She had once fought with Duan Ling Tian and thus knew of the strangeness of his defensive martial skill; it was almost exactly the same as Xiao Yu\u2019s Star Shift.\u201cNo, only the characteristics are the same. My defensive martial skill is called Greater Teleportation.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so ruthless, right? I rather be defeated how Li Qing was, being forced back by a single swing of your sleeve\u2026 If I knew earlier how abnormal your defensive martial skill was, I wouldn\u2019t even have fought you.\u201dMeng Quan got up with a face full of dust and glanced at Xiao Yu with a gaze filled with hidden bitterness.Immediately, it attracted a wave of sincere laughter.\u201cMeng Quan, you were able to make Young Master Yu use Star Shift. It\u2019s already worthy to be proud of!\u201d\u201cYeah, at least you\u2019re stronger than someone who is even inferior to bumpkins.\u201dMany people laughed as they talked.\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to someone who suffered defeat at my hands, that\u2019s insulting me.\u201dMeng Quan glared with an unsatisfied expression.Li Qing, who was standing at the side, had a gloomy expression. He was enraged to the limit\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I want to battle you!\u201dMeng Quan looked towards Duan Ling Tian.Xiao Yu\u2019s gaze flickered, returning back to Xiao Lan\u2019s side.\u201cWhy did you choose me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse and directly walked out.After all, his target was the first rank in the Hidden Dragon List.If he wanted to get the first rank, then it was necessary for him to have the strength to dominate all of the young geniuses present.But he was puzzled. Why would this Meng Quan directly choose him?He seemingly hadn\u2019t fought Lin Zhuo yet, right?\u201cOriginally, I thought that besides Xiao Yu, my opponent would only be Lin Zhuo and Li Qing\u2026 but now Li Qing was defeated by me, and I can\u2019t defeat Xiao Yu, whereas you defeated Lin Zhuo. Thus, I naturally would choose you! If I defeat you, I don\u2019t even need to fight Lin Zhuo anymore,\u201d Meng Quan said as a matter of course.Duan Ling Tian was stunned.After thinking about it, it was indeed the right argument.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty astute.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.After a short moment, Meng Quan attacked.Exploding forth with his entire strength of three ancient mammoths!He attacked like a gust of wind with rod shadows that covered the skies, smashing straight towards Duan Ling Tian.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian moved at a tricky angle, avoiding Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike.Noticing Meng Quan\u2019s rod strike was sweeping towards him horizontally, Duan Ling Tian moved once more.As if transforming into a serpent, he coiled along the black iron rod in Meng Quan\u2019s hand and moved towards him.There was a common saying: hit a snake with a rod and it will coil up the rod towards you.What the saying said might be what happened right now.Collapsing Fist!Taking advantage of the opportunity, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s fist smashed directly at Meng Quan\u2019s chest, blasting him flying.Pu!Meng Quan spat out a mouthful of blood before glaring at Duan Ling Tian. \u201cWhat movement technique is that? It feels like it restrains my Thousand Shadow Rod.\u201d\u201cSpirit Serpent Movement Technique.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled lightly. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of \u2018hit a snake with a rod and it will coil up the rod towards you?\u2019\u201d\u201cEven that is possible?\u201dMeng Quan smiled bitterly as he withdrew himself.\u201cHit a snake with a rod and it will coil up the rod towards you\u2026 Duan Ling Tian\u2019s movement technique, Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, virtually seems to be made just to restrict Meng Quan\u2019s Thousand Shadow Rod.\u201d\u201cMeng Quan is really unlucky.\u201dMany people had odd smiles on their faces; they could perceive Meng Quan\u2019s grievance.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dJust at this moment, Li Qing walked out in large strides to arrive in front of Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHuh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cLi Qing, you don\u2019t seem to be lightly injured\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me you want to fight me in such a state.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than enough to defeat you!\u201dLi Qing sneered.\u201cEveryone can brag\u2026 come on.\u201dDuan Ling Tian silently awaited for Li Qing to make his move.\u201cWait.\u201dUnexpectedly, Li Qing abruptly called out.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. This Li Qing was so bothersome.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a bet?\u201dLi Qing took in a deep breath. His eyes that were like an array of stars glistened.\u201cWhat bet?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze shone.\u201cThe loser of our battle will not come into contact with Fei Fei for their entire lifetime and must take a detour as long you could see her from afar\u2026 Do you dare to accept this bet?\u201d Li Qing said directly.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression froze.He originally thought Li Qing would bet some medicinal pills, silver, or some sort of other bet.Duan Ling Tian started laughing.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dLi Qing got angry from embarrassment.\u201cNothing, I just feel it\u2019s funny\u2026 What are you to Little Fei? And what qualifications do you have to use Little Fei in a gamble? Did you ask Little Fei\u2019s opinion? Also, Little Fei is a person, not an item; she has her own thoughts. What were you thinking when you made her a part of your gamble? Did you take her as an item that could be casually lost to another?\u201dAs Duan Ling Tian asked, each question caused Li Qing\u2019s expression to distort.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201dLi Qing was both embarrassed and enraged, but he didn\u2019t know how to retort.\u201cNicely said!\u201dMeng Quan praised.The gazes of the surround people towards Li Qing had a trace of contempt, speaking of such a gamble, this Li Qing really doesn\u2019t want his face anymore.Any person with a good sense would easily notice that Li Fei liked Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLooks like he really likes Li Fei.\u201dXiao Lan\u2019s clear eyes flashed, vaguely flickered within was a trace of a sense of loss.When Li Qing spoke of the gamble, Li Fei\u2019s face was covered in a layer of frost, but when she heard what Duan Ling Tian said, her expression finally eased up.For the first time, she felt that Duan Ling Tian was actually so \u2018noble\u2019\u2026Her heart was warm.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I want you dead!\u201dUnder his extreme rage, Li Qing almost completely lost all reason.On the space above him, the forces of heaven and earth shook as three ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared.Swimming Dragon Steps!Dark Nether Finger!Li Qing attacked madly, every move containing a bloodthirsty killing intent, without a single shred of mercy, going straight towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s vital points.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!As he dodged, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.Even a kind person would get enraged when threatened!\u201cLi Qing, you\u2019re going too far!\u201dDuan Ling Tian sneered as his right hand flashed past his waist and a violet sword shine appeared once again.Sword Drawing Arts!The icy cold sword strike that was swift and fierce intercepted Li Qing\u2019s Dark Nether Finger.Whoosh!Li Qing swiftly withdrew his attack, dodging Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword strike before striking with his finger once more, aiming towards the flat side Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword\u2019s blade.Clang!But his finger strike descended unto empty space.Duan Ling Tian had already sheathed his sword.\u201cSince you want to kill me, then I\u2019ll cut off your finger!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s indifferent voice had just sounded.In the time it took a bolt of lightning to flash.Whoosh!He drew his sword once more and a violet sword shine flashed by.Sword drawn, finger cut!\u201cAhhh!\u201dLi Qing emitted a shrill cry. His left hand clasped the bloody spot where his right hand\u2019s finger was cut off, his face deathly pale.At this moment, his cut off finger had already dropped on the ground.He endured the pain and allowed his cold sweat to pour as he extended his left hand to pick up his cut off finger, leaving the Star Observation Platform as if he was flying.At this moment, what Hidden Dragon List ranking, what Li Fei? He didn\u2019t give a care.He only knew that if he didn\u2019t connect this cut off finger in time, the Dark Nether Finger that he bitterly cultivated for years would be completely crippled.His Dark Nether Finger\u2019s might was all on the index finger of his right hand.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I will surely return todays shame a hundred fold, a thousand fold!As he left, Li Qing didn\u2019t forget to roar.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face emitted a cold smile, entirely not paying any attention to Li Qing\u2019s threat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whoosh! Whoosh!Gazes descended onto the violet-clothed youth one after the other.They all felt a chill run down their spines.This Duan Ling Tian had acted really decisively. If he said that he would cut off one finger, then he wouldn\u2019t cut off a second.Most of the young genius\u2019 eyes emitted a trace of reverence.Duan Ling Tian used his formidable strength and decisive approach to win the reverence of these young geniuses.He was different from the other young geniuses.The corners of Li An\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer as a sense of joy arose in his heart. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, no matter what, Li Qing is still the Grand Elder\u2019s grandson\u2026 I want to see how a little Branch Family disciple like you will face the Grand Elder\u2019s rage!\u201dLi Qing being cripple was something he was happy about.Duan Ling Tian getting into trouble was something he was happy about as well.\u201cYou\u2019re too rash. Li Qing is the Grand Elder\u2019s grandson after all, and the Grand Elder has always been protective\u2026\u201dLi Fei looked towards Duan Ling Tian, her beautiful eyebrows slightly knit.\u201cLittle Fei, are you worried about me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed faintly.\u201cYou\u2026 You can still laugh even at such a time?\u201d Li Fei said angrily.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, today\u2019s matter is something that many people bore witness to. If it wasn\u2019t for Li Qing being overbearing and persistently at my heels, I wouldn\u2019t have gone so far as to cut off his finger\u2026 I didn\u2019t kill him, it could be considered as me giving Grand Elder enough face.\u201dDuan Ling Tian made nothing of it.\u201cRegarding today\u2019s matter, Grand Elder indeed won\u2019t cause trouble for you during the day, but a visible spear is easily withstood, whereas an unseen arrow is hard to guard against. I\u2019ve heard from my grandfather that the Grand Elder is not a pushover,\u201d Li Fei said anxiously.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes slightly narrowed as he lightly smiled. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYou!!\u201dLi Fei was completely helpless. Duan Ling Tian was extremely obstinate.But she had a plan in her heart. After returning today, she would tell her grandfather what happened and ask him to protect Duan Ling Tian.\u201cLin Zhuo, do we still need to battle each other?\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s gaze descended onto Lin Zhuo.Lin Zhuo waved his hand dismissively as he casually said, \u201cForget about it. We only just sparred a few days ago, and I haven\u2019t had a break in these past few days.\u201dXiao Yu nodded, \u201cThen you\u2019ll battle Meng Quan, and once Duan Ling Tian recovers, I\u2019ll battle him\u2026 and compete for the first rank in the Hidden Dragon List! Does anyone have any objections?\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Xiao Yu\u2019s gaze swept across all the remaining young geniuses in the Star Observation Platform.No one made a sound.\u201cVery good.\u201dXiao Yu nodded. \u201cThis year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List\u2019s first and second rank will be decided between Duan Ling Tian and I\u2026 The third and fourth rank will be decided between Lin Zhuo and Meng Quan. The fifth is Li Qing.\u201d\u201cMeng Quan!\u201dLin Zhuo looked towards Meng Quan.Meng Quan stuffed a piece of dim sum into his mouth and said, in an unclear voice, \u201cWait! I still haven\u2019t rested enough\u2026 There\u2019s no need to hurry; decide on the last five first and we can battle after.\u201dLin Zhuo was speechless.\u201cOK, now we\u2019ll start the ranking battle for the last five ranks in the Hidden Dragon List\u2026\u201dXiao Yu nodded.Under his direction, the more outstanding young geniuses of the three great clans continuously battled the outstanding youths of the smaller clans.In the end, the verdict was.Hidden Dragon List sixth, Li An.Seventh and the Eighth tied by Li Fei and Xiao Lan.Ninth and Tenth tied by Xiao Yun and Lin Qi.In the Hidden Dragon List, only Meng Quan came from the smaller clans.The other nine were all from the three great clans.Towards this result, the young geniuses of the small clans were not surprised.At any rate, they had Meng Quan who entered the Hidden Dragon List this year.At this moment, the sky had already come close to dusk.\u201cOkay!\u201dMeng Quan walked out and directly took up the black iron rod before looking at Lin Qi with a gaze that emitted battle intent.Lin Zhuo flew out to confront Meng Quan.Abruptly, they both moved simultaneously.Immediately, half of the Star Observation Platform was enveloped in rod shadows and palm shadows.Heaven\u2019s Net Palm formed a net that covered the heavens and the earth, causing its opponent to be unable to flee!Thousand Shadow Rod moved freely like a shadow, always able to give the opponent a quick and ferocious strike at the critical juncture.Whoosh!The two of them battled for tens of moves, but in the end, Lin Zhuo feinted an opening and enveloped Meng Quan with his Heaven\u2019s Net Palm, injuring Meng Quan.\u201cF**k! The third place is gone.\u201dMeng Quan couldn\u2019t help himself from spouting out vulgarities. He was slightly vexed and then he casually threw the black iron rod aside.Although Meng Quan lost, he still obtained the respect of everyone.A disciple of a small clan being able to achieve such an accomplishment was truly rare.It could be imagined that with his natural talent, if he could obtain the fostering from one of the three great clans, defeating Lin Zhuo in the future wasn\u2019t impossible.\u201cMeng Quan!\u201dAt this moment, Xiao Yu walked out as he looked towards Meng Quan. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in joining our Xiao Clan to become a disciple with another surname of the Xiao Clan, the Xiao Clan will spare no efforts in fostering you.\u201dObviously, Xiao Yu took a fancy to Meng Quan\u2019s natural talent, so he extended an olive branch to him.\u201cMeng Quan, if you join our Lin Clan, what our Lin Clan can give you wouldn\u2019t be less than the Xiao Clan.\u201dLin Zhuo was unwilling to lag behind.\u201cLin Zhuo is the Lin Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s son, so it\u2019s normal for him to endeavor to win over Meng Quan for the Lin Clan\u2026This Xiao Yu shouldn\u2019t be the Xiao Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s son, right?\u201dSeeing this scene, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help himself from asking Li Fei.\u201cYou don\u2019t know Xiao Yu\u2019s background?\u201dLi Fei had a strange gaze.Duan Ling Tian shook his head.\u201cAlthough Xiao Yu isn\u2019t the son of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Patriarch, his status in the Xiao Clan is even higher than the Xiao Clan Patriarch\u2019s son\u2026Xiao Yu\u2019s grandfather is the Supreme Elder of the Xiao Clan, one of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Nascent Soul powerhouses,\u201d Li Fei explained.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze flickered. So that\u2019s how it is; no wonder then.\u201cSorry, but after a period of time, I\u2019m going to leave Aurora City and head to Iron Blood City to join the army.\u201dMeng Quan smiled regretfully to Xiao Yu and Lin Zhuo.Iron Blood City, join the army?Duan Ling Tian was stupefied.Xiao Yu and Lin Zhuo were startled as well.The young geniuses looked at Meng Quan with gazes that seemed like they had seen a ghost.\u201cCould it be that Meng Quan wanted to enter the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp?\u201d\u201cAlthough Meng Quan\u2019s strength is pretty good, wanting to enter the Genius Camp seems to still be quite difficult\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, the Genius Camp test now only requires the age to be below nineteen, but the strength requirement is also extremely high. Allegedly, even a genius martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage might not be able to pass the test.\u201d\u201cThis Meng Quan is absolutely insane!\u201d\u2026\u2026Some of the young geniuses couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads, as they did not look favorably upon Meng Quan.Lin Zhuo\u2019s eyes stared fixedly at Mung Quan as he asked, \u201cMeng Quan, you plan to enter the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp?\u201d\u201cI plan to, but I don\u2019t know if I can pass the test. I heard that the Genius Camp test is extremely rigorous.\u201dMeng Quan smiled in a straightforward manner.\u201cIt\u2019s far more than just rigorous. According to the disciples of our Lin Clan who went and returned, the Genius Camp test is absolutely abnormal. In fact, in the past few years, there has hardly been any young geniuses of our Aurora City that were capable of passing the test and entering the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp.\u201dLin Zhuo heaved a sigh. \u201cUnfortunately, my father isn\u2019t willing to let me go, or else I would love to go and have a try.\u201dThe Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp was cutthroat.Allegedly, there were plenty of young geniuses that died in there every year.Lin Zhuo\u2019s expression turned serious as he said, \u201cBut if you can\u2019t pass the Genius Camp test, the door to our Lin Clan will always be open for you.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t willing to give up on a talent such as Meng Quan.\u201cOK.\u201dMeng Quan nodded and agreed.\u201cMeng Quan, when do you plan on leaving?\u201dSuddenly, Xiao Yu looked at Meng Quan. His eyes flashed with a thread of light.\u201cThe Genius Camp\u2019s yearly test is half a year away. I plan to leave in five months.\u201dMeng Quan smiled in a straightforward manner.\u201cIn five months, huh? At that time, come find me at the Xiao Clan. I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Xiao Yu said.\u201cYou\u2019re going as well?\u201dMeng Quan was stupefied.\u201cBig guy, brother Yu has been planning to enter the Genius Camp for months.\u201dXiao Yun grunted.\u201cYoung Master Yu wants to enter the Genius Camp?\u201dThe crowd of young geniuses present in the Star Observation Platform all looked at Xiao Yu in surprise.As far as they were concerned, Xiao Yu was the most outstanding genius disciple of the Xiao Clan in the past one hundred years. As long as he stayed in the Xiao Clan, becoming the Xiao Clan\u2019s Patriarch in the future was virtually a decided matter.But once he enters the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, then he will only have a slim chance of surviving!If they were Xiao Yu, they would definitely not take the risk.Even though the returns were great, that would rely upon being able to survive\u2026Once dead, everything is lost.\u201cOK, I\u2019ll go with you at that time. At least we can look after each other.\u201dMeng Quan smiled.Xiao Yu nodded, and his gaze moved on to descend upon Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian was just thinking about asking Li Fei what the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, but when he noticed Xiao Yu\u2019s gaze sweep over, his body jerked and he directly entered the arena to confront Xiao Yu.On the Star Observation platform, everyone\u2019s gazes descended on the two of them.Duan Ling Tian and Xiao Yu\u2019s battle will decided the first ranked on the Hidden Dragon List this year!\u201cDo you all think Duan Ling Tian is able to defeat Xiao Yu?\u201d\u201cHow could that be possible!? Although I admit Duan Ling Tian is extremely formidable, so much so that his natural talent isn\u2019t inferior to Young Master Yu\u2019s, but he is only sixteen after all\u2026 He\u2019s certainly unable to match Young Master Yu right now.\u201d\u201cYeah! I think so too.\u201d\u2026\u2026While the young geniuses discussed one by one.Duan Ling Tian moved.And Xiao Yu still stood on the spot, immovable like a mountain.Sword Drawing Arts!The first move Duan Ling Tian made was already his strongest technique.At the same time, above his head, three ancient mammoth silhouettes formed\u2026Battling Xiao Yu, he didn\u2019t hold back any longer!\u201cThree ancient mammoth silhouettes!\u201dThe surrounding young geniuses that were spectating were all struck dumb.A ninth level Body Tempering martial artist exerting the strength of three ancient mammoths.Looks like the rumors were all true.Whoosh!The violet sword shine mixed with a cold and fierce aura flashed straight towards Xiao Yu.Sleeve Dimension!Xiao Yu swung out his sleeve as his Origin Energy enveloped the sleeve, trying to roll up the flexible sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand.\u201cHumph!\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a smile.The hand that held the sword shook.Riiiip!The sword strike penetrated Xiao Yu\u2019s Origin Energy and pierced through his sleeve, tearing it apart.\u201cSpirit Weapon!\u201dAs Xiao Yu exclaimed, his expression distorted and he quickly retreated.Shadowless Drifting Light!Instantly, Xiao Yu created after imagers as he flashed in retreated, his speed swift to the limit, avoiding Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword strike.Above him, three ancient mammoth silhouettes slowly formed\u2026\u201cSpirit Weapon?\u201dEveryone on the Star Observation Platform was stupefied.This Duan Ling Tian actually had a Spirit Weapon.Wasn\u2019t he a Branch Family disciple of the Li Clan?After all, in the entire Li Clan, even a Main Clan disciple such as Li Qing didn\u2019t own a Spirit Weapon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your strength didn\u2019t seem like it received any amplification. Moreover, it would be impossible even for a Spirit Weapon to completely ignore my Origin Energy. What sword is that?\u201dAfter standing still, Xiao Yu had a brief expression of fear as he glanced at Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian nodded before answering, \u201cYou\u2019re right, my sword isn\u2019t a Spirit Weapon, but my sword contains a type of material that is able to ignore the Origin Energy of martial artists below the Origin Core Stage.\u201dThis was one of the special characteristics of Violet Meteorite.\u201cIgnore Origin Energy below the Origin Core Stage?\u201dDuan Ling Tian said it as if it was simple, but when it entered the ears of Xiao Yu and the other people that were present, it caused their scalps to go numb.Ignore Origin Energy below the Origin Core Stage.In other words, if Duan Ling Tian used this sword in an unexpected manner and made a preemptive strike against a ninth level Core Formation martial artist, if that person was slightly unguarded, it would be possible for him to die under Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword.\u201cThen I\u2019ll change a sword.\u201dDuan Ling Tian sheathed his sword and looked towards the weapons rack.\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary, I\u2019ll use a weapon.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head and proceeded to draw a long spear from the weapons rack. He jerked the long spear as his Origin Energy suffused it.\u201cCome!\u201dXiao Yu looked at Duan Ling Tian.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Sword Drawing Arts!The Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand was hard to get rid of as it followed like shadow, flashing straight towards Xiao Yu.Sleeve Dimension!Xiao Yu\u2019s long spear trembled as he swept it towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword. As the sword wobbled, it perfectly contained the force exertion of the Sleeve Dimension.Ka!A clear sound was heard.It was the sound of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword slicing Xiao Yu\u2019s long spear in half.Even if it was Fine Steel, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword would be able to slice through it, let alone the ordinary long spear in Xiao Yu\u2019s hands.\u201cLooks like I can\u2019t fight with you head on.\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s gaze concentrated as he flashed while holding the short spear.Shadowless Drifting Light!Executing his movement technique, Xiao Yu\u2019s speed was swift to the limit.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian noticed that even if he exerted his full strength, he actually wasn\u2019t able to come close to Xiao Yu\u2019s speed.\u201cHigh grade Profound Rank movement technique at the Perfection Stage!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled as he understood.He didn\u2019t expect that this Xiao Yu had actually cultivated both his high grade Profound Rank offensive martial skill and movement technique to the Perfection Stage.Even his high grade Profound Rank defensive martial skill was cultivated to the Mastery Stage.Such comprehension ability could be called monstrous!\u201cAmong the martial skills under the heaven, only speed is unbeatable! Duan Ling Tian, be careful, I\u2019m going to attack.\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s voice was cold.Duan Ling Tian was the only one today that could make him execute three types of martial skills, receiving the respect he deserved.Hearing what he said, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart sunk.He felt the pressure and started becoming vigilant.Sleeve Dimension!Xiao Yu flashed directly over like a bolt of lightning and appeared behind Duan Ling Tian. He swung out the broken spear in his hand to descend towards Duan Ling Tian\u2019s back.Just when he thought that Duan Ling Tian would be blasted flying by his spear strike.Whoosh!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body inclined flexibly like a spirit serpent, closely avoiding Xiao Yu\u2019s attack.\u201cYou have some skill!\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s eyes shone as his battle intent rose.Although Duan Ling Tian dodged Xiao Yu\u2019s attack, it still caused cold sweat to pour out.If it wasn\u2019t for the nervous reflex he developed as a member of the Special Forces in his previous life, he would\u2019ve been hit. It would have been extremely difficult for him to dodge Xiao Yu\u2019s attack by solely relying on his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, which was at the Mastery Stage.Subsequently, Xiao Yu attacked a few more times.Every time was an unexpected attack\u2026But he noticed instead that Duan Ling Tian was always able to closely dodge his attacks, causing him to be slightly doubtful.Did this Duan Ling Tian have an intuition that wasn\u2019t inferior to his?But he knew that after dodging his attacks with his nervous reflex so many times, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s nerves were fatigued to the extreme.Sleeve Dimension!Xiao Yu once again flashed behind Duan Ling Tian with a speed that was far faster than Duan Ling Tian\u2019s, his broken spear descending once again.\u201cAh!\u201dThis time, Duan Ling Tian, whose nerves hurt, couldn\u2019t restrain himself from shouting in alarm.And at this exact moment, his feet stomped on the ground and his entire body flew out, flashing far away, and causing Xiao Yu\u2019s attack to hit air.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dNoting the white glow that suffused Duan Ling Tian\u2019s legs, Xiao Yu was dumbstruck.\u201cIt\u2019s Origin Energy!\u201dOh my god! Duan Ling Tian broke through?\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian actually broke through during his battle with Xiao Yu and developed his Origin Energy\u2026 Unbelievable!\u201d\u2026\u2026Most of the people present were dumbstruck.\u201cHe broke through?\u201dLi Fei watched this scene and was struck dumb.\u201cI\u2019m afraid big brother is going to lose.\u201dA bitter smile appeared on the corners of Xiao Lan\u2019s mouth.Xiao Yun\u2019s beautiful eyebrows knit as she said, \u201cThis Duan Ling Tian is absolutely a freak!\u201d\u201cHaha! Xiao Yu, eat this!\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed loudly as the Origin Energy beneath his feet flickered and four ancient mammoth silhouettes dashed out from above him.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s current speed was even slightly faster than Xiao Yu\u2019s.Developing his Origin Energy under pressure and breaking through to the Core Formation Stage\u2026Even to Duan Ling Tian it was slightly unexpected.He originally thought that he still required a period of time before he could break through, but he didn\u2019t imagine that he would break through under such circumstances.In the end, he had to thank Xiao Yu.Om!Duan Ling Tian instantly arrived before Xiao Yu and slapped the flat side of his blade towards Xiao Yu.Sleeve Dimension.Xiao Yu knew that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s current speed was faster than his, so he could only choose to fight Duan Ling Tian head on.Luckily, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t use the blade of his sword.So it couldn\u2019t be considered to be relying upon weapons.But even so.Bang!The Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand slapped onto the broken spear in Xiao Yu\u2019s hand.Om!The broken spear started to tremble.Xiao Yu noticed that the force of his Sleeve Dimension had been completely destroyed.Only when a sharp pain came from his palm did Xiao Yu realize that his palm had split open from the force of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s sword strike. Fresh blood oozed out from it.\u201cI\u2019ve lost,\u201d Xiao Yu calmly said.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t happen to break through to the Core Formation Stage, then the one who lost would\u2019ve been me\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.\u201cLuck is also a part of strength.\u201dXiao Yu smiled.Duan Ling Tian had exerted the strength of four ancient mammoths, so even if Duan Ling Tian\u2019s movement technique was one stage lower than his, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed still firmly exceeded his speed.The extra strength of an ancient mammoth completely defeated the difference in a single stage of their high grade Profound Rank martial skills.\u201cDeveloping Origin Energy during battle and breaking through to the Core Formation Stage\u2026 Even this is possible?\u201dMany people were dumbstruck.Even now, they still couldn\u2019t react to the scene they witnessed earlier.Seeing Duan Ling Tian being suppressed by Xiao Yu, they all thought that Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on much longer.But who would have thought that Duan Ling Tian would develop his Origin Energy at that critical juncture?. Controlling the strength of four ancient mammoths, he launched a counterattack and suppressed Xiao Yu.Obtaining the final victory.\u201cGreat!\u201dOnly after reacting did they start cheering.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, this year\u2019s first rank in the Hidden Dragon List is something you fully deserve! As for the prizes, our Xiao Clan will personally send them to you later on.\u201dXiao Yu nodded to Duan Ling Tian.Losing to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength of four ancient mammoths, he acknowledged his defeat.But in his heart, a towering battle intent still arose.Once he breaks through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage, he will surely invite Duan Ling Tian to battle.\u201cThanks.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled as he nodded.Suddenly, Xiao Yu asked, \u201cRight, I have a question; I wonder if you\u2019re able to answer it for me.\u201d\u201cYou want to ask me why I can possess the strength of three ancient mammoths when only at the ninth level of the Body Tempering Stage, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.Xiao Yu nodded, he was slightly surprised in his heart at Duan Ling Tian wisdom.\u201cWhen I went to the Misty Forest the other day, I found a type of Spirit Fruit. After consuming it, I noticed that my fleshly body underwent a metamorphosis and had an extra strength of two ancient mammoths out of thin air.\u201dDuan Ling Tian explained.He naturally didn\u2019t disclose anything about the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique and casually found an excuse.Moreover, in the Cloud Continent, there indeed was a similar Spirit Fruit.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. Your luck is really good\u2026 But being able to break through to the Core Formation Stage at the age of sixteen, the natural talent you\u2019ve revealed right now, even in the entire Aurora City\u2019s past hundred years, you\u2019re still the first.\u201dXiao Yu glanced deeply at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cBeing able to break through today was all thanks to you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.If he wasn\u2019t under the pressure that Xiao Yu gave him, it would have been impossible for him to directly complete his breakthrough.\u201cIn other words, you owe me a favor?\u201dXiao Yu grabbed on to the opportunity.\u201cYou can say so.\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t deny it.\u201cThen tonight I\u2019ll entertain you and Li Fei. You won\u2019t decline, right?\u201d Xiao Yu asked.\u201cThat would depend on her.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards Li Fei.Li Fei was just walking over when she heard Duan Ling Tian. Her angel-like face blushed and her heart slightly trembled\u2026Recalling the bet she made with Duan Ling Tian earlier, she wished she could dig a hole and hide in it.\u201cThen we\u2019ll have something before returning.\u201dLi Fei nodded.Subsequently, Xiao Yu invited the two brothers Lin Zhuo and Lin Qi, as well as Meng Quan.Besides Meng Quan, who was in a hurry to return, Lin Zhuo and Lin Qi stayed behind.The other people, on the other hand, returned home. They weren\u2019t qualified to receive an invitation from Xiao Yu.Today\u2019s youth gathering came to an end.This year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List ranking was released.First, Duan Ling Tian.Second, Xiao Yu.Third, Lin Zhuo.Fourth, Meng Quan.Fifth, Li Qing.Sixth, Li An.Seventh and eighth were tied by Li Fei and Xiao Lan.Ninth and tenth were tied by Xiao Yun and Lin Qi.That night, Xiao Yu held a banquet in a large courtyard.Besides Duan Ling Tian, Li Fei, Lin Zhuo, and Lin Qi, there was only Xiao Yu, Xiao Lan, and Xiao Yun.During the banquet, Xiao Yu asked Lin Zhuo, \u201cLin Zhuo, your strength isn\u2019t inferior to Meng Quan\u2019s. Why don\u2019t you try participating in the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp test?\u201dHearing what he said, Lin Zhuo smiled bitterly. \u201cXiao Yu, I want to go, but my father wouldn\u2019t let me. Even you know that it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t pass the Genius Camp test, but if I do pass the test and enter the Genius Camp, then I will only have a slim chance of surviving. I\u2019m not afraid, but my father isn\u2019t willing to let me take the risk.\u201cIn a person\u2019s lifetime, there will naturally not be a lack of hardships and dangers. I, however, feel that this is an opportunity for me.\u201dXiao Yu\u2019s gaze flickered full of yearning.Lin Zhuo had a strange gaze as he asked, \u201cYour grandfather was actually willing to let you go?\u201d\u201cOn this point, he was much more open-minded than your father, but even if he didn\u2019t allow it, I would still go\u2026 Aurora City isn\u2019t the stage I yearn for. If I continue to stay in Aurora City, I will only follow in my grandfather\u2019s footsteps, and the Nascent Soul Stage will be my final achievement before waiting for death to take me. Maybe it was because he has experienced this that he didn\u2019t stop me.\u201dXiao Yu laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is it all about?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked out the question that had been bothering him.\u201cYou don\u2019t know about the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp?\u201dLin Qin looked at Duan Ling Tian as if looking at an alien.\u201cIs it that strange?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed.After a moment, after hearing the explanation from Lin Zhuo, Duan Ling Tian finally knew what sort of place the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius camp was.The Iron Blood Army was a formidable army under the command of the Crimson Sky Kingdom, garrisoned in Iron Blood City at the border.The officers of the Iron Blood Army are allegedly able to win one against ten fights with unstoppable might.Whereas the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, on the other hand, was a standalone army camp that gathered young geniuses and was directly under the control of the Imperial Family.In the Imperial City of the Crimson Sky Kingdom, there was a Paladin Academy.As long as a student graduates from the academy, practically all of them are conferred with some sort of official appointment, respectively conferred an area of land, and end up becoming a noble.At that time, they would need to say the word, and it would be enough to completely annihilate factions such as the three great clans of Aurora City.In the entire Crimson Sky Kingdom, there were numerous small cities similar to Aurora City.And factions similar to the three great clans were even more numerous.Paladin Academy\u2019s entry threshold was extremely high.Besides disciples of the Royal Family and the outstanding disciples of the few eminent families being able to directly enter the academy, if an ordinary person wanted to enter the academy, then they would have to go through a brutal test just to obtain the qualifications to enter the academy.The Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp was precisely one these numerous brutal tests.The Genius Camp was a special training camp that lasted a year.Only those who survive through the special training have the qualification to become one of the students at Paladin Academy.In the past thirty years, there have been nearly a hundred disciples of Aurora City\u2019s three great clans that passed the test and entered the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp.However, these people all died without exception in the course of the Genius Camp\u2019s special training.Hence, one can see the brutality of the Genius Camp.Allegedly, only 10% of the young geniuses gathered by the Genius Camp are able to survive the year.Since the beginning, there has been a saying: \u2018Nine die, one lives, Genius Camp\u2019.A youth genius without a certain level of strength, confidence, and courage would fundamentally not dare to enter the Genius Camp.Once you\u2019ve entered the Genius Camp, you will be confronted with only two paths.The first, die!The second, achieve greatness!\u201cImperial City\u2026Paladin Academy.\u201dDuan Ling Tian started pondering.The Duan Clan was at the Imperial City. According to what his mother said, the Duan Clan should be one of the eminent families in the Imperial City.The Duan Clan, the day he went there would eventually come.He only had one reason.To take Duan Ling Xing\u2019s life!That day, Duan Ling Xing injured Ke Er and heavily injured Li Xuan, already completely enraging him.\u201cMaybe this is an opportunity.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed.Maybe because of his experience having a military career in his previous life, it caused Duan Ling Tian to have a sense of intimacy towards the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp.Xiao Yu looked at Duan Ling Tian as he asked, \u201cSo how about it, Duan Ling Tian? Are you interested?\u201d\u201cYou and Meng Quan said earlier that the Genius Camp\u2019s test was in half a year\u2019s time?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.\u201cYes, but if you want to go, then you must leave one month in advance\u2026 Because from our Aurora City to Iron Blood City, even if you travel at top speed, you will still need to spend close to a month,\u201d Xiao Yu slowly said.\u201cIf you want to go, you can go with me and Meng Quan,\u201d Xiao Yu continued.Duan Ling Tian lightly nodded, but he didn\u2019t say if he would go or not.\u201cNo rush, there\u2019s still another five months to go.\u201dXiao Yu shook his head and smiled.The group of youths and young girls enjoyed themselves and the banquet soon approached its end.\u201cRight, Duan Ling Tian, you cut off Li Qing\u2019s finger today. Even if it can be connected back in time, at least half of his Dark Nether Finger will probably be crippled\u2026 Li Qing is brainless and thus there\u2019s nothing to fear from him. But his grandfather, the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder, is a prominent figure, so you must be careful.\u201dAs Xiao Yu and his sister personally sent Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group out of the Xiao Clan Estate, Xiao Yu had a serious expression as he warned Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThanks for the warning.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Looking at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group leaving from afar, Xiao Yu turned around to look at his sister, Xiao Lan.Xiao Lan\u2019s clear and beautiful eyes emitted a strange lustre.\u201cLan, interested?\u201dXiao Yu had a faint smile on his face.\u201cBig Brother, what are you talking about?\u201dXiao Lan\u2019s cheeks were bright red, then she turned around and left in embarrassment.Xiao Yu laughed loudly. Every young girl thought of love, so he didn\u2019t mind.Moreover, Duan Ling Tian was indeed outstanding. It was no wonder that his sister, who had extremely high expectations, would be interested.On the way back to Aurora City, Lin Zhuo suggested, \u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you want to go to the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, I suggest you go after a year or two\u2026 You are different from Xiao Yu and Meng Quan. If they don\u2019t go this time, then they\u2019ll forever not have the chance. But you are just sixteen, even if you don\u2019t go this time, you still have two more chances.\u201dThe Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp only recruited youth geniuses below the age of nineteen.Duan Ling Tian lightly nodded but neither indicated consent nor dissent.They quickly arrived at Aurora City.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, if you need any help in the future, you can look for us in the Lin Clan\u2026 As long as it\u2019s within my ability, I will absolutely not decline.\u201dBefore going their own ways, Lin Zhuo lightly smiled to Duan Ling Tian.\u201cYeah, we are friends. You don\u2019t have to be courteous to us,\u201d Lin Qi said.\u201cSure!\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled amicably to the two of them.He could be considered to be friends with Lin Zhuo and Lin Qi. Their friendship was made from the exchange of blows.They appreciated their own kind.\u201cYou\u2019ve broken through to the Core Formation Stage now. Can you treat my grandfather yet?\u201dOn the way back to the Li Clan Estate, Li Fei gazed at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cYes, my dear wifey.\u201dDuan Ling Tian answered in all seriousness.\u201cWhat\u2019s a wifey?\u201dLi Fei was dazed.\u201cIt means wife. It\u2019s the way we say it in the small towns at the countryside.\u201dOnly now did Duan Ling Tian realize he misspoke. In this world, there was no such thing as wifey.\u201cPei! Who\u2019s your wife?\u201dLi Fei blushed.\u201cMy good wife, have you forgotten about our agreement?\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and wrapped his arm around Li Fei\u2019s slender figure. A soft and supple feeling entered his hand.Li Fei\u2019s delicate figure trembled and was slightly stiff, but she didn\u2019t resists as she lightly said, \u201cHurry up and let go; there are people ahead.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed loudly and stopped teasing her. \u201cOK, tomorrow morning I\u2019ll come to your house to see you and grandfather. I\u2019m quite tired today, so I need to return and take a good night\u2019s sleep.After returning to the Li Clan Estate and sending Li Fei back home, only then did Duan Ling Tian return home.At the moment he entered the courtyard, he noticed the young girl sitting in front of a table with an exhausted appearance. She was dozing off\u2026The table was filled with food.\u201cKe Er\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian felt an ache in his heart. He could guess that Ke Er had most certainly waited for him the entire night.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dKe Er heard some sounds and rubbed her eyes in a daze, then she abruptly stood up in shock and brought Duan Ling Tian to the table. \u201cMadam said you surely had eaten outside, but I still made some food. Young Master, have you eaten?\u201d\u201cSilly girl, I haven\u2019t eaten, and I\u2019m indeed hungry right now. Come, eat with me.\u201dDuan Ling Tian sat down, and accompanied by the young girl, he cleaned all the food on the table.\u201dEven though at the end he was overly full, there was only warmth which flowed through Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart.No matter what, this was Ke Er\u2019s feelings.He wasn\u2019t willing to disappoint her.Seeing Duan Ling Tian finishing all the food, Ke Er had a satisfied expression on her face. After clearing up the tableware, she notified Duan Ling Tian and was prepared to return to her room and sleep.\u201cKe Er, sleep in my room tonight. I want to cuddle with you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian took a deep breath as he looked at the young girl.The young girl was panic-stricken and her cheeks blushed, but she still lightly nodded.Lying on the bed, smelling the pure and fresh virgin\u2019s fragrance off the young girl, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s lower regions were hot and reacted.But he didn\u2019t take it a step further, only embracing the young girl with one hand holding the budding flower on her chest, laying there contently.\u201cYoung\u2026Young Master\u2026\u201dThe young girl\u2019s delicate body slightly trembled.She could feel a burning hard object pushing up against her from behind.\u201cKe Er, go to sleep.\u201dEmbracing the young girl, smelling the young girl\u2019s fragrant hair, Duan Ling Tian fell soundly asleep.He wasn\u2019t Liu Xia Hui[1], but a man that was full of vigor and vitality.However, the young girl was still young after all, so he was reluctant to take her at this moment.If the young girl in his embrace was Li Fei, he would disregard everything and pounce on her, to claim her and vent out to his heart\u2019s content.Hearing the sound of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s steady breathing, the young girl let out a breath of air as she relaxed. Her face emitted a smile of happiness.The next day, close to noon, Duan Ling Tian awoke.\u201cNot good!\u201dOnly now did Duan Ling Tian recall the agreement he made with Li Fei.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dAt this moment, the young girl in his embrace was roused from her sleep because of him.\u201cKe Er, if you\u2019re still sleepy, then sleep for a while longer.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the young girl a hug and kissed her on the forehead before getting off the bed and putting on some clothes.The young girl followed him off the bed and put on her clothes before leaving the room together with Duan Ling Tian.Who knew that the moment they opened the room door, they saw the hot-bodied young girl standing in the courtyard who just happened to look over.\u201cYou\u2026You two\u2026\u201dSeeing the scene in front of her, Li Fei was so angry that she was at a loss for words.\u201cBig Sister Fei Fei.\u201dKe Er greeted Li Fei before running back to her own room in embarrassment.Duan Ling Tian, on the other hand, had a natural expression as he looked at Li Fei. \u201cLittle Fei, let\u2019s go. I was really too tired yesterday and accidentally overslept.\u201dAccidentally?Li Fei\u2019s eyes seemed to be on the verge of emitting fire, but when she thought of how she needed Duan Ling Tian to treat her grandfather, she endured it.Walking out of the courtyard with Li Fei, Duan Ling Tian could still feel the smell of gunpowder that surrounded him.He shook his head and smiled.She really was overly jealous.\u201cYou\u2026You two, last night\u2026\u201dEventually, Li Fei couldn\u2019t hold back.\u201cYou want to ask me what we did last night, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as if he could see through Li Fei\u2019s thoughts.Li Fei didn\u2019t say anything, but her expression said it all.\u201cHeh, when can my Ke Er grow up to become like you? If it were you, I wouldn\u2019t have had to suppress the fire in me and sleep through the night.\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh as he sized up Li Fei\u2019s hot figure in an unrestrained manner. \u201cLittle Fei, why don\u2019t you sleep with me tonight?\u201d\u201cPei! Ask your Ke Er to sleep with you.\u201dLi Fei made a spitting sound, but her expression eased up slightly.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Google this name if you want to find out about itPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a weapons craftsman, you should have one, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian blinked his eyes as a trace of cunning flashed within.\u201cKid, you\u2019re actually having ideas about my things. I do indeed have a Cauldron, and it\u2019s even a Grade Eight Spirit Weapon. Are you really capable of refining medicinal pills?\u201dThe old man\u2019s eye emitted a sense of doubt.Duan Ling Tian continued with no nonsense; he directly lifted his hand, with his palm facing upwards, circulating his Origin Energy.In the next moment, as if he was possessed by the Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2026Duan Ling Tian skillfully transformed his Origin Energy into a milky white flame.It was precisely a Grade Nine Pill Fire.The grade of an alchemist was judged based on the grade of the Pill Fire.\u201cThis\u2026This is a Grade Nine Pill Fire! You really are a little freak that nobody can see through.\u201dThe old man gave Duan Ling Tian a deep glance. \u201cIf you can really refine a medicinal pill, than can uproot my hidden injuries. I might as well gift that Cauldron to you!\u201d\u201cGrandfather, isn\u2019t that Cauldron something that your teacher left behind for you?\u201dLi Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows frowned. She knew the meaning of that Cauldron to her grandfather.\u201cGrandfather, since that Cauldron has a special meaning to you, then it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just casually refine a Cauldron myself to play with.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled at the old man, unwilling to take away his prized possession.\u201cForget about that. That Cauldron is my master\u2019s peak creation. Leaving it in my hands will only be wasting such a valuable item. It would be better off giving off its splendor in your hands\u2026But kid, you said that you would casually refine a Cauldron to play with? Don\u2019t tell me you can condense a Weapon Flame as well.\u201dThe old man had a strange expression.Hiss!The Pill Fire on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s palm distorted and become more destructive. Instantly, the air in the seemed to become hotter.\u201cGrade Nine Weapon Flame!\u201dAs a weapons craftsman, the old man naturally was able to differentiate between the Pill Fire and Weapon Flame.The Pill Fire was more restrained.The Weapon Flame was more destructive and unrestrained.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201dThe old man\u2019s breathing became hurried, slightly unable to catch his breath.Condensing Pill Fire or Weapon Flame out of Origin Energy was something that even someone with a high natural talent would require years of painstaking cultivation to achieve.But the violet-clothed youth in front of him completely overturned what he knew about alchemists and weapons craftsmen.Years ago, he spent a whole five years before he was able to successfully condense his Weapon Flame.But even then, his teacher said that he had outstanding natural talent.\u201cGrandfather, don\u2019t get agitated.\u201dDuan Ling Tian withdrew his Weapon Flame and smiled.Li Fei had long since been struck dumb. Although she wasn\u2019t an alchemist or weapons craftsman, as she followed by her grandfather\u2019s side since a young age, she was imbued with the knowledge she saw and heard.She knew how difficult it was to become a graded alchemist or weapons craftsman.But now, what happened before her very eyes utterly overturned everything her grandfather had once said.\u201cI have really wasted my life all these years.\u201dThe old man finally caught his breath and had a bitter smile.Duan Ling Tian quickly diverted the topic. \u201cGrandfather, the medicinal pill I want to refine for you includes some medicinal materials that are fairly rare, so ordinary medicine stores wouldn\u2019t sell them\u2026 Is there a Alchemist Guild in Aurora City?\u201dAs he spoke, his gaze descended upon the other crest beside the Li Clan\u2019s crest on the old man\u2019s chest.He recognized it.That was the Grade Nine Weapons Craftsman Crest of the Weapons Craftsmen Guild.Relying on this crest, no matter where one goes in the entire Cloud Continent, they would still be able to receive treatment that was extremely good.He still remembered that the Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Branch Family\u2019s Grand Elder, Li Huo, had the Alchemist Guild\u2019s crest on his chest at all times to indicate his status as a Grade Nine Alchemist.\u201cYou want to buy medicinal materials from the Alchemist Guild?\u201dThe old man frowned slightly. \u201cAccording to what I know, the medicinal materials in the Alchemist Guild can\u2019t be exchanged for money and must be exchanged for with the Alchemist Guild\u2019s points.\u201cI know of this.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.What a joke.Years ago, Rebirth Martial Emperor was the only Royal Grade Alchemist in the entire Cloud Continent.And he even was the Honorary Guild Master of the Alchemist Guild\u2019s Headquarters.He was extremely clear about the workings of the Alchemist Guild.If one wanted to obtain the Alchemist Guild\u2019s points, then one must provide a contribution to the Alchemist Guild, such as completing the assignments posted by the Alchemist Guild.Contributing some sort of rare medicinal material would also result in generous points.The old man gave Duan Ling Tian an address.Duan Ling Tian left the Li Clan Estate.Li Fei curiously followed along.\u201cThis run-down place is the Alchemist Guild?\u201dAfter arriving at the end of a small alley and looking at the condemned building that looked like it would fall at any moment, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth twitched.But in the next moment, what Li Fei said cause Duan Ling Tian to be completely speechless.\u201cNot bad, it\u2019s slightly better than the Weapons Craftsmen Guild.\u201dLi Fei looked at the condemned building and judged.Duan Ling Tian could only imagine how Aurora City\u2019s Weapons Craftsmen Guild would undoubtedly be in an even more terrible state\u2026When he walked in the Alchemist Guild, it was completely different to what he expected.Although the hall was old and worn out, it was very simple and clean.When they entered, besides the young girl behind the counter, there wasn\u2019t anybody else.The two of them walked to the counter.\u201cCustomers, may I ask if you want to post an assignment or collect the medicinal pills that you entrusted to our Alchemist Guild to refine?\u201dThe young girl had an ordinary appearance but was very animated. She had a pair of big eyes that were brimming with vigor.Ordinary people were able to post assignments in the Alchemist Guild by means of monetary payments and entrust the Alchemist Guild to refine the medicinal pill required.These assignments would be put up by the Alchemist Guild and offered to the alchemists of the Alchemist Guild to take on. The rewards of these assignments would be then converted to the Alchemist Guild points.These points were useless to ordinary people, but to an alchemist, they were extremely valuable.Sometimes, some alchemists would even spend large sums of money to post assignments which they would then complete themselves as a way to earn points.This was equivalent to using money in exchange for points.In the Alchemists Guild, according to the rules, money was restricted from being directly converted into points.But the proverbs were indeed correct.While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs ten!\u201cI\u2019ve come to register as a Grade Nine Alchemist.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he proclaimed the reason of his arrival.\u201cRegister as a Grade Nine Alchemist?\u201dThe young girl was stunned. She thought that she had heard wrong.This youth that looked even younger than her wanted to register as a Grade Nine Alchemist?Let alone that fact that a Grade Nine Alchemist must be a Core Formation Stage martial artist, even if this youth\u2019s natural talent in the Martial Dao and Alchemy was any better, it would still at least require spending a few years of bitter cultivation to condense the Origin Energy into Pill Fire after breaking through to the Core Formation Stage.This was the iron law of the Cloud Continent!Duan Ling Tian frowned as he asked, \u201cWhat, you\u2019re not in charge?\u201d\u201cCustomer, wait a moment. I\u2019ll go get the Guild Master.\u201dAlthough the young girl felt it to be inconceivable, he was a customer after all, and she wasn\u2019t able to differentiate the truth of the matter, so she could only get Aurora City\u2019s Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master.The young girl returned with an old man after a short moment.The old man wan brimming with energy and vigor and his eyes shone with a shrewd light.\u201cWho wants to register as a Grade Nine Alchemist?\u201dThe old man\u2019s gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei and his brows slightly furrowed.\u201cMe!\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the old man.The old man frowned as he shouted in a low voice, \u201cYou? Where did this little kid come from? Hurry up and go home, this isn\u2019t the place to joke around!\u201d\u201cGeezer, how could you not have any manners?\u201dLi Fei couldn\u2019t stand by and watch anymore.\u201cHumph! What manners does a little girl like you know about? The two of you coming here to joke around, this is called manners? For a moment there I even thought that Aurora City had a new Alchemist, but I never imagined that it would turn out to be two kids who came to make a ruckus.\u201dAs he finished speaking, the old man was slightly ashamed and irritated.\u201cGeezer, nothing is absolute. Don\u2019t always look at the surface of things.\u201dDuan Ling Tian swept the old man with his indifferent gaze.As he finished speaking, he turned his palm upwards and a milky white Pill Fire jumped about on it.The old man and young girl were both dumbstruck.A Grade Nine Pill Fire, it wasn\u2019t something they hadn\u2019t seen before\u2026But it appearing in a sixteen-year-old youths hand was something they saw for the first time.\u201cKid, do you have a master?\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes shone. His attitude took a 360 degree turn as he looked at Duan Ling Tian as if looking at a treasure.\u201cWhat nonsense! If I didn\u2019t have a master, would I be able to become a Grade Nine Alchemist at such an age?\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave the old man a disdainful glance.He naturally was aware of the old man getting ideas of wanting to take him as a disciple.But as far as he was concerned, a mere Grade Eight Alchemist didn\u2019t have the qualifications to be his teacher at all.The old man\u2019s expression froze for a moment and briefly had embarrassment on it.The old man quickly helped Duan Ling Tian register and passed a Grade Nine Alchemist Crest and a Crystal Card to Duan Ling Tian.The Crystal Card was the Alchemist Guild\u2019s exclusive point card.Duan Ling Tian could see that the remaining points inside were zero when he circulated his Origin Energy into the Crystal Card.The old man looked at Duan Ling Tian and could not regain his senses for an extremely long time.A sixteen-year-old Grade Nine Alchemist\u2026He suddenly felt that for all these years, the hidden bitterness he had accumulated for being sent to this desolate place had suddenly slightly dissipated.\u201cRight, geezer, I need some materials,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cKid, I\u2019m not some geezer, I\u2019m Aurora City\u2019s Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master, Su Mo\u2026 As for the materials you need, sure, as long as you can complete an assignment or contribute a medicinal formula, you can exchange them for some points and buy what you want with those points.\u201dSu Mo glared at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHmph! Then I\u2019ll post some assignments now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian withdrew a stack of silver bills.\u201cKid, I have to warn you. When it comes to the assignments that are posted by customers in the Alchemist Guild, I as the Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master have the authority to take priority when accepting these assignments, so if you want to exchange for points with money, you better forget it.\u201dThe corners of Su Mo\u2019s mouth curled into a ridiculing smile as if he had Duan Ling Tian in the palm of his hand.\u201cGeezer, you\u2019re really shameless!\u201dHearing what Su Mo said, Li Fei couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said this on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s behalf.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m just abiding by the rules of the Alchemist Guild.\u201dThe corners of Su Mo\u2019s curled into a complacent simile.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Fei was flustered.\u201cLittle Fei, you don\u2019t have to get angry with an old man\u2026 The old man\u2019s heart isn\u2019t well; if you accidently anger him until he faints, we will have to compensate a lot of money.\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and held on to Li Fei\u2019s jade-like hand. He rubbed her palm to make her feel at ease.Li Fei took a deep breath and looked at Duan Ling Tian with a puzzled expression.Duan Ling Tian looked at Su Mo, whose expression froze for a moment. The corners of his mouth had a slight smile.Wanting to steal his business?\u201cHelp me register. I want to post an assignment.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young girl beside Su Mo.The young girl was slightly hesitant and looked to the old man.\u201cHe\u2019s currently a customer of our Alchemist Guild. Pass the assignment over to me once you\u2019ve registered it.\u201dSu Mo nodded to the young girl.But in a short moment, when he heard the assignment Duan Ling Tian posted, the smile on his face completely froze.\u201c10,000 silver, refine three Phosphorus Flame Pills.\u201dPhosphorus Flame Pill?What medicinal pill was that?He had never heard of such a medicinal pill.\u201cGeezer, according to the Alchemist Guild\u2019s rules, if a alchemist can refine the medicinal pill required by an assignment, he can get an advance on the points required to buy the medicinal materials. They can then deduct the points from the assignment\u2019s reward once it is completed\u2026 I\u2019m not wrong, am I?\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave Su Mo a deep glance.Su Mo felt slightly depressed.There indeed was such a rule.Su Mo unwillingly took out the medicinal materials Duan Ling Tian required, also arranging a quiet room for Duan Ling Tian.\u201cGeezer, you won\u2019t mind lending your Cauldron to me for a while, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian blinked his eyes, causing the corners of Su Mo\u2019s mouth to twitch.\u201cLending is not a problem, but I have to ask for 10 points from you.\u201dSu Mo took a deep breath.This kid, as an alchemist, he actually had to borrow a Cauldron from another\u2026Really unprofessional!\u201c10 points?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. \u201cThis 10,000 silver assignment seems to be only worth 100 points, right? And the materials you gave me, how many points do they require?\u201d\u201cNot much, 30 points.\u201dWhen Su Mo noticed the frown on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face, his tense face finally had a slight smile on it.\u201cYou\u2019re really shady\u2026But you better not regret it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian received the Cauldron from Su Mo and gave Su Mo a deep glance. Only then did he take Li Fei and enter the silent room and closed the door behind him.\u201cRegret? What do I have to regret?\u201dSu Mo paid no attention to it.In the quiet room.Duan Ling Tian shook the Cauldron in his hand and nodded. \u201cThat geezer is crafty, but his Cauldron is indeed not bad and can be considered top quality among Grade Eight Spirit Weapons.\u201dAlchemists had many requirements of their Cauldrons when they refined medicinal pills.For example, a Grade Nine Alchemist required the use of a Grade Nine Spirit Weapon or above Cauldron to guarantee the Cauldron wouldn\u2019t be melted by the Pill Fire.A Grade Eight Alchemist would require a Grade Eight Spirit Weapon or above Cauldron.So on and so forth.The higher the alchemist\u2019s grade, the higher their requirement towards their Cauldron.\u201cYou said you wanted to make that geezer be regretful?\u201dLi Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian curiously.\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled mysteriously.After putting the Cauldron on the stone platform in the quiet room, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s palm burned with a milky white Pill Fire, then he opened the Cauldron cover and placed the Pill fire within.At the same time, Duan Ling Tian started putting the materials in one by one.Refining medicinal pills was particular about the order in which medicinal materials were added in, as well as the amount.A small discrepancy could lead to a great error!After that was the control of the Pill Fire.When Duan Ling Tian finished putting all of the materials into the Cauldron, he covered the Cauldron.His Origin Energy jumped about in his palms and condensed into Pill Fire, he then put his hands on the two air vents of the Cauldron and sent the Pill Fire in, starting to refine the medicinal pill with a Pill Fire of high strength.The string of moments were completed like flowing water as if it was a performance by an alchemist with abundant experience.Li Fei, who was standing at the side, was completely stupefied as she watched.\u201cIs he really only sixteen?\u201dLI Fei\u2019s heart shook. Everything this youth in front of her was completely not something a sixteen-year-old youth should be capable of.She felt the youth to be even more mysterious.She had an unfathomable feeling.One hour later.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands jerked as his Pill Fire increased explosively, rushing into the Cauldron.Pill Harvest!Instantly, three medicinal pills that flickered with a crimson brilliance flew out from the opening in the side of the Cauldron, falling into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand.\u201cMy first time refining medicinal pills seems to be not bad\u2026 The purity is over 90%.\u201dLooking at the medicinal pills, Duan Ling Tian laughed in satisfaction.Even if they were refining the same medicinal pill, every alchemist\u2019s completed product would have a difference.A difference in purity!The lesser the impurities within the medicinal pill, the better the medicinal effect of the medicinal pill would be.If it was a Phosphorous Flame Pill refined by an ordinary Grade Nine Alchemist, the purity would not exceed 60%.For example, Fresh Breeze Town\u2019s Li Branch Family\u2019s Grand Elder, the Thunder Flame Pill he refined only had a purity of a little over 50%, so the medicinal effect was reduced significantly.The Phosphorous Flame Pill was precisely the medicinal pill he refined for Li Fei\u2019s grandfather.Based on Li Fei\u2019s grandfather\u2019s current circumstances, only a Phosphorous Flame Pill with a purity of over 80% would be able to completely uproot his hidden injuries.Therefore, Duan Ling Tian could only refine a high purity medicinal pill by himself.Purity of above 90%!Any alchemist would be aware of how rare this level of purity was.Therefore, when Duan Ling Tian took the Phosphorous Flame Pill to collect the assignment\u2019s points, Su Mo\u2019s expression was abnormally marvelous.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dPicking up the Phosphorous Flame Pill, Su Mo\u2019s gaze trembled.Although he had never heard of the Phosphorous Flame Pill, nor did he know its use, at this moment he could use the perception of a Grade Eight Alchemist to notice how extraordinary this medicinal pill was.Based on his rough estimate, this Phosphorous Flame Pill had a purity of at least 90%.What sort of concept was this?As an alchemist, he naturally understood.Even a Grade One Alchemist of Cloud Continent would not necessarily be able to increase the purity to such a level when refining a Grade Nine Medicinal Pill.After all, on a similar medicinal pill, a purity of 60% and 90% was absolutely like the difference between heaven and earth.The medicinal effect was completely not on the same level.\u201cKid, how did you do it?\u201dSu Mo looked at Duan Ling Tian in a slightly agitated manner.\u201cI casually refined it and it just happened\u2026 How about it? It\u2019s not bad, right? This is the first time I\u2019m refining a medicinal pill since breaking through to the Core Formation Stage yesterday.\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at Su Mo before grinning, revealing a set of white teeth.Broke through to the Core Formation Stage yesterday?First time refining a medicinal pill?Hearing this, the corners of Su Mo\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cDon\u2019t joke around.\u201dSu Mo frowned.\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201dDuan Ling Tian spread out his hands with an innocent expression.\u201cI can bear witness.\u201dNoticing how Su Mo looked right now, Li Fei\u2019s mood was exceptional and her beautiful face had a trace of a smile. \u201cYesterday, in the youth gathering hosted in the Xiao Clan Estate, numerous youth geniuses of Aurora City saw him break through with their own two eyes\u2026 Also, on this year\u2019s new Hidden Dragon List, he\u2019s ranked at the top.\u201dRanked first in the Hidden Dragon List?Su Mo\u2019s pupils constricted.He has been in Aurora City for a few years, so he had naturally heard of how the Aurora City young geniuses had a ranking called Hidden Dragon List.The young geniuses who could be ranked on the Hidden Dragon List were all extremely outstanding figures.\u201cI remember that the Xiao Clan\u2019s Xiao Yu obtained the second rank in the Hidden Dragon List last year when he was seventeen\u2026 This year, could it be that he still lost to this kid?\u201dSu Mo glanced at Li Fei before looking at Duan Ling Tian with a shocked expression.Li Fei\u2019s beautiful eyes slightly moved as she slowly said, \u201cYes, this time Xiao Yu is still the second.\u201dSu Mo exhaled out a breath of cold air.A sixteen-year-old Core Formation martial artist was more than enough to shock him.A sixteen-year-old Grade Nine Alchemist was even more shocking to him.But even all this wasn\u2019t the end\u2026First it was the over 90% purity medicinal pill.Then it was the first in the Hidden Dragon List.This violet-clothed youth, what kind of freak was he?Even in the entire Crimson Sky Kingdom, he had never once heard of such a freak.Duan Ling Tian!Su Mo deeply remembered in his heart the name which the youth revealed during his registration.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dThe young girl behind the counter returned the Crystal Card to Duan Ling Tian.Balance, 60 points.\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201dDuan Ling Tian snatched the Phosphorous Flame Pill back from Su Mo\u2019s hands and called Li Fei.Seeing Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei about to walk out the door, Su Mo couldn\u2019t help but call out, \u201cWait!\u201d\u201cIs there something else?\u201dDuan Ling Tian turned around and looked at him with a spurious smile.\u201cYou said earlier that you hoped I wouldn\u2019t regret it\u2026 I want to know, what did you mean?\u201d Su Mo inquired.If it was before, he would pay no attention to what Duan Ling Tian had said.But once he experienced how miraculous Duan Ling Tian was, he had to treat him seriously.\u201cActually it\u2019s not a big deal. I just noticed that you\u2019ve been trying to break through to become a Grade Seven Alchemist, but you seem to have diverted off the right path. Originally, with your current foundation, you could perfectly break through to become a Grade Seven Alchemist. Such a pity.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as he smiled.Su Mo\u2019s face instantly turned black.Even this was considered to be not a big deal?At this moment, he even felt that Duan Ling Tian had done it on purpose.\u201cOK, Geezer, I still have things to do, so I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian waved his hand and was about to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dSu Mo once again stopped Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThere\u2019s still something else?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned and was slightly impatient.But if one looked at closely, it could be noticed that deep within his eyes was a hidden smiling expression.\u201cYou have a way?\u201d Su Mo asked. His breathing had become slightly hurried.\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian gave a straightforward answer.\u201cWhat are your conditions?\u201dSu Mo didn\u2019t mince his words as he asked with a pained expression. He knew that based on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s earlier attitude, he probably would have to bleed for it.\u201cI won\u2019t be greedy, I only want half the points in your Crystal Card.\u201dDuan Ling Tian grinned.Even that wasn\u2019t considered greedy?That was the points he had accumulated for half his lifetime\u2026The corners of Su Mo\u2019s mouth twitched and he secretly thought, \u201cLittle fox.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dBut Su Mo still decisively agreed upon his conditions and his gaze descended unto Duan Ling Tian. \u201cBut I want to examine the goods first before I give you the points.\u201d\u201cWhat, you\u2019re scared I\u2019ll cheat you? Then forget it; we don\u2019t owe each other anything.\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and grabbed Li Fei\u2019s hand before walking away with quick steps.Whoosh!Instantly, Su Mo blocked their passage.On top of being a Grade Eight Alchemist, Su Mo was also a ninth level Origin Core martial artist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he felt helpless in his heart, he chose to compromise.What Duan Ling Tian said earlier was something he had noticed long ago.However, he didn\u2019t possess the experience of a Grade Seven Alchemist and thus could only stubbornly continue on the path he was on and stumble along the way.Now that he had a chance to break through to become a Grade Seven Alchemist, he naturally wouldn\u2019t let it go easily.As far as he was concerned, as long as he broke through and became a Grade Seven Alchemist, he could apply to the Alchemist Guild and leave this damnable place.Aurora City, in the entirety of the Crimson Sky Kingdom, it was only a small city.In the past, were it not for him offending a person who had both power and authority, it would be unlikely that he would have been sent here.As long as he breaks through to become a Grade Seven Alchemist, that person will be helpless to do anything to him.A Grade Seven Alchemist and Grade Eight Alchemist, although a difference of only one grade, the difference was like heaven and earth.In the vast Crimson Sky Kingdom, there were an entire 1,000 plus Grade Eight Alchemists who had registered themselves in the Alchemist Guild.Whereas there were only just a few tens of Grade Seven Alchemists.A Grade Seven Alchemist had an honorable standing; even the Imperial Family of Crimson Sky Kingdom would extend an olive branch to them.\u201cGeezer, don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t suffer any losses.\u201dDuan Ling Tian held back his smile in the corners of his mouth as he handed over the Crystal Card.Quickly, the Crystal Card in Su Mo\u2019s hand flicked and showed its balance.10,000 points.Catching sight of this number, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be dumbfounded.After all, 10,000 silver was only worth 100 points.These 10,000 points, if exchanged into silver, that would be 1,000,000 silver\u20261,000,000 silver, what kind of concept was that?In next to no time, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Crystal Card had an extra 5,000 points, totaling to 5,060 points.Duan Ling Tian received the Crystal Card with satisfaction as he smiled and said, \u201cGeezer, I originally only intended to ask for a third of your net worth\u2026 But who asked you to cheat 10 points off me when I only borrowed your Cauldron? Likewise, I can\u2019t go easy on you.\u201dThe corners of Su Mo\u2019s mouth twitched.Didn\u2019t that mean that he had given up nearly 2,000 points for 10 points?Even his intestines turned green from regret!\u201cPfft!\u201dLi Fei laughed like a flower. She finally understood what Duan Ling Tian meant when he said \u2018you better not regret it.\u2019So it turned out that he had schemed this all along.\u201cStarting from noon tomorrow, come look for me at the Li Clan\u2026 Right, remember to eat before coming. I don\u2019t provide food.\u201dDuan Ling Tian grabbed Li Fei\u2019s hand, walked around Su Mo, and walked away.Su Mo looked at their disappearing figures and his eyes narrowed.The Li Clan, when did they have such a figure?On the way back.\u201cYou\u2019re too ruthless, directly cheating him off half his points.\u201dLi Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian as she smiled.But after seeing Su Mo be thwarted, her heart was filled with pleasure.\u201cWho asked him to cheat me first\u2026 Asking for 10 points just to casually use his lousy Cauldron for a while, that\u2019s an entire 1,000 silver!\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a pained expression as he spoke.\u201cTook 1,000 silver, but lost 500,000 silver\u2026 I wonder if he will sleep tonight.\u201dLi Fei giggled.Duan Ling Tian was entranced.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dLi Fei asked angrily.\u201cLittle Fei, my wife, you\u2019re truly beautiful.\u201d Duan Ling Tian said eagerly.\u201cPei! Who\u2019s your wife? Go look for your Ke Er.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so overly jealous, but you still don\u2019t admit to being my wife?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to turn around and pursue Xiao Lan\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d\u2026\u2026Amidst the frolicking, Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei returned to the Li Clan Estate and subsequently Li Fei\u2019s home.\u201cYou\u2019ve finished refining so quickly?\u201dWhen the old man saw the three medicinal pills Duan Ling Tian passed over to him, he was stupefied.\u201cI didn\u2019t spend much time because it\u2019s only a Grade Nine medicinal pill.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\u201cWhere did you get the Cauldron from? Don\u2019t tell me that in just this amount of time, you refined a Cauldron yourself.\u201dThe old man looked at Duan Ling Tian as if he was looking at a freak.\u201cWell, no.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled embarrassedly.\u201cGrandfather, he used the Cauldron of our Aurora City\u2019s Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master Su Mo\u2026 But that Su Mo is really stingy; he actually asked Duan Ling Tian for 1,000 silver just to use his Cauldron for an hour.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows slightly knit and her face was filled with dissatisfaction as she spoke.\u201cIs that so? Isn\u2019t it only 1,000 silver? Grandfather can still afford it.\u201dAs the old man spoke, he looked at Duan Ling Tian. \u201cKid, how much did these three medicinal pills cost in total, I\u2019ll pay for them together.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, this is my gift to you; I don\u2019t dare to take your money.\u201dWhen the old man said those words, Duan Ling Tian noticed Li Fei glaring at him in a threatening manner that said \u201cif you dare take my grandfather\u2019s money, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Alright. In any case, this old man\u2019s money will be Fei\u2019s in the future anyway.\u201dThe old man nodded and didn\u2019t insist.In his heart, he had already taken Duan Ling Tian as his future son-in-law.\u201cGrandfather, what are you talking about? You\u2019ll definitely live a long life. As for this guy, he doesn\u2019t lack money; he just cheated Su Mo off 500,000 silver.\u201dLi Fei scowled, selling out Duan Ling Tian in the blink of an eye.\u201c500,000 silver?\u201dThe old man was dumbstruck.Although he was a Grade Nine Weapons Craftsmen, even all the wealth he had accumulated during half his lifetime wasn\u2019t worth 500,000 silver\u2026\u201cWhat happened?\u201dThe old man was curious.Li Fei told the old man the sequence of events.\u201cHaha\u2026 In that case, Guild Master Su hurt himself by his own doing this time.\u201dThe old man couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.The old man\u2019s laughter vanished before long as he looked at Duan Ling Tian with a serious expression. \u201cKid, you can consider yourself lucky this time. This Guild Master Su is famous for his good temper\u2026 Next time, you can\u2019t use similar methods to dupe other powerhouses; otherwise, once he attains his goal and comes for your life, you will lose more than you gained.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, grandfather. I\u2019m aware of what I should do.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded with an air of being educated.However, in his heart, he was thinking of something else.What the old man said was something he had long ago thought of, and he even had a way to cope with it which would guarantee his safety.In a vast courtyard.Om!An incredibly swift figure pointed out his finger as he flashed about, causing a piercing howl to explode out.Dark Nether Finger!The figure was precisely Li Qing.His right index finger had been completely connected and healed already, and he was in the process of testing the degree of recovery.Clang!Dark Nether Finger flashed out, hitting a stone pillar in the courtyard.Instantly, with the point of impact as the center, fissures split open in the stone pillar before exploding with a loud bang.\u201cAh!\u201dLi Qing let out a shrill cry. As he gripped his right index finger, cold sweat flowed out.\u201cQing, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe person who was observing from the sidelines was a tall, elderly old man. He walked over with large strides and had a trace of worry between in brows.It was precisely Li Qing\u2019s grandfather, the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder\u2026Li Tai!\u201cGrandfather, my Dark Nether Finger is crippled!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s face was pale as he was unable to accept this fact.In order to cultivate Dark Nether Finger, only he was clear of how much mental and physical effort he expended.Finger techniques, besides their formidable might, were also ten times more difficult to cultivate than regular martial skills!If he could take the mental and physical effort he expended on Dark Nether Finger and use it on a different high grade Profound Rank offense martial skill, he would have long ago cultivated it to the Perfection Stage.\u201cQing, if you can\u2019t use your right index finger, then use your left index finger. Grandfather believes that you\u2019ll be able to recover your Dark Nether Finger\u2019s former might,\u201d Li Tai consoled.Li Qing had an ugly expression and said, in an unresigned manner, \u201cThat would mean I need to start cultivating Dark Nether Finger all over again. Moreover, I\u2019m not left-handed, so if I want to cultivate Dark Nether Finger to the Mastery Stage once more, it will be many times more difficult than before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s fault, it\u2019s all because of him! If it wasn\u2019t for him, how could this index finger of mine have been cut off! Grandfather, I want him dead, I want to kill him, I want to kill him\u2026\u201dLi Qing suddenly went mad. He had a savage expression as he howled.Li Tai took a deep breath. His murky eyes flashed with a cold light.Duan Ling Tian!\u201cQing, don\u2019t worry; grandfather will get justice for you\u2026 He\u2019s only just a Branch Family disciple, and if you want him dead, then he can\u2019t live!\u201dLi Tai\u2019s voice emitted a trace of coldness.\u201cThank you, grandfather, thank you, grandfather.\u201dHearing what Li Tai said, Li Qing\u2019s mood finally eased up.On the other side.After Duan Ling Tian finished telling the old man of the precautions before consuming the Phosphorous Flame Pill, he left and headed home.He happened to bump into a person walking out of his own courtyard.\u201cYoung Master Ling Tian.\u201dThe person smiled to Duan Ling Tian before leaving.Duan Ling Tian recognized him. This person was precisely the person who sent the Hidden Dragon invitation to him, a member of the Xiao Clan.Duan Ling Tian guessed the reason he came.\u201cThe Xiao Clan\u2019s operations are indeed quick.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked in and saw his mother sorting a pile of things. They were precisely the prizes for the first ranked in the Hidden Dragon List.\u201cTian, you were ranked first in the Hidden Dragon List?\u201dLi Rou noticed Duan Ling Tian had returned and gave him a spurious smile.Duan Ling Tian smiled as he said, \u201cMom, you\u2019re unhappy?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy. My Tian is really extraordinary\u2026\u201dLi Rou lightly nodded.For a moment, she couldn\u2019t help but think of her long lost husband.Her son had inherited her husband\u2019s natural talent in the Martial Dao.\u201cLittle Black, where\u2019re you going?\u201dAbruptly, Ke Er\u2019s voice sounded from inside her room.Whoosh!A black bolt of lightning flashed out and coiled itself around Duan Ling Tian\u2019s wrist.It was precisely the little black python that had gone into a deep slumber for more than a month after consuming half the Beast Core of the Snow Python.Hiss hiss~The little black python flicked its tongue towards Duan Ling Tian and was extremely happy.Duan Ling Tian noticed that the little black python had changed.The gold markings on its body were much more profound.Its pupils had now transformed into golden pupils that seemed incomparably fierce.Moreover, the little black python\u2019s speed just now had obviously greatly surpassed its mother\u2019s, the Black Python\u2026\u201cLittle Black, looks like you\u2019ve undergone a metamorphosis.\u201dDuan Ling Tian rubbed the little black python\u2019s small head as he lightly smiled.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dMeanwhile, Ke Er had come out too. When the little white python that was coiled on her wrist noticed Duan Ling Tian, it was slightly joyous as well.The little white python was similar to the little black python; they both had undergone great changes.The silver markings on its body were much more profound as well.Its pupils had transformed into silver pupils.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a whole row of stone pillars there, and they were provided to be used for his usual cultivation.Collapsing Fist!Duan Ling Tian took a few steps forward and punched out. A gust of wind swept by as his fist blasted a stone pillar in half.Hiss hiss~The pupils of the two little pythons shined as they transformed into two bolts of black and white lightning, flashing towards another stone pillar.Duan Ling Tian noticed that in the sky, twenty ancient mammoth silhouettes had appeared out of thin air.An ordinary martial artist would need to cultivate to the seventh level of the Core Formation Stage before being able to exert such a strength.Clang! Clang!The two bolts of lightning immediately pierced straight through the stone pillar, leaving behind two small holes on the stone pillar.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.The small holes that the two little pythons pierced through were extremely smooth and did not leave a single crack on the stone pillar\u2026It was imaginable how condensed the piercing attacks of the two little pythons were.They were completely condensed to a single point.This could be said to be perfect!\u201cThe two of you are the real freaks.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze descended onto the heads of the two little pythons. Those two small bulges had already started to blossom.On the little black python\u2019s bulge, a trace of a golden horn emerged.On the little white python\u2019s bulge, a trace of a silver horn emerged.\u201cTheir respective strengths are comparable to a seventh level Core Formation martial artist\u2026 However, even a seventh level Core Formation martial artist might not be their match. After all, their bodies are small and they have swift speeds, so they hold a huge advantage.\u201dDuan Ling Tian exhaled a breath of cold air.Luckily, these two variant little pythons weren\u2019t his enemies.If he had such enemies, just thinking about it caused Duan Ling Tian\u2019s scalp to go numb.Ke Er, who was watching from the side, had long since been struck dumb.\u201cLittle White, so it turned out to be that you\u2019re so formidable.\u201dKe Er had a light smile on her face as she rubbed the small head of the little white python.The little white python seemed to have noticed that Ke Er was praising it, as it complacently lifted its small head up and playfully flicked its tongue\u2026That night.Duan Ling Tian passed down a top tier cultivation method to his mother.This cultivation method was called Demonic Beauty Divine Technique.It was one of the top cultivation methods that the Rebirth Martial Emperor had gathered during his first lifetime, and it was the cultivation method cultivated by the Demonic Beauty Martial Emperor of that time, thus it could be cultivated until the Martial Emperor Stage.\u201cThis cultivation method\u2026\u201dAfter Li Rou grasped the Demonic Beauty Divine Technique, she realized how terrifying this cultivation method was.She felt slightly numbed.Her son truly had too many secrets.The Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique that Ke Er cultivated seems to not be inferior to this Demonic Beauty Divine Technique.\u201cMom, patiently comprehend it once more\u2026 I\u2019ll go buy medicinal materials tomorrow and refine a Spirit Containment Pill for you. At that time, the Spirit Containment Pill will absorb all of your Origin Energy and contain it within. Once you\u2019ve completed your change of cultivation method to the Demonic Beauty Divine Technique, you can release the Origin Energy that was contained within the Spirit Containment Pill, allowing you to recover your full strength or even become stronger in half a month\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cGood, good.\u201dLi Rou looked at Duan Ling Tian dotingly as she nodded continuously.In the morning the next day, Duan Ling Tian took Ke Er along as he left the Li Clan Estate and arrived at the trade market.First, he collected his account balance from the medicine store manager and once again concocted two crocks of Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid. Only after finishing did Duan Ling Tian proclaim the reason he came\u2026The medicinal materials for the Spirit Containment Pill were all quite ordinary.After a short moment, the medicine store manager finished preparing them for Duan Ling Tian.\u201cManager, how much are all these medicinal materials?\u201dDuan Ling Tian asked.\u201cCustomer, the total for all these medicinal materials are only just a few hundred silver. You don\u2019t have to pay for them.\u201dThe medicine store manager\u2019s face was filled with smiles.Since Duan Ling Tian started to consign his Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid for sale at this medicine store, his medicine store could be considered to be raking in money. God knows how many medicine stores were filled with envy and jealousy.\u201cThen I\u2019ll help myself.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded. After giving the manager a deep glance, he left with Ke Er.Originally, Duan Ling Tian thought that the manager would meet with some trouble from the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2019s huge sale\u2026After all, there were surely many people who coveted it.But up until now, the manager didn\u2019t face a sliver of trouble, meaning that he obviously wasn\u2019t as simple as he seemed to be on the surface.But this didn\u2019t have anything much to do with Duan Ling Tian.After he and Ke Er arrived home, he entered his room and prepared to refine the Spirit Containment Pill.Whoosh!With but a thought, he withdrew a Cauldron from his Spatial Ring.The Cauldron had an exquisite look; it had nine extremely lifelike five-clawed divine dragons carved on all sides.It was precisely the Cauldron that Li Fei\u2019s grandfather gave him.Originally, he wasn\u2019t willing to take away the old man\u2019s prized possession.But the old man persisted, so in the end, even Li Fei persuaded him to take it.\u201cLooks like grandfather\u2019s teacher from all those years ago was remarkable. This Cauldron already has a trace of a Grade Seven Spirit Weapon\u2019s aura\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted and briefly flashed with a slight surprise.\u201cEh, the material of this Cauldron\u2026 F**k! It can\u2019t be! Thousand Year Dark Iron?\u201dAfter a short moment, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands trembled and he spouted out vulgarities in pleasant surprise.The Thousand Year Dark Iron is a type of extremely valuable weapon crafting material.Its limit is being able to withstand a Grade Six Weapon Flame. In other words, the Thousand Year Dark Iron was sufficient to refine a Grade Six Spirit Weapon.\u201cThe entire body is made of Thousand Year Dark Iron. Extravagant, too extravagant! With this Cauldron as a foundation, in the future, even when I become a Grade Six Alchemist, I won\u2019t need to change to another Cauldron because I can directly refine this one into a Grade Six Spirit Weapon.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone with a brilliant light.After merging with the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, he was now not only an alchemist with abundant experience, he was also a weapons craftsman with abundant experience.Before long, Duan Ling Tian started refining the medicinal pill.When compared to the Phosphorous Flame Pill, the refining process of the Spirit Containment Pill was much simpler.After spending half an hour, Duan Ling Tian completed the Spirit Containment Pill refinement and had refined a total of two pills.One of the pills was for his mother to consume.The other, he planned to keep it for Li Fei.After passing the Spirit Containment Pill to his mother and informing her of the method to consume the pill and its necessary precautions, Duan Ling Tian returned to his room.He started cultivating.Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Raging Python Form!At present, Duan Ling Tian had already developed his Origin Energy and became a martial artist at the first level of the Core Formation Stage.If he was cultivating an ordinary cultivation method, the next step would be to charge towards the second level of the Core Formation Stage\u2026However, due to the uniqueness of the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2026What he needed to do now was use his Origin Energy to further temper his fleshly body and increase the limits of his fleshly body, thus allowing the strength of his fleshly body to increase from the strength of three ancient mammoths to the strength of four ancient mammoths.Once the tempering is completed, he will have an extra strength of one ancient mammoth.At that time, even though he will still be a martial artist at the first level of the Core Formation Stage, he will be a martial artist at the first level of the Core Formation Stage that possesses the strength of five ancient mammoths.In terms of strength, he will be superior to a martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage and inferior to one at the fourth level.An ordinary martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage possessed the strength of four ancient mammoths.Like the former Fresh Breeze Town Branch Family\u2019s Seventh Elder, Li Kun.A martial artist at the fourth level of the Core Formation Stage, on the other hand, possessed the strength of six ancient mammoths.Like his mother.\u201cTempering the fleshly body with Origin Energy, it\u2019s really exciting\u2026\u201dIn accordance with the Raging Python Form\u2019s mental cultivation method, Duan Ling Tian started tempering his fleshly body with Origin Energy for a short moment before his body trembled, causing him to immediately stop. His face emitted a bitter smile.Contrary to expectations, tempering the fleshly body with Origin Energy didn\u2019t cause him to feel any pain.However, the feeling of numbness, itchiness, and limpness he felt in his entire body caused him to feel extremely distressed.If an example was really given.It would be similar to thousands of ants crawling around inside his flesh\u2026This type of feeling caused suffering that was even worse than direct pain.\u201cBring it on!\u201dGritting his teeth, Duan Ling Tian had a resolute gaze.As a result of the Origin Energy\u2019s tempering, the Fleshly Body became even more condensed.The lifeblood and Fleshly Body that originally were at the threshold were now unendingly growing and undergoing transformations at an extremely fast pace\u2026No pain, no gain!Duan Ling Tian deeply understood this logic.After continuously cultivating until noon, Duan Ling Tian was drenched in sweat and his clothes were soaked through, slimy, and extremely uncomfortable.After taking a bath and changing into some clean and dry clothes, only then did Duan Ling Tian walk out of his room.At noon, while Duan Ling Tian was eating with his family, an unexpected guest arrived.\u201cGuild Master Su, Duan Ling Tian stays here.\u201dOutside the courtyard, a respectful voice sounded.\u201cTian, someone\u2019s looking for you?\u201dLi Rou glanced at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, let him wait. Let\u2019s have lunch first.\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a tranquil expression, continuing to clamp food with his chopsticks naturally and smoothly.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I\u2019m the inner court\u2019s manager, Li Qiang. Guild Master Su wants to see you.\u201dOutside the courtyard, a shout echoed out and entered the courtyard.\u201cAsk him to come in himself.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly impatient.Outside the courtyard, Li Qiang was struck dumb.This Duan Ling Tian was really unruly\u2026Who was this old man that stood beside him?This was a figure that even their Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch would have to greet in respect!He was Aurora City\u2019s Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master.Su Mo!\u201cSu\u2026 Guild Master Su, Duan Ling Tian is young and inexperienced, how about\u2026\u201dCold sweat poured out of Li Qiang as he gazed at the old man with a bitter smile, deeply afraid that the old man would be enraged because of this.But in the next moment, he was completely stupefied.\u201cYou can leave, I\u2019ll go in myself.\u201dSu Mo nodded to Li Qiang and flicked out a medicinal pill towards him.After Li Qiang caught the medicinal pill, he that noticed Su Mo wasn\u2019t angry nor irritated, so he slowly walked into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s house courtyard.\u201cOrigin Increasing Pill!\u201dWhen he clearly saw the medicinal pill in his hand, Li Qiang\u2019s gaze shone.This Origin Increasing Pill was worth 5,000 silver.\u201cAs expected of the Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master, he\u2019s really generous. All I did was show him the way, and he gave me an Origin Increasing Pill.\u201dLi Qiang took a deep breath, slightly excited.Even though he was the Li Clan\u2019s inner court manager, his monthly pay was only 1,000 silver.Normally, he loathed buying himself some Origin Increasing Pills to increase his cultivation.Just when he was about to turn around and leave, a voice sounded from the courtyard behind him, causing his expression to freeze. He was nearly scared shitless\u2026\u201cGeezer, you\u2019ve come so early. It can\u2019t be that you came here to get a free meal, right? Let me tell you first, I didn\u2019t prepare any tableware for you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if I wanted to invite Guild Master Su for food, he might not even do me the favor, but he actually directly asked Guild Master Su to not think of getting free food.\u201dLi Qiang had a strange expression as he pricked up his ears and listened.As far as he was concerned, Duan Ling Tian was going to get into trouble\u2026Unexpectedly.\u201cKid, don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve already eaten. You take your time and eat, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201dSu Mo\u2019s calm voice sounded, causing Li Qiang to be thunderstruck.This\u2026How could this be possible!?Instantly, thousands of questions arose in his heart.This Duan Ling Tian, wasn\u2019t he just a Branch Family disciple?Why would the Aurora City Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master, the only Grade Eight Alchemist in Aurora City, be so courteous to him?He couldn\u2019t figure it out.But he had already come to a decision in his heart.No matter what, he would absolutely not offend Duan Ling Tian\u2026After Duan Ling Tian finished eating, he started guiding Su Mo.An afternoon passed, and the shocked expression on Su Mo\u2019s face had never ceased.He noticed that this sixteen year old youth knew more than him, and his understanding towards a Grade Seven Alchemist was even at a level that was difficult for him to reach.If it wasn\u2019t for him being a youth, Su Mo would probably plan to directly take him as his master.Although it was only an afternoon, Su Mo benefitted greatly.He was convinced that so long as he came here for a few more days, the threshold that had bewildered him for so long would undoubtedly be broken, enough for him to smoothly become a Grade Seven Alchemist.Before leaving, Su Mo had a serious expression as he asked Duan Ling Tian, \u201cKid, what grade is your teacher?\u201dIn his opinion, the reason why Duan Ling Tian had such vast knowledge was surely because of the great teacher he had.Moreover, this teacher was far from being someone a Grade Seven Alchemist could compare to\u2026No, even a Grade Six Alchemist, Grade Five Alchemist, or even a Grade Four Alchemist, they might not be able to educate such a disciple.In his heart, an insane guess arose.But he still wanted to double check.\u201cEven I don\u2019t know what grade my teacher is. I was lucky to see him refine a medicinal pill. At that time, the Pill Fire he condensed from his Origin Energy was a violet flame\u2026 Right, surrounding the violet flame, there was a strand of silver edging intertwined,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said in all seriousness, as if it was all true.\u201cViolet Silver Pill Fire?\u201dSu Mo\u2019s pupils constricted.He had once gone through some ancient records in County City\u2019s Alchemist Guild. On it was a record of the various grades of an alchemist in Cloud Continent.The Pill Fire of a Grade Three Alchemist was violet and its surroundings were intertwined with copper edges\u2026It was called Violet Copper Pill Fire!Whereas a violet Pill Fire with its surroundings intertwined with silver edges, that would be Violet Silver Pill Fire.It was the Pill Fire of a Grade Two Alchemist!Grade Two Pill Fire!Instantly, Su Mo felt as if the sky was about to fall!Grade Two Alchemist\u2026\u201cKid, are you certain your teacher\u2019s Pill Fire is violet? And its surroundings has silver edges?\u201dSu Mo\u2019s chest was rising and falling like bellows.Even at the time he condensed his Pill Fire when he was young and became an alchemist, he wasn\u2019t this excited.\u201cOf course I\u2019m certain. Oh, right\u2026 Teacher told me once that he came from some \u2018foreign lands\u2019 and that he happened to come here to relax, and it so happens that he noticed my natural talent was good, thus he took me as a disciple.\u201dDuan Ling Tian seemed to have thought of something as he spoke.\u201cForeign lands?\u201dSu Mo\u2019s pupils constricted.As expected\u2026He had already guessed it earlier, but after hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, he confirmed his suspicions.He was confident that the term \u2018foreign lands\u2019, not to mention Duan Ling Tian, even the Supreme Elders of the three great clans of Aurora City knew nothing of it.The only reason he knew was that he had read some ancient records in the Alchemist Guild.Duan Ling Tian being able to speak of the term proved that he wasn\u2019t lying.In this instant, he felt his scalp go numb.The violet-clothed youth who stood before his eyes seemed to become incomparably noble\u2026The disciple of a Grade Two Alchemist!He was confident now.If this matter were to be spread, even his majesty, the emperor of the Crimson Sky Kingdom, would probably have to go out of his way to build a good relationship with this youth.A disciple that a Grade Two Alchemist liked, his future accomplishments would certainly be extraordinary.Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Su Mo was slightly perturbed as he asked, \u201cKid, where\u2019s your teacher? I wonder if I can have the fortune to meet him.\u201d\u201cMy teacher is away for the time being. He asked me to patiently gain experience by myself and said that he would come back to visit me every now and then\u2026 If you want to meet him, when he comes the next time, I\u2019ll ask him to meet you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s brows slightly twitched.\u201cThank you, little brother.\u201dSu Mo had an expression filled with excitement. Even the way he addressed Duan Ling Tian changed.Duan Ling Tian continued, \u201cIt\u2019s a small matter; my teacher dotes on me the most. He said that out of all the disciples he took in this lifetime, my natural talent was the best\u2026 He also said that those other Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters that are at that \u2018foreign lands.\u2019 they can\u2019t even compare to a finger of mine. Heh, at that time, the way he spoke even made my face red\u2026\u201dSu Mo\u2019s expression froze, but he deeply agreed.What a joke.In terms of natural talent, a sixteen-year-old Grade Nine Alchemist, even in the entire \u2018foreign lands\u2019, would still be a rare existence.Su Mo, however, didn\u2019t notice that at this moment, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth were slightly twitching.He seemed to be forcefully holding back a smile.\u201cLittle brother, I wonder if you\u2019re interested in joining our Alchemist Guild. I guarantee that once you join, you will certainly get the best treatment\u2026 In the future, even his majesty, the emperor of the Crimson Sky Kingdom, wouldn\u2019t dare to even breathe loudly in front of you,\u201d Su Mo said to Duan Ling Tian, his tone filled with temptation.\u201cSeems to be not bad.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly muttered.Su Mo\u2019s eyes shone.It looked like it might be possible!\u201cBut my teacher said that I can\u2019t casually tell others about him, and that I can\u2019t use his identity to make others pave the way for me\u2026 He wants me to carve my own path because only then will I have the qualifications to be a true powerhouse.\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh.\u201cI\u2019ve told you so much; it\u2019s already considered as violating my teacher\u2019s orders\u2026 Geezer, you better not tell another soul of what I told you just now, or else I\u2019ll tell my teacher that you forced me to tell you everything the next time he comes.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes emitted a trace of a cunning smile.Whoosh!Su Mo\u2019s face turned completely green.\u201cLittle brother\u2026 Don\u2019t, please don\u2019t\u2026 Just take it as I never asked. Since your honored teacher said so, you must honor and respect his teachings, and please don\u2019t get me into trouble\u2026\u201dSu Mo was slightly struck with panic.Su Mo was crystal clear of what a Grade Two Alchemist represented.Besides having superb medicinal refining skills, alchemists were also extremely formidable powerhouses of the Martial Dao.These powerhouses were omnipotent!At this moment, he had a lingering fear in his heart.Because before today, a thought once momentarily appeared in his mind\u2026After Duan Ling Tian assists him to become a Grade Seven Alchemist, he would take care of Duan Ling Tian and seize back his Alchemist Guild points.But when he looked at it now, he felt lucky that his reason and conscience had defeated this crazy thought.Or else, once something happened to Duan Ling Tian, no matter how he cleaned up after himself, with the resources of a Grade Two Alchemist, it would exceedingly easy for his teacher to get to the bottom of things.At that time, he could imagine what his end would be like.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little brother, I will absolutely not tell another soul of what you\u2019ve told me today. Also, if you need anything, feel free to let me know. As long as it\u2019s within my power, I will certainly not refuse.\u201dSu Mo had a serious expression as he pledged sincerely.\u201cGeezer, you\u2019re too courteous\u2026 But since you\u2019re so enthusiastic, then I\u2018ll be candid: I really do require some materials lately. These materials aren\u2019t available in Aurora City. I wonder if you can help me obtain some.\u201dDuan Ling Tian wrote it all down in a piece of paper before handing it over to Su Mo.Su Mo lowered his head and read.A total of five materials, two of which he had heard of, and they were both medicinal materials that were very rare and extremely valuable. He had no clue about the other three materials.\u201cI\u2019ll gather these materials as fast as possible and I\u2019ll send them to you as soon as they\u2019re gathered.\u201dSu Mo assured Duan Ling Tian in a serious manner.\u201cThen I\u2019ll thank you in advance.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he expressed his gratitude.Only after Su Mo left did Duan Ling Tian have a broad grin on his face.Everything he made up earlier were measures he used to protect himself\u2026As for \u2018foreign lands\u2019 and the Pill Fire of a Grade Two Alchemist, they were all things he found out of from Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories.Using it to intimidate people, there would utterly be no one that would doubt it.After all, it was impossible for even the Supreme Elders of the three great clans of Aurora City to know of these things, let alone a Branch Family disciple of Aurora City\u2019s Li Clan.Su Mo knew of it only because he was a part of the Alchemist Guild.The main branch of the Alchemist Guild was in the \u2018foreign lands\u2019.\u201cI hope that Geezer can gather those five materials as soon as possible, because only then can I inscribe the Blood Crescent Inscription. Although it isn\u2019t as strong as the Blood Explosion Inscription on the Spirit Weapon of Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan\u2019s Supreme Elder, it is nearly comparable.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered with a cold light.The art of inscription was extensive and profound.An inscription master, however, was different compared to alchemists and weapons craftsmen.The latter two required their cultivation to attain a certain level before being able to condense Origin Energy into a Pill Fire or a Weapon Flame to refine medicinal pills or spirit weapons.The former only had a requirement towards Spiritual Force.As long as the inscription master had sufficient Spiritual Force and was able to obtain the materials required, no matter how formidable the inscription may be, he would be able to inscribe it\u2026Origin Energy, in the eyes of inscription masters, was only a tool to inscribe and activate inscriptions.The Spiritual Force stemmed from the soul.Maybe it was due to him having traveled through to this world, or maybe it was because he had merged with the memories of the Rebirth Martial Emperor.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s soul was terrifyingly strong.By means of estimation, based on Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s memories, Duan Ling Tian could almost be sure that his current Spiritual Force was sufficient to be compared with an Origin Core martial artist\u2019s.But unfortunately, in Cloud Continent, only Martial Emperor Stage powerhouses were able to fight using Spiritual ForceOr else, with Duan Ling Tian\u2019s current Spiritual Force, it would be sufficient to easily pulverize any martial artist below the Origin Core Stage.It was precisely because of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s shocking Spiritual Force that as long as he had sufficient materials, he could inscribe inscriptions that only an Origin Core Stage inscription master could inscribe.Just like the Blood Crescent Inscription he planned to inscribe.The Blood Crescent Inscription was the inscription with the strongest might among the inscriptions he was currently capable of inscribing.\u201cIt\u2019ll be different now that I broke through to the Core Formation Stage and developed Origin Energy. I can now use Origin Energy to inscribe, so as long as my Spiritual Force can fulfill the requirements of the inscription, I can easily inscribe it.\u201dThinking up to this point, a smiled appeared on the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s a Branch Family disciple and a disciple with another surname at that; how could he strike a relationship with the Alchemist Guild?\u201dLi Qing shook his head continuously, unwilling to believe it.\u201cFor some unknown reason, in these last few days, Su Mo would go look for Duan Ling Tian at noon every day.\u201dLi Tai was slightly fearful for a brief moment.Although he was the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder, in front of Su Mo, he was nothing.Not mentioning that Su Mo\u2019s strength was above his, solely based on Su Mo\u2019s identity as a Grade Eight Alchemist, if Su Mo wanted to deal with him, he wouldn\u2019t even need to do it himself; only a single word from Su Mo would cause a group of people to come for his life, just to kill him as a favor to Su Mo.This was precisely the influence of a Grade Eight Alchemist.\u201cGrandfather, could it be that the enmity for my crippled finger will just be let go like this? I\u2019m not resigned!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s expression was gloomy and his breathing became hurried.\u201cQing, you can be at ease; Grandfather will definitely help you take revenge\u2026 Now, since Su Mo and Duan Ling Tian are related, I cannot get involved directly, so I will have to ask someone else to deal with him.\u201dLi Tai\u2019s face emitted a cold smile.\u201cGrandfather, what do you mean?\u201dLi Qing was puzzled.\u201cMoney makes the world go around.\u201dLi Tai\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cGrandfather, you mean we should hire Ghastly Shadow?\u201dLi Qing\u2019s eyes shone.Ghastly Shadow, the top organization of assassins in the Crimson Sky Kingdom. They rose like a hurricane twenty year ago and swept through the kingdom.As long as Ghastly Shadow accepted the assignment, the rate of success was 100%.Of course, this was closely linked to the rules of Ghastly Shadow.If one wanted to post an assignment in Ghastly Shadow, a deposit must be paid and the target identified.Three day later, one needed to reconfirm with Ghastly Shadow to see if Ghastly Shadow was willing to accept this assignment.If they were unwilling, the deposit would be refunded.If they were willing, the balance fee must be paid.Ghastly Shadow only accepted assignments that they were confident about.As far as Li Qing was concerned, Ghastly Shadow was an organization with such formidable assassins that killing Duan Ling Tian would be a piece of cake.Deep in the night, in the Li Clan Estate, a robust figure flashed out.Before long, the figure arrived at a secluded old building in Aurora City and walked in.The hall was very vast and had dim lighting.Behind the counter, a young man with a slightly pale face sat there. When he noticed movement, he raised his head and looked with an icy cold gaze at the figure who arrived.\u201cI want to post an assignment: Li Clan, Duan Ling Tian! This is the deposit.\u201dThe figure was straightforward. He withdrew a stack of silver and slapped it on the counter, then turned around and left.\u201cLi Clan, Duan Ling Tian.\u201dThe young man registered.Dawn.When the first light of morning illuminated the earth, Duan Ling Tian walked out of his room and stretched.It was a new day!\u201cHuh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked forward only to notice two young girls happily chatting in the courtyard.\u201cLittle Fei, you\u2019re here so early. Did you miss me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, greedily sizing up the hot, devilish body of the young girl\u2026Li Fei glared at Duan Ling Tian and angrily said, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to look for you, I came for little sister Ke Er.\u201dDuan Ling Tian made nothing of it. As he ate his breakfast, he pricked up his ears to overhear what the two young girls were chatting about.In the end, he realized that the two young girls were chatting about interesting stories from their childhood.After he finished his breakfast, Duan Ling Tian went out alone and left the Li Clan Estate.Su Mo had brought him good news yesterday. Out of the five rare materials that the Blood Crescent Inscription required, two would arrive in Aurora City within the next two days.As such, he started to prepare the other materials.Inscribing the Blood Crescent Inscription required a total of eleven materials.Six of them were comparatively ordinary.Arriving at the large trade market of Aurora City, Duan Ling Tian entered the medicine store he sold the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid at.Out of the six materials, three were ordinary medicinal materials.\u201cManager!\u201dDuan Ling Tian greeted the manager as soon as he entered.Before long, under Duan Ling Tian\u2019s puzzled gaze, the manager brought him into a small room in the medicine store.\u201cManager, what is it?\u201dDuan Ling Tian inquired.\u201cSomeone wants your life.\u201dThe manager gazed fixedly at Duan Ling Tian as he said this in a straightforward manner.\u201cHuh?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.At this moment, Duan Ling Tian even had a misconception that the manager\u2019s disposition had changed.If the past manager was only a completely sordid merchant, then the current manager vaguely emitted a sense of unfathomableness.It looked like his suspicions from earlier were correct, this medicine store manager was definitely not simple.\u201cThe Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder, Li Tai, posted an assignment in Ghastly Shadow last night. The target is you,\u201d the manager bluntly said.Ghastly Shadow?Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted.He had heard of this assassin organization that was famous throughout Crimson Sky Kingdom.\u201cYou\u2019re from Ghastly Shadow?\u201dDuan Ling Tian abruptly laughed.\u201cYes, in the daytime, I\u2019m the manager of this medicine store, but at night, I\u2019m the person in charge of Ghastly Shadow in Aurora City.\u201dThe manager slowly nodded.\u201cManager, doing thing like this, I bet it\u2019s against the rules of Ghastly Shadow, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze slightly twitched.\u201cRules are dead, but people are living. I don\u2019t wish for my business partner to be killed because of some people. That would mean losing my road to riches for no reason.\u201dThe manager was extremely frank.As far as he was concerned, the little amount of silver that Li Tai paid for the assassination wasn\u2019t even enough to be considered spare change compared to the profit he gained from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.He naturally knew how to choose between the two.\u201cThen what you mean now is, you\u2019re refusing his assignment?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.\u201cOf course.\u201dThe manager nodded.\u201cIf I post an assignment targeting Li Tai now, would Ghastly Shadow accept?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked again.\u201cOf course. Ghastly Shadow only recognizes money\u2026 But the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder\u2019s price is extremely expensive,\u201d the manager answered.\u201cHow much?\u201d\u201c1,000,000 silver!\u201d\u201cSo expensive?!\u201d\u201cOf course. Li Tai is the Grand Elder of the Li Clan after all, an existence at the eighth level of the Origin Core Stage\u2026 If you really want to post this assignment, since we are business partners, I can give you a 20% discount.\u201d\u201c20% discount? Even then it would be 800,000. You Ghastly Shadow people are really greedy.\u201d\u201cYou can owe a debt without interest, and it would be deducted from the profit of the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid.\u201d\u201cForget it. 800,000 silver, I\u2019d loath to part with it\u2026 I\u2019ll just do it myself.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cWhat, doubting me?\u201d\u201cSlightly.\u201d\u201cHow about this, I don\u2019t need Ghastly Shadow to kill him, but help me with a small matter\u2026\u201dAfter getting the agreement of the manager and buying the medicinal materials he required, Duan Ling Tian left the medicine store satisfied.800,000 silver\u2026To kill Li Tai.To Duan Ling Tian, it was really not worth it.But Li Tai had actually posted an assignment to kill him.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of coldness.After buying the remaining materials, he returned home.At noon today, Su Mo didn\u2019t come.Duan Ling Tian had already taught him everything he could teach.The remainder was something he could only rely on himself to comprehend.Three days later, deep in the night, in the point of operations of Ghastly Shadow in Aurora City.Li Tai looked at the young man behind the counter as he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the confirmation of the assignment I posted three days ago? For killing a first level Core Formation martial artist, 100,000 silver should be enough, right?\u201d\u201c100,000 silver? Customer, are you joking?\u201dThe pale-faced young man\u2019s eyes flickered with a cold light that would cause chills to run down people\u2019s spines.\u201cWhat?\u201dLi Tai\u2019s heart jerked and he had a bad premonition.\u201cAccording to the information our Ghastly Shadow collected, this Duan Ling Tian is the first ranked youth genius in Aurora City\u2019s Hidden Dragon List for this year\u2026 Just this point alone would require a fee of at least 300,000 silver.\u201dThe young man slowly said.\u201c300,000 silver? OK.\u201dLi Tai grit his teeth. Although it pained him, he still agreed.\u201cCustomer, I haven\u2019t finished.\u201dThe young man frowned.\u201cWhat else do you have to say?\u201d Li Tai questioned.The young man continued, \u201cWe also discovered that Duan Ling Tian is close to the Alchemist Guild\u2019s Guild Master, Su Mo\u2026 Su Mo is a member of the Alchemist Guild, and killing someone close to him is very risky for us. Thus, combining the above facts, the price for this Duan Ling Tian\u2019s head is 1,000,000 silver.\u201d\u201c1,000,000 silver?\u201dLi Tai was stupefied.Even though he guessed the assignment wouldn\u2019t be possible when the young man mentioned Su Mo, he didn\u2019t expect that Ghastly Shadow would set the price at 1,000,000 silver for Duan Ling Tian\u2019s head.Not to mention he didn\u2019t have so much silver on him, even if he had brought out that much, he wouldn\u2019t be willing to spend it.A mere first level Core Formation kid, even if his strength was bizarre, he was only comparable to a third level Core Formation martial artist.To him, killing such a kid was as simple as cutting grass.The young man looked at Li Tai as he asked, \u201cCustomer, may I ask if you still want to post this assignment?\u201d\u201cNo, return the deposit to me.\u201dLi Tai hurriedly shook his head.What a joke!1,000,000 silver\u2026This amount of money was enough to even post an assignment in Ghastly Shadow to kill an Origin Core martial artist.After Li Tai left.A middle-aged man slowly walked out from an inner chamber.\u201cManager.\u201dThe young man hurriedly bowed to the middle-aged man.If Duan Ling Tian was here, he would surely be able to recognize with a glance that this middle-aged man was precisely the medicine store manager.\u201cI\u2019m curious though, how will he kill this Li Tai\u2026\u201d the middle-aged man thought in his heart. The corners of his mouth had a trace of a smile.Li Clan Estate.\u201cGrandfather, how is it?\u201d Li Qing hurriedly asked as soon as he noticed that Li Tai had returned.He knew what Li Tai had gone out to do, so he was waiting all along for the result.\u201cI canceled the assignment.\u201dLi Tai shook his head.\u201cHuh?\u201dLi Qing was dumbstruck. \u201cGrandfather, why?\u201d\u201cHumph! That Ghastly Shadow actually asked for 1,000,000 silver.\u201dLi Tai\u2019s expression sank.\u201cWhat?! Killing a mere Core Formation kid for 1,000,000 silver? Are they conducting daylight robbery?\u201dLi Qing had an expression of disbelief.\u201cThey discovered the relationship between Duan Ling Tian and Su Mo, so they were slightly afraid and thus asked for such a high price\u2026 Qing, don\u2019t worry, even though Ghastly Shadow won\u2019t accept this assignment, Grandfather will still not allow that Duan Ling Tian to continue living.\u201dLi Tai looked at Li Qing as he guaranteed this.\u201cThank you, Grandfather,\u201d Li Qing said excitedly.If Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t die, he couldn\u2019t eat nor sleep in peace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their impurities were extracted and they were transformed into puddles of liquid that jumped about in the air as they boiled.Under Duan Ling Tian\u2019s control, the Violet Meteorite liquid and the other liquids from the other few metal materials fused together.Accompanied by Duan Ling Tian\u2019s profound movements, the fused liquid eventually separated into three balls.Finally, they transformed into three dark violet flexible swords.The three flexible swords were almost identical to the Violet Meteorite Flexible Sword from before, similarly thin as a cicada\u2019s wing.\u201cSuccess!\u201dDuan Ling Tian finished up and the three flexible swords entered his hands.Grasping one of the flexible swords, his Origin Energy flashed out as the strength of four ancient mammoths poured in the flexible sword.Om!A sword cry echoed out.\u201cNot bad. Compared to an ordinary Grade Nine Spirit Weapon, the amplification is over 10%, and the strength has increased by 5,000 or so pounds, comparable to the strength of half an ancient mammoth.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled in satisfaction.A Spirit Weapon refined by a Grade Nine Weapons Craftsman would mostly only have a strength amplification of nearly 10% only.A Grade Nine Spirit Weapon that could provide a 10% amplification was considered to be top quality.The Grade Nine Spirit Weapons that Duan Ling Tian refined on his first try had obviously surpassed top quality.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll call you Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a smile as he stared at the dark violet flexible sword in his hand.Subsequently, Duan Ling Tian put the remaining materials to use.He started inscribing inscriptions on the three Violet Myrtle Flexible Swords.Presently, all of the five materials that he asked Su Mo to get were here. Adding on the materials that Duan Ling Tian bought himself, he had everything he needed to inscribe the Blood Crescent Inscription.Duan Ling Tian only spent two hours to refine three Grade Nine Spirit Weapons.Inscribing the three Blood Crescent Inscriptions, however, used half of an entire day. He didn\u2019t even have time to go have lunch.\u201cDone!\u201dLooking at the blood red glow emitting from the blades, Duan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief.The three Violet Myrtle Flexible Swords had all been inscribed with Blood Crescent Inscriptions.At this moment, he felt an exhaustion invade his body and a drowsy feeling crept over him.After asking Ke Er to heat up the food and eating, Duan Ling Tian fell dead asleep before the sky was even dark, and he slept all the way until the next morning.After awakening, he still felt slightly dizzy and overwhelmed.\u201cThe inscribing of inscriptions really drains Spiritual Force.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.But when he saw his works from yesterday, he felt it was all worth it.Out of the three Violet Myrtle Flexible Swords, Duan Ling Tian kept one.As for the other two, he gave one to both Ke Er and one to his mother.\u201cYoung Master, I felt that when I cultivated my sword skills using the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword, its might seemed to have increased considerably\u2026 is it my misconception?\u201dThe young girl looked at Duan Ling Tian with a puzzled expression.Whoosh!Li Rou swung out the sword as well.\u201cSpirit Weapon!\u201dLi Rou had more experience than the young girl, and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from exclaiming in a low voice, then she looked at the youth at the side with a dull gaze. \u201cTian, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, besides being a Grade Nine Alchemist, I\u2019m now also a Grade Nine Weapons Craftsman.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly smiled as he said, \u201cAlso, on the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword, I\u2019ve inscribed the Blood Crescent Inscription. You just need to control your Origin Energy and fuse it into the inscription to activate it\u2026 This Blood Crescent Inscription, if you\u2019re able to use it unexpectedly, even an Origin Core martial artist will have only a slim chance of survival once hit!\u201dBlood Crescent Inscription?Able to kill an Origin Core martial artist?The two beauties were stupefied, taking a long time before finally being able to regain their senses.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re so great.\u201dThe young girl looked at Duan Ling Tian in a gaze of adoration, causing Duan Ling Tian to feel elated.Li Rou\u2019s gaze became slightly dazed and her heart trembled.\u201cBrother Feng, can you see it? Our child is extremely talented\u2026 Even without the Duan Clan to rely on, he isn\u2019t one bit inferior to his Duan Clan peers.\u201dA tall and robust figure seemed to appear in front of Li Rou\u2019s eyes.That figure was her everything once upon a time.\u201cRight, Tian, Ke Er, Shi Shi moved her home a few days ago. What happened? I haven\u2019t seen you two with Shi Shi lately. Did you three bicker?\u201d Li Rou suddenly asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shrugged. He had an innocent expression.That day, after he admitted defeat to Li Qing during the Clan Martial Meet, Li Shi Shi started to avoid him.After that, he occasionally met Li Shi Shi a few times, but Li Shi Shi had a very unfamiliar gaze when she looked at him, even having a trace of contempt mixed within.He didn\u2019t expect that Li Shi Shi would actually move away from him.\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201dKe Er lightly shook her head.Inner court.At a large courtyard extremely far away from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s home.Whoosh!The young girl\u2019s sword moved with her body. She was drenched in sweat. The corners of her mouth had a pained expression that was faintly mixed with a trace of self-mockery.It was precisely Li Shi Shi!For this past period of time, Li Shi Shi\u2019s state of mind was filled with a sense of loss.Since she witnessed Duan Ling Tian\u2019s formidable strength, she started to have a type of infatuated feeling towards him.But when Duan Ling Tian admitted defeat during the Clan Martial Meet and submissively gave away the championship to Li Qing, the lofty image of Duan Ling Tian in her heart crumbled. Because of this, she started to dislike Duan Ling Tian and intended to keep her distance from him.However, just at this moment.A shocking piece of news caused her to feel as if she had dropped into a pit of ice!During this year\u2019s youth gathering, Duan Ling Tian cut off Li Qing\u2019s finger and defeated in succession the Xiao Clan\u2019s and Lin Clan\u2019s top disciples in the younger generation, and he was placed at the first rank in the Hidden Dragon List.At that moment, she felt terribly ashamed in her heart.The youth she looked down upon had used his strength and proved everything.Of course, all of this, in her opinion, seemed to be mocking her short-sightedness.It was because of this that she didn\u2019t have the courage to face Duan Ling Tian and directly went to see the inner court manager to move.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t kept my distance from him at that time\u2026maybe\u2026\u201dLi Shi Shi\u2019s heart was filled with agony.Unfortunately, in this world, there were no \u2018ifs,\u2019 and there was no regret medicine to consume either.Duan Ling Tian had just arrived at Li Fei\u2019s door when he heard a hearty laughter sounding from within, full of confidence.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone.He knew that the old man had surely broken through to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsman.While walking in with large strides, Duan Ling Tian said, in a loud voice, \u201cCongratulations, Grandfather.\u201dAt this moment, the old man also walked out of his room, his face glowing. Seeing Duan Ling Tian was like seeing the future husband of his granddaughter to him. \u201cKid, it\u2019s all thanks to you\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for you, even if I had forcefully broken through to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen, my old life wouldn\u2019t have lasted much longer.\u201d\u201cGrandfather, you\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re all family anyway.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled as he spoke.Li Fei had walked out of her room when she heard the sound of the old man\u2019s laughter. Upon hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, her face blushed slightly as she angrily said., \u201cPei! Who\u2019s family with you?\u201d\u201cFei, you little girl, last night you kept talking about this kid Ling Tian, but now you deny it\u2026 OK, Grandfather needs to make a trip to the Weapons Craftsman Guild. Ling Tian is grandfathers guest, and also my benefactor, so you need to treat him well,\u201d the old man said to Li Fei before leaving.\u201cGrandfather, what are you talking about?\u201dLi Fei, who was sold out by the old man, was slightly embarrassed and angry.\u201cLittle Fei, what were you saying about me? Also, you need to listen to your grandfather and treat me well.\u201dDuan Ling Tian walked in large strides, bluntly walking into her room.\u201cYou\u2026 you actually entered my room.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s beautiful eyes glared at him as she angrily followed.\u201cSo what if I enter your room? I even want to sleep on your bed.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly as he directly fell onto Li Fei\u2019s bed.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Fei flared and was about to extend her hand and pull Duan Ling Tian up.But how could her strength compare to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s? Duan Ling Tian pulled her straight into his embrace and they both fell onto the bed. \u201cLittle Fei, cut it out.\u201dLi Fei still tried to struggle but was unable to break free of Duan Ling Tian. Her pair of clear eyes had tears within as she said, \u201cBully.\u201d\u201cOK, I\u2019ll stop teasing you.\u201dSeeing this, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart softened and he let go off Li Fei.\u201cYou\u2019re a rascal!\u201d Li Fei angrily said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you know of this since long ago?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cHumph! Stinking rascal. But\u2026 thank you for helping my grandfather.\u201dAs she finished speaking, Li Fei\u2019s voice was no different from the sound of a mosquito.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to thank? You\u2019re my wife, and your grandfather is my grandfather,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said brazenly.\u201cRight, Little Fei, tell me about you\u2026 where\u2019re your parents?\u201d Duan Ling Tian abruptly asked.\u201cParents?\u201dLi Fei took a deep breath. \u201cThey met with an accident before I was old enough to understand anything and they passed away.\u201dDuan Ling Tian found out about Li Fei\u2019s parents from her.It turned out that many years ago, the Li Clan once met with a calamity. During that period, many people died, and Li Fei\u2019s parents died were among them.Although the Li Clan got their revenge later on, it was impossible for the dead to come back again.\u201cI really miss my father, I really miss my mother\u2026 According to grandfather, they loved me dearly.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s delicate body started trembling as tears poured out of her like the rain.\u201cLittle Fei, it has passed. Don\u2019t be upset.\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and pulled Li Fei into an embrace as he consoled her.In the end, maybe because she was too tired from crying, Li Fei directly fell asleep in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s embrace\u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this little girl to have such a past.\u201dDuan Ling Tian stared fixedly at Li Fei\u2019s exquisite cheeks as he sighed in his heart.At this moment, although a beauty was in his embrace, he didn\u2019t have any other thoughts; all he had was pity.\u201cBad guy, bad guy, all you know is to bully me, all you know is to bully me\u2026\u201dAbruptly, Li Fei extended out her fist and started hitting Duan Ling Tian in a violent flurry as she spoke.In the beginning, Duan Ling Tian thought that Li Fei had woken up, but when he looked closely, he realized that Li Fei was sleep talking.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you big rascal, you\u2019re not allowed to look at Xiao Lan. If you continue, I\u2019ll dig out your eyes\u2026\u201dLi Fei seemed to be dreaming and muttered to herself for a while before finally recovering into a calm state.The corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth twitched.What sort of dream of this Little Fei having?After around one hour, Li Fei woke up.\u201cYou\u2026You\u2026\u201dOnly now did she realize that she had actually fallen asleep in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s embrace. She blushed immediately.\u201cLittle Fei, I didn\u2019t think you would have the habit of talking in your sleep\u2026 But when did I look at Xiao Lan? You actually want to dig out my eyes, too ruthless.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked as if he had a lingering fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was no joke.\u201cScared?\u201dLi Fei laughed complacently.\u201cWhy do I feel like a sheep that entered the den of a tiger?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.Looking at Li Fei\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes and feeling the warmth off her body, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s lower regions started to burn.Just when he was about to do something.\u201cFei, has Ling Tian left?\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice sounded from outside.When the old man saw the youth and young girl that came out of the room, he had a weird expression.\u201cGrandfather, nothing happened between us.\u201dLi Fei explained in panic.\u201cRight, there\u2019s nothing. Grandfather, err\u2026 I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was like a kid who was caught stealing candy, hurriedly fleeing.While he left Li Fei\u2019s home, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mood was elated.After today\u2019s events, the relationship between him and Li Fei was completely obvious.At the same time, he had no choice but to be on alert.After all, there was still someone that was waiting for a chance to take his life.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to take care of this,\u201d Duan Ling Tian muttered to himself.He then directly left the Li Clan Estate and entered the Misty Forest inner area by himself to hunt fierce beasts.For the next few days, he left the Li Clan Estate at around the same time.\u201cHe can really maintain his equanimity.\u201dIn the Misty Forest inner area, after killing a fierce beast, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered.But what he didn\u2019t lack was patience.Deep at night.In a vast courtyard, Li Qing greeted the old man who had just returned. \u201cGrandfather, that Duan Ling Tian has been continuously going to the Misty Forest by himself for a few days now. Are there any results from your secret observations in these past few days?\u201d\u201cI was originally worried that Su Mo would trail behind and protect him, but I noticed that when Duan Ling Tian went to the Misty Forest, Su Mo always stayed in the Alchemist Guild and didn\u2019t go out. Since a while back, he seemed to have cut off all relations with Duan Ling Tian\u2026\u201dLi Tai\u2019s brows jerked lightly. He was slightly puzzled.\u201cMaybe they never had any relationship all along, and it was just us overthinking things,\u201d Li Qing said.\u201cMaybe.\u201dLi Tai nodded.The next day, dawn.\u201cSuccess!\u201dLooking at the five ancient mammoth silhouettes that floated above him, Duan Ling Tian had a smile on his face.After days of effort, he had finally completed the tempering of his fleshly body for the first level of the Core Formation Stage, allowing his fleshly body\u2019s strength to increase by the strength of one ancient mammoth.Now he was confident that even if he fought a martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage, he would be capable of dominating his opponent!After having his breakfast, Duan Ling Tian once again went out by himself.This time, when he entered the Misty Forest, he started to enter even deeper inside the inner area, as the fierce beasts on the outskirts of the inner area were unable to pose a threat and pressure him at his current strength.After a short moment, Duan Ling Tian bumped into a fierce beast that had a savage appearance.Growing on its body were tumor-like spikes, and it had a pair of eyes that flickered with a green light. It appeared to look somewhat similar to a wolf but entirely larger by a whole size.\u201cAroooo!\u201dThe fierce beast let out a howl and pounced towards Duan Ling Tian.Instantly, above the fierce beast, four ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared.In other words, this fierce beast\u2019s strength was comparable to a martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage.But fierce beasts were naturally able to precisely control their strength and could even be considered to have reached the acme of perfection. Its strength even surpassed an ordinary martial artist\u2019s that was at the third level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201cBring it on!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shone brightly.He didn\u2019t even plan to use his Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s entire body flashed out, his speed far surpassing that of the fierce beast that was pouncing towards him.He exploded forth with his full strength of five ancient mammoths.Collapsing Fist!Drawing his body back like a heavy bow, Duan Ling Tian swung out his fist, smashing straight upon the fierce beast\u2019s head and blasting it flying.Bang!The fierce beast\u2019s enormous body caused dirt to suffuse in the air when it hit the ground.\u201cSatisfying!\u201dExhaling a breath of pent up feelings, Duan Ling Tian quickly walked up towards the fierce beast.The fierce beast\u2019s pupils that flickered with a green light had a trace of fear flash past as it slowly stood up and growled at Duan Ling Tian before turning around and fleeing.Duan Ling Tian was briefly stunned before he was able to react.\u201cWant to flee?\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth had curled into a smile as his body jerked.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s speed was greatly superior to the fierce beast\u2019s, so he caught up to it in the blink of an eye.\u201cAroo!\u201dMaybe it knew that it wouldn\u2019t be able to escape today. As the fierce beast\u2019s eyes emitted a fierce light, it desperately pounced towards Duan Ling Tian.This time, Duan Ling Tian seized the opportunity, and shattered the fierce beast\u2019s skull with a few punches.\u201cI wonder what type of fierce beast this is. Its fur and skin should sell for some money,\u201d Duan Ling Tian muttered to himself.\u201cThat is a Spike Wolf. Its fur and skin combined can be sold for 1,000 silver.\u201dJust at this moment, an elderly voice sounded from behind Duan Ling Tian, answering his question.Duan Ling Tian slowly turned around.Standing in front of him was a tall old man.On the old man\u2019s clothes, there was a Li Clan crest as well.\u201cA member of the Li Clan!\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart as he vaguely guessed the identity of this old man.\u201cOnly sixteen years old, the strength of five ancient mammoths\u2026 I have to say, your natural talent, not to mention in Aurora City, even in the entire Crimson Sky Kingdom, it is sufficient to be in the top of first-rate natural talents.\u201dThe old man\u2019s gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian as he said, with slight pity, \u201cUnfortunately, today you\u2019ll surely die!\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, are you so sure that I\u2019ll surely die?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed.\u201cYou recognize me?\u201dLi Tai\u2019s pupils constricted.In his memories, Duan Ling Tian should have never seen him before.\u201cAmong the old men of the Li Clan who want to kill me, besides you, the grandfather of Li Qing, I really can\u2019t think of a second person.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed as he spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re about to die and you can still laugh?\u201dLi Tai\u2019s expression turned grim.At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help himself from looking at the surroundings in vigilance. His first thought was that there was a high possibility of someone protecting Duan Ling Tian nearby; otherwise, Duan Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t dare be so unperturbed\u201cGrand Elder, you don\u2019t have to continue looking. No one followed me here.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled indifferently.\u201cNo one followed you?\u201dLi Tai\u2019s brows knit. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of death?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m afraid; no one is able to be unafraid of death,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said truthfully.\u201cThen you still have the mood to continue laughing?\u201d Li Tai asked, in a grim voice.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he asked, \u201cGrand Elder, I\u2019m really curious though, could it be that if I don\u2019t laugh now, you will let me go?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Today, you must die!\u201d Li Tai grunted coldly.\u201cWhether I laugh or not doesn\u2019t make any difference, so why should I put on a wailing expression?\u201dThe smile on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face grew more and more wide.\u201cI\u2019m not going to waste my breath on you! Die!\u201dLi Tai\u2019s gaze turned cold as he stepped out, pulling forth a line of afterimages at extreme speed.Above him, nearly a hundred ancient mammoth silhouettes dashed forward, their imposing manner piercing through the sky.Bang!Li Tai slapped out his palm, bringing a vast amount of Origin Energy with it.Immediately, the sounds of air exploding continuously rose and fell.And a shapeless gust of wind whistled as it swept through the surrounding bushes\u2026A jet of pressure enveloped Duan Ling Tian.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!Under Li Tai\u2019s briefly stunned gaze, Duan Ling Tian directly rushed towards him as if moving forward to receive his palm strike.\u201cIs this kid mad?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s hand grasped onto the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword\u2019s hilt on his waist.Sword Drawing Arts!His sword moved like a bolt of lightning, aiming straight for Li Tai\u2019s chest. It flashed straight out as if transforming into a violet, venomous snake.\u201cChild\u2019s play!\u201dLi Tai sneered. His descending palm spun around and instead slapped towards the blade of the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword.\u201cThis is the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s Origin Energy started trembling violently and poured into the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword\u2019s blade.Instantly, on the blade, a bloody gleam jumped about.Whoosh!A bloody gleam that looked like a waning crescent moon flashed straight towards Li Tai\u2019s chest.At this moment, Li Tai\u2019s palm strike descended, and the Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand was slapped flying.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand shook as his palm split open, bleeding profusely.\u201cInscription!\u201d Li Tai exclaimed in a low voice.Clang!The blood red waning crescent moon shattered Li Tai\u2019s defensive qi barrier.Just when Duan Ling Tian thought the force from the Blood Crescent Inscription was going to pierce through Li Tai\u2019s body.Hua!The pendant on Li Tai\u2019s neck flickered with a strand of a dark blue brilliance, condensed into a dark blue crystal wall, and blocked the force of the Blood Crescent Inscription.Kacha!The pendant shattered after completing its mission.\u201cCrystal Wall Inscription!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face distorted. After all the planning and calculations, he never expected that Li Tai would have a Crystal Wall Inscription on him.The Crystal Wall Inscription was a defensive inscriptionIn terms of grades, it even was not a bit inferior to the Blood Crescent Inscription.Duan Ling Tian felt a wave of powerlessness.He had entered the Misty Forest daily in these past few days just to use himself as bait and attract Li Tai into his trap.He was confident he could kill Li Tai if used the Blood Crescent Inscription.But how could he have known that this Li Tai would actually have a Crystal Wall Inscription\u2026It had blocked his only resort!Bang!The force of two inscriptions collided together. Li Tai\u2019s body was affected by the force and flew out more than ten meters away. Only then was he able to stabilize himself.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I didn\u2019t expect you to have such a formidable inscription.\u201dLi Tai\u2019s face was extremely gloomy. Today, he nearly failed miserably in such an easy task.Just now, if it wasn\u2019t for him activating his defensive inscription in time, he would have died without a doubt!In his heart, a coldness emerged.Duan Ling Tian took a deep breath, and said, slightly helplessly, \u201cEven I didn\u2019t expect that you would actually have a defensive inscription.\u201dInscriptions. There were various kinds; there were offensive inscriptions, defensive inscriptions, and assistive inscriptions.The Blood Crescent Inscription belonged to the offensive inscriptions type.Li Tai took a deep breath, and said, word for word, \u201cToday, if it wasn\u2019t for me having a defensive inscription, I would have surely died\u2026 No wonder you weren\u2019t one bit surprised you saw me; you already knew I was coming and planned to kill me with that inscription, right?\u201dAt this moment, the sixteen-year-old youth in front of him caused him to have a slightly frightened feeling\u2026Being able to think things through so thoroughly at such an age, once he grows up in the future, he will undoubtedly be a great figure.He even couldn\u2019t stop himself from thinking that if his grandson Li Qing had even half of what this youth had, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about him anymore.\u201cYes.\u201dAt this point, Duan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t afraid to admit it.A wave of bitterness flushed through his heart.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t f**cking easy for me to get the chance to cross over to this world and achieve rebirth.\u201cCould it be that I\u2019m really going to die here today?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You didn\u2019t even do your homework, and you wanted to use an offensive inscription to kill me? My defensive inscription, Crystal Wall Inscription, was granted to me by the former Li Clan Patriarch years ago. Who among the older generation of the Li Clan doesn\u2019t know of this?\u201dLi Tai stepped forward. Every step he took seemed like an approaching death warrant to Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling TIan lifted up his sword once again and stood ramrod straight, staying completely silent as he awaited Li Tai\u2019s arrival.Even though he wasn\u2019t a match, he would still put up a fight!Death, even death needed to be a heroic death!On his body, a fearless aura stretched out. That was the manifestation of his unyieldingness, to die rather than to submit.Li Tai was moved once again.The coldness in his eyes grew even deeper.\u201cIf this kid doesn\u2019t die, he will surely be a great disaster to me!\u201dBang!Li Tai\u2019s palm strike moved like a shadow as it flashed towards Duan Ling TIan.Whoosh!The Violet Myrtle Flexible Sword in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand swept out, moving to intercept Li Tai\u2019s palm.Pa!Li Tai\u2019s palm descended and slapped the sword flying. Its momentum didn\u2019t not lessen one bit as it smashed towards Duan Ling TIan\u2019s chest.Above him, 110 ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared, their might like thunder, fully exploding forth with the strength of the eighth level of the Origin Core Stage!Feeling the pressure that was approaching in the form of a suffocating aura, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth had a bitter smile.\u201cAm I going to die again?\u201dOm!But in the next moment, the ear-piercing cry of a saber, accompanied by Li Tai\u2019s shrill cry, caused Duan Ling Tian to feel as if he awoke from a dream.Instantly, he felt a hand being placed on his shoulder and pulling him aside.He focused his eyes to look.Presently, the hand that Li Tai was using to execute the strike was completely cut off at the wrist, spouting out a steaming stream of fresh blood. His body was carried away by the force of inertia for more than ten meters.Duan Ling TIan looked towards the person who saved him.Clothed in a black garb that stuck tightly to his body and with a ghost mask on his face, the Crescent Saber in his hand was still dripping with Li Tai\u2019s blood\u2026\u201cGrade Eight Spirit Weapon!\u201dWith just a glance, Duan Ling Tian discerned the Crescent Saber\u2019s grade.\u201cHuh?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian noticed that the eyes behind the ghost mask had a smile flash within.So it was him!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled.\u201cYou\u2019re from Ghastly Shadow?\u201dAt this moment, after stopping his bleeding, the pale-faced Li Tai looked at the black-clothed person with a fearful expression.The black-clothed person ignored Li Tai.Instead he looked at Duan Ling Tian and asked, \u201cNow, do you want to post the assignment to kill Li Tai? If there\u2019s no need, I\u2019ll leave.\u201dDuan Ling Tian rolled his eyes at the black-clothed person as he angrily said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m posting it! You were concealed at the side and watching the show, right?\u201dThe black-clothed man laughed dryly and stepped out.Above his head, 120 ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared instantly like nimbus clouds covering the sky. Their imposing manner shot up into the heavens.\u201cNine\u2026 Ninth level of the Origin Core Stage!\u201dLi Tai\u2019s face distorted.\u201c1,000,000, 1,000,000 silver\u2026 I\u2019ll pay 1,000,000 silver to buy Duan Ling Tian\u2019s life!\u201d Li Tai said in panic.A powerhouse at the ninth level of the Origin Core Stage, not mentioning how he had lost the use of his prominent arm, even if he was at full strength, he would still not necessarily be the black-clothed man\u2019s match.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, his life\u2026 is far more valuable than 1,000,000!\u201dThe black-clothed man gave Li Tai a reply.Li Tai\u2019s face turned grim.Flee!He didn\u2019t dare to hesitate; he turned around and fled, transforming into a string of afterimages as he executed his movement technique to its limits.However, the black-clothed man\u2019s speed was even faster, seeming like a ghost as he caught up in the blink of an eye.Om!A white light flashed past.Li Tai\u2019s body jerked before flying out. His hand grasped his throat but was unable to stop his blood from spouting out.The dignified Grand Elder of the Li Clan, his life ended in such a way.Only now did the black-clothed man remove his mask.It was precisely the medicine store manager!Seeing the face of the black-clothed man, Duan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t one bit surprised, as he had long ago noticed his identity.But he was still shocked at his cultivation level.Ninth level of the Origin Core Stage.Such a cultivation, it was comparable to the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Ao.\u201cManager, I\u2019ve known you for so long, but I seem to not know your name.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered as he stared fixedly at the black-clothed man.\u201cIn the day, I\u2019m called Bull Tang[1]. At night, I\u2019m Tang Ying, codenamed Blood Crescent.\u201dTang Ying laughed.\u201cBull Tang?\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth twitched.No matter what, it was difficult for him to compare the decisive and ruthless Ghastly Shadow assassin from before with this name.Abruptly, Tang Ying looked at Duan Ling Tian and asked, \u201cThe inscription you used before, was it the Blood Crescent Inscription?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cYou inscribed it yourself?\u201d Tang Ying asked.\u201cYes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded once more.Tang Ying gave Duan Ling Tian a deep glance, and sized him up. \u201cI really want to take you back, cut you open, and see what other secrets you have\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face froze. \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\u201cI want some Blood Crescent Inscriptions,\u201d Tang Ying abruptly said.\u201cSure, but you prepare your own materials. Also, I\u2019ll be taking 100,000 silver per Blood Crescent Inscription as my inscribing fee.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of cunning.\u201cYou\u2026 so ruthless.\u201dThe corners of Tang Ying\u2019s mouth twitched, but he still said, \u201cAgreed!\u201dBefore Tang Yin left, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help himself from asking, \u201cIn these past few days, were you always following behind me?\u201dTang Ying rolled his eyes at Duan Ling Tian as he said, in an angry tone, \u201cDid you think I\u2019m you, someone with so much free time? I still have to take care of my shop in the day\u2026 I ordered my men to surveil Li Tai, and when he left Aurora City, I followed him. I was curious about why you were so confident in your ability to kill Li Tai.\u201cIn the end, someone actually failed miserably. Hahahaha\u2026\u201dAs he finished speaking, Tang Ying couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.The corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cNo matter what, I still owe you my life, so I\u2019ll do the first ten inscriptions for free.\u201dDuan Ling Tian wasn\u2019t one who like to owe people.\u201cSo generous? Then I won\u2019t be stingy either; the assignment fee for killing Li Tai, consider it free.\u201dTang Ying looked at Duan Ling Tian with a slightly surprised gaze, then his body moved like a ghost, disappearing from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s field of vision in a few movements.\u201cLooks like when it relates to my life, I can\u2019t be too stingy\u2026\u201dThis lesson was something Duan Ling Tian remembered deep in his heart.Suddenly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears slightly moved and his face turned grim.He noticed that a group of people was moving towards here from afar.He didn\u2019t have time to deal with Li Tai\u2019s body. He flew up onto a tree and concealed himself there, overlooking what happened below.After a short moment, seven youths walked over in large strides.Crests were pinned on the clothes of these youths.Wang Clan.\u201cCould it be the members of Triumph City\u2019s Wang Clan?\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.Around the Misty Forest, there were three cities, namely Aurora City, Aqua Mist City, and Triumph City.The Nascent Soul powerhouse he met earlier in the Misty Forest, He Zu Dao, was precisely from Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan.A young man noticed Li Tai\u2019s body and exclaimed, \u201cEh, there\u2019s a corpse here!\u201d\u201cHumph! You don\u2019t have enough strength, but you dared to enter the inner area of the Misty Forest; serves you right that you died,\u201d one of the people who walked over said disdainfully.\u201cNo\u2026He wasn\u2019t killed by fierce beasts. Look, the place where his arm was cut off is smooth, and his throat was cut by a weapon,\u201d one of the more careful young women said.\u201cIt really is true. Eh, there\u2019s a crest on his clothes.\u201dOne of the young men walked up and wiped clean the crest on Li Tai\u2019s body.Immediately, many of them exclaimed, \u201cLi Clan!\u201dThese people noticing the identity of Li Tai didn\u2019t cause Duan Ling Tian to feel panicked.No one would think that he had the strength to kill Li Tai.\u201cHumph! So it turned out to be a member of the Li Clan. Serves him right.\u201dA blue-clothed young man seemed to be enraged when the Li Clan was mentioned.\u201cYeah, the members of the Li Clan are so detestable. Wang Huai\u2019s younger brother, Wang Zhen, came to the Misty Forest to hunt a Black Python the other time. At the critical juncture, it was a Li Clan youth and young girl who took their gains from behind them. Not only did they take all the benefits, they even killed the few outer court disciples of our Wang Clan that were still alive.\u201d\u201cLuckily, Wang Zhen was born with a heart that was inclined sideways; otherwise, I\u2019m afraid he would have become another wandering ghost of the Misty Forest.\u201d\u201cEven then, Wang Zhen\u2019s internal organs were still pierced through, and he is still recuperating\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Wang Zheng\u2019s current body circumstances being unsuitable to travel, the Patriarch would have long since brought Wang Zhen to the Li Clan to identify the murderer and denounce his crimes.\u201d\u201cOnce Wang Zhen\u2019s recovers, I want to go to the Li Clan as well. I want to see who is so vicious.\u201d\u2026\u2026The group of Triumph City\u2019s Wang Clan disciples discussed.Their casual discussion, however, entering Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears, causing him to be slightly moved.Black Python?Stealing gains from behind them?The Li Clan youth and young girl these people were talking about, wasn\u2019t it Ke Er and him?\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019d have such \u2018good\u2019 luck,. Who would\u2019ve thought that I\u2019d bump into a person who had an inclined heart.\u201dDuan Ling Tian had the desire to spit blood.According to his knowledge, a person who was born with an inclined heart was 1 in 10,000.Although he had killed many people during his previous lifetime, he had not even once bumped into a person with an inclined heart.In this lifetime, altogether, he had only killed just a few people, but he actually bumped into this type of a person.Such lousy luck!\u201cWhat should we do with this old guy from the Li Clan?\u201d\u201cI think we should send him back to the Li Clan\u2026 Like this, the Li Clan would owe our Wang Clan a favor, and maybe when the Patriarch takes Wang Zhen to identify the murderer, the Li Clan will look upon this favor and be willing to hand the murderer over to us.\u201d\u201cYou have a point.\u201d\u2026\u2026Seeing the Wang Clan group of young men and women taking Li Tai\u2019s corpse away, Duan Ling Tian jumped off the tree and left the Misty Forest.After returning to Aurora City, he didn\u2019t return to the Li Clan straight away.He instead went to the medicine store to look for Tang Ying.\u201cSo anxious to see me. Did something happen?\u201dTang Ying was slightly surprised when he saw Duan Ling Tian arrive.\u201cI want to post an assignment.\u201dDuan Ling Tian went straight to the point.\u201cTarget?\u201d Tang Ying asked.\u201cWang Zhen\u2026a member of the Triumph City\u2019s Wang Clan,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said slowly.As far as he was concerned, Wang Zhen staying alive was a potential threat to him.He had to be removed!\u201cTriumph City?\u201dTang Ying frowned slightly. \u201cIn Triumph City, our Ghastly Shadow has another person in charge\u2026 That person doesn\u2019t have a very good relationship with me, so I\u2019m unable to cross my boundaries for this matter, but you can sneak into Triumph City yourself and go post an assignment at the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s point of operations in Triumph City.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1](TL Note \u2013 I know I\u2019ve always been TL-ing names in Pinyin and this is slightly inconsistent. But I feel it sounds better than calling him Tang A Niu/Tang Ah Niu, which is the Pinyin of his name and means cow/bull. Btw small note to make the next few lines make more sense, the name A Niu \u963f\u725b is a common name people use in villages.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t want to come watch the scene? I heard it was Triumph City\u2019s Wang Clan members that found Grand Elder\u2019s corpse\u2026 Hmm, Grand Elder\u2019s death will cause Li Qing to completely lack anyone to rely on.\u201dAs she finished speaking, Li Fei\u2019s gaze was slightly complicated.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re worried about him?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s brows slightly twitched.\u201cNo, I\u2019m just musing\u2026 Li Qing is the same as me, his parents died in the calamity that year as well, and he lived together with his grandfather since he was small.\u201dLi Fei shook her head.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.Meanwhile, he had brought Ke Er and Li Fei to stand at the front of the crowd.In the Martial Arts Practice Field, besides Li Ao, the group of Li Clan Elders was present and stood behind him.Opposite them, there were seven young adults standing, both men and women.Between the two groups of people, Grand Elder Li Tai lied there in a wretched state. Besides his right hand being broken, his throat was sliced open by a weapon as well.Li Ao and the group of Li Clan Elders didn\u2019t have very good expressions on their faces.Li Ao looked at the seven Wang Clan members and asked, \u201cYoung men and young woman of the Wang Clan, when you found the Grand Elder\u2019s corpse, did you notice anything else in his surroundings?\u201d\u201cPatriarch Li, we examined the surroundings, but we didn\u2019t discover anything,\u201d one of the Wang Clan disciples said.\u201cThank you for your troubles. Since it\u2019s a matter of great importance, the Li Clan is unable to entertain everyone at the moment\u2026 Consider these Origin Increasing Pills a gift from me.\u201dLi Ao withdrew a bottle of Origin Increasing Pills and passed it over.The Wang Clan disciples received the medicinal pills with delighted expressions.\u201cPatriarch Li, we understand. Farewell.\u201dThe seven members of the Wang Clan came and went like the wind.\u201cGrandfather!\u201dSuddenly, a shrill and sad cry sounded from outside the crowd.A youth in white clothes rammed straight through the crowd and knelt down beside Li Tai\u2019s corpse. His body trembled as he cried his heart out.It was precisely Li Qing!\u201cLi Qing, don\u2019t grief too much and accept the inevitable changes\u2026 Our Li Clan will surely spare no efforts to investigate and get to the bottom of this matter. We will give Grand Elder justice,\u201d Patriarch Li Ao consoled.\u201cInvestigate? You don\u2019t have to investigate, I know who the murderer is!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s eyes were crimson red as he lifted his head up with a vicious expression.\u201cYou know?\u201dLi Ao was stunned.\u201cLi Qing, if you know, you can speak out\u2026 I want to know who is so bold to dare kill our Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder. Does he really think our Li Clan is easy to bully?\u201d an old man behind Li Ao said, in a low voice which had infinite rage mixed within.\u201cYes! Killing the Grand Elder is no different from slapping our Li Clan in the face. Li Qing, you don\u2019t have to be afraid; you can speak out.\u201d\u201cI want to know as well. Who the hell has such tremendous bravery?!\u201d\u201cIf we can find this person, we must shred his body into 10,000 bits!\u201d\u2026\u2026Each and every Li Clan Elder was filled with fury.The gazes from the surrounding crowd all descended upon Li Qing.They all wanted to know who the murderer Li Qing spoke of was.Eventually, Li Qing\u2019s gaze swept through the crowd\u2026In the end, it fixed itself on a violet figure.\u201cPatriarch, it\u2019s him, Duan Ling Tian!\u201dLi Qing pointed towards the violet-clothed youth with a face full of rage.Noticing Li Qing pointing at him and even proclaiming him as the murderer, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s facial expression remained unchanged as he looked Li Qing in the eye calmly in a very tranquil manner.After hearing what Li Qing said, everyone present followed Li Qing\u2019s finger and their gazes all descended upon the violet-clothed youth.For a moment, the entire scene lost control.\u201cIs Li Qing mad? He actually said that the murderer is Duan Ling Tian!\u201d\u201cWhat a joke. Even if Duan Ling Tian consumed a Spirit Fruit once and his fleshly body has an extra strength of two ancient mammoths compared to ordinary martial artists, even though he has broken through to the Core Formation Stage, his strength is merely compared to a martial artist at the third level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201d\u201cKilling Grand Elder, who was at the eighth level of the Origin Core Stage, with the strength of a third level Core Formation martial artist? To think Li Qing is able to say such a thing.\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have gone mad from the news of Grand Elder\u2019s death, right? Duan Ling Tian? How could that be possible!\u201d\u201cThis Li Qing couldn\u2019t be thinking of using the power of the clan to settle a personal grudge, right? I heard that during the Hidden Dragon List competition, because of him being overbearing, Duan Ling Tian cut off his finger\u2026 Could it be because of this matter?\u201d\u201cEven if he wanted to use the clan\u2019s power to take revenge on a personal grudge, he should at least find a logical excuse.\u201d\u201cYeah, actually framing Duan Ling Tian as the murderer, who would believe that?\u201d\u2026\u2026The discussions of the crowd entered into Li Qing\u2019s ears and caused his expression to become ghastly pale.\u201cI\u2019m not lying. Duan Ling Tian is the murderer, he\u2019s the murderer!\u201d Li Qing bellowed, abruptly standing up and moving. He exploded forth with his entire strength of three ancient mammoths, flashing towards Duan Ling Tian like a madman.Swimming Dragon Steps!Dark Nether Finger!His first move was directly a killing move. His finger went straight for Duan Ling Tian\u2019s vital points.\u201cLi Qing!\u201d Patriarch Li Ao\u2019s expression turned grim as he shouted in a low voice.But how would the current Li Qing pay attention to Li Ao?\u201cYou don\u2019t know your own limits!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze turned cold as he stepped forward. Too lazy to use martial skills, he casually swung his fist out.Four ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed above him.Bang!His fist flew towards Li Qing at a speed much faster than his finger and blasted Li Qing flying.Li Qing loudly crashed on the floor with an ugly expression.He struggled to stand up and desired to attack once more.\u201cEnough!\u201dLi Ao\u2019s lofty figure blocked in front of Li Qing, his gaze cold and indifferent. \u201cLi Qing, if you can bring forth evidence, then speak\u2026 If you want to use Grand Elder\u2019s death as a means to settle your personal grudges with Duan Ling Tian, I\u2019ll punish you according to the Clan\u2019s rules right now! Don\u2019t forget, Grand Elder is your grandfather; his body hasn\u2019t even gotten cold, but you\u2019re already busy trying to take revenge. How could he die contently in the nether world?\u201d\u201cPatriarch!\u201dLi Qing knelt down sorrowfully. \u201cI\u2019m not using my grandfather\u2019s death to take revenge on a personal grudge, and every single word I say is true.\u201d\u201cThen speak. Why do you say Duan Ling Tian is the murderer?\u201d Li Ao asked, in a heavy voice.The gazes of everyone present fell onto Li Qing.\u201cPatriarch, since my grandfather is already dead now, I won\u2019t continue to conceal some matters.\u201dLi Qing took a deep breath as he slowly said, \u201cDuring the youth gathering, Duan Ling Tian cut off my finger and practically crippled my Dark Nether Finger. Grandfather was very furious about this matter, and on many occasions he said that he would find a chance to teach Duan Ling Tian a lesson\u2026\u201dHearing what Li Qing said, Li Ao\u2019s expression became ugly.Li Tai, no matter what, was still the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder, but he was such a narrow-minded person.The competition at the Hidden Dragon List youth gathering was something that had the unified acknowledgment of the three great clans of Aurora City and was thus extremely fair.Getting injured during a spar was unavoidable.The crowd went into an uproar.\u201cSo the Grand Elder was this sort of person.\u201d\u201cI even thought that the Grand Elder was different from us, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be the same as us, so much so that his selfishness was even greater\u2026 Li Qing was injured by Duan Ling Tian during the youth gathering; many people witnessed it, and it was Li Qing who was overbearing and Duan Ling Tian is not to be blamed.\u201d\u201cThink about it, Li Qing is his only grandson after all.\u201d\u201cHumph! To think that I actually respected the Grand Elder previously, but he was actually this sort of person.\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian had a weird gaze.Was this Li Qing an idiot?His grandfather was dead, and he actually ruined his grandfather\u2019s name like this\u2026He could imagine that if Li Tai rose from the dead, he would probably be angered to death by Li Qing.However.The current Li Qing had already lost all reason. He continued, \u201cIn these past few days, I noticed Duan Ling Tian going to the Misty Forest daily, so I told my grandfather. This morning, my grandfather followed behind Duan Ling Tian\u2026 but I never expected that what came back to me was instead my grandfather\u2019s corpse.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, tell me, if the murderer isn\u2019t Duan Ling Tian, then who could it be?\u201d Li Qing hysterically asked.He didn\u2019t notice, however, that Li Ao\u2019s expression was becoming darker by the second.Hua!Practically at the moment Li Qing finished speaking, the crowd went into an uproar once again.\u201cHe followed Duan Ling Tian into the Misty Forest? This doesn\u2019t seem like purely planning to teach Duan Ling Tian a lesson\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce Duan Ling Tian enters the Misty Forest, even if he died, nobody would ever suspect the Grand Elder.\u201d\u201cGrand Elder is too tyrannical. Li Qing only had his finger cut off, and it was even reconnected later\u2026 For this reason, he actually wanted to kill Duan Ling Tian.\u201d\u201cGrand Elder is too frightening.\u201d\u2026\u2026All of the Li Clan disciples\u2019 expressions froze for a moment.He had followed Duan Ling Tian into the Misty Forest purely to teach him a lesson?Only an idiot would believe that!\u201cLi Qing, don\u2019t talk nonsense. How could Grand Elder be this sort of person?\u201d Li Ao\u2019s face was grim as he shouted in a stern voice.\u201cYes, I believe that with the way Grand Elder has always conducted himself, it\u2019s absolutely impossible for him to do such a thing.\u201d\u201cI believe that as well.\u201d\u201cLi Qing, don\u2019t let revenge blind your eyes. Slandering your grandfather just to satisfy your own selfish desire for revenge is something you really shouldn\u2019t do!\u201d\u2026\u2026The Li Clan Elders voiced their opinions.What a joke.There were so many Li Clan disciples present right now.Even if Grand Elder Li Tai had really done this, they would still not admit it, as the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder didn\u2019t just represent a person, he represented the entire Li Clan.\u201cPatriarch, I\u2019m not lying!\u201dNoticing that no one believed him, Li Qing immediately got anxious and howled.\u201cEnough!\u201d Li Ao bellowed. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Enforcement Elder?\u201d\u201cPatriarch!\u201dAmong the elders that stood behind Li Ao, a black-robed old man walked out.\u201cLi Qing slandered our Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder. Take him away and give him 30 paddle strikes as a warning to other clan members!\u201d Li Ao ordered.\u201cYes, Patriarch.\u201dThe Enforcement Elder walked out in large strides and grabbed ahold of Li Qing like how an eagle would catch a chick.\u201cPatriarch, I\u2019m telling the truth, I\u2019m telling the truth\u2026\u201dAs he was dragged away by the Enforcement Elder, Li Qing continued to howl hysterically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who else would be punished besides him?\u201d\u201cIf the Grand Elder knew that his grandson would do this to him after his death, I wonder what he would think\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, even if the Grand Elder had the desire to kill Duan Ling Tian, it was still for his sake. The Grand Elder having had such a grandson, even in the netherworld, I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to die contently.\u201d\u201cChi! To think I used to respect him as my idol. I was really blind.\u201d\u201cYou should instead make Duan Ling Tian your idol. He\u2019s the top ranked in the Hidden Dragon List this year. Moreover, he\u2019s only sixteen, so he will surely be the top ranked in the Hidden Dragon List of the next two years.\u2026\u2026As they condemned him, they didn\u2019t forget to compare Duan Ling Tian to Li Qing.Everything was still fine before they started the comparisons.But as soon as they compared, Li Qing was trampled on and torn to pieces.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019d be so popular now.\u201dLi Fei looked at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cThat\u2019s why being able to become my wife is your fortune.\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed slyly.\u201cPei!\u201dWhen Li Fei noticed Ke Er looking at her with a smile, she instantly blushed.\u201cYoung Master, should I call Big Sister Li Fei \u2018Young Mistress\u2019 from now on?\u201dKe Er lightly smiled.\u201cKe Er, he\u2019s led you astray.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s cheeks, which were already blushing, now seemed to be so red that blood would drip out at any moment.Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter.Suddenly, his brows twitched.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, in one hour, I\u2019ll come look for you at your home.\u201dThis was Patriarch Li Ao\u2019s Origin Energy condensed into sound, so only Duan Ling Tian could hear it.Duan Ling Tian glanced at Li Ao before lightly nodding.He was prepared in his heart.Even if Li Ao thought that this matter wasn\u2019t related to him, because Li Qing had spoken against him to such an extent, the Li Clan would start with him to find the murderer.The crowd in the outer court Martial Arts Practice Field slowly dispersed.\u201cLet\u2019s go out for a spin. I need to buy some things,\u201d Li Fei suggested.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t accompany you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled apologetically.Li Fei\u2019s beautiful eyebrows knit as she asked, in an unsatisfied manner, \u201cWhat do you have to do?\u201d\u201cThe Patriarch condensed his Origin Enery into sound earlier and told me that he would come look for me at home in an hour\u2026 You can\u2019t be expecting me to stand up the Patriarch, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian laughed bitterly.\u201cWhat?! The Patriarch is looking for you? It can\u2019t be that he really thinks you killed the Grand Elder, right.\u201dLi Fei was stunned.Ke Er had a worried expression as well.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Patriarch probably just wants to ask if I have any clues. Even you two didn\u2019t believe it when Li Qing said I was able to kill the Grand Elder, let alone the Patriarch,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said, with an indifferent attitude.One hour later.Patriarch Li Ao arrived at the agreed time.Duan Ling Tian entertained him in his house\u2019s courtyard.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I know based on your strength that it\u2019s absolutely impossible for you to be the Grand Elder\u2019s murderer, but since the Grand Elder was following behind you, did you see him?\u201dLi Ao went straight to the point.He had complicated feelings towards Duan Ling Tian.He originally thought that Duan Ling Tian was only slightly stronger than Li Qing.But who would have known that during the youth gathering, he would have actually defeated both the Lin Clan\u2019s Lin Zhuo and the Xiao Clan\u2019s Xiao Yu.Forget Lin Zhuo.Xiao Yu was not only the Xiao Clan\u2019s top genius in the past 100 years, he was Aurora City\u2019s top genius in the past 100 years.Even he, the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, would frequently sigh.If Xiao Yu was a member of the Li Clan, how nice would that be.And now Duan Ling Tian had defeated Xiao Yu, truly giving him an extremely pleasant surprise.Most importantly, Duan Ling Tian was only sixteen.Younger than Xiao Yu by an entire two years.He could imagine that when Duan Ling Tian is eighteen, his strength will certainly be even stronger, leaving his peers far, far behind.\u201cPatriarch, I know what you mean. I entered the Misty Forest to wholeheartedly hunt fierce beasts, but I didn\u2019t find anything amiss, nor did I see the Grand Elder. Moreover, with the Grand Elder\u2019s strength, if he wanted to follow me, it would be impossible for me to notice.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Duan Ling Tian had a self-mocking expression.\u201cI understand this. I was just asking a routine question. Even if you couldn\u2019t notice the Grand Elder, you don\u2019t have to care about it\u2026 He was an Origin Core martial artist after all. With your natural talent, you can certainly surpass him before the age of thirty.\u201dLi Ao lightly nodded and consoled at the same time.\u201cI\u2019ll work hard.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded, his gaze firm as steel.Li Ao hesitated for a moment before speaking. \u201cAlso\u2026 About the other time, I hope you don\u2019t mind. I only did that for the sake of the Li Clan\u2019s face.\u201dAs far as he was concerned, the current Duan Ling Tian was no longer the Duan Ling Tian from before.Able to climb to the top of the Hidden Dragon list at the age of sixteen\u2026Since the appearance of the Aurora City\u2019s Hidden Dragon List, this was a first.Duan Ling Tian could be considered to have made history.Presently, even if Duan Ling Tian was only a Branch Family disciple, and only a disciple with another surname, he was still worthy of the Li Clan\u2019s attention.\u201cPatriarch, you worry too much.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.Li Ao withdrew a stack of silver bills and put it on the table as he said, with a light smile, \u201cThis silver is a small expression of goodwill from the Clan.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, this\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied.These silver bills were all of the largest denomination, one bill was worth 10,000 silver.This thick and heavy stack would probably be around 1,000,000 silver.\u201cYou brought honor to the Clan during this year\u2019s Hidden Dragon List, and this is the Clan\u2019s reward to you\u2026 I\u2019ve already spoken with the three alchemist elders of the clan. If you need anything to be refined, you can buy your own materials and ask them to refine it for you. They won\u2019t ask you for any money.\u201dLi Ao lightly smiled.Being placed first on the Hidden Dragon List was an honor no one in the Li Clan had achieved in the past ten years.This time, Duan Ling Tian had brought great face to the Li Clan.Recalling back to when he met with the Xiao Clan\u2019s and the Lin Clan\u2019s Patriarchs and saw their envious and jealous expressions, he felt a wave of satisfaction in his heart.\u201cThank you, Patriarch.\u201dDuan Ling Tian hurriedly expressed his gratitude.\u201cIf you want to refine weapon, you can look for Elder Li De. You\u2019re on good terms with Li Fei, so I think that out of consideration towards Li Fei, he would be willing to refine a Spirit Weapon for you,\u201d Li Ao continued.Li De?Duan Ling Tian was dazed.\u201cPatriarch, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. If Ling Tian really wants me to refine a Spirit Weapon for him, even if I have to risk this old life, I would still help him.\u201dJust at this moment, a hearty voice sounded, breaking the momentary silence.Duan Ling Tian saw Li Fei supporting her grandfather as they slowly walked over.Duan Ling Tian finally realized.So it turned out that Li Fei\u2019s grandfather was the Elder Li Dei that the Patriarch spoke off.His eyes flashed with a trace of being emotionally moved.He knew that it was surely Li Fei being worried that he would suffer a loss, so she had brought the old man over to help take care of him.\u201cElder Li De!\u201dSeeing the old man, Li Ao hurriedly stood up. His tone was filled with respect.The Li Clan had three Grade Nine Alchemists.However, after his father, the previous Patriarch, left, there was only Li De as the sole Grade Nine Weapons Craftsman.\u201cPatriarch, you don\u2019t have to stand on formalities,\u201d Li De said indifferently.Suddenly, Li Ao\u2019s pupils constricted.His gaze fell upon the Weapons Craftsman Guild crest on Li De.The piercing red Grade Eight on it caused his heart to tremble.Li Ao took a deep breath as he asked, in a slightly discomposed manner, \u201cElder Li De, you\u2026 you\u2019ve broken through to become a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsman?\u201d\u201cPatriarch\u2019s eyes are sharp indeed.\u201dLi De lightly nodded.Gaining confirmation, Li Ao\u2019s breathing become hurried, and his chest rose and fell like a bellow.According to what he knew, within Aurora City in the past, only the Weapons Craftsman Guild\u2019s Guild Master was a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsman.But now their Li Clan actually had a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsman as well.This was a piece of shockingly good news!\u201cCongratulations, Elder Li De, on achieving your wish of becoming a Grade Eight Weapons Craftsmen. Since elder Li Dei has matters to discuss with Duan Ling Tian, I\u2019ll take my leave first,\u201d Li Ao said to Li De, then he nodded to Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei before leaving.\u201cRascal, he didn\u2019t make things difficult for you, right?\u201d Li Fei asked concernedly.\u201cNo, the Patriarch came to gift me some money.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards the stack of silver bills on the table.Li Fei went and looked through it for a moment before exclaiming, \u201c1,000,000 silver\u2026 The Patriarch is really generous!\u201d\u201cLing Tian, you\u2019re current net worth will probably soon be higher than mine.\u201dLi De laughed.\u201cGrandfather, how can I compare to you? You only refined weapons for people inside the clan use and didn\u2019t really take any fees for your work; otherwise, your wealth would probably be innumerable since long ago.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.These were things he had found out from Li Fei.\u201cLooks like Fei sold me out long ago. The hearts of girls need to reside with their men.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Li De heaved a sigh. \u201cA grown girl can\u2019t be kept at home anymore\u2026\u201dLi Fei hurriedly grabbed Li De\u2019s arm as she said, in a spoiled manner, \u201cGrandfather, what are you talking about? I\u2019ll always be your lovely granddaughter.\u201d\u201cElder Li De.\u201dHearing activity, Li Rou walked out of her room and looked at the old man in a slightly respectful manner.\u201cYou\u2019re Ling Tian\u2019s mother, right? You have a good son\u2026\u201dLi De nodded to Li Rou and smiled, his expression amiable.\u201cElder, you\u2019re too kind,\u201d Li Rou modestly said.Li De lightly smiled as he asked, \u201cI came here today because I wanted to ask your opinion on a matter\u2026 Look, Ling Tian and my granddaughter can be considered to be in love with each other, so why don\u2019t we set a marriage for them? How about it?\u201d\u201cGrandfather!\u201dLi Fei blushed. She was unaware of Li De\u2019s decision.\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to marry Ling Tian?\u201dLi De teased.\u201cGrandfather, you\u2018re bullying Fei!\u201dLi Fei lowered her heard, not daring to look at Li Rou or Duan Ling Tian.\u201cElder, I naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse this matter. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s fine as long as Tian is happy. But I still have to let Elder know, my son has already set another marriage previously,\u201d Li Rou said.\u201cI know of this, it\u2019s that girl Ke Er, right?\u201dLi De nodded.\u201cGreetings Elder.\u201dAt this moment, Ke Er had heard the voice and came out as well. She bowed to the old man.\u201cAs expected, a good girl with a beautiful appearance and clever in mind\u2026 Ling Tian has really good fortune.\u201dLi De sized up Ke Er for a moment, and under Ke Er\u2019s delicate and perturbed gaze, he emitted a satisfied smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s only a fixing, we haven\u2019t really gotten married yet.\u201dLi Fei rolled her eyes at Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes burned as he sized up Li Fei\u2019s hot body, swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and said greedily, \u201cGrandfather has already said that in two years, once I\u2019m eighteen, we\u2019ll get married. Little Fei, why not sleep here tonight?\u201d\u201cYou wish.\u201dLi Fei had a vigilant expression, moving gracefully as she rushed into her room, and shut the door with a bang.Duan Ling Tian could only leave while laughing bitterly.When he returned home, Duan Ling Tian noticed that Ke Er was still waiting for him.\u201cSilly girl.\u201dDuan Ling Tian extended his hand and wrapped it around Ke Er\u2019s waist as he pulled her into an embrace and carried her off back to her room.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dJust when Duan Ling Tian was about to leave, Ke Er called him lightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian wondered.\u201cYoung Master, accompany Ke Er tonight, OK?\u201d Ke Er said, in a delicate and touching manner.After taking off his outer garments and getting on the bed, Duan Ling Tian embraced Ke Er in his arms as he asked, in a gentle tone, \u201cSilly girl, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, when you have Big Sister Fei Fei in the future, will you not want Ke Er anymore?\u201dThe young girl voiced out her worries.\u201cSilly girl, remember this: you\u2019re mine for your entire lifetime, no one can change that\u2026 Your place in my heart is something no one can replace, understand?\u201dDuan Ling Tian hugged the young girl and comforted her lightly. It was unusual that he didn\u2019t do anything else to her.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dThe young girl tightly hugged Duan Ling Tian as she sank into a deep slumber.Early morning the next day, during breakfast.\u201cMom, Ke Er, I\u2019m going out for a few days. Don\u2019t wait for me at night these next few days and sleep early,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said in advance.\u201cBe careful.\u201dLi Rou nodded.Although Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t say what he was going to do, she knew that he definitely had something to deal with.Her son had grown up; he wasn\u2019t the baby eagle that used to be curled up under her wings anymore.\u201cYoung Master, when will you be back?\u201d Ke Er asked.Duan Ling Tian pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIn four days\u2026 If Little Fei comes looking for me, let her know.\u201dHe was planning to head to Triumph City.The current him had a standing in the Li Clan; he had even obtained the protection of the Li Clan\u2019s one and only Grade Eight Weapons Craftsman, meaning that he didn\u2019t have to be afraid of Triumph City\u2019s Wang Clan bringing the \u2018fish that escaped the net\u2019 to come denounce his crimes.Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t want to expose himself in front of the Wang Clan.Once he was exposed, the Li Clan could protect him for some time, but it couldn\u2019t protect him for an eternity.He had to eradicate the source of his problems to prevent any future troubles.After exiting the Li Clan Estate, Duan Ling Tian removed the Li Clan crest from his clothes and placed it inside his Spatial Ring.The Spatial Ring had been covered with a dark grey-colored metal layer by Duan Ling Tian using his refinement methods. It now looked like it was an ordinary ring, and as such he conveniently wore it on his hand.After going to the trade market and buying a horse and some dry rations to eat on the way, Duan Ling Tian departed Aurora City.Aurora City, Aqua Mist City, and Triumph City were in a triangular position surrounding the Misty Forest within.The distance from Aurora City to Triumph City was not one tad shorter than the distance of a round trip to the Misty Forest and back to Aurora City.Even if he galloped all the way to Triumph City with his horse, it would still take him eight or nine hours.Duan Ling Tian departed in the morning and passed the Misty Forest at noon, then headed towards the other side of the large road swiftly.Dusk.The outline of Triumph City appeared before Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes.Under his agitated mood, he spurred his horse to go even faster and galloped onwards.\u201cGo!\u201d\u201cGo!\u201dJust at this moment, Duan Ling Tian heard two voices come from behind him, one male and one female.Turning around to take a look, he noticed a youth and young girl galloping their horses. They were running madly, their speeds extremely swift.The youth and young girl were around the age of seventeen.Their clothes were gorgeous, obviously having an extraordinary background.\u201cFerghana Horse!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze quickly descended upon the fine steeds beneath them.He could see the two steeds sweat out drops of blood as they galloped.In terms of speed, they were completely incomparable to the horse under him.\u201cFerghana horse, one is worth 10,000 gold, and they are extremely rare\u2026\u201d Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.In the Cloud Continent, one gold would be equal to 100 silver.In other words, a Ferghana Horse was worth 1,000,000 silver.Even the Patriarchs of Aurora City\u2019s three great clans weren\u2019t so extravagant.He guessed that this pair of youths weren\u2019t from the three cities that surrounded the Misty Forest.\u201cCould it be that they are from County City?\u201dThe Crimson Sky Kingdom was divided into 18 counties. These 18 counties had eighteen respective county cities at a scale only inferior to the Imperial City.And below every county city, there were 81 smaller cities.\u201cHalt.\u201dTaking a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian stopped his horse and made it leap to the side of the road.He wasn\u2019t willing to get into any unwanted trouble.But sometimes, even though he didn\u2019t want any unwanted trouble, it didn\u2019t mean others wouldn\u2019t provoke him.\u201cSister Ru, do you see that commoner ahead? Scared to the side of the road just by noticing us\u2026\u201dThe youth who was madly galloping his horse laughed loudly.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid he will be knocked flying by our Ferghana Horses.\u201dThe young girl laughed as well.The youth\u2019s gaze flickered as he asked, \u201cSister Ru, why don\u2019t we have a competition?\u201d\u201cHow will we compete?\u201dThe young girl was interested as well.\u201cWe\u2019ll see who can reach the commoner\u2019s side first and be the first to hit him off his horse with their horsewhip\u2026 how about it?\u201dThe youth laughed.\u201cOK! Go!\u201d the young girl replied as her horsewhip descended unto her Ferghana Horse.Immediately, the Ferghana Horse galloped like the wind.\u201cSister Ru, you\u2019re being shameless!\u201d the youth exclaimed before following her.Duan Ling Tian naturally didn\u2019t hear their conversation.Duan Ling Tian looked from afar at the youth and young girl who were galloping over and planned to continue his journey after they passed, as he wanted to avoid any unwanted troubles.Unexpectedly.Whoosh!The young girl was in the lead as she passed by Duan Ling Tian first, giving rise to a surge of fierce winds.Suddenly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned grim.He noticed the horsewhip in the young girl\u2019s hand jerk as it was suffused with Origin Energy. It was actually whipping down towards him, flashing straight for his face\u2026Above the young girl, two ancient mammoth silhouettes formed.A seventeen-year-old at the first level of the Core Formation Stage!Whoosh!The horsewhip hadn\u2019t arrived in front of him yet, but he could already feel the sharp breeze hitting his face as the whip approached, causing him to feel a slight pain.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression sunk.In the blink of an eye, his hand grabbed out.Exploding forth with a strength close to the strength of three ancient mammoths, two ancient mammoth silhouettes formed above Duan Ling Tian\u2026Pa!Duan Ling Tian easily caught hold of the horse whip.The young girl obviously didn\u2019t expect Duan Ling Tian to be able to catch her whip. At the same moment that she was stunned, she unconsciously tried to pull the horsewhip out of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand.\u201cHumph!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze turned cold as he exerted force with his hand.Bang!The Ferghana Horse continued to gallop on by itself, but the young girl, however, was pulled off her horse by Duan Ling Tian and emitted a shrill cry.\u201cSister Ru! Halt\u201dThe expression of the youth that was following from behind distorted as he stopped his horse, quickly flashed to the side of the young girl, and supported the young girl up.\u201cThird Brother, it hurts.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s face was pale.\u201cCommoner, do you know who we are?\u201dThe youth\u2019s face was grim and his voice was incomparably cold and indifferent.Duan Ling Tian frowned and indifferently said, \u201cI don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not interested to know.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dThe youth\u2019s face distorted and his body jerked, flying straight out.Instantly, four ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above the youth, revealing his cultivation.Third level of the Core Formation Stage!Duan Ling Tian was slightly moved.Third level of the Core Formation Stage at an age around seventeen\u2026His natural talent was even more abnormal than Xiao Yu\u2019s!Bang!The youth dashed forward, his speed like lightning, and slapped out a palm that hit the steed under Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face twitched as he kicked on the steed\u2019s body and jumped off.The steed emitted a shrill cry as it flew out and then lied there without a sound.Dead.\u201cDie!\u201dThe youth\u2019s icy cold gaze stared fixedly at Duan Ling Tian.Whoosh!His body flew like the wind as his palm slapped out once again.More than ten palm images condensed from Origin Energy formed into a line in the air, whistling as they descended, and enveloped Duan Ling Tian.\u201cA high grade Profound Rank martial skill at the perfection stage!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The youth\u2019s offensive martial skill was not one bit weaker than Xiao Yu\u2019s Sleeve Dimension.Combined with the youth\u2019s cultivation being a level higher than Xiao Yu\u2019s, even Xiao Yu would find it difficult to take a palm strike from the youth.\u201cYou can consider bumping into me your bad luck!\u201d Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were cold as he moved forward and intercepted the attack.Exploding forth with the strength of nearly five ancient mammoths\u2026Sword Drawing Arts!Whoosh!A dark violet sword shine was like a shadow that followed his hand.\u201cAh!\u201dThe youth emitted a shrill cry as his body was blasted flying. He crashed on the ground afar in a sorry state and rolled on the ground in pain.An arm that was sliced off at the shoulder dropped on the ground.\u201cThird Brother!\u201dThe young girl was muddled.\u201cGrandpa Huai!\u201dThe young girl called out in sorrow, her voice spreading far away.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian clearly saw that far away behind on the road, there was an elderly figure galloping over\u2026In Duan Ling Tian\u2019s field of vision, this figure started off at the size of an ant, became the size of a fist, and was still becoming larger as time went by\u2026Closer and closer!\u201cNot good!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned gloomy as he realized how formidable this figure was. He stomped on the ground and dropped onto the youth\u2019s Ferghana Horse.Flee!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s legs clamped onto the steed\u2019s waist as he galloped forward, dashing like the wind.Looking at Triumph City, which was nearby, and then turning around to look at the old man that was getting closer, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression sunk.Now he only hoped that the old man would take time to attend to the youth\u2019s injuries and help the youth connect his sliced off arm.Or else he would surely die!The speed of this old man was far swifter than the Li Clan\u2019s Grand Elder, Li Tai.To the extent that his speed wasn\u2019t inferior to Aqua Mist City\u2019s Supreme Elder, He Zu Dao.Obviously, this was a Nascent Soul Powerhouse.As he galloped his horse and flew forward, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart filled with a sense of uneasiness and anxiousness. What he was afraid of the most was the old man abandoning the youth to chase after him\u2026With the old man\u2019s strength, once he caught up to him, it would be impossible for him to survive.\u201cFaster, faster!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s legs unceasingly pressed upon the Ferghana Horse\u2019s waist to urge it forward. His heart was burning with anxiety.Even though the Ferghana Horse\u2019s speed was double the speed of his previous horse\u2026At this moment, he still felt it to be too slow!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Faster! Faster!At this instant, Duan Ling Tian wished he could attach wings to himself and fly straight into Triumph City.As long as he entered the city, he would be safe.Eventually, under Duan Ling Tian\u2019s perturbed and fearful gaze, the old man stopped, obviously going to look at the youth\u2019s injuries.\u201cHu!\u201dDuan Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief. Only now did he realize that his clothes had long been drenched with cold sweat.At this moment, he felt like he had abruptly risen to the heavens from hell.Even though the old man didn\u2019t continue to pursue him, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t dare to hesitate as he rode his Ferghana Horse directly into the city.He heard the exclamations of bystanders the instant he entered the city.\u201cLook!\u201d\u201cAnother Ferghana Horse!\u201d\u201cCould it be that the Ferghana Horse that passed by earlier was his?\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian heard the discussions of the crowd.He frowned as he directly jumped off the steed, and while everyone present had their gazes on the Ferghana Horse, he seized the opportunity and left.He concealed himself inside the crowded streets and vanished.\u201cCould it be that the trend nowadays is to throw Ferghana Horses about?\u201d\u201cThis is a Ferghana Horse that\u2019s worth 10,000 gold\u2026 But that youth seemed to throw it away like throwing trash.\u201dMany people were dumbstruck.Whoosh!Just at this moment, the gazes of everyone present moved towards the direction of the city\u2019s gate.An elderly figure dragged out a string of afterimages as he instantly arrived before the Ferghana Horse.\u201cDid anyone see the violet-clothed youth that galloped into the city?\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes were like lightning as they swept past the crowd, causing them to feel chills running down their spines.\u201cHe went that way!\u201dSomeone pointed out the direction that Duan Ling Tian left in.Whoosh!The old man\u2019s figure disappeared into the crowd.\u201cSo fast!\u201d\u201cToo fast, I\u2019m a Core Formation martial artist, but I couldn\u2019t even catch the shadow of his figure.\u201d\u201cProbably an Origin Core Stage powerhouse.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen the Zhong Clan\u2019s Second Elder, Zhong Ying, battle; Zhong Ying is a martial artist at the seventh level of the Origin Core Stage, but his speed didn\u2019t seem to be as fast as this.\u2026\u2026The crowd was in an uproar.Duan Ling Tian twisted and turned, circling around more than half of Triumph City, until night fell. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief.Duan Ling Tian glanced at the clothes on his body as he said to himself, \u201cNow I need to change my clothes, or else it will be too obvious.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian noticed a figure walking towards him.Looking at the figure, it was a youth that had a similar height as him.\u201cMom and Dad will surely be very happy. From tomorrow onwards, I\u2019ll be a servant of the Zhong Clan, and my monthly pay will be ten silver,\u201c the youth muttered to himself, and then he started humming a song as he walked into the alley.But he quickly quieted down because his throat seemed to be gripped.Under the moonlight, the dark violet sharp sword flickered with an icy cold brilliance.The youth was so scared that he shut his eyes and fearfully said, \u201cSpare my life, sir. I don\u2019t have any money, I really don\u2019t have any money.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly speechless.Who wants your money!?\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cAh! Sir, you\u2026you want to\u2026\u201dThe youth\u2019s body shivered, even his voice started to tremble.\u201cCut the crap, take off your clothes!\u201d Duan Ling Tian said slightly impatiently.\u201cYes, yes.\u201dThe youth nodded as he quickly removed his clothes.Duan Ling Tian removed the clothes on his body and changed into the youth\u2019s clothes.But when Duan Ling Tian finished changing, he noticed that the youth had removed his own pants and was leaning against the wall with his bare butt facing him. The youth\u2019s body was incessantly trembling. \u201cSir, you must be more gentle, I\u2026I\u2019m still a virgin\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian was utterly dumbfounded.This guy, what did he take him for?Even if he wanted to rape someone, he wouldn\u2019t need to go to the extent of finding a man, right?\u201cF**k off! I only want your clothes.\u201dDuan Ling Tian withdrew his sword and gave the youth a kick on the butt.The youth cried out in pain and said, with a wronged expression, \u201cSir, why didn\u2019t you say that earlier\u2026Wuwu\u2026My innocence\u2026\u201d\u201cDo I look like that sort of person?\u201d Duan Ling Tian muttered to himself while giving the youth a glare. He then left the alley.The night market of Triumph City was similar to Aurora City, bustling with noise and excitement.After buying a mask at one of the night market stalls and putting it on in a secluded place, Duan Ling Tian headed to Ghastly Shadow\u2019s point of operation in Triumph City.Tang Ying had told him beforehand of the location of Ghastly Shadows point of operations, so he quickly located it.He walked in with large strides and arrived before the counter.Behind the counter was a young woman around the age of 22 or 23. Her seductive body, which was like a water serpent, a pair of magnificent jade hills that seemed ready to burst out at any moment, combined with her icy cold face, it formed a striking contrast.Noticing Duan Ling Tian wearing a mask, the woman wasn\u2019t surprised; it was as if it was a common occurrence.\u201cWang Clan, outer court disciple, Wang Zhen.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at the young woman, suppressed his voice to a low degree, and faked a husky voice as he spoke.\u201c10,000 silver deposit, confirmation after three days.\u201dThe young woman\u2019s voice was incomparably icy cold without a shred of feeling.Duan Ling Tian laid on the counter the silver bills he withdrew from his Spatial Ring before coming here, he then turned around and left.He had already been informed by Tang Ying about the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s rules.After leaving Ghastly Shadows point of operations, Duan Ling Tian took a few circles in the surrounding area. After confirming that he wasn\u2019t followed, he took off his mask and shattered it to pieces.Subsequently, he returned to the noisy night market and had some barbeque. Only then did he look for a nearby inn to stay at.\u201cTwo Ferghana Horses and a Nascent Soul powerhouse.\u201dRecalling the incident that took place this morning, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart sunk.To have a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse as an escort, the youth and young girl\u2019s identities would certainly not be simple. It was extremely likely that they were members of one of the large clans in the County City.\u201cBut only the youth and the young girl can recognize my appearance.\u201dThinking up to this point, he heaved a sigh of relief.After pondering for a moment, he went out once more and bought some makeup.In his previous lifetime, as a mercenary, Duan Ling Tian was skilled in various concealment and infiltration techniques, and that included disguising.After spending half an hour, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s handsome cheeks had undergone a change, becoming extremely ordinary.\u201cNot bad, my skills haven\u2019t deteriorated.\u201dLooking in the mirror, Duan Ling Tian nodded in satisfaction.With these ordinary cheeks, no matter how one looked at them, it was utterly impossible to notice any traces of having put on makeup\u2026This face was one of those faces that if thrown into a crowd, no one would be able to find it anymore.\u201cNow, even if they see me once more, it will be impossible for them to recognize me.\u201dAfter he finished putting on his makeup, Duan Ling Tian felt at ease for the moment.At dawn the next day, seizing the opportunity of when the manager was still in a daze from drowsiness, he directly checked-out.If he wanted to completely conceal himself, then he must not leave any trace behind.This manager had seen his real appearance.After walking out of the inn, Duan Ling Tian went to a restaurant for breakfast in the open.The steaming hot breakfast allowed him to enjoy it to his heart\u2019s content.\u201cI wonder who it was. So ruthless. Swallow Mountain County is above our Triumph City, and he even dared to cut off the arm of the County Governor\u2019s son.\u201cI heard the Patriarch say that they went to the Wang Clan and the Zhong Clan early this morning, probably wanting to use their power to find the assailant.\u201d\u201cAllegedly, the assailant is a sword-cultivating youth around the age of sixteen who is at the third level of the Core Formation Stage, he was wearing violet clothes, and had a handsome appearance\u2026 But how would they search for him based on only that?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was just gulping down some milk and eating his breakfast when he heard the discussion from the nearby table.That were three twenty-over-year-old young men.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart shook.He naturally could figure out that the assailant they were speaking of was none other than himself.But even though he guessed that the three people from yesterday had prominent a background, he didn\u2019t expect it to be that prominent.Swallow Mountain County, its lands were vast, encompassing 81 cities.Among them were Aurora City, Triumph City, and Aqua Mist City.Swallow Mountain County was one of the 18 counties of Crimson Sky Kingdom, and the Governors of the 18 counties were figures that held the power to wield large numbers of troops. They had a decisive position in the kingdom.Allegedly, the 18 Governors were all Void Stage powerhouses.Void Stage powerhouses, they were existences that were above Nascent Soul martial artists, also known as \u2018Immortals of the Land,\u2019 as they could use the strength of their fleshly bodies to control the air and fly.\u201cThat youth is the son of Swallow Mountain County\u2019s Governor?\u201dDuan Ling Tian realized that he had gotten into trouble, and it was big trouble.But he didn\u2019t regret it.Even if he could turn back time and be in that position once more, he would still do it the same way.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart jerked as he thought to himself, \u201cLuckily, this is Triumph City, and it is far away from Aurora City\u2026 There shouldn\u2019t be anyone who would think to suspect me.\u201dFor the next three days, the entirety of Triumph City was startled by the large movements of the three great clans.They only had one objective: find the assailant that cut of the arm of the County Governor\u2019s son.During this time, Duan Ling Tian saw that young girl once again.The young girl had an icy cold expression and was following the crowd as they searched for his tracks.But even when he looked at the young girl face to face, she didn\u2019t recognize him.Duan Ling Tian was confident that besides Ke Er and his mother, no one else, not even Li Fei, could recognize the current him, even if they met face to face.He was extremely confident in his disguise techniques.Deep in the night.Duan Ling Tian once again bought a mask in the night market before putting it on and once again arrived at the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s point of operations in Triumph City.It was still that seductive and icy cold young woman that attended to him.\u201cWang Clan, Wang Zhen, how\u2019s the confirmation?\u201dDuan Ling Tian went straight to the point.\u201c200,000 silver.\u201dThe young woman said, in an icy cold voice.\u201cA mere Body Tempering martial artist is so expensive?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stunned.Based on the prices Tang Ying informed him off, a ninth level Body Tempering martial artist would at most cost 100,000 silver.\u201cInfiltrating deep into the Wang Clan Estate has a high risk.\u201dThe young woman\u2019s icy cold voice sounded once more.\u201cThis is 190,000 silver.\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t ask any further. He withdrew the silver bills he had prepared earlier and passed them to the young woman.The young woman received the silver bills and nodded.\u201cWhen will the mission be conducted?\u201dDuan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking.\u201cTonight, the target will surely die.\u201dHearing what the young woman said, the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a smile, but it was concealed under his mask.He left the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s point of operations and found another inn to stay in.He had already made a decision in his mind.Tomorrow morning, after breakfast, he would leave Triumph City.The next day.Duan Ling Tian found a restaurant to have some breakfast.He originally thought that he would be able to hear some news, but he didn\u2019t expect that the hot topic currently was still the matter regarding the County Governor\u2019s son.\u201cAccording to Tang Ying, as long as it\u2019s an assignment accepted by Ghastly Shadow, they have never failed, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201dAfter eating and drinking his fill, Duan Ling Tian prepared to leave the restaurant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although we know it was someone from Aurora City\u2019s Li Clan that did it, we don\u2019t know who exactly it was.\u201d\u201cHumph! That guy from the Li Clan really got lucky.\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian started laughing.Got lucky?Nevertheless, the movement of Ghastly Shadow was really swift.He couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by the methods of Ghastly Shadow.According to what he heard from the conversation of the two Wang Clan disciples, it was extremely obvious that even the Wang Clan Patriarch didn\u2019t notice that Wang Zhen was murdered; he believed that it was only his only injuries relapsing.Duan Ling Tian bought a horse and galloped towards the city gates.At the Triumph City city gates, there were three groups of people that had joined together to inspect the people that were leaving, and from the crests on the clothes of these people, he could make out that they were members of the Triumph City\u2019s three great clans.The Zhong Clan, the Wang Clan, and the Liu Clan.Duan Ling Tian saw that young girl once again.The young girl was helping inspect the people in the queue to leave the city.After a short moment, it was Duan Ling Tian\u2019s turn.The middle-aged man beside the young girl looked at Duan Ling Tian as he asked, \u201cYoung Lady, is it him?\u201dYoung Lady?Duan Ling Tian was stunned.The middle-aged man\u2019s clothes displayed a Liu Clan crest on it, so he was obviously a member of Triumph City\u2019s Liu Clan.In other words, the young girl that swung her horse whip towards him the other day was the Liu Clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s daughter?Like this, everything seemed to be easily explainable.Earlier, Duan Ling Tian felt that it strange that the dignified son of the County Governor would come to such a small city like Triumph City.Compared to Swallow Mountain County\u2019s County City, Triumph City was merely a small countryside city.So it turned out to be because of this young girl.\u201cIt isn\u2019t him.\u201dLiu Ru\u2019s gaze scanned Duan Ling Tian for a few moments before shaking her head.\u201cMove!\u201dThe middle-aged man swept Duan Ling Tian with a cold and indifferent gaze.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t take any offense. As he galloped his horse out of the city, leaving Triumph City behind, his face slowly emitted a smile.Even though he had been met with unexpected complications that came out of nowhere, his affairs could still be considered to have been concluded satisfactorily.His return journey went quite smoothly, so he arrived at Aurora City before Dusk.Although he had only left for a few days, Duan Ling Tian still felt eager to return home, so he directly went home, embraced Ke Er, and spun in circle.Duan Ling Tian let the young girl, whose face was completely red, down, and said, in a gentle voice as he smiled, \u201cKe Er, I missed you so much.\u201d\u201cGot a wife and forgot the mother\u2026\u201dUnknowingly, Li Rou had also come out of her room. She shook her head and sighed.Duan Ling Tian was slightly embarrassed as he hurriedly went to hold Li Rou\u2019s hand and tried to remedy it by saying, \u201cMom, I really missed you too.\u201d\u201cEnough, stop being mushy. You probably haven\u2019t eaten a proper meal throughout your journey. Mom will go prepare some food for you.\u201dLi Rou shook her head as she entered the kitchen.\u201cMadam, I\u2019ll help you!\u201dKe Er wanted to enter the kitchen as well.But she was instead held onto by Duan Ling Tian. \u201cKe Er, didn\u2019t you miss me?\u201dKe Er nodded her head like a chick pecking grain off the ground. \u201cOf course I missed you, but Big Sister Fei Fei missed Young Master as well. Young Master, you go see her, and when Young Master returns, I and Madam will have finished preparing the food.\u201d\u201cSilly girl.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart was warm as he pulled the young girl into his embrace.Ke Er was always like this, always putting him before everything.When Duan Ling Tian arrived at Li Fei\u2019s home, she said, \u201cYou actually know how to return?\u201dThe moment Li Fei saw Duan Ling Tian, she directly glared at him.\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to return? Then I\u2019ll leave.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed for a moment before turning around and walking away with a smile on the corners of his mouth.\u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to leave!\u201dLi Fei quickly walked forward and blocked Duan Ling Tian from leaving.Unexpectedly, at the instant she blocked Duan Ling Tian, he seemed to be able to predict the future, because he opened his arms wide and pulled her into his embrace.Li Fei\u2019s delicate figure trembled.Duan Ling Tian mouth was snuggled up to her earlobe; he gave it a lick and quietly said, \u201cI missed you.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s figure was as if struck by lightning, and her body became stiff.\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201dJust at this moment, a cough sounded from behind him, causing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face to freeze.He even felt that the old man had done it on purpose!\u201cGrandfather.\u201dLi Fei\u2019s face was red from embarrassment, and thus she kept her head lowered, not daring to look at the old man.\u201cGrandfather.\u201dDuan Ling Tian turned around and smiled slyly while greeting the old man.Li De\u2019s eyes narrowed, lightly smiling as he asked, \u201cLing Tian, I heard you left for a few days. Where did you go?\u201d\u201cNowhere. I just went to take a spin around Misty Forest. I wanted to see if I could find another one of the Spirit Fruits that could increase the strength of the fleshly body.\u201dDuan Ling Tian made up an excuse.\u201cDo you think those types of Spirit Fruits fall from the sky?\u201dLi De was speechless.He had heard of the story of Duan Ling Tian consuming a Spirit Fruit that caused his fleshly body to undergo a metamorphosis, gaining an additional two ancient mammoths of strength.But as far as he was concerned, these types of Spirit Fruits were things one came by with luck and not by searching for it.\u201cGrandfather, that Spirit Fruit I got that time really did fall down from the sky; it even knocked a bump on my head\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian continued to speak drivel.Li De\u2019s face froze and he was slightly embarrassed. \u201cThat\u2019s a coincidence\u2026absolutely a coincidence.\u201dLi De quickly changed the subject. \u201cLing Tian, I\u2019ve seen the Spirit Sword you refined for Ke Er. It\u2019s really not bad; it surpasses regular Grade Nine Spirit Weapons\u2026 but it\u2019s still quite far away from being a Grade Eight Spirit Weapon. Do you need Grandfather to help you increase the grade of the Spirit Sword to a Grade Eight Spirit Weapon?\u201d\u201cGrandfather, you must not only want to simply help me increase the grade of the Spirit Weapon, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian saw through Li De\u2019s intention, so he teased him a bit.Li De\u2019s face turned red.\u201cRascal! Grandfather wants to ask you for some Violet Meteorite so he can help me increase the grade of my Spirit Weapon to the eighth grade as well\u2026\u201dLi Fei rolled her eyes at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI\u2019m just joking. Since grandfather wants it, I naturally wouldn\u2019t refrain from giving it to him. Grandfather, I\u2019ll go get my mother\u2019s and Ke Er\u2019s swords for you right now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian quickly took a trip home, brought the three Violet Myrtle Flexible Swords, and passed them to the old man.\u201cExtravagant, too extravagant!\u201dThe old man looked at the three flexible swords and was slightly amazed. \u201cLing Tian, where did you get this Violet Meteorite from?\u201d\u201cWhen I was at Fresh Breeze Town, I bought it from a weapon store\u2026 I think I spent around 200 silver.\u201d200 silver?The corners of the old man\u2019s mouth twitched, and he was only able to say two words after a long time. \u201cLucky bastard!\u201dThe old man was overjoyed as if a precious jewel had fallen into his hands as he took the three swords back to his room and started getting busy.Duan Ling Tian sneak attacked Li Fei once again and pulled her into his embrace. \u201cLittle Fei, did you miss me these past few days?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t miss you.\u201dLI Fei blushed.\u201cReally, you didn\u2019t miss me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s hand\u2019s mischievously moved around Li Fei\u2019s hot and delicate figure.\u201cStop that!\u201d\u201cThen tell me the truth, did you miss me or not.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you clearly.\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s enough, right? Stinking rascal!\u201d\u201cHehe, then I\u2019ll be a rascal for you to see\u2026 the wolf[1] is coming!\u201d\u201cAh! No.\u201d\u2026\u2026Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei both didn\u2019t notice.At this moment, outside the courtyard, a white-clothed youth that had been standing there for a long time walked away in large strides.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, even if the clan doesn\u2019t punish you, I will kill you sooner or later\u2026 you just wait.\u201dLi Qing\u2019s eyes were crimson red, filled with hatred and envy.His heart was close to warping.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that Li Qing?\u201dSuddenly, two youths walked over from nearby. The grey-clothed youth in the lead had eyes that contained a smile as he looked towards Li Qing.Li Qing\u2019s face turned grim as he shouted in a low voice, \u201cLi An, you better f**k the hell off. Don\u2019t provoke me!\u201d\u201cLi Qing, do you really think you\u2019re still the you of before? The current you is just trash to me.\u201dLi An sneered as he said in disdain, \u201cNow, in the Li Clan younger generation, only Duan Ling Tian can be my opponent\u2026 You are not worthy!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Qing\u2019s expression was ferocious as his body moved, pouncing towards Li An.Swimming Dragon Steps!Dark Nether Finger!Li Qing pointed out with his finger and flew straight towards Li An, fully exploding forth with the strength of three ancient mammoths!\u201cHumph! It isn\u2019t only you who\u2019s at the second level of the Core Formation Stage.\u201dLi An sneered as he took a step forward. Above him, three ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared.Bang!Li An directly moved to intercept and blocked Li Qing\u2019s finger strike with a single punch.The forward force of his punch didn\u2019t decrease as it blasted onto Li Qing\u2019s body and blasted Li Qing flying.\u201cLi Qing, if your Dark Nether Finger wasn\u2019t crippled, even if you broke through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage, it would still be impossible for me to be your match\u2026 Unfortunately, trash is trash, so don\u2019t even think of rising for the rest of your lifetime.\u201dLi An arrived beside Li Qing and laughed coldly.Li Qing\u2019s face turned green. He was angry to the extent that he spat out a mouthful of blood and his eyes even emitted a dense hatred\u2026LI An! Duan Ling Tian!He wouldn\u2019t let any one of them go.\u201cRemember, your grandfather is dead, and you don\u2019t have anyone to rely on in the Li Clan. Next time, don\u2019t be so arrogant to me, or else I\u2019ll beat you up every time I see you.Li An threatened him before leaving.Li Qing struggled to stand up, then he took a deep breath before making a decision.Return home, pack his bags, bring along his grandfather\u2019s inheritance, and leave the Li Clan.He was leaving with hatred.When Duan Ling Tian heard that Li Qing had left the Li Clan, even he was slightly surprised.Although he didn\u2019t have any favorable impression of Li Qing, he couldn\u2019t deny that Li Qing\u2019s actions still made him feel a sense of respect in his heart. Leaving the Li Clan\u2019s protection and venturing out in the world wasn\u2019t something that anyone would have the courage to do\u2026Once one did this, it would mean that everything would need to start from the beginning.He would be without anything to rely on, and everything could only be done by himself.He didn\u2019t know, however, that where Li Qing left to was, as luck would have it, Triumph City.So much for that\u2026\u201cFive days ago, our Swallow Mountain County\u2019s County Governor\u2019s son\u2019s arm was cut off by someone outside of Triumph City? A violet-clothed youth? Sword cultivation? Sixteen?\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian just so happened to not be at the Li Clan during that period. I can be sure that there\u2019s an over 90% probability it\u2019s him!\u201dAfter leaving the Li Clan, Li Qing galloped without direction, coincidentally arrived at Triumph City, and thus heard of the latest news that was raging in Triumph City.\u201cMaybe this is a chance for me.\u201dLi Qing\u2019s eyes shone.After a short moment, Li Qing arrived at the Liu Clan\u2019s Estate.\u201cI know who cut off the County Governor\u2019s son\u2019s arm.\u201dA single sentence allowed Li Qing to be unobstructed in the Li Clan. He smoothly met with the person he wanted to meet.In a vast audience hall, a youth in fine clothes sat at the head seat with a slightly pale face.On the sides of the fine-clothed youth stood a young girl and an old man.\u201cYou know who injured my Young Master?\u201dThe old man\u2019s gaze was like electricity as the imposing manner of a Nascent Soul Stage powerhouse swept across, pressing onto Li Qing\u2019s body.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1](TL Note \u2013 Just to clear things up, the wolf the author is referring to here is the Chinese saying \u8272\u72fc which directly translates to color wolf, or its real meaning, pervert.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Moreover, not considering natural talent, just this unyieldingness is extremely hard to come by\u2026 what's your name?\"The old man glanced deeply at Li Qing.\"I'm called Blood Enmity[1].\"According to the plan in his heart, Li Qing made up a name.From today onwards, he would be Li Qing no more; instead, he was Blood Enmity!Blood Enmity.He would use this to remind himself that he carried with him a bloodthirsty enmity.\u201cBlood Enmity, I\u2019m the third son of the Swallow Mountain County\u2019s County Governor, Pei San. You really know who cut off my arm?\u201dThe youth that sat at the head seat looked down towards Li Qing in a condescending manner.Although his arm had been connected with great difficulty, it no longer possessed the nimbleness of before, and it was even unable to execute martial skills\u2026Such a blow caused these few days to feel like years to him; living wasn\u2019t better off than dying.He wished he could immediately uncover the assailant and dish out a capital punishment to him.LI Qing looked at Pei San as he asked, \u201cThird Young Master, if I\u2019m not wrong, the person that cut off your arm, the speed of his sword was extremely fast, swift as lightning. The sword entered it\u2019s sheathe almost immediately after attacking. Was it like this?\u201d\u201cWho is he?\u201dPei San\u2019s eyes shone and his face was flushed from agitation. \u201cAs long as you tell me who he is, no matter whether it\u2019s 10,000 gold, a group of beautiful woman, medicinal pills, spirit weapons, cultivation techniques, or martial skills\u2026 I can bestow them all upon you!\u201d\u201cThird Young Master, I don\u2019t want all of these things.\u201dLi Qing shook his head slowly.\u201cThen what do you want?\u201dPei San suppressed the agitation in his heart and his expression turned grim.\u201cI want to follow beside the Third Young Master and return to the County City together! As long as my cultivation breaks through to the Origin Core Stage, I will undoubtedly personally tell the Third Young Master who was the person who cut off his arm and where he is from.\u201dLi Qing\u2019s gaze flickered as he stared fixedly at Pei San.\u201cHmph, what a nice scheme you have there! You see that I\u2019m desperate to seek revenge, so you believe that I would spare no efforts in assisting you to step into the Origin Core Stage, right?\u201dPei San\u2019s face turned cold as he saw through Li Qing\u2019s intentions.Li Qing kept silent. This was exactly his plan.As far as he was concerned, as long as he followed beside this County Governor\u2019s son, with his full support, he would certainly be able to step into the Origin Core Stage within the shortest time possible.In Swallow Mountain County, the strongest power was none other than the County Governor\u2019s Estate.If he had the full support of the Country Governor\u2019s Estate, stepping into the Origin Core Stage was only a matter of time!At that time, he would return to the Li Clan and cruelly murder Li An.As for Duan Ling Tian, he would shame him violently and torture him for a while before handing him over to be dealt with by Pei San.\u201cImpudent!\u201dThe old man\u2019s gaze turned cold. \u201cSince you know the identity of my Young Master, then you should know the methods of our County Governor\u2019s Estate\u2026 If you don\u2019t speak, I\u2019ll kill you right now!\u201d\u201cYou can kill me, but then your Young Master can forget about finding the assailant to take revenge in his lifetime.\u201dFacing the old man\u2019s imposing manner, Li Qing had a calm expression and was fearless.\u201cDo you really think I won\u2019t dare to kill you?\u201dThe old man walked forward. A palms trike with immense force and radiating Origin Energy slapped onto Li Qing, blasting Li Qing away.Li Qing crashed onto the floor and continuously spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, but the corners of his mouth still had a smile. \u201cI really am sure that you won\u2019t dare kill me.\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dThe old man\u2019s face sunk and he looked towards Pei San.\u201cVery good, very good.\u201dPei San smiled out of extreme anger and said to the young girl beside him, \u201cSister Ru, arrange for people to take him to heal his injuries.\u201d\u201cYes, Third Brother.\u201dThe young girl replied before going to arrange it.A few moments later, only Pei San and his servant remained.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re really going to take him back to the County City?\u201dThe old man frowned.\u201cGrandpa Huai, when dealing with desperate people like Blood Enmity, even if you interrogate him under torture, it will still be impossible to make him talk\u2026 Instead of that, why not make use of this opportunity and take him back to the County City. Once we\u2019ve returned to the County City, we can investigate his background. If we can find the assailant through this, then he won\u2019t be of any more use to me. If we can\u2019t find the assailant, then we follow his wishes. Once he steps into the Origin Core Stage and uncovers the assailant for me, that day will be the day he loses his life!\u201dPei San\u2019s eyes flickered with a cold light as he spoke of his plans.He was the dignified son of the County Governor of Swallow Mountain County; how could he tolerate being threatened?In his heart, Li Qing was already a dead man.\u201cYoung Master is wise.\u201dThe old man nodded. This was indeed the best method.Aurora City, Li Clan Estate.In a room within a large courtyard.Om!Behind the screen, a completely naked youth stood up from within the bath barrel. On his body, a defensive qi barrier raged like a gust of of strong winds whistling by.\u201cGreater Teleportation has finally been cultivated to the Mastery Stage!\u201dThe youth\u2019s face emitted a satisfied smile as he walked out of the bath barrel and put on a set of dry clothes before walking out of the room.Spirit Serpent Movement Technique!As soon as he entered the courtyard, the youth\u2019s figure started flashing about as if he had transformed into an agile spirit serpent, incomparably swift.In an instant, he wound around the large tree, rapidly rising to the top.In the next instant, he flashed onto the ground, extremely agile.\u201cHiss hiss.\u201dOn the trunk of the large tree, one white and one black, two little pythons watched the youth\u2019s figure flashing about. Their sharp eyes emitted a sense of meekness and infatuation\u2026Abruptly, the youth stopped and stood there before taking a step forward.Dragons Finishing Touch!In a blink of an eye, the youth\u2019s hands danced about like the wind, either forming a fist or forming a palm. As his Origin Energy whistled, it was difficult to distinguish which movement was the true attack.Whoosh!Just after his thousands of movements, a finger attack condensed from Origin Energy was instantly shot out. A piercing, whistling sound sounded through the air and descended upon a stone pillar.Bang!Immediately, the stone pillar exploded from the point of impact, causing stone chips to swirl out into the air.\u201cAs expected of the offensive martial skill that matches the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique\u2019s Raging Python Form\u2019s mental cultivation method. This Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch, in terms of might, is even stronger than Li Qing\u2019s Dark Nether Finger and not one bit inferior to Xiao Yu\u2019s Sleeve Dimension.As Duan Ling Tian stood with his hands behind his back, a smile appeared on his face.The Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch stressed upon the usage of a howling flurry of fists and palms to disrupt the opponent\u2019s field of vision as if painting a dragon that didn\u2019t have the final touches to make it lifelike.Lastly, a finger attack with an extremely formidable might to directly attack the vital points of the opponent was used!This act was like the finishing touch to the drawing!Thus, this martial skill was named Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch by Rebirth Martial Emperor.\u201cDragon\u2019s Finishing Touch includes the high grade Profound Rank martial skill, Cloud Piercing Finger, that Rebirth Martial Emperor cultivated during his second lifetime. Since I\u2019ve merged with the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, I have thus inherited Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s comprehension towards the Cloud Piercing Finger.. .In those years, Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s Cloud Piercing Finger was cultivated to the Perfection Stage. As such, I only used half a month\u2019s time to cultivate the Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch, which surpassed the Cloud Piercing Finger, to the Mastery Stage.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled in satisfaction.Now the might of the Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch completely surpassed the might of the Form and Will Boxing\u2019s Collapsing Fist, which he was the most skilled at.At present, it was once month after the youth gathering was held.\u201cCurrently, the three high grade Profound Rank martial skills that I cultivate, Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch, Greater Teleportation, and Spirit Serpents Movement Technique, have all stepped into the Mastery Stage, but among them, I\u2019ve only felt the threshold to the Perfection Stage for Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch.\u201dAfter thinking up to this point, Duan Ling Tian started to cultivate the Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch even more painstakingly\u2026Striking when the iron was hot would certainly result in a miraculous effect!\u201cDuan Ling Tian, you really are hardworking. No wonder you have such a shocking cultivation at such a young age.\u201dJust at this moment, a hearty laughter sounded from outside the courtyard.Duan Ling Tian looked towards the source of the sound.What he saw was a figure walking into the courtyard.The figure was precisely Lin Qi.Duan Ling Tian welcomed Lin Qi into the courtyard and asked curiously, \u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, a few days ago, our Lin Clan welcomed a guest from Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan. Among them was the He Clan\u2019s number one disciple in the younger generation. At the beginning, everything was fine, but after he won in a spar against my big brother, he started boasting without restraint, saying that there were no worthy figures in the younger generation of our Aurora City\u2026 Afterwards, he even arrogantly established an arena at the north area of the city and is currently challenging all of the younger generation martial artists of Aurora City. Even Meng Quan was defeated by him.\u201dLin Qi proclaimed the reason he had come. \u201cI came here today because I hoped you would help teach him a lesson and let him know that no matter how great he may be, there will always be someone greater.\u201d\u201cCould it be that even Xiao Yu wasn\u2019t a match for him?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stunned.Lin Qi laughed bitterly. \u201cXiao Yu left half a month ago to go afar and visit some relatives.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded and left the Li Clan Estate with Lin Qi.If he had just accidently heard of this matter, he wouldn\u2019t care about it, nor would he fight for the sake of the so called \u201chonor\u201d of Aurora City.The reason he was going was out of his friendship with Lin Qi.Upon arriving at the north area of the city, Duan Ling Tian saw a simple martial arts combat arena.Presently, the arena was fully surrounded by people.Among them were many Li Clan youth martial artists.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dBefore long, many people recognized Duan Ling Tian and their gazes shined brightly.\u201cDuan Ling Tian has arrived. He can certainly defeat that guy from Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. This guy from the He Clan seized the opportunity that our Aurora City\u2019s Xiao Yu wasn\u2019t around and is so arrogant\u2026 Now that Duan Ling Tian is here, I want to see how he continues to be arrogant.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I support you, f**k him up!\u201d\u2026\u2026The surrounding crowd was incomparably fervent, causing Duan Ling Tian to feel slightly overwhelmed.\u201cHmm?\u201dSuddenly, Duan Ling Tian noticed that on the martial arts combat arena, a person was blasted flying from the arena, hurtling down towards him.\u201cLi Zhong!\u201dWhen Duan Ling Tian recognized the youth that was hurtled down, he lifted his hand and caught on to the youth\u2019s shoulder, allowing him to firmly descend onto the ground.Li Zhong was in a slightly sorry state. When he saw that the person who saved him was Duan Ling Tian, his gaze was complicated.After taking in a deep breath, Li Zhong sincerely said, \u201cThank you.\u201dDuan Ling Tian lightly nodded and patted Li Zhong\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re OK, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dLi Zhong shook his head.At this moment, a blue-clothed youth on the combat arena looked at Duan Ling Tian and asked in a scornful manner, \u201cYou\u2019re Duan Ling Tian? The youth genius ranked at the top of this year\u2019s Aurora City\u2019s Hidden Dragon List?\u201dBut Duan Ling Tian, however, ignored him.\u201cYou!\u201dThe blue=clothed youth got angry from embarrassment. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, I, Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan\u2019s He Jun, formally challenge you! Do you dare to accept the challenge?\u201dDo you dare to accept the challenge?The surrounding crowd had their gazes all descend upon Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHmph!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, then he stomped his legs on the ground and used the force to fly up onto the martial arts combat arena.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, fight!\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, show him what you\u2019ve got!\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I love you, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1](TL note \u2013 I could have gone with the usual Pinyin way of Tl-ing names but I felt it should be made English as the name he chose has such an obvious meaning and all.

A sixteen-year-old little kid is capable of being placed in the top of the Hidden Dragon List?\u201d\u201cIdiot, so what if he\u2019s sixteen? Say that again if you can defeat Duan Ling Tian.\u201d\u201cYeah, if you\u2019re unable to even take a single move from Duan Ling Tian, that would really be an extreme disgrace.\u201dBystanders in the crowd ridiculed him.He Jun\u2019s face turned grim instantly.\u201cLooks like they\u2019re very confident in you.\u201dHe Jun glanced at Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian still did not reply; it was as if he hadn\u2019t heard He Jun speak at all.\u201cKid, I\u2019m talking to you!\u201dHe Jun had a grim expression. This was the first time he was ignored by someone in this way.\u201cAlthough they haven\u2019t fought, their states of mind are already on different levels. Duan Ling Tian is worthy of being the first in the Hidden Dragon List, as he\u2019s able to be unfazed no matter what.\u201d\u201cYeah, unlike this He Jun, who\u2019s getting so flustered and exasperated. In terms of bearings, he isn\u2019t even on the same level as Duan Ling Tian.\u201cNot on the same level? You\u2019re thinking too highly of him; I think he\u2019s miles away from Duan Ling Tian.\u201d\u2026\u2026Hearing the crowd\u2019s ridicule, He Jun\u2019s expression got uglier as time passed by.\u201cI\u2019ll see how long you can continue acting for!\u201dHe Jun was enraged. His body jerked like a roc spreading its wings as he flew towards Duan Ling Tian.Three ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed into form.This He Jun was obviously a martial artist at the second level of the Core Formation Stage.Whoosh!Seeing He Jun flying out towards him, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed. No wonder He Jun was able to defeat even Lin Zhuo; he did really have some ability.He Jun\u2019s movement technique was similar to his, also a high grade Profound Rank movement technique at the Mastery Stage.\u201cSee how I blast you flying with a single punch!\u201d He Jun bellowed. His fist seemed like a launched cannonball as it whistled through the air and blasted towards Duan Ling Tian.From start till finish, Duan Ling Tian stood on the spot, unmoved like a mountain. Even when He Jun arrived in front of him, Duan Ling Tian still had a tranquil expression.Eventually, under the gazes of everyone present, Duan Ling Tian made his move.Dragons!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands danced about, suffused with Origin Energy.In the eyes of everyone in the surroundings, including He Jun\u2019s, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hands movements weren\u2019t random; they seemed to be following some sort of profound trail.\u201cBreak for me!\u201dHe Jun\u2019s gaze turned cold and his fist exerted force like a landslide as it smashed towards the palm and fist silhouettes that appeared from Duan Ling Tian\u2019s hand movements.Before long, his expression distorted.He noticed that his fist had actually hit nothing but air, and it didn\u2019t touch a hair on Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes focused.Above him, three ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed into form\u2026Finishing Touch!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s finger strike flashed out. As it penetrated through the flurry of fist and palm silhouettes, an earsplitting howl sounded.His finger touched upon He Jun\u2019s fist, instantly shattering his defensive qi barrier.\u201cAh!\u201dHe Jun emitted a shrill cry as his body flew out, crashing onto the ground in an incomparably sorry state.His left hand tightly clasped the right as soon as he noticed that one of his finger bones had cracked apart and a heart wrenching pain caused his body to start trembling.Only after hastily consuming a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill did He Jun look at Duan Ling Tian with an expression of dread.This sixteen-year-old youth was no different than a demon to him.Too terrifying!\u201cDuan Ling Tian is so strong.\u201d\u201cAllegedly, when Duan Ling Tian defeated Xiao Yu, he event used the strength of four ancient mammoths\u2026 Today, he instead only used the strength of three ancient mammoths to defeat this He Jun.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian obviously held back.\u201d\u201cThis He Jun probably can\u2019t even defeat Xiao Yu.\u201d\u201cThe number one martial artist in the younger generation of Aqua Mist City is merely so mediocre.\u201d\u2026\u2026The crowd was in an uproar.\u201cYou should keep a low profile and not establish arenas everywhere when you don\u2019t have any ability.\u201dDuan Ling Tian paid no attention to He Jun. Under the gazes that were filled with veneration and adoration, Duan Ling Tian jumped off the arena and swung a kick at the one of the support pillars on the side of the arena.Bang!Immediately, the martial arts combat arena collapsed with a loud crash, burying He Jun within.He Jun crawled out in a sorry state with a face full of dirt, looking like a refugee.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dInstantly, the crowd burst into a wave of laughter.Amongst the laughter, He Jun\u2019s expression turned ugly and he swiftly fled.\u201cHa ha\u2026 Duan Ling Tian, nice!\u201dLin Qi arrived beside Duan Ling Tian and gave him a big thumbs up, as if he was even more excited than if it was himself who beat He Jun.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dMeanwhile, two more people arrived beside Duan Ling Tian.Li Zhong, Li Xiao.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Li Zhong as he questioned.\u201cHurry up and say it.\u201dLi Zhong glared at Li Xiao as he scolded him.Li Xiao\u2019s body trembled as he looked at Duan Ling Tian in terror. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, I apologize for what I did in the past. I hope you can forgive me.\u201d\u201cLouder. Haven\u2019t you eaten?\u201dLi Zhong grunted coldly towards his little brother. He didn\u2019t care about his little brother\u2019s feelings at all.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just let the past matters vanish into the void now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian waved his hand and smiled.This Li Zhong\u2019s character wasn\u2019t bad. Recalling the conflict between the two of them, it was all because of his little brother, Li Xiao.Slap!Li Zhong swung his palm onto Li Xiao\u2019s head. \"What are you daydreaming for? Hurry up and say thank you.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201dLi Xiao had a bitter smile on his face as he hastily thanked Duan Ling Tian.Duan Ling Tian indifferently swept Li Xiao with his gaze before walking away with Lin Qi.The crowd automatically opened up a path. The gazes that descended upon Duan Ling Tian from the surroundings were all filled with veneration.After watching Duan Ling Tian and Lin Qi\u2019s figures disappear in the distance, only then did everyone present come back to their senses.\u201cToo formidable. He annihilated Aqua Mist City\u2019s He Clan\u2019s He Jun with just a single move.\u201d\u201cAs expected of the young genius who defeated Xiao Yu to be placed in the top of the Hidden Dragon List.\u201d\u201cDuan Ling Tian is only sixteen. I\u2019m certain that the first ranked in the Hidden Dragon List for the next two years will undoubtedly be him.\u201d\u201cNonsense, even I can be certain of that.\u201d\u2026\u2026In a restaurant, Duan Ling Tian and Lin Qi sat facing each other.Duan Ling Tian originally intended to return home but was forced by Lin Qi to come here, his reason being having something to discuss with him.\u201cWhat do you want to discuss, even coming to a restaurant. So solemn\u2026 Couldn\u2019t you have just told me on the way?\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked at Lin Qi.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, what\u2019s your plan?\u201dLin Qi went straight to the point.\u201cWhat plan?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was dazed.\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking you is, what are your plans for the future.\u201dLin QI smiled wryly.\u201cI don\u2019t know for now.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and his heart slightly jerked.Hearing Lin Qi speak about this, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help himself from thinking about the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp he had heard of the other day.The exact date of the Genius Camp test was five months from now\u2026Lin Qi continued, \u201cDuan Ling Tian, even though you\u2019re a member of the Li Clan, you\u2019re a disciple with another surname after all\u2026 In the Li Clan, you\u2019ll become an elder at most; you\u2019re destined to have no fate with the Patriarch\u2019s seat.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just say what you want to say and stop beating around the bust?\u201dDuan Ling Tian derided.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be frank.\u201dLin Qi took a deep breath before slowly saying, \u201cHalf a month ago, my aunt made a trip back here and heard about you from me. She\u2019s very interested in you.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dAfter hearing what he said, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s face trembled and the food that he hadn\u2019t swallowed yet was spat all over Lin Qi\u2019s face.\u201cF**k! Lin Qi, although I\u2019m not against being together with a slightly older woman, I\u2019m really not suitable to be together with a cougar\u2026 Ask your aunt to look for someone else,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said in all seriousness.Lin Qi was dumbstruck.Coming back to his senses, Lin Qi wiped off the food that was spat on his face before deriding, \u201cCan you steop thinking of everything in that way!? My aunt\u2019s been married for years, even her son is over ten years old.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t it you who said your aunt was interested in me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly speechless.Was it he who overthought things?\u201cShe\u2019s interested in your natural talent and comprehension ability.\u201dLin Qi rolled his eyes at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cSay it earlier.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head and continued to eat. He was like a whirlwind sweeping away everything on the plate.\u201cMy aunt is the person in charge of the Violet Tulip Trading Company\u2019s branch in Swallow Mountain County,\u201d Lin Qi said.\u201cSo what?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked as he ate.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of the Violet Tulip Trading Company, right?\u201dLin Qi looked at Duan Ling Tian as if he was looking at an alien.When he saw Duan Ling Tian shake his head, he was utterly speechless.This guy\u2019s really ill informed!\u201cThe Violet Tulip Trading Company is one of the three great Trading Companies in the Crimson Sky Kingdom. Its properties can be found all over six counties out of the eighteen counties in Crimson Sky Kingdom, and Swallow Mountain County is one of them\u2026\u201d Lin Qi explained.\u201cWait. You said the Violet Tulip Trading Company occupies six out of the eighteen counties of Crimson Sky Kingdom, and your aunt is the person in charge of one of the counties?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLin Qi had a face full of pride.\u201cEven though my aunt\u2019s natural talent in the Martial Dao is average, she is really business-minded, she was already thought highly of by the president of the Violet Tulip Trading Company in her early years, and she advanced step by step to obtain her current position. This restaurant that we\u2019re eating in is one of the properties of the Violet Tulip Trading Company.\u201cBesides that, the properties of the Violet Tulip Trading Company can be said to have a finger in every pie, to the extent that it can be found even in remote, small towns\u2026 As long as it has the prefix of Agarwood, Golden Adonis, or Violet Caltrop, they are all properties belonging to the Violet Tulip Trading Company.\u201dLin Qi continued to speak of the Violet Tulip Trading Company with great familiarity.\u201cAgarwood?\u2019Duan Ling Tian suddenly realized that the Agarwood Restaurant in Fresh Breeze Town turned out to be a property of the Violet Tulip Trading Company.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in conducting business.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.\u201cWho\u2019s asking you to conduct business.\u201dLin Qi angrily said, \u201cMy aunt took an interest in you because she highly regards your natural talent in the Martial Dao and your comprehension ability\u2026 While the Violet Tulip Trading Company is rich enough to rival a kingdom, it naturally has many people who are watching it secretly and are looking for an opportunity. Therefore, the Violet Tulip Trading Company has fostered many powerhouses to be in charge of protecting the trading company\u2019s properties.\u201d\u201cMy uncle is precisely the Guard Commander of the Violet Tulip Trading Company in Swallow Mountain County, and he is a Void Stage powerhouse. Even the County Governor of Swallow Mountain County is respectful when dealing with my uncle.\u201dLin Qi finished saying this within a single breath.\u201cYour aunt wants to make me a guard for the Violet Tulip Trading Company?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a weird gaze.\u201cMy aunt said that as long as you\u2019re willing to join the Violet Tulip Trading Company, the Violet Tulip Trading Company will spare no effort in fostering you\u2026 In the future, you will even have the opportunity to take over my uncle\u2019s position and become the Guard Commander of the Violet Tulip Trading Company in Swallow Mountain County.\u201dLin Qi looked at Duan Ling Tian with a face full of envy and jealousy.\u201cIn other words, once I join the Violet Tulip Trading Company, even if I stay there till I die, I will only be a head bodyguard?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had eaten his fill and put down his cutlery.\u201cHead bodyguard?\u201dLin Qi didn\u2019t understand what Duan Ling Tian had said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you even know what the guard commander of the Violet Tulip Trading Company represents?\u201dLi Qin was slightly exasperated.\u201cWhat does it represent?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly curious.\u201cThere were only a total of seven guard commanders in the entire Violet Tulip Trading Company, and every single guard commander is a Void Stage powerhouse! While they guard the Violet Tulip Trading Company, they also obtain the various resources of the Violet Tulip Trading Company, such as grade seven medicinal pills, grade seven spirit weapons, and a wealth that they and their families can\u2019t spend within their lifetime.\u201dLin Qi was slightly agitated as he spoke.\u201cAre you finished? That\u2019s all?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked.That\u2019s all?Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s unperturbed expression that seemed like he wasn\u2019t one bit concerned made Li Qi unable to help himself from glaring. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that all of these things aren\u2019t something you can get from being a Li Clan elder for your entire life\u2026 What, even this doesn\u2019t attract you?\u201d\u201cTell your aunt I\u2019m not interested.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shrugged with a light smile.\u201cYou\u2026 you really plan to be a Li Clan elder for the rest of your life?\u201dLin Qi was astounded.\u201cWho said I want to be a Li Clan elder?\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head as he slowly walked away, only leaving behind a single sentence to Lin Qi. \u201cMy ambitions aren\u2019t within the boundaries of the Crimson Sky Kingdom!\u201dAmbitions not within the boundaries of Crimson Sky Kingdom?Li Qin was dumbfounded.He dreamt occasionally, and in those dreams he would always see himself becoming the Guard Commander of the Violet Tulip Trading Company, or the County Governor of one of the 18 counties in Crimson Sky Kingdom before laughing himself awake.As far as he was concerned, these were all his wild wishes.Duan Ling Tian, however, actually said his ambitions weren\u2019t within the boundaries of the Crimson Sky Kingdom.This was an utter disregard to all the things he dreamt of.\u201cMaybe it was precisely his broad ambitions that allowed him to achieve his current cultivation level at such a young age\u2026 Compared to him, I\u2019m virtually an ignorant fool.\u201dA bitter smile filled the corners of Lin Qi\u2019s mouth.At this moment, he seemed to have understood many things.Duan Ling Tian, however, didn\u2019t know that Lin Qi\u2019s entire life would change tremendously just because of that single sentence he spoke.Of course, this was a story for some other time.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s life gradually quieted down.His days were spent routinely cultivating the Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch, and Spirit Serpent Movement Technique, as well as concocting medicinal liquids and refining medicinal pills\u2026In private, Duan Ling Tian flirted with Ke Er on one day and Little Fei on the other.His days passed by in a leisurely fashion.Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.During these three months, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength had undergone earth-shaking changes.His cultivation had advanced a stage to step into the second level of the Core Formation Stage. Furthermore, the process of tempering his body with Origin Energy had already been completed, and he was in the progress of charging towards the third level of the Core Formation Stage.Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch was officially cultivated to the Perfection Stage.With the assistance of large quantities of medicinal liquids concocted from Blood Lingzhi, Greater Teleportation also officially stepped into the Perfection Stage.However, Duan Ling Tian seemed to have been trapped in a bottleneck that seemed nearly impossible to break through, and thus his Spirit Serpent Movement Technique had not improved after so long.As for Ke Er, her cultivation had already stepped into the third level of the Core Formation Stage half a month ago, and she cultivated the high grade Profound Rank martial skill, Freezing Sword, that supplemented the Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique to the Mastery Stage.Besides that, her defensive martial skill, Stealth Substitution, and her movement technique, Profound Rippling Steps, both had been cultivated to the Perfection Stage.Ke Er\u2019s natural talent in the Martial Dao once again astounded Duan Ling Tian\u2026As for Li Fei, Duan Ling Tian gave her the second Spirit Containment Pill he refined that day and let her cultivate a new top cultivation method after dispersing her Origin Energy into the Spirit Containment Pill.The cultivation method he passed on to Li Fei was called Galactic Star Technique. It was a cultivation method that was cultivated by one of Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s best friends, Stellar Martial Emperor. Its might was on par with Frost God\u2019s Sword Technique and the Demonic Beauty Divine Technique.In terms of martial skills, Li Fei had already been cultivating high grade Profound Rank martial skill since the beginning, and as such, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t pass anything on to her.After dispersing her Origin Energy and re-cultivating the new cultivation method, her cultivation stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage and was on the verge of breaking through into the third level of the Core Formation Stage.Duan Ling Tian had once asked his mother about her cultivation, but she would always smile it off while emitting a sense of mysteriousness, causing Duan Ling Tian to have no way of knowing.However, Duan Ling Tian was convinced that his mother\u2019s cultivation had absolutely far surpassed her previous cultivation!Duan Ling Tian sat in the courtyard as he teased the two little pythons on the table beside him.In the past three months, the two little pythons had swallowed down plenty of medicinal pills that Duan Ling Tian refined, allowing their strengths to improve and step into the ninth level of the Core Formation Stage. They were now only a step away from the Origin Core Stage.\u201cTwo little freaks.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a bitter smile as he looked at the two little pythons.Who would have thought that in Duan Ling Tian\u2019s house, the strongest wasn\u2019t him nor Ke Er, and even wasn\u2019t his mother, but instead it was these two variant little pythons.Half a month ago, Duan Ling Tian took the two little pythons deep within the Misty forest as a means to probe their strength, and with great difficulty he finally found a fierce beast at the ninth level of the Core Formation Stage that wasn\u2019t afraid of the Snow Python\u2019s aura that lingered on the two little pythons\u2019 bodies. To his surprise, however, the two little pythons easily penetrated the fierce beast\u2019s body and killed it\u2026The horns on their heads utterly ignored the tough and tensile leather on the fierce beast\u2019s body.\u201cRascal!\u201dSuddenly, a voice sounded from outside the courtyard.The hot-bodied young girl was wearing a light violet dress as she quickly walked into the courtyard before sitting opposite Duan Ling Tian. She teased the two little pythons as she said, \u201cRascal, make a trip to the Misty Forest with me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was utterly fixated on the young girl\u2019s well developed pair of jade hills as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva.\u201cStinking rascal, what\u2019re you looking at!\u201dLi Fei glared at Duan Ling Tian before continuing, \u201cI just broke through and want to try out my strength on some fierce beasts\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve broken through?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stupefied.\u201cYes.\u201dLi Fei nodded with a smile. \u201cGrandfather said that my fast progress was all thanks to the high purity Origin Increasing Pills you refined, and if it was Origin Increasing Pills refined by ordinary alchemists, even if I cultivated the Galactic Star Technique, I would still need another half a year before being able to break through.\u201d\u201cOf course, don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled complacently. \u201cIn terms of medicinal effect, my Origin Increasing Pill with over 90% purity is at least twice as effective as the Origin Increasing Pills sold in Aurora City\u2019s trade market\u2026 Under the same absorption circumstances, compared to others who consume ordinary Origin Increasing Pills, your cultivation speed should be twice as fast.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re great, egomaniac!\u201d Li Fei rebuked.She could still remember how upon learning of the medicinal effect of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s Origin Increasing Pill, her grandfather was dumbstruck for a long long time before finally regaining his senses and actually swearing\u2026That was the first time in her life that she saw her grandfather so discomposed.When she finally found out from her grandfather about what a purity of over 90% really represented, even she was shocked.According to her grandfather, an Origin Increasing Pill costed 5,000 silver in Aurora City\u2019s trade market.However, the Origin Increasing Pill Duan Ling Tian refined would easily be able to go over 100,000 silver for merely one pill\u2026\u201cKe Er\u2019s cultivating, so let\u2019s not disturb her and go ourselves,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said to Li Fei.After notifying his mother, Duan Ling Tian glanced at the two little pythons that were looking at him with anticipation and said, while glaring, \u201cYou two little guys behave yourselves and stay at home. If you dare to follow me, I\u2019ll cook the two of you in a pot of snake soup!\u201dAs long as he brought the two little pythons along into the Misty Forest, it would be nearly impossible for him to encounter any fierce beasts\u2026 Unless it was a high ranked fierce beast, other fierce beasts would hide the moment they noticed the aura emanating from the two little pythons.The two little pythons nodded their heads with wronged expressions, seemingly beginning to be able to understand what Duan Ling Tian meant. They then coiled up the large tree in the courtyard and looked on at Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei\u2019s disappearing figure with eager eyes.\u201cHiss hiss~~\u201dIt wasn\u2019t long before they forgot their worries and were happily coiling about the large tree\u2026Misty Forest. Duan Ling Tian had already come here at least ten times, and thus was extremely familiar with it.\u201cRascal, let\u2019s go slightly deeper in this time.\u201dLi Fei was slightly excited; even her face was flushed.\u201cGoing in deep is fine, but you must not leave my line of sight.\u201dAfter entering the Misty Forest, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression became more serious.\u201cI know.\u201dLi Fei rolled her eyes at Duan Ling Tian.In the beginning, it was hard for her to understand how the youth usually was fearless and did whatever he wished without restraint, but after entering Misty Forest, he would instead advance gradually and carefully.Now she had become accustomed to Duan Ling Tian\u2019s vigilance.She didn\u2019t know, however, that it was utterly Duan Ling Tian\u2019s instinct\u2026An instinct he developed from his years of life as a member of the Special Forces and a mercenary.Once he entered Misty Forest, his nerves would be slightly tenser as he vigilantly scanned the surroundings for safety\u2019s sake.In his previous life, this instinct had saved his life not less than ten times.\u201cEh, something\u2019s not right.\u201dAfter being in the inner area for some time, Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei didn\u2019t encounter not one fierce beast.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s expression became heavy.Whoosh! Whoosh!Suddenly, two incomparably fast figures flew down from the sky and floated above Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei.These were two middle-aged men that seemed to be worn out from a journey.The middle-aged men wore black clothing. One of them had a stiff expression. The other middle-aged man had a hideous appearance and was emitting an evil and greedy gaze as he stared at Li Fei.\u201cVoid Stage martial artists!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s heart trembled. He was unable to comprehend why a Void Stage powerhouse would appear in Misty Forest.A Void Stage powerhouse was an existence that surpassed the Nascent Soul Stage.\u201cFlying\u2026 People can really fly\u2026\u201dLi Fei was dumbstruck. Although she had heard of Void Stage martial artists and even knew that they had the ability to control the air and fly, when she really saw it, she still couldn\u2019t help herself from being shocked.In the next moment, she noticed the lustful gaze of one of the middle-aged men, and her beautiful eyebrows frowned.Just at this moment, Duan Ling Tian took a step forward and stood in front of Li Fei, fearlessly looking the Void Stage martial artist in the eye.\u201cA mere ant dares to stop me from looking at a beauty? Hmph!\u201dThe Void Stage martial artist grunted coldly, condensing his sound into a line and blasting it into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.Instantly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eardrums quaked!\u201cPu!\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face turned pale as he spat out a mouthful of blood.Only a mere cold grunt was already enough to injure Duan Ling Tian.\u201cRascal!\u201dLi Fei\u2019s expression turned pale as she hurriedly went to support Duan Ling Tian.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dDuan Ling Tian took a deep breath as he continued to protect Li Fei behind him before once again looking at the Void Stage martial artists with a ghastly and firm gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let me see how hard the bones of this ant is.\"The Void Stage martial artist sneered. The imposing manner that pressed down upon Duan Ling Tian increased in intensity.The pressure on Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body doubled, but only Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted before he grit his teeth and endured. His will was firm like a mountain.The Void Stage martial artist\u2019s gaze turned cold and a killing intent arose within him.Just at this moment.The other Void Stage martial artist frowned as he said in a cold and indifferent manner, \"Enough, Sun Rui, don\u2019t create unnecessary problems! If you delay our true purpose, the sect leader won\u2019t forgive you.\"\"Kid, remember that in front of me, you\u2019re just an ant! If I desired to kill you, it would be no different than killing an ant\u2026 I disdain to kill you.\"The Void Stage martial artist tried to smash Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pride with his words.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body lightly trembled and his eyes emitted a ghastly brilliance as if ready to swallow someone up.\"Let\u2019s go!\"The two Void Stage martial artists rose into the air before flying into the distance.Bang!In the end, Duan Ling Tian couldn\u2019t persist any longer. He limply fell on the ground and continuously spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.The imposing manner of a Void Stage martial artist wasn\u2019t something that the current him could withstand.Earlier, he was forcefully withstanding it and was on the verge of collapse.\"Rascal, you\u2019re injured.\"Li Fei\u2019s face was pale and her eyes went red from anxiousness. She withdrew a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill in a flurry and gave it to Duan Ling Tian to consume.After consuming the medicinal pill, Duan Ling Tian slightly recuperated.His eyes still gazed with a strong killing intent at the far off spot that the two Void Stage martial artists\u2019 figures disappeared.He wasn\u2019t a person that liked to cause trouble, but if someone tried bully him, he wouldn\u2019t easily let it go\u2026Currently, his strength was inferior.But he was still young and full of ability; that combined with the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor that he had merged with, as far as he was concerned, he would catch up sooner or later and even surpass the Void Stage martial artist from before\u2026At that time, Duan Ling Tian would make him regret his actions today.\"Sun Rui? I\u2019ll remember it.\"Duan Ling Tian deeply committed this name to memory.This was the second person since he arrived in this world that made his heart emit a monstrous killing intent.The first was Imperial City\u2019s Duan Clan\u2019s Duan Ling Xing.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s incomparably strong fleshly body which could exert a force of five ancient mammoths allowed him to quickly recover his injuries after consuming a Grade Eight Gold Injury Pill and absorbing its medicinal effect.At this moment, Li Fei stood at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side and stared fixedly at him with a gentle and affectionate gaze.Earlier, when facing the two Void Stage martial artists, she was extremely scared, to the extent that her legs seemed to be as heavy as lead and unable to move a single inch.At the moment she felt the most helpless, Duan Ling Tian stood out and shielded her behind him, like a fearless guardian angel that shielded her from everything\u2026He would rather get injured himself than allowing anyone to injure her.Her heart started trembling lightly\u2026At this moment, she felt that this man was worthy of her entrusting her life to.\"Huh?\"Suddenly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s nose jerked as if he had smelled something. His gaze focused slightly as he looked into the distance before flashing over.Li Fei had a puzzled expression as she followed him.Duan Ling Tian noticed that behind the nearby bushes was a man lying on the floor, or more accurately speaking, a corpse.This was a young man with a body full of injuries, and in his hand was a jade slip. Origin Energy could be vaguely seen dissipating from his body, and the injuries on his body that were temporarily patched up with Origin Energy started to have fresh blood that was unpleasant to the eye flow out all over the ground.And it was precisely this that allowed Duan Ling Tian to smell the scent of blood and notice him.Seeing the bloody scene, Li Fei turned her head away and her expression turned ghastly white.\"This jade slip seems to be\u2026\"Duan Ling Tian picked up the jade slip and, thanks to the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, recognized what it was and thus poured his Origin Energy into it.A voice entered into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears.\"Fated one, I\u2019m the Young Sect Leader of Boundless Sect, Shang Guan Yu. Please be sure to properly put away the Jade Sword in my spatial ring\u2026 If you can one day cultivate to the Void Initiation Stage, you may head to Azure Forest Imperial Kingdom and get in touch with the owners of the other eight Jade Swords. Once all nine Jade Swords are gathered together, you can all head out to find the Sword Monarch\u2019s Treasure. With these eight Jade Swords, you will be able to open the treasure and obtain a great fortuitous gain\u2026 My Boundless Sect suffered complete annihilation because of this Jade Sword!\"\"Besides that, if you have the chance of traveling to the Azure Forest Imperial Kingdom, out of the fate between us when you received my Jade Sword, I hope that you send the Voice Transmission Jade Slip within my Spatial Ring to the Solitary Summit and pass it to a reclusive old man by the name of Shang Guan Yan. Shang Guan Yu expresses his thanks.\"After Duan Ling Tian finished listening, a light flashed within his eyes and he was slightly excited.Azure Forest Imperial Kingdom, Duan Ling Tian had heard off it. The Crimson Sky Kingdom he was currently residing in was precisely a kingdom under the rule of the Azure Forest Imperial Kingdom.\"According to the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor, some Martial Monarchs and Martial Emperors liked to place some of their treasures at certain locations, then they would put restrictions in place and distribute keys for the future generations to fight for\u2026 To them, this was a game. This sort of game was something Rebirth Martial Emperor had played on countless occasions\u2026\"\"The treasures that Rebirth Martial Emperor originally planned to use in his third lifetime are all concealed in the \u2018Foreign Lands\u2019 and are currently unreachable to me\u2026 However, this Sword Monarch\u2019s Treasure is at the Azure Forest Imperial Kingdom, a very realistic and readily available location.\"Duan Ling Tian inhaled deeply.An existence called \"Sword Monarch\" would undoubtedly be a Martial Monarch Stage sword cultivator.Although the Martial Monarch Stage was a stage inferior to the Martial Emperor Stage, the treasures he left would certainly be extremely valuable.Duan Ling Tian removed the Spatial Ring from the young man\u2019s hand and dripped his blood on it to establish ownership.He was pleasantly surprised at what was inside.\"I didn\u2019t expect that he would also be an alchemist\u2026. By the looks of the pile of rare materials he collected, he should be a Grade Seven Alchemist. Not bad, these materials can save me a huge sum of money.\"\"Is this Jade Sword one of the keys to the Sword Monarch\u2019s Treasure? Hmm, and this Voice Transmission Jade Slip.\"Duan Ling Tian withdrew the jade slip and poured Origin Energy into it.A voice one again entered into Duan Ling Tian\u2019s ears. \"Great grandfather, the Boundless Sect is no more. Father and all the elders all died in battle\u2026. It was the Black Fiend Sect that annihilated the Boundless Sect.\"This Voice Transmission Jade Slip was precisely the jade slip that the young man asked Duan Ling Tian to pass to the old man in Solitary Summit.\"Looks like that Sun Rui is from the Black Fiend Sect.\"Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered as a cold light flashed through them.In his opinion, Sun Rui and the other Void Stage martial artist were undoubtedly chasing after Shang Guan Yu to kill him and seize the Jade Sword.\"Rascal, what\u2019re you day dreaming about?\"Li Fei\u2019s voice caused Duan Ling Tian to regain his senses.The sound from the Voice Transmission Jade Slip could only be heard by the person who poured Origin Energy into it, and as such Li Fei wasn\u2019t aware of what had happened.\"Nothing, I feel he\u2019s quite pitiable.\"Duan Ling Tian shook his head. After a while, he started a fire and burned away the young man\u2019s corpse.\"Little Fei, do you want to return and rest?\"Such an incident caused Duan Ling Tian to be slightly worried about Li Fei.\"Rascal, if you\u2019re tired and want to rest, then we can head home,\" Li Fei said lightly.Duan Ling Tian noticed the change in attitude Li Fei had towards him.Looks like being a hero and saving the beauty would forever be the most formidable method of chasing girls\u2026\"I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s go look ahead and see if there\u2019s any suitable fierce beasts to hunt.\"Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei continued to go deeper into the Misty Forest.During this period of time, they encountered many fierce beasts. The stronger ones were taken care of by Duan Ling Tian, only leaving some fierce beasts at the fourth level of the Core Formation Stage or below for Li Fei to deal with.Li Fei enjoyed herself the as she continued hunting, but unknowingly, the sky had turned dark.\"Looks like we will have to spend the night here,\" Duan Ling Tian thought in his heart.That night, the moon was bright in the starless sky. Duan Ling Tian and Li Fei leaned shoulder to shoulder on the trunk of a large tree as they gazed into the sky.\"Rascal, even though I had heard before that a Void Stage martial artist was able to control the air and fly, I only thought it was just an exaggeration; never did I think that it was real.\"Li Fei\u2019s tone sounded slightly complicated.\"Some things aren\u2019t always groundless rumors.\"Duan Ling Tian lightly smiled.\"Weren\u2019t you afraid of the two Void Stage martial artists from today?\" Li Fei asked.\"Of course I was.\"Duan Ling Tian truthfully replied.A Void Stage martial artist could kill the current him with but a wave of his hand.If he said he wasn\u2019t afraid, that would be a lie.Li Fei gazed at Duan Ling Tian as she asked, in a light voice, \"Then you still\u2026 still protected me.\"\"Isn\u2019t a man protecting a woman a principle of heaven and earth? Moreover, don\u2019t you forget, you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9, so of course I would protect you\u2026. Not to mention Void Stage martial artists, even if it was a Martial Monarch or Martial Emperor, I would still protect you at the first instant.\"Duan Ling Tian smiled.\"Martial Monarch? Martial Emperor?\"Li Fei was fazed, obviously having not heard of such terms before.\"A Martial Monarch is an existence that surpasses the Void Transformation Stage powerhouses, and a Martial Emperor is an existence that surpasses a Martial Monarch, an existence at the pinnacle of Cloud Continent,\" Duan Ling Tian explained.\"How do you know all this?\"Li Fei was slightly surprised.\"I read a few books.\"Duan Ling Tian smiled.What a joke! He was the inheritor of the memories of Rebirth Martial Emperor; he naturally was clear of all this.\"You mentioned Void Transformation Stage powerhouses. What stage is that?\"Li Fei felt slightly curious.\"Little Fei, commit this to memory: above the Nascent Soul Stage is the Void Stage. The Void Stage is separated into four stages, namely the Void Prying Stage, the Void Initiation Stage, the Void Interpretation Stage, and the Void Transformation Stage,\" Duan Ling Tian slowly explained.\"So that\u2019s how it is.\"Li Fei lightly nodded. \"Rascal, I\u2019ve really underestimated you. So you actually knew so many things.\"\"Of course, don\u2019t you know who I am?\"Duan Ling Tian was slightly complacent.\"Pei! I only slightly praised you and you\u2019re already floating.\"Li Fei rebuked.\"Little Fei.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Don\u2019t call me rascal anymore, it sounds so bad.\"\"Then I\u2019ll call you scoundrel from now on.\"\"Scoundrel? Did you actually call me a scoundrel? Then I\u2019ll let you see how much of a scoundrel I am.\"\"Ah! What\u2019re you doing?\"\"I\u2019m proving that I\u2019m not a scoundrel of course.\"\"Scoundrel, stop!\"\"Little Fei\u2026 I\u2026 want you\u2026\"\"No.\"\"You\u2019re not willing to give it to me?\"\"You\u2019re not allowed for these few days, my\u2026 that thing has arrived.\"\"F**k!\"\u2026After hearing this, Duan Ling Tian dispiritedly climbed off Li Fei\u2019s hot and delicate body, but of course not before stealing a good feel of it.In the end, he embraced Li Fei and fell into deep sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve been wanting to go look for you these past few days.\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian, Tang Ying\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cThe Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid is out of stock? No\u2026 I just concocted two large crocks of them for you half a month ago.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s brows slightly jerked.\u201cIt isn\u2019t the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid, but the Blood Crescent Inscription.\u201dTang Ying smiled.\u201cBlood Crescent Inscription? I don\u2019t think Ghastly Shadow had any big movements in Aurora City lately, right?\u201dDuan Ling Tian had a face full of vigilance as he looked at Tang Ying. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been selling off all the Blood Crescent Inscriptions I inscribed for you, right?\u2019Tang Ying laughed embarrassedly.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you how you deal with them, but you better not drag me into it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve only sold it to some of the people in charge within Ghastly Shadow\u2026 As for you, I have never once mentioned your existence,\u201d said Tang Ying.\u201cHow many do you want this time?\u201d Duan Ling Tian knit his brows as he asked.Tang Ying pondered for a moment before speaking. \u201cThirty.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shrugged and said indifferently, \u201cYou really know how to ask for exorbitant amounts\u2026 But forget it, it\u2019s the last time I inscribe for you anyway.\u201d\u201cThe last time?\u201dTang Ying was dazed momentarily, as he was unable to understand what Duan Ling Tian\u2019s words meant.\u201cOne month from now, I\u2019ll be leaving Aurora City,\u201d Duan Ling Tian said.\u201cOne month from now?\u201dTang Ying\u2019s eyes flickered as his gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian. \u201cYou plan to enter the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp to participate in the Paladin Academy\u2019s test?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve guessed it.\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly surprised.\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t that difficult. Since you plan to leave, it would surely mean you weren\u2019t resigned to continue staying in Aurora City. With your natural talent and comprehension ability, entering Paladin Academy would undoubtedly be your best choice\u2026 Adding on the fact that you will leave in a month\u2019s time, it would surely be for the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp without a doubt.\u201dTang Ying lightly smiled.\u201cAren\u2019t there other tests available to enter Paladin Academy? How do you know I\u2019m not going to participate in the other tests?\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked, in a questioning manner.\u201cYes, there are other tests, but those tests are all held in the other 17 counties of the Crimson Sky Kingdom\u2026 In our Swallow Mountain County, there is only one choice: Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp,\u201d Tang Ying said.Duan Ling Tian suddenly understood. \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\u201cRight, how much do you know about the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp? I heard it\u2019s very brutal inside, even to the extent of being called a place where one only has a 10% chance at survival,\u201d Duan Ling Tian asked curiously.\u201cThe Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp is indeed brutal, but that would be towards ordinary youths\u2026 Freaks like you only need to know their place and mind their own business. As long as you don\u2019t offend the instructors there, surviving a year can be done easily.\u201dTang Ying was extremely confident of Duan Ling Tian.\u201cInstructor? Could it be the officers of the Iron Blood Army?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was slightly curious.\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s indeed those madmen from the Iron Blood Army\u2026\u201dTang Ying nodded.\u201cMadmen?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was puzzled.\u201cYou\u2019ll know why I call them madmen once you\u2019re at the Genius Camp.\u201dEven Tang Ying was rather fearful when mentioning the Iron Blood Army.\u201cI actually slightly look forward to it now that you\u2019ve put it that way.\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered.Duan Ling Tian would definitely be able to rise to the peak of the Crimson Sky Kingdom no matter what path he took by relying on Rebirth Martial Emperor\u2019s lifelong memories. But Duan Ling Tian still chose the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp.Besides stemming from a sort of persistence from his previous life towards a military career\u2026There was still another reason.Once he passes the test, which was the Genius Camp itself, he would be able to obtain the qualifications to study at Paladin Academy.The Paladin Academy was situated in the Imperial City!Duan Ling Xing was at the Imperial City as well!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes emitted a dense killing intent as the aura on his body involuntarily swept out.Tang Ying\u2019s face was filled with shock as he felt the icy cold killing intent that was coming off Duan Ling Tian.This type of killing intent was something even he didn\u2019t possess.His hands had at least a few hundred lives on them after all, but even he hadn\u2019t developed such a terrifying killing intent yet.\u201cI\u2019ve only felt this type of killing intent on one person before\u2026 However, how could this kid compare to that person? This kid is merely sixteen years old; how could he possibly have this type of killing intent!?\u201dAt this moment, Tang Ying felt his scalp go numb.Even though Duan Ling Tian\u2019s current strength was far inferior from his, Duan Ling Tian was still able to make him feel a pressure that stemmed from the bottom of his heart by relying solely on his killing intent.Even in the entire Ghastly Shadow, there was only one person capable of making him feel such pressure by relying solely on killing intent.That person was precisely the number one assassin in Ghastly Shadow, Demon.\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go.\u201dDuan Ling Tian looked towards Tang Ying and faintly smiled.The reason he came to look for Tang Ying was to ask him about the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, and now his objective had been reached.\u201cWait.\u201dTang Ying however stopped him.\u201cYes?\u201dDuan Ling Tian questioned.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, how about you don\u2019t go to the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp, and instead let me recommend you to our Ghastly Shadow\u2019s headquarter? With your natural talent combined with my recommendation, you will undoubtedly be one of the main targets of fostering within the organization, and you would soon become a trump card assassin of Ghastly Shadow.\u201dTang Ying\u2019s eyes narrowed as he made this suggestion.As far as he was concerned, as long as Duan Ling Tian joined Ghastly Shadow, him surpassing the current number one assassin, Demon, would only be a matter of time.Duan Ling Tian shrugged as he said in a disapproving manner, \u201cBe an assassin? Not interested.\u201d\u201cKid, you haven\u2019t felt that sort of pleasure yet\u2026 Think about the day when even his majesty, the Emperor of Crimson Sky Kingdom, will experience a change in expression when speaking of you. How satisfying will that feel? It would absolutely be the best spiritual indulgence! With your natural talent and comprehension ability, I\u2019m confident it won\u2019t be long before you can become a top assassin within our Ghastly Shadow.\u201d\u201cNot interested.\u201dDuan Ling Tian shook his head.\u201cYou\u2026 You have such an icy cold killing intent on you; you\u2019re simply born to be an assassin. Not being one would be such a waste.\u201dTang Ying had an expression that seemed to show that he was eager due to him cherishing geniuses.\u201cKilling intent? Are you talking about this?\u201dAt the moment Duan Ling Tian\u2019s voice faded, an even more terrifying killing intent swept out from his body, pressing itself onto Tang Ying.Tang Ying\u2019s face turned slightly pale as he suffused his Origin Energy around his body. Only then was he able to withstand the bloodthirsty killing intent that was roaring out of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s body.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dTang Ying was dumbstruck.This killing extent even surpassed the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s number one assassin, Demon!\u201cTang Ying, only now did I realize that you were actually so senseless\u2026 You concluded that I was born to be an assassin by merely relying on this? All you need to do is go kill a few more people and you will naturally be tainted with this kind of killing intent.\u201dDuan Ling Tian glanced at Tang Ying in disdain.\u201cYou\u2026 Kid, I\u2019m curious, how many people have you killed to dare to be conceited in front of me, the person in charge of the Ghastly Shadow\u2019s operations in Aurora City!\u201dTang Ying was slightly angry from embarrassment.\u201cI don\u2019t remember anymore\u2026 In total, it should at least be over 10,000 people\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze seemed to drift, as if drifting away into the distant past.Only when Duan Ling Tian left did Tang Ying come back to his senses.\u201cThis kid really dares to talk nonsense. Over 10,000? Who would believe a little ass kid like him?\u201dTang Ying didn\u2019t take it seriously and only thought Duan Ling Tian was bragging.But it still couldn\u2019t stop him from sighing.The Ghastly Shadow organization had lost a promising youth\u2026After leaving the medicine store, Duan Ling Tian was slightly speechless as well.Born to be an assassin?The killing intent that stemmed from his soul was something that was accumulated from the bloodshed he experienced as a mercenary in his previous lifetime\u2026Every time he took on an assignment, if it was an assassination, the head count on his hands would be relatively small.If he ever conducted a large scaled \u2018deal\u2019 in a region and used a weapon of mass destruction, the number of casualties would at least amount to tens of people, and on occasion amount of hundreds and even thousands.Saying that he had killed more than 10,000 people was actually him holding back on the actual numbers.Duan Ling Tian noticed two people coming towards him at the moment he entered the Li Clan Estate.One was a youth around the age of eighteen and the other was a young man over twenty years old.The youth was a familiar face, Li Yuan.As Li Yuan saw Duan Ling Tian, a trace of fear was emitted from his brows and he lowered his head.Obviously he was afraid of Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe young man beside Li Yuan noticed his movements, then his gaze descended upon Duan Ling Tian. \u201cLittle brother Yuan, who is he? You seems to be afraid of him.\u201d\u201cBrother Guang, he is Duan Ling Tian.\u201dThe corners of Li Yuan\u2019s mouth were filled with a bitter smile.If it was said that he still had the confidence to battle Duan Ling Tian before the Clan Martial Meet took place, then after seeing Duan Ling Tian defeat Li Kuang with his own two eyes, and even defeating the Core Formation Stage disciples of the inner court\u2026From that moment onwards, he knew that he had already lost the qualifications to compare himself with Duan Ling Tian.Even when he encountered Duan Ling Tian later on, he chose to directly admit defeat.\u201cDuan Ling Tian? This year\u2019s top ranked on the Hidden Dragon List?\u201dLi Guang eyes constricted as an interest arose within him.\u201cDuan Ling Tian!\u201dLi Guang walked up quickly to block in front of Duan Ling Tian.\u201cHmm?\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned and his gaze descended upon Li Yuan. \u201cWhat, Li Yuan, what do you want?\u201dHe naturally thought it was Li Yuan who asked this person to block his path.After all, he didn\u2019t recognize this person.Li Yuan had a face full of a bitter smile, as he knew that Duan Ling Tian had misunderstood, and thus he hurriedly said to Li Guang, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. Brother Guang, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cI heard you snatched away my cousin\u2019s woman.\u201dLi Guang paid no attention to Li Yuan and instead looked at Duan Ling Tian, his eyes flickering with a fierce light.\u201cYour cousin\u2019s woman?\u201dDuan Ling Tian hadn\u2019t reacted to what was being said.\u201cLi Yuan is my cousin.\u201dLi Guang grunted coldly.\u201cLi Yuan, when did I snatch away your woman?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stunned.\u201cBrother Guang, what nonsense are you speaking of?\u201dLi Yuan\u2019s face flushed red.\u201cLittle brother Yuan, when did you become such a pu**y? This isn\u2019t how you used to be.\u201dLi Guang frowned once again before glancing at Duan Ling Tian and sneering. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a young girl called Ke Er at your side? She\u2019s the woman my cousin took a fancy to. If you\u2019re sensible, then hurry up and leave her side, or else don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless!\u201dLi Yuan was stupefied. When did he ever say that the young girl at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s side was his woman?He had only just casually praised her, and said her beauty was not one bit inferior to Li Fei\u2019s\u2026Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted and his piercingly cold gaze descended upon Li Yuan.\u201cDuan Ling Tian, I never said such a thing\u2026 I really didn\u2019t\u2026\u201dLi Yuan became afraid and had a bitter smile on his face.\u201cYou\u2019ve never said such a thing\u2026 Then it\u2019s him who\u2019s talking nonsense and slandering my Ke Er?\u2019Duan Ling Tian fierce and sharp gaze descended upon Li Guang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Touch it and one will absolutely die!Ke Er was precisely Duan Ling Tian\u2019s reverse scale\u2026Noticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze, Li Guang\u2019s eyes turned cold as he shouted in a low voice, \u201cDuan Ling Tian, so what if I\u2019m talking nonsense? Do you really think that just because you\u2019re the leading figure in Aurora City\u2019s younger generation, you can look down upon me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about others, but you\u2026 I really do look down upon you.\u201dThe corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dLi Guang\u2019s expression greatly distorted as he roared.Bang!He swung out his fist that was filled with raging Origin Energy, and it flashed in full fury straight towards Duan Ling Tian while whistling through the air.Above him, six ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed into form.Fourth level Core Formation martial artist!Li Guang attacked with full force right at the get go. His attack was utterly ruthless.\u201cFourth level of the Core Formation Stage? No wonder you\u2019re so arrogant\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze slightly focused as he took a step forwards before sweeping his hands out.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u2026\u2026Instantly, fist and palm silhouettes suffused with Origin Energy swept out, seeming to transform into layers of mist.Abruptly.Whoosh!Dragon\u2019s Finishing Touch!Duan Ling Tian\u2019s finger tore through the air accompanied by a piercing howl as it descended upon Li Guang\u2019s fist, which was approaching in full fury.In the blink of an eye, six ancient mammoth silhouettes appeared above Duan Ling Tian.Crack!The clear sound of a bone breaking sounded.\u201cAh!\u201dInstantly, Li Guang emitted a shrill cry, then his body trembled and flew out seven or eight meters like an arrow that had left the bowstrings, before crashing onto the ground in a sorry state.Subsequently, Li Guang clasped his finger bone that had shattered and rolled on the floor while emitting heart-rending cries; it was as if he would never feel exhausted\u2026Li Yuan was dumbstruck.Duan Ling Tian had stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage?As far as he knew, the reason Duan Ling Tian had a fleshly body that possessed an extra strength of two ancient mammoths in the past was because of him consuming a Spirit Fruit.At present, Duan Ling Tian was able to draw upon the energy of heaven and earth to condense six ancient mammoth silhouettes\u2026There was only a single possibility.Duan Ling Tian had stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage!\u201cBrother Guang, are you alright?\u201dReturning to his senses, Li Yuan quickly walked over and supported Li Guang up.Duan Ling Tian walked up with quick strides to arrive in front of Li Guang and looked at him with an icy cold gaze. \u201cKeep a low profile if you\u2019re incapable\u2026. And remember well what I said today: however strong you are, there will always be someone stronger!\u201dAfter he finished, Duan Ling Tian ignored Li Guang\u2019s gloomy expression and eyes that seemed to be emitting flames as he walked off in large strides.A martial artist at the fourth level of the Core Formation Stage was nothing to the current him.He, who was currently at the second level of the Core Formation Stage, possessed an entire seven ancient mammoths worth of strength when fully exerting himself, and was comparable to a fifth level Core Formation martial artist.Earlier, when he blasted Li Guang away, he held back and use one ancient mammoth\u2019s strength lesser than what he was capable off.Otherwise, Li Guang injuries would only be worse.Duan Ling Tian had only just entered his home when the two little pythons flashed over and dropped onto his shoulder, flicking their tongues as they licked his cheeks in an intimate manner.\u201cLittle guys, we\u2019ve only not seen each other for a day and you\u2019re already missing me?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s face emitted a smile as he looked at the two little pythons.However, in the next moment, his smile froze.Because he noticed that the two little pythons were staring at his Spatial Ring\u2026\u201cI even thought that you two little guys really missed me\u2026 But I didn\u2019t expect that all you two missed were the Origin Increasing Pills in my Spatial Ring.\u201dDuan Ling Tian derided as he realized what the two little pythons really wanted.After withdrawing two Origin Increasing Pills and tossing them over to the two little guys, Duan Ling Tian let them go play by themselves.Subsequently, Duan Ling Tian walked over to Ke Er\u2019s room\u2019s door and after noticing that Ke Er was still cultivating, he returned to his own room.After consuming an Origin Increasing Pill, Duan Ling Tian started cultivating as well.Nine Dragons War Sovereign Technique, Raging Python Form!Presently, Duan Ling Tian was charging towards the third level of the Core Formation Stage.Due to the uniqueness of the Raging Python Form, after he stepped into the second level of the Core Formation Stage and finished tempering his body with Origin Energy, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s fleshly body\u2019s strength had increased to a degree comparable to the strength of five ancient mammoths.Combined with his Origin Energy, which was comparable to the strength of two ancient mammoths, he possessed a strength of seven ancient mammoths.Once he breaks through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage, he will possess the strength of eight ancient mammoths. And if he once again completes the body tempering using Origin Energy for the third level of the Core Formation Stage, he will be able to possess the strength of nine ancient mammoths\u2026At that time, his strength would easily annihilate any sixth level Core Formation martial artist and would be approaching the strength of a seventh level Core Formation martial artist.Deep in the night.Duan Ling Tian exhaled a mouthful of foul air before ceasing to cultivate.Walking out of his room, he noticed that food was almost ready and thus sat down at the table and waited.After a short moment, the whole family sat around the table and enjoyed a meal.Duan Ling Tian gulped down a mouthful of food before saying, with a light voice, \u201cMom, I plan to head to Iron Blood City with Xiao Yu next month.\u201d\u201cGoing to the Genius Camp?\u201d asked Li Rou.\u201cMom, how did you know?\u201dDuan Ling Tian was stunned.\u201cYoung master, Big Sister Fei Fei had long since told us about it and asked us to be mentally prepared \u2026She said that during the youth gathering earlier, she noticed you being extremely interested in the Genius Camp and said you would probably go there.\u201dKe Er lightly smiled as she spoke.A strand of warmth flashed through Duan Ling Tian\u2019s heart.Never had he imagined that Li Fei had already helped pave the way for him.He originally thought that he would need to take some time and appease the two beauties at his home.\u201cTian, you\u2019re all grown up; remember to take good care of yourself when you\u2019re outside\u2026 No matter what happens, you must always put your safety above all else,\u201d Li Rou slowly said.\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d Duan Ling Tian nodded.The young girl puckered her mouth as she lightly said, \u201cYoung Master, Ke Er doesn\u2019t want to part with you\u2026\u201d\u201cSilly girl, I\u2019m only going for a year. After a year, I will certainly obtain the qualifications to study in the Paladin Academy\u2026 At that time, I will bring you and mom both to the Imperial City.\u201d Duan Ling Tian smiled as he spoke.All of this was something he had planned.Since he was leaving next month, besides cultivating, Duan Ling Tian got busy as well.Firstly he inscribed the thirty Blood Crescent Inscriptions for Tang Ying.Duan Ling Tian planned to exchange these thirty Blood Crescent Inscription for a promise from Tan Ying, a promise that for the year when he left Aurora City and was at Iron Blood City, Tang Ying would ensure his family\u2019s safety\u2026\u201cDuan Ling Tian, we\u2019re assassins, not bodyguards.\u201d Tang Ying laughed bitterly.\u201cI was originally going to ask you for 3,000,000 silver for these thirty Blood Crescent Inscriptions, but now I\u2019m not asking for any payment\u2026 Besides this, during the time I\u2019m away, our partnership would still continue as I\u2019ll ask Ke Er to take over and concoct the Six Treasures Body Tempering liquid for you\u2026\u201dDuan Ling Tian frowned. \u201cIf you\u2019re unwilling, then forget it. I\u2019ll find someone else to partner with and sell the Six Treasures Body Tempering Liquid\u2026 Hmm, I bet the Alchemist Guild and Weapons Craftsmen Guild would be interested in these thirty Blood Crescent Inscriptions.\u201d\u201cStop! I\u2019ll promise.\u201dTang Ying laughed bitterly, In the end, he still chose to compromise.Only now did Duan Ling Tian leave in satisfaction.Afterwards, he went to see the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Ao.He still remembered that Li Ao owed him a favor.\u201cPatriarch, that day during the Clan Martial Meet, when you asked me to admit defeat to Li Qing, you made me a promise. Do you remember?\u201dDuan Ling Tian didn\u2019t beat around the bush.\u201cOf course I remember. Why? Do you have something you need my help with?\u201d Li Ao asked.\u201cI will be heading to Iron Blood City to enter the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp next month\u2026 I hope that during the time I\u2019m gone, Patriarch can ensure the safety of my family,\u201d said Duan Ling Tian.\u201cYou want to enter the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp?\u201dLi Ao frowned. \u201cDuan Ling Tian, once you enter the Genius Camp, you will only have a slim chance of surviving\u2026 Have you thoroughly considered this?\u201dDuan Ling Tian nodded.\u201cI promise you.\u201dLi Ao agreed to the promise.Aurora City, Alchemist Guild.\u201cKid, I was just about to go look for you.\u201dNoticing Duan Ling Tian\u2019s arrival, Su Mo face was glowing and full of smiles.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze focused, and he was slightly surprised. \u201cGeezer, you\u2026 broke through?\u201dChi!Su Mo lifted up his hand with his palm facing up, and a gold Pill Fire flickered for a moment before vanishing. \u201cI just broke through the day before yesterday.\u201d\u201cCongratulations.\u201dDuan Ling Tian smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you that I was able to break through\u2026 After becoming a Grade Seven Alchemist, I\u2019ve already applied for being recalled back into the County City. I\u2019ll be leaving in a few days, and this mess in Aurora City will be taken over by someone else.\u201dWhen Su Mo spoke about the Aurora City\u2019s Alchemist Guild, his face was filled with dislike.\u201cYou said earlier that you were about to go look for me. You wanted to say your farewells?\u201dDuan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flickered. He was slightly surprised.\u201cYes.\u201dSu Mo nodded before saying, \u201cIs there something you came to see me for?\u201d\u201cI came to say my farewells as well\u2026 I\u2019ll be leaving Aurora City next month. I\u2019ll be heading to Iron Blood City to participate in the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp test. And through the Genius Camp\u2019s training, I\u2019ll obtain the qualifications to study in Paladin Academy,\u201d Duan Ling Tian slowly said.\u201cPaladin Academy is indeed a good choice. With your natural talent, it won\u2019t be hard to become outstanding in Paladin Academy\u2026\u201dSu Mo nodded.He already knew that everything Duan Ling Tian did was to abide by his teacher\u2019s instructions to gain experience, and as such he didn\u2019t dare throw out the Alchemist Guild\u2019s olive branch at Duan Ling Tian.\u201cGeezer, I hope we can meet again in the future.\u201dDuan Ling Tian said his farewells to Su Mo before leaving the Alchemist Guild.Su Mo sent Duan Ling Tian out the door and watched as his figure slowly faded into the distance. His eyes flickered with heartfelt gratitude.It was all thanks to Duan Ling Tian that he was able to become a Grade Seven Alchemist in such a short period of time.With his departure being near at hand, Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t leave the Li Clan Estate anymore; he only cultivated.He took his time to properly accompany his mother and Ke Er\u2026The day of farewell approached and got closer day by day.\u201cFei, I\u2019m going out for a while.\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice sounded from outside the room\u2019s door.Hearing this, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes shined brightly as he glanced at the young girl in front of him, sizing up her hot figure\u2026\u201cLittle Fei, you can\u2019t escape today!\u201dDuan Ling Tian grinned widely, causing the young girl to seem nervous, and her face blushed a bright red.A night\u2019s time passed quickly.Duan Ling Tian only woke up at dawn the next day.Looking at the beautiful red rose that had bloomed on the bedsheets, the corners of his mouth curled into a light smile.And when his gaze fell upon the beauty beside him, the smile on the corners of his mouth grew even wider, and his eyes were filled with tender affection.The beauty was still deeply asleep, and her drop dead gorgeous face was directly facing Duan Ling Tian, causing him to be infatuated for a time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other 80 cities of similar size as Aurora City will certainly have outstanding young geniuses as well\u2026 As for the County City, it will even have outstanding people appear one after the other.\" Xiao Yu deeply agreed.\"No matter what, our objective this time is to stand out of the crowd and become members of the Iron Blood Army\u2019s Genius Camp,\" Duan Ling Tian\u2019s said with a firm gaze.Presently, Duan Ling Tian had already tossed all the reluctance from leaving to the back of his head for the moment, as what he wanted to do was enter the Genius Camp, survive, and obtain the qualifications to study at Paladin Academy\u2026At that time, he would be able to bring Ke Er, Li Fei, and his mother to the Imperial City.Li Fei's grandfather also.Xiao Yu had a serious expression as he slowly said, \"We have a long journey ahead of us, so try your best not to get into any unwanted trouble.\"Duan Ling Tian and Meng Quan both nodded.Especially Duan Ling Tian, as he couldn't help himself from recalling what happened outside Triumph City the other day.Fortunately, that son of the County Governor didn't investigate all the way to Aurora City.After experiencing a long and arduous journey for a month and being careful along the way, they eventually arrived at Iron Blood City.Although it was one of the 81 cities under the rule of Swallow Mountain County, Iron Blood City was slightly different.Iron Blood City was the only city under Swallow Mountain County that wasn\u2019t required to pay taxes to the County Governor\u2019s Estate, as the taxes of Iron Blood City were completely taken as the soldiers\u2019 provisions for the Iron Blood Army.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s pupils constricted as he arrived outside of Iron Blood City and gazed at the city that seemed like a metal drum.For the next year, he would be spending his days here.\"So many people.\"Meng Quan\u2019s gaze descended on Iron Blood City\u2019s city gate, where every path was filled with groups of youths galloping through.Even though the Genius Camp was brutal, there was still a slim chance of survival. If they could stay alive, then it would be a chance to achieve greatness.In addition to that, there were also plenty of people who wanted to try their luck.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group followed the stream of people and galloped into Iron Blood City.The road in front of their eyes abruptly became clear.Streams of people came and went through the streets, bustling with noise and excitement\u2026\"We\u2019ve finally arrived. Dammit, an entire two month\u2019s journey; it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve travelled so damned far.\"\"Two months isn\u2019t too bad; some people even travelled for nearly three months.\"\"Let\u2019s go find a place to have a nice bath first. Dammit, I\u2019m so itchy all over.\"\u2026Two youths galloped past Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group; one of the youths grumbled all the way.\"Two months?\"Meng Quan was stunned before laughing bitterly. \"We only travelled for a month and I already can\u2019t take it. I didn\u2019t expect there to be people worse off than us.\"\"Of course there are. Iron Blood City is situated east of Swallow Mountain County, and our Aurora City is pretty well off as we\u2019re only at the southeast of Swallow Mountain County\u2026 People from the west of Swallow Mountain County require at least three months of travel to arrive at Iron Blood City.\"Xiao Yu shook his head and smiled.After travelling along together with Xiao Yu for this past month, Duan Ling Tian noticed something.Xiao Yu would always had an icy cold expression when he faced strangers.But when he faced people he was familiar with, he was instead extremely casual.According to the sayings of his past lifetime, it would be acting cool!\"In any case, since we have already arrived, let\u2019s go look for an inn to stay in first,\" Duan Ling Tian said.Before long, the three of them found a relatively clean inn to stay at.After resting for a few hours, when dusk nearly descended onto the land, the three of them left the inn and went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.The three of them hadn\u2019t eaten a proper meal this entire month.The restaurant was entirely filled with people; however, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group\u2019s luck wasn\u2019t bad, as there so happened to be a table beside the window that had just finished their meal and left.\"There\u2019s really so many people.\"Meng Quan sighed after sitting down.\"It should be the busiest period for Iron Blood City around this time every year.\"Duan Ling Tian took a look around and noticed that more that 60% of the people dining in the restaurant were youths; moreover, they were mostly gulping down their food in a hurry as they obviously had not eaten a proper meal in a long time.These people were probably young geniuses that had just arrived at Iron Blood City like the three of them.Before long, two waiters came over and cleared the used cutlery off the table.\"Today we can finally eat a proper meal.\"Xiao Yu smiled.Suddenly, four youths arrived at Duan Ling Tian\u2019s table.A blue-clothed youth among them with big eyes and bushy eyebrows said, with a thunderous voice, \"The three of you, hurry up and leave. This table is ours.\"Duan Ling Tian indifferently swept the blue-clothed youth with his gaze and ignored him.Xiao Yu was too lazy to pay attention to him either.However, Meng Quan\u2019s expression sunk and he said in rage, \"Why should we? We\u2019ve already taken this table. If you want a place, wait for someone else to finish eating.\"\"Kid, do you know who we are?\"Another green-clothed youth among them had eyes that emitted a fierce light.\"What\u2019s that got to do with me? All I know is that this table is ours.\"Meng Quan argued based on reason.\"You three really want to oppose our Yu Clan? Our Yu Clan is one of the five great clans in the County City. It isn\u2019t something you bumpkins from the small clans of small cities can compare to,\" a grey-clothed youth snapped.\"County City clan?\"Meng Quan\u2019s face turned slightly grim.Aurora City\u2019s three great clans were already colossi to Meng Quan, let alone the great clans of the County City; they were practically titans.\"Yes, we\u2019re precisely disciples of the Yu Clan.\"Noticing Meng Quan\u2019s expression, the grey-clothed youth was slightly complacent.\"Waiter, get us a table full of the best specialty dishes in the restaurant.\"Duan Ling Tian picked his ears as he looked towards the waiter and placed his order.Xiao Yu had an icy cold expression as he coolly added, \"And another two jars of wine.\"\"Yes, customer.\"Hearing what they said, the waiter hurriedly went to prepare it.\"Didn\u2019t you hear what I said?\u2019The grey-clothed youth\u2019s expression turned gloomy as he angrily gazed at Duan Ling Tian.The other three youths beside him had ugly expressions as well\u2026\"Xiao Yu, why do you think there are such annoying lifeforms like flies in this world?\"Duan Ling Tian looked at Xiao Yu as he faked an astonished expression.\"Who knows? Maybe they were born wanting to be despised.\"Xiao Yu went along.\"You have a point. Meng Quan, what do you think?\"Duan Ling Tian looked at Meng Quan.Meng Quan was from a small clan after all, and as such couldn\u2019t help being dumbstruck for a moment when he heard that the youths were from a large clan in the County City.Now that he saw Duan Ling Tian and Xiao Yu being so fearless, even he was influenced, so he took a deep breath and regained his composure. \"I think so too.\"\"You\u2019re all courting death!\"The grey-clothed youth\u2019s face distorted and he slapped his palm that flared with Origin Energy, flashing straight towards the \u2018initiator,\u2019 Duan Ling Tian.Above him, four ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed.\"Third level Core Formation martial artist!\"Meng Quan\u2019s face became grim.\"Hmph!\"Xiao Yu grunted coldly as he swung out his sleeve that was suffused with Origin Energy to intercept the grey-clothed youth\u2019s palm strike.Above Xiao Yu, a similar four ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed\u2026Sleeve Dimension!Bang!The grey-clothed youth\u2019s body trembled as his hand felt numbed and momentarily even lost all feeling, only to recover after a few moments.\"Xiao Yu, you\u2019ve broken through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage?!\" Meng Quan exclaimed.\"I broke through a month ago.\"Xiao Yu nodded.\"Kill them!\"The grey-clothed youth\u2019s expression was gloomy as he shouted explosively and pounced towards Xiao Yu.Instantly, the other three youths attacked at the same time, flashing out with immense force.\"F**k off!\"The corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a sneer as he abruptly roared and stood up.He casually swung out his arm, even to the extent of not using any martial skills.It was just like a huge python\u2019s tail swinging out!In the blink of an eye, six ancient mammoth silhouettes condensed above him, dazzling the eyes of everyone present.A terrifying force poured out of his arm, flying straight towards the four youths that were approaching menacingly.Instantly, the four youths came and went like the wind and were blasted away before crashing onto the floor in a sorry state.\"Fourth level of the Core Formation Stage!\"The restaurant was in an uproar.Gazes filled with disbelief descended onto Duan Ling Tian one after the other, as their hearts were filled with shock.\"Oh my god! This youth looks to be around sixteen or seventeen years old, but he\u2019s actually a fourth level Core Formation martial artist!\"\"Which city and which clan did this monster come from?\"\"Could he be a member of one of the large clans of the County City?\"\"Impossible, didn\u2019t you hear what those four youths said? They are members of the County City\u2019s Yu Clan. With his natural talent, if he was from a large clan in the County City, how could these four youths not recognize him?\"\"County City\u2019s Yu Clan really lost face this time.\"\u2026The crowd started discussing together.Many people had faces full of a mocking smiles as they looked towards the four youths that were struggling to stand up.\"Fourth level of the Core Formation Stage\u2026\"The four youths had ugly expressions and their gazes emitted a sense of fear as they looked at Duan Ling Tian.\"If you still don\u2019t want to f**k off, then don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless.\"Duan Ling Tian\u2019s gaze went cold as he swept his gaze over the four of them.\"Kid, the Yu Clan won\u2019t let you off.\"The four youths\u2019 faces distorted as they fled the scene in a sorry state, and at the same time they didn\u2019t forget to leave a threat.Duan Ling Tian paid no attention to their threats and returned to his seat.\"You two\u2026\"Duan Ling Tian quickly noticed that Xiao Yu and Meng Quan were staring fixedly at him, causing him to instantly feel uncomfortable.\"Duan Ling Tian, you\u2019re absolutely a freak\u2026 You broke through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage as well?\"As Meng Quan reached the end of what he wanted to say, he suppressed the sound of his voice.He knew that Duan Ling Tian\u2019s fleshly body had an extraordinary strength, so as far as he was concerned, Duan Ling Tian being able to exert a strength of six ancient mammoths would undoubtedly be because he had broken through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage.Duan Ling Tian smiled mysteriously.He didn\u2019t admit it nor did he deny it.Xiao Yu deeply glanced at Duan Ling Tian before saying with certainty, \"Do you even need to ask? He certainly has broken through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage.\"At this moment, he felt powerless in his heart. He originally thought that he would be able to compete with Duan Ling Tian once he broke through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage\u2026But now it seemed like Duan Ling Tian had left him even further in the distance.\"This violet-clothed youth\u2019s natural talent is too shocking.\"\"Yeah, even our Swallow Mountain County\u2019s County Governor\u2019s third son, Pei San\u2019s, natural talent is inferior to his.\"\"I heard Pei San was planning to participate in this year\u2019s Genius Camp test, but he won\u2019t be coming because of an accident that happened a few months ago.\"\"What accident?\"\"Could it be that you didn\u2019t hear of it? That Pei San\u2019s arm was cut off by a sword-cultivating youth outside of Triumph City\u2026 Even though it was reconnected later on, he\u2019s unable to use martial skills with it, so his strength was reduced drastically.\"\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/War Sovereign Soaring The HeavensChapter 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: \u2018Fate\u2019Translator: KurazyTolanzuraytor Duan Ling Tian's brows twitched.Pei San, the third son of Swallow Mountain County's County Governor, his arm was precisely cut off by Duan Ling Tian.He didn't expect that the news had already spread.With a quick thought, Duan Ling Tian quickly realized something: there wasn\u2019t an impermeable wall in this world, let alone one that could block explosive news such as this.Before long, the waiter had brought out and served the dishes and wine.Duan Ling Tian's group chatted as they ate.\"I've heard of the Swallow Mountain County's County Governor's third son, Pei San. Allegedly he broke through to the third level of the Core Formation Stage before the age of seventeen and is a famous youth genius in Swallow Mountain County,\"Meng Quan's eyes flickered as he slowly spoke.\"Since the arm which he uses to execute martial skills was crippled, his life can be considered to be completely ruined,\" said Xiao Yu.\"Doesn't he still have the other hand?\" asked Meng Quan in a daze.Xiao Yu shook his head and laughed.Meng Quan was puzzled. He turned his gaze toward the violet-clothed youth. \"Duan Ling Tian, what does Xiao Yu mean?\"\"Meng Quan.\"Duan Ling Tian looked at Meng Quan as he smiled. \"Which hand are you skilled in executing martial skills with?\"\"Of course it\u2019s my right hand!\" Meng Quan bluntly stated.\"Then when you eat with chopsticks or write, which hand do you use?\" asked Duan Ling Tian.\"My right hand as well. It\u2019s been a habit since I was small.\"Meng Quan didn\u2019t ponder and directly answered.\"That\u2019s right. So to speak, if your right hand was crippled as well, and you were unable to execute martial skills\u2026 how long would it take you to make your left hand replace your right hand completely?\"Duan Ling Tian threw out another question.\"This\u2026.\"At this moment, Meng Quan seemed to have understood.A person\u2019s entire life was only for a few tens of years.If the most important arm of Pei San was crippled and he wanted to cultivate his martial arts anew on his left hand, or change entirely to kicking technique martial skills\u2026 it would certainly require a huge amount of time. And this would in turn delay the speed at which his cultivation level increased.As time went by, even his peers who had inferior natural talent to him in the past would now throw him off far in the distance.\"Tsk tsk.\"Meng Quan couldn\u2019t stop himself from being astounded. \"I wonder who was so ruthless to cut off Pei San\u2019s arm with a single sword strike\u2026 That\u2019s the son of our Swallow Mountain County\u2019s County Governor; if they find out who he is, I\u2019m afraid he will die a graveless death.\"Xiao Yu made nothing of it. \"So long has passed, but I\u2019ve never heard of the Governor\u2019s Estate being able to find the assailant. They probably can\u2019t find him.\"\"That\u2019s true as well.\"Meng Quan nodded.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he took his time to eat and acted as if everything that Meng Quan and Xiao Yu were talking about wasn\u2019t related to him.\"But Duan Ling Tian, you were really ruthless earlier\u2026 Those four youths from the Yu Clan were directly blasted away instantaneously by you. This matter would probably spread around the entire Iron Blood City not too long from now. At that time, the Yu Clan will have really lost face.\"Xiao Yu looked at Duan Ling Tian as he shook his head and laughed.\"Even if they lose face, it was something they brought upon themselves. There\u2019re so many people eating here in the restaurant, but they just had to come to our table.\"Duan Ling Tian rolled his eyes with an indifferent expression.\"The Yu Clan won\u2019t cause trouble for us, right?\"Meng Quan was slightly worried.\"Meng Quan, you\u2019re overthinking things. Even if the Yu Clan wanted to cause trouble for us, it would be a year from now\u2026 The members of the Yu Clan earlier have decent strength and should be able to enter the Genius Camp. At that time, it isn\u2019t even certain if they will still be alive.\"As Xiao Yu finished speaking, killing intent flashed within his eyes.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s brows slightly twitched.He felt a strand of true killing intent coming off Xiao Yu\u2026This was something that the other youth martial artists he encountered didn\u2019t possess\u2026Obviously, Xiao Yu had killed someone before\u2026 And it wasn\u2019t only one or two people.After eating their fill, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group left the restaurant, but they were still deeply remembered by the crowd of young geniuses within the restaurant.Especially Duan Ling Tian, a sixteen or seventeen-year-old fourth level Core Formation martial artist. It was impossible to wish that he wouldn\u2019t be remembered.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group went around Iron Blood City before returning to the inn to rest.Tomorrow, they would head to the Iron Blood Army\u2019s camp ground to register themselves.Duan Ling Tian didn\u2019t cultivate tonight. Instead, he lied there on his bed and recalled his experiences this past year\u2026He couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\"Now I can be considered to have completely integrated myself into this world.\"A warm smile appeared on the corners of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s mouth.He thought of his mother, Ke Er, and Li Fei\u2026They were the people he cared the most about in this world.For their sake, he was willing to go against the entire world!Deep in the night, Duan Ling Tian fell soundly asleep.He had a very long dream.In this dream, he spent his days with Ke Er and Li Fei and even had plenty of kids later on\u2026When the ninth child had just been born.\"Duan Ling Tian!\"A thunderous voice jolted Duan Ling Tian awake.\"F**k! Meng Quan, you\u2019ve destroyed my sweet dream.\"Duan Ling Tian casually cleaned himself up and changed his clothes before walking out of his room and shouting the four-letter word.Meng Quan embarrassedly touched the back of his head and laughed naively.\"Let\u2019s go and register ourselves.\"At this time, Xiao Yu came out as well.On the east side of Iron Blood City, a vast area had been divided. This was precisely the Iron Blood Army\u2019s camp grounds.Presently, at the entrance to the Iron Blood Army\u2019s camp ground were lines of queues that were as long as dragons.Plenty of youths had lined up into neat lines.\"We\u2019re still too late.\"Meng Quan was stunned when he saw the packed and dense lines of youths.\"It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re late as long as someone wasn\u2019t late.\"As Duan Ling Tian looked off into the distance, a smile appeared on his face.\"Huh?\"Xiao Yu and Meng Quan had puzzled expressions.\"Let\u2019s go, someone has helped us reserve some places.\"Duan Ling Tian brought along Xiao Yu and Meng Quan. He took the lead and walked towards the front of the line.\"Hey! Have a bit of morality and line up.\"\"Shame on you for cutting in line!\"\"Kid, we\u2019re talking about you.\"\u2026Immediately, the crowd of youths that were drenched in sweat from lining up couldn\u2019t help themselves from berating Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group.Xiao Yu and Meng Quan were both slightly embarrassed.\"Duan Ling Tian, let\u2019s just go and queue up,\" Meng Quan said, in a low voice.Duan Ling Tian ignored Meng Quan and instead looked towards the people who raised a clamor. He frowned as he said, \"What are you all fussing about? When did you see me cutting the line? We\u2019ve been here since early in the morning, and our companions have reserved a place for us in the front.\"Hearing what Duan Ling Tian said, the group of people who raised a clamor went silent, but now they had doubtful expressions as they looked at Duan Ling Tian.Meng Quan and Xiao Yu were both stunned.Companions?Why didn\u2019t they know that they had companions?\"Hey! Brothers, sorry for troubling you to line up for us, lunch is on me.\"Meanwhile, Duan Ling Tian had already arrived at the front of the queue and slapped his hand on the grey-clothed youth\u2019s back.\"Which bastard touched me\u2026.\" the grey-clothed youth roared, but when he noticed Duan Ling Tian, he swallowed whatever he was going to say. \"You\u2026you\u2026\"\"Brothers, thank you for all the trouble.\"Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he smiled and interrupted the grey-clothed youth before looking at the other three youths and nodding.Although seemingly friendly, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of threatening intent.These four youths weren\u2019t anyone else but precisely the four youths that Duan Ling Tian taught a lesson to last night in the restaurant\u2026Only now did Meng Quan and Xiao Yu get it, and they secretly gave Duan Ling Tian a big thumbs up.In this manner, Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group successfully cut the line.Upon seeing the grey-clothed youth\u2019s reaction, the surrounding youths that were glaring fiercely naturally thought that Duan Ling Tian and them were really companions\u2026Of course, there were some youths who were coincidentally eating at the restaurant last night and had recognized Duan Ling Tian and the grey-clothed youth.But they didn\u2019t speak a word of it.They had all experienced Duan Ling Tian\u2019s strength and were frightened of bringing trouble to themselves.The grey-clothed youth\u2019s face was flushed and his heart trembled.\"Dammit, have I offended the gods in these past two days?\"\"Why is it that everywhere I go, I meet this bane? Not mentioning yesterday at the restaurant, today I queued up since early in the morning but I still had to let him cut in,\" he thought, but he just didn\u2019t dare to say anything.Or else he could imagine his end would be even more miserable than yesterday\u2026\"Yu Xiao, this guy is going too far.\"The three youths behind the grey-clothed youth were filled with rage; however, they only dared to use a voice that sounded as loud as a mosquito when they spoke.\"Then tell me what should we do? Why not you three chase him away?\"Yu Xiao rolled his eyes at his three companions.Hearing this, the three youths immediately acted as if they didn\u2019t hear him; they looked around and maintained their silence.Before long, it was the turn of Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group.After filling in the simple registration form, the three of them each obtained a number card.Duan Ling Tian\u2019s number was 137.Xiao Yu was 138.Meng Quan was 139.An Iron Blood Army soldier who wore light armor said, with a cold and unfeeling expression, \"Before noon tomorrow, use your number cards and enter our Iron Blood Army\u2019s camp grounds to participate in the test\u2026 You\u2019ll be a member of the Genius Camp once you pass the test.\"Duan Ling Tian\u2019s group of three nodded before turning around and planning to leave.\"Thanks, brothers. In consideration of us having so much \u2018fate\u2019 together, I\u2019ll treat you to some tea when we\u2019re free.\"Before leaving, Duan Ling Tian patted the grey-clothed youth on the shoulder and grinned, revealing a row of neat and white teeth. \"Also, your name isn\u2019t bad\u2026 Yu Xiao, it sounds like an extraordinary name the moment you hear it. I\u2019ve learned some divination in the past; trust me when I say that you will surely be a great figure in the future.\"Obviously, Duan Ling Tian heard the discussion between Yu Xiao and his three companions.The corners of Xiao Yu\u2019s and Meng Quan\u2019s mouths twitched, as they forcefully endured the urge to laugh\u2026Yu Xiao\u2019s face went blank.What did this bane actually want to do!?Duan Ling Tian smiled and patted Yu Xiao\u2019s shoulder as he slowly said, \"OK, brothers, hurry up and get your number cards, or else Mr. Soldier over there won\u2019t be too happy.\"Duan Ling Tian walked away with large strides as soon as he finished speaking.Just at this moment.\"The four of you are together?\"The Iron Blood Army soldier\u2019s face sunk as he asked Yu Xiao and the three youths behind him.\"Yes, Mr. Soldier.\"Yu Xiao hurriedly nodded.Even though he was a disciple of the County City\u2019s Yu Clan, the Iron Blood Army inspired awe throughout the kingdom, and the soldiers within the army were said to be extremely cruel and merciless, so he didn\u2019t dare to be presumptuous.The Iron Blood Army soldier seemed to have transformed into a glaring guardian warrior of the Buddha as he howled, \"It\u2019s been some time since the three people in front of you finished obtaining their number cards, but you four only come over now. Are you four purposely trying to make it hard on me?\"\"No, No\u2026.\"Yu Xiao hurriedly waved his hand in denial.\"Humph! In consideration of you four delaying the people behind, the four of you scram to the back of the line and queue up once more!\"The Iron Blood Army soldier had an expression that didn\u2019t allow any arguments.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Hi everyone!!!Thanks for supporting me and Lucas, and of course WSSTH!As a little celebration/event for the first 100 chapters being published, and to thank everyone for supporting us thus far.
