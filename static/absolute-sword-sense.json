    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - A Spy's End Is DeathPublished onJun 29, 2022\u202210 min read\u20221780 viewsA foul-smelling hidden room blanketed in darkness, proof that it had been untouched by humans for a long time.\u201cKuak!\u2019I coughed from the dust which got into my mouth and nose. Still, I felt a sense of excitement.Please let the thing I longed for be in here. As I looked carefully through the dark room, I spotted an ancient-looking wooden box. I approached it cautiously and touched the dust-covered box. As my fingers made contact, something popped out with the sound of rushing air.Swish!\u201cKuak!\u201dI backed away in surprise and made some distance with the box as I saw a snake pop out.But strangely, this snake had white eyes, like a snowy field. When I looked at those pure white eyes, fear filled my body. Suddenly, the fact that there was not even a single rat in this room makes perfect sense.The snake continued to threaten me with its hissing sound and flitting tongue. It was trying to stop me from getting to the box.\u201cUh!\u201dI resorted to swinging the torch in my hand at the snake. Its heat, as well as the sparks that fly off of it, should scare the snake away.Wheik!But even as the torch in my hand moved, the snake did not budge. Instead, it continued to stare at me with its pure white eyes.Does this snake not fear fire? I decided to use the sword at my waist instead, and as I reached for my sword.Whoo!However, perhaps feeling the threat, the snake bowed its body and quickly disappeared as it escaped somewhere.\u201cHaa.\u2019I breathed out a sigh of relief. Catching a snake wasn\u2019t tough, but its snowy white eyes made me feel uneasy. Before the snake decided to come back, I quickly opened the box.\u201cAh!\u201dThere was something within it! A yellowed piece of paper that looked like it would tear at any moment with just a touch.Well, it must have been here for around 600 years, but even though there had been a change in color, something seemed to have been done to treat the paper to keep the writing intact.I felt like I might cry.\u201cHmm.\u201dBut I was not sure that this was what I was searching for. There was something odd about the content of the paper.To know the true essence of the Sword Immortal I had come all this way\u2026 but was this really the treasured book?Moreover, the paper contained creepy and strange patterns drawn with red ink, just like the writings of the Demonic Cult.Well, my goal was to get rid of the blockages in my body. That way, I can return to being a child of a noble clan instead of remaining a spy.Even if I was treated like trash back then, it was better than living like a spy now with fear and concern at every moment.All I would have to do is call Elder Baek Wei-hyang and the head of Yellow Dragon Hall, Moyong Soo. But there was work to do before I did that.I pulled something out of my arm. It was a pill about two inches in size, made through special methods.\u201cTch.\u201dI am annoyed. There is a crack on the pill.It must have been from when I slipped as I climbed the cliff.Luckily, the pill did not shatter. I carefully folded the paper containing the sword technique and placed it inside the pill.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dI\u2019m not sure if I can swallow this. Still, I opened my mouth and put the pill in, forcefully gulping it down as I regretted not bringing water with me. The scent of the pill almost made me puke.\u201cKuak!\u201dIt felt like eating dried, rotten old tree roots. The reason I chose to swallow it was simple. This was my countermeasure.No matter how much I was told that I would be helped, as long as they were warriors, they would covet this.Dri!Soon after swallowing the pill, I headed to the back of the room and opened a stone door. I then went towards the cavity in the middle of the cave and knocked on the wall.Knock! Knock! Knock knock knock!It was a signal code to the Murim Alliance. The average warrior might not be able to hear such small knocks. Still, the signal would be audible to Elder Baek Wei-hyang, who was known to be one of the Five Great Warriors of the Murim Alliance, and the skilled Moyong Soo.Not surprisingly, the two appeared shortly.\u201cDid you find it?\u201dA middle-aged man with broad shoulders and a handsome beard. He was Baek Wei-hyang, an elder of the Murim Alliance.The young man standing next to him with sharp eyes was Moyong Soo, the eldest of his family.At the sight of both of them, I smiled.\u201cYes. Elder. It was here.\u201dThe two people\u2019s faces brightened at my words. There was nothing else here for them but that, the treasure of the heavens, and it was easy to know their feelings even without words.Moyong Soo, the head of Yellow Dragon Hall, asked me.\u201cWhere is it? The Record of the Sword Immortal?\u201d\u201cBefore that, make sure to keep the promise you made.\u201dA promise to remove the blockages in my body. I heard that Elder Baek Wei-hyang\u2019s deep understanding of the body\u2019s meridians can help restore a clear flow of qi to my body.I felt slightly sorry as they trusted me, but as a spy, I had to ensure I got what I was promised. Elder Baek Wei-hyang then smiled.\u201cHahaha. Right. That is true. We need to do it right.\u201dHe then glanced at Moyong Soo. The man who is Head of the Yellow Dragon Hall then pulled out his sword from his waist, its blade covered in a purple glow.Srng!It was the Fame Dagger of the Moyong family. As he suddenly drew his sword, I backed away in shock.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cIf you won\u2019t give it to me, you will die.\u201dMoyong Soo aimed the sword at me. If I didn\u2019t move back right away, he would have stabbed me right then.My heart was pounding in shock at this, but I, who have lived with such anxieties, won\u2019t be so obedient to threats.\u201cIf I give this, will the blood clots in the body be removed?\u201d\u201cWell. Is there any reason for me to keep you alive?\u2019Ah, for real? I was going crazy here. These two were blinded by the Sword Immortal\u2019s technique.After obtaining the treasure, they planned to kill and annihilate my traces immediately.\u201cAre you going to break the decree that you must not indulge your personal feelings or greed for the mission of the Murim Alliance?\u201dElder Baek Wei-hyang laughed at those words.\u201cNo one will even know, so what is the use of that?\u201d\u201cIf I die\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat could be the problem if a spy dies? Rather, the lord will be praising us for handling the spy without causing trouble.\u201dDamn it!This was why people cannot be trusted. They would show that they were simply forced to kill a spy in this manner and use it as their defense.\u201cWhat if I keep my mouth shut? Did you forget that not just you but there are other warriors sent here? This is a situation where you would go up against the whole alliance.\u201dPeople were already up searching the cliff, and they would soon figure out that there is a cave in here and that it held the treasure. At those words, Moyong Soo\u2019s eyes fluttered in hesitation\u2026 but the elder Baek Wei-hyang remained unperturbed.\u201cIt looks like you want to use your head, but it won\u2019t work. And you know this isn\u2019t a situation where anyone would openly fight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe treasure is hidden in one of the many hidden rooms? Don\u2019t try to overthink it. We can always just say you tried to deceive us and hide your body here.\u201dI was at a loss for words. I tried to think but was unable to. The reason was simple.\u201cDid you think this elder wouldn\u2019t see through this?\u201dBaek Wei-hyang smiled.Ah shit!At this exact moment, my supreme disadvantage was that I am just a third-rate warrior with no internal qi.Even if someone deliberately tried to investigate who had been in this room, they wouldn\u2019t know me. It would be twice more difficult since an elder was involved.\u201cWe can just rip him apart. Elder. Hehe.\u201dMoyong Soo smiled. Now, his appearance was more similar to a greedy man.Nothing else to do!Thud!I knelt down and begged for my life.\u201cPlease spare me. I will keep my mouth shut for the rest of my life. To kill a third-rate warrior like me\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou read it right?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYou read that, right? The sword technique.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything. If I hadn\u2019t read it, how would I know about the record being the right one? The most unfortunate thing was that there was absolutely nothing in the record that could even be called special.\u201cThat is another reason you should die.\u201d\u201c-But I\u2026\u201dPuk!It was a moment that my heart had always been worried about.The sword of Moyong Soo pierced my chest. Right, these people never had any intention of saving me.\u201cCough.\u201dBlood flowed down from my mouth, and I fell to the ground like a doll with its threads cut.From the moment I was given this mission, the Murim Alliance and the others had decided my fate.My body began to lose strength as my mind wandered. To die like this\u2026\u201cCut the stomach.\u201dElder Baek Wei-hyang said casually. Did this guy think I was a pig that could have my stomach cut open so easily?\u201cYes, Elder.\u201dMoyong Soo pulled his sword out of my chest and thrust it into my stomach.\u201cKuak!\u201dI could hear the sound of something being crushed inside my stomach.\u201cThis-.\u201dMoyong Soo seemed to know about the pill that I had swallowed. He, too, must have felt it, so he was trying to quickly bring the pill out of my stomach. He must be afraid that the acids in my stomach would destroy it.It was then.Wheik!\u201cUgh!\u201dA strange thing was happening. Hot energy rose up in my stomach, and blue flames soared from inside.Flustered, the man stepped back.\u201cWhat are you doing! Get it out of the stomach!\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u2019At Baek Wei-hyang\u2019s cry, he tried to come close again, but it was of no avail. All of a sudden, my entire body was engulfed in flames.But it was strange.This should have been painful, but it wasn\u2019t. Was it because my body is dying?\u201cShit! Why isn\u2019t the fire going out!\u2019Moyong Soo cursed while I gradually could hear nothing.As my thoughts considered my impending death, I began to regret everything. Why did I live my life like this?As my eyes gradually were engulfed in blue flames, it turned white, and then something wet covered my body.Did someone pour water to put out the flames? The sensation startled me, causing my body to jump.\u201cAck!\u201dAs soon as I got up, I remembered something wet covering my body, and I looked at my hands and feet.I\u2019m completely fine. Even my stomach had no visible wound. I couldn\u2019t figure out what just happened.\u201cKiduk.\u201dThe sound of laughter.When I looked up, I saw two boys in colorful silk robes, both about 15 years old, looking down at me and laughing.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

The faces of the two boys in their red and blue clothing were very similar.They were twins. As I saw them, I mumbled.\u201c\u2026 is this a dream?\u201dAs he heard my words, the twin in blue shook his head and said.\u201cEven when we poured water on you, you didn\u2019t wake up, eh? Yulang\u2019s idiot.\u201dThat was a name I haven\u2019t heard in a long time.The Idiot of Yulang, Yulang\u2019s Idiot.A nickname I was given ten years ago.\u201cHic.\u201dI hiccuped. Even though I didn\u2019t drink, I felt like I had a hangover. I couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s happening. The boy in blue then leaned down and grabbed my hair.Clench!\u201cThis Honam\u2019s Swift Blade is speaking, and you won\u2019t get up!\u201dAt that moment, I felt like I was losing it.\u201cSong Jwa-baek? Song Woo-hyun?\u201d\u201cNow, you seem to be getting your mind together. Why are you pretending to be drunk and trying to be sneaky?\u201d\u201cRight. Right. Our Honam\u2019s Swift Blade won the bet.\u201dWow\u2026This was crazy.This situation was absurd. The boy in blue is Song Jwa-baek, and the one in red is Song Woo-hyun. It felt like I was dreaming.I could remember this moment that happened 10 years ago so vividly.Clink!Song Jaw-baek waved a red pouch in front of him and grinned.\u201cI prepared it in advance in case you wanted to speak. It will be handy for our work as the Honam\u2019s Twin Swift Blades!\u201d\u201cRight. It will be useful.\u201dSong Woo-hyun added to his brother\u2019s words while I struggled to understand what was happening.Obviously, I had been stabbed in the chest and stomach by Moyong Soo. Strange blue flames then spread through my body as I lost consciousness.But when I opened my eyes, these two boys were in front of me instead. Except, last time, I never spoke to them at this moment.Wait\u2026\u201cWhat day is today?\u201d\u201cWhat dog shit\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is today!\u201dSong Jwa-baek was startled by my loud words and frowned.\u201cYou must be drunk. It is the year of Dog.\u201dNo.If we say it is the year of the Dog, then this was 10 years in the past. This dream was too vivid.And this wasn\u2019t a dream or illusion either. The pain from my pulled hair was very much real.\u201cReally\u2026 the year of the Dog?\u201d\u201cWhat is with you all of a sudden? Did you think it would be the year of the Pig? You drank so much that your head doesn\u2019t work?\u201dThe two looked at me as if they couldn\u2019t understand me. But even these weird faces looked great to me.\u201cUh. What are you doing? Are you crying?\u201dIt was like he said. I had tears in my eyes that were blurring my vision. Overcome with emotion, I even hugged Song Jwa-baek, who was still holding my hair tightly.\u201cAh, he has gone crazy!\u201d\u201cHe is!\u201dI was holding his head and hugging him, so he must be shocked, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was feeling so good right now that I could fly. After being kidnapped by the Blood Sect and used as a spy, everything, including my death, was now just a lie.I wanted to make a temple in the sky for this!Pak!Song Jwa-baek pushed me back, but my mouth continued to laugh.\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dI was feeling good. The two looked at me like I had gone crazy as I lay down and continued laughing. But I didn\u2019t care.I had returned to the past. A past where I was called Yulang\u2019s idiot, a past that I missed being in. I would never do anything that will lead to being captured by the Blood Sect again\u2026\u201c\u2026 year of the Dog\u2026 ahhh!\u201dAs I stopped laughing and began speaking seriously, the twins moved away from me in surprise.I didn\u2019t care that anyone was paying attention to what I was doing, even if they thought I was going crazy. The important thing is\u2026\u201cFuccckk!\u201dThe two boys moved their hands to the sword on their waists and cursed at me. Either way, I looked around and got up.It was late at night, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any customers around. It was so late that even dawn was still far away.\u201cDamn it! Asong! Asong!?\u201dI could hear the people on this floor doing their tasks outside. At the sound of my cry, a man with droopy eyes who looked to be in his early thirties walked in, barely aware.\u201cYoung master. Everyone is awake. Oh my. Were you hit by the lightning?\u201dHe is the servant who followed me even when I was kicked out of my home. He was the only faithful aide I had, one who served me despite being called an idiot and a fool.\u201cSorry. What about my things?\u201d\u201cIt is on the second floor.\u201dAs soon as I heard that, I began to run up to the second floor in a hurry. As I do, the twins tried to stop me.\u201cBrat. Did you go crazy for real?\u201d\u201cRight. Have you really gone crazy?\u201dI don\u2019t have the time to deal with them right now!\u201cHa\u2026 Damn it\u2026 you\u2026 you might think I am crazy, but you better pack your bags and run away from this inn right now. Otherwise, we will be living like dogs for the rest of our lives.\u201dI was about to say they could even live, but these people were different from me. In any case, I was saving both their lives.\u201cJust run.\u201d\u201cWhat is he saying? This brat isn\u2019t up yet? We are Honam\u2019s Twin Swift Blades\u2026\u201dPuk!\u201cKuak!\u201dThen I broke his nose.\u201cBrother!\u201dSong Woo-hyun, who was next to his twin, tried to draw his sword. I jumped back and kicked him on the leg. He fell to the floor from the blow, and I hit his stomach with my elbow.\u201cKuak.\u201dGroans of pain came out from the two of them.\u201cY\u2026 young master.\u201dThe servant looked at me with wide eyes. What made it stranger is that despite coming from a prestigious martial arts family, I was a kid who should be incapable of doing what I just did.Surprisingly, I defeated the twins who learned martial arts. Well, it wasn\u2019t something to be proud of.Even if I was just a third-rate warrior, I learned the basic martial arts moves in the Blood sect. Even though my body wasn\u2019t in its best state like it was back then, I could easily take down idiots like these two.\u201cYo\u2026 you bastard\u2026 when did you learn martial arts?\u201dSong Jwa-baek grabbed his nose, which was bleeding, and asked.\u201cShut it. If you want to live like humans, run!\u201dAfter saying those words, I quickly made my way up the stairs. The twins who saw me hastily running were unsure of what was happening. I ran up to the second floor and wandered around, searching for my things.\u201cLeft side!\u201dAsong shouted from the first floor. It was 10 years in the past, so I could barely remember where my room was. Following Asong\u2019s words, I ran to the room and saw a dagger with a blue thread around it, alongside a bag of my things on the bed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI felt a twinge of emotion at the sight of the dagger, which I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. I could have just run away, but I needed to pick up this dagger which was my mother\u2019s keepsake.It was a pity that I lost everything on this day.Hurry up and run.Shh!I grabbed the dagger, and at that moment, I was startled by a sudden sound that made me drop the dagger.Kyaaaaal!\u201cKuak!\u201dMy heart was pounding loudly at these bizarre sounds. I looked at the dagger as if it was a monster. I wondered if it was a coincidence and picked it back up.-Kyaaaak!\u201cAh!\u201dI felt a surge of shock as I picked up my mother\u2019s dagger and put it down again. This wasn\u2019t a ghost\u2019s song, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.\u201cUh.\u201dGoosebumps and cold sweat broke out on my body. I hesitated to pick it up since I might hear that sound again.Kik!Just in case, I tore the bed sheets and then used them to cover the dagger. Once it was covered, I picked it up and heard no sound.I was not sure what was happening, but it felt like this is how I should carry it. I quickly ran down the stairs and saw that the twins were still there.\u201cI said run away!\u201d\u201cMy nosebleed didn\u2019t stop! And what are you saying! Why do we have to run!?\u201dSong Jwa-baek asked me, unable to understand. Anyway, I was too busy trying to save my own hide. I didn\u2019t have time to care for these people.\u201cEnough. Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Asong. We need to hurry\u2026\u201dBefore I could finish my words, a scream came from outside the inn.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u2026!As soon as I heard the scream, I felt like my heart was going to drop. The joy from returning to 10 years in the past immediately disappeared.Even if I came back, wasn\u2019t this the moment I wanted to avoid? Did I return just to get captured again?\u201cW-what is this?\u201dI looked at the twins, who were scared, and said.\u201c\u2026. Blood Cult.\u201d\u201cUh!\u201dThe two twins looked terrified at my words. The worst of the Unorthodox Sects which had a vicious name that could make anyone piss themselves just hearing it.There is no way these two didn\u2019t understand what this meant.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dA desperate voice.Out of all the days, why today?That moment in the year of the Dog.The day I was kidnapped by the Blood Cult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We are Honam\u2019s Twin Swift Blades\u2026\u201dPuk!\u201cKuak!\u201dThen I broke his nose.\u201cBrother!\u201dSong Woo-hyun, who was next to his twin, tried to draw his sword. I jumped back and kicked him on the leg. He fell to the floor from the blow, and I hit his stomach with my elbow.\u201cKuak.\u201dGroans of pain came out from the two of them.\u201cY\u2026 young master.\u201dThe servant looked at me with wide eyes. What made it stranger is that despite coming from a prestigious martial arts family, I was a kid who should be incapable of doing what I just did.Surprisingly, I defeated the twins who learned martial arts. Well, it wasn\u2019t something to be proud of.Even if I was just a third-rate warrior, I learned the basic martial arts moves in the Blood sect. Even though my body wasn\u2019t in its best state like it was back then, I could easily take down idiots like these two.\u201cYo\u2026 you bastard\u2026 when did you learn martial arts?\u201dSong Jwa-baek grabbed his nose, which was bleeding, and asked.\u201cShut it. If you want to live like humans, run!\u201dAfter saying those words, I quickly made my way up the stairs. The twins who saw me hastily running were unsure of what was happening. I ran up to the second floor and wandered around, searching for my things.\u201cLeft side!\u201dAsong shouted from the first floor. It was 10 years in the past, so I could barely remember where my room was. Following Asong\u2019s words, I ran to the room and saw a dagger with a blue thread around it, alongside a bag of my things on the bed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI felt a twinge of emotion at the sight of the dagger, which I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. I could have just run away, but I needed to pick up this dagger which was my mother\u2019s keepsake.It was a pity that I lost everything on this day.Hurry up and run.Shh!I grabbed the dagger, and at that moment, I was startled by a sudden sound that made me drop the dagger.Kyaaaaal!\u201cKuak!\u201dMy heart was pounding loudly at these bizarre sounds. I looked at the dagger as if it was a monster. I wondered if it was a coincidence and picked it back up.-Kyaaaak!\u201cAh!\u201dI felt a surge of shock as I picked up my mother\u2019s dagger and put it down again. This wasn\u2019t a ghost\u2019s song, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.\u201cUh.\u201dGoosebumps and cold sweat broke out on my body. I hesitated to pick it up since I might hear that sound again.Kik!Just in case, I tore the bed sheets and then used them to cover the dagger. Once it was covered, I picked it up and heard no sound.I was not sure what was happening, but it felt like this is how I should carry it. I quickly ran down the stairs and saw that the twins were still there.\u201cI said run away!\u201d\u201cMy nosebleed didn\u2019t stop! And what are you saying! Why do we have to run!?\u201dSong Jwa-baek asked me, unable to understand. Anyway, I was too busy trying to save my own hide. I didn\u2019t have time to care for these people.\u201cEnough. Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Asong. We need to hurry\u2026\u201dBefore I could finish my words, a scream came from outside the inn.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u2026!As soon as I heard the scream, I felt like my heart was going to drop. The joy from returning to 10 years in the past immediately disappeared.Even if I came back, wasn\u2019t this the moment I wanted to avoid? Did I return just to get captured again?\u201cW-what is this?\u201dI looked at the twins, who were scared, and said.\u201c\u2026. Blood Cult.\u201d\u201cUh!\u201dThe two twins looked terrified at my words. The worst of the Unorthodox Sects which had a vicious name that could make anyone piss themselves just hearing it.There is no way these two didn\u2019t understand what this meant.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dA desperate voice.Out of all the days, why today?That moment in the year of the Dog.The day I was kidnapped by the Blood Cult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - The Sword Talks (2)Published onJun 29, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022740 views\u2018You\u2026 what are you?\u2019Thanks to following the dagger\u2019s instructions, I managed to overcome at least one crisis. At first, I did wonder if I was really hallucinating or if it was really the dagger. Still, I struggled to understand this unfamiliar and bizarre experience after experiencing it for the first time.-I am the Small Short Sword.The dagger stated its sword name with elation. The name of the dagger was Small Short Sword. It was also the name that is engraved on the sheath.-Do you think they didn\u2019t know how to write Big and ended up using the sword Small? What a shame they did this to me, Small!?The dagger, strangely, seemed to not like being a dagger.However, I couldn\u2019t figure out how the dagger managed to figure out the attacks of that second-rate warrior and even gave me instructions to deal with him.-Because I can see, I told you. I saved your life in the best way.\u2018It isn\u2019t like that.\u2019-As if. You are someone who has too many doubts.\u2018Would anyone find it easy to accept this?\u2019-True. It is strange for me that you, a human, can hear my voiceThe dagger understood what I was saying. It was like I was talking to a person and not a dagger.-Oh my, after 47 years of being a sword, I could have a conversation with a human. That too with someone who isn\u2019t much more than an idiot.\u2018Idiot? This is bad!\u2019I wanted to cry from the dagger\u2019s words. It\u2019s treating a decent human like me as a fool!-This is funny. Even though I look like this, there are many things I have seen and heard. I know martial arts better than a kid like you who just enjoys alcohol.\u2018Ha! Understand martial arts?\u2019-I have only seen martial arts for nearly 20 years after being wielded by my owner. They said that even useless people can bring in good things at times. Did you know that?\u2018Former owner?\u2019The former owner would be my deceased mother. If so, the owner that this dagger referred to must be the one who passed down the dagger to my mother. Perhaps my maternal grandfather?-Maternal grandfather, my ass. Did you forget that your mother got me as a present from a passerby? Think straight.\u2026This guy\u2019s character is getting harsher the longer we are speaking. It feels like just its harsh words can hurt me greatly.After all, my mother was a female servant. She couldn\u2019t have gotten such a dagger from her father.\u2018Because I was young, I don\u2019t seem to remember it well.\u2019-Right, right. You must have. You don\u2019t remember since you were wrong. Must have had a hell of a comfortable life.This brat talked way too much.As long as I kept talking, there was no guarantee he would stop talking. Then there was only one thing left to do, I needed to deal with this and then run away.-You seem busy.The dagger seemed to want to talk more, but I didn\u2019t have time.\u2018I need to get out of here quickly.\u2019-Yah. Before that, say thank you. I helped you\u2026Oh, shut it!\u2018Right, right, thank you.\u2019-Oh myyy!It felt like it was messing with me. Anyway, I needed a weapon, so I took the sword of the dead masked man. The dagger continued talking, which made me feel a bit hesitant. I don\u2019t know if I was fortunate or not that this dagger could speak to me.\u2018Is this one unique?\u2019-Can\u2019t you understand what the blade is saying?\u2018What?\u2019I couldn\u2019t hear it at all. But the dagger, Small Short Sword, grinned and said.-That blade is cursing you a lot. It is cursing you for killing its owner. Uh\u2026 brat is cursing me too! It isn\u2019t wrong to help a fool! Uh!I couldn\u2019t understand a single thing.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019The blade was much heavier than I expected.I was back to a past where I couldn\u2019t even train properly, so this blade aws probably not the right fit for me.\u2018Shit.\u2019-Who will be surprised by that? You should train. You should have developed some muscle strength.\u2018I know.\u2019As expected, it was heavy.I can wield it if I hold it with both hands, right? That might work. But I had no internal qi and must be agile to counter them.After giving up on lifting the blade, I searched the dead man\u2019s body and found five throwing knives. I had some training with these while in the Blood Cult. However, I had to really be close to throw it right.\u2018Let\u2019s take it for now.\u2019-You know how to use it?\u2018I know\u2019-When did you learn?The dagger seened confused. This guy seemed to know only the present version of me. Well, even I couldn\u2019t believe that I had returned back to the past.-Yah! Behind.\u2018What?\u2019For a moment, I was startled as I began to move ahead.Pak!A muffled sound came from behind.I barely managed to hold my balance and looked behind me. There I saw a masked man holding a large iron club with sharp thorns.\u201cShit!\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but curse out at this. It looked like he was aiming for me. Though since the club was quite large, the movements seem sluggish.\u2018Now is the time.\u2019I moved ahead and tried to stab him in the chest with my dagger. But the large man took his hands off the club and moved back to dodge the attack.This ominous feeling of mine came true. This guy was also a second-rate warrior.In addition, he seemed to be the kind who has learned footwork skills for avoiding attacks and was ready to counter my attack with a kick.Papak!His right foot launched itself straight for my head.-Keep your head down.Small Short Sword\u2019s voice echoed in my head. And I followed it.-Take a close look and slash his calf!As soon as I heard the dagger\u2019s command, I tried to slash the left calf, the man\u2019s balancing foot, but he managed to dodge it and get away.And then, with a feeling of alertness, he moved further back.I decided that I couldn\u2019t let him go, so I followed to maintain my distance and then took aim.-No!The dagger cried inside my head. At that moment, the kick from the masked man hit me in the stomach.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dI fell back as pain burst from my stomach. If I had practiced martial arts or internal qi, I would have been able to endure it by applying the qi to my stomach, but I was just a normal man.And normal people had difficulty breathing when they got hit in their stomach.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dI suffered from shortness of breath as I continued to cough. Then the masked man frowned.\u201cWhat? You couldn\u2019t avoid this?\u201dHe seemed to think that I should have dodged his kick.-Idiot. How can you fall for such a low-level kick?The dagger decided that criticizing me right now was the most amazing thing. Still, I was already in pain so responding to it was impossible. In a situation where tears were forming in my eyes, the masked man decided to come for me.-Avoid it! Run!The dagger called out, but I could do nothing. It was impossible for a body that was hit and unable to breathe to even move.\u201cKuak!\u201dAs I suffered a blow to my head, my consciousness began to fade. I had struggled so hard to not get caught by these people. Yet like in my previous life, I couldn\u2019t even escape from the inn.I didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. The sound of voices in the air gradually reached me as my mind regained consciousness.\u201cTwo of them were killed by this kid? Can\u2019t the captain handle his men properly?\u201dI heard mumbles all around.Looks like I was finally captured after I fainted. I woke up but focused on the voices without opening my eyes to understand the situation better.\u201cI am sorry. Please punish me.\u201d\u201cUh!\u2019Puck!A muffled groan. The person that asked for punishment seemed to have been hit and fallen to the ground.\u201cDon\u2019t act and get up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat is his true identity?\u201d\u201cThese are the things he had. He had a plaque, an old dagger, and six silvers.\u201d\u201cWhose child is he?\u201dThis was bad!I kept thinking as I kept my eyes closed.Eventually, my name was going to be known to them once again.\u201cHe is the son of the So family of Yullang. His name is So Wonhwi.\u201d\u201cYullang\u2019s So family\u2026 wait, Yiyang So family!\u201dYiyang So family!In Murim, there were families who have fame as great as the top martial arts families. Among them, my family, the Yiyang So family, was one of the three most prestigious families in Honam.\u201cWhat? So, was this guy the trash which was kicked out of the Yiyang So family?\u201dDespite my pretending to be unconscious, wasn\u2019t it too much to call me trash when I was right here! I am angry.But this was the truth. The current me was trash which cannot even be seen as a child of that family.\u201cGiven his age, it seems to be true.\u201d\u201cThey say he is trash who cannot even learn to cultivate qi. Who wouldn\u2019t abandon him? But he manages to take down two of our warriors?\u201dWhile having a person who seemed to have been their superior say this felt nice, it didn\u2019t give me any pleasant feelings. I killed two of his men, which meant my current situation was dangerous.\u201cAnd he did this with just this rusted dagger? If he mastered qi, he would have been quite useful.\u2019A voice tinged with regret.The same situation as before. At that time, I was treated like trash, just like at my family\u2019s home.Still, I got a decently high evaluation. It seemed like they wouldn\u2019t try to kill me. Just as that wishful thought entered my mind, I heard\u2026\u201cUnfortunately, we need to kill him.\u201d\u2018\u2026 what!\u2019I flinched at his words that seemed to seal my fate. This was an entirely different situation from before.\u201cUh? He should be around the secondary level.\u201d\u201cI lost two people who worked for me, so I now have to take the one who took them out and use them? Definitely not. Just deal with him quickly.\u201dApparently, the masked men I killed seemed to be people their superior cherished. It was totally unexpected.I had barely survived and returned to the past, but now I have to die again?! As I thought this, I heard a sound.Tak!Something flew and hit my head.\u201cOuch!\u201dI groaned as I opened my eyes from the pain. Around me, ten masked men were looking at me.Among them, a middle-aged man with a blue belt and a long scar near his lip was shaking his head.\u2018That\u2019s the leader!\u2019The blue belt symbolized someone in the status of sect leader in the Blood Cult. It is a position that could only be touched by climbing the best form of any martial arts in the cult, similar to a first-rate warrior.Looking at the fingers of the leader, I felt weird.\u201cWhen you wake up, you need to open your eyes. But here you are eavesdropping on me like a rat.\u201dHe caught me.The leader pretended to slash his neck with his hand.Srng!The two masked men near me drew their blades and swords.They seemed like ones who would like to cut my throat at any moment.Pak!\u2018Shit!\u2019I was tied up with a rope. I couldn\u2019t even run away. I was just like an animal ready to be sacrificed. I was in a situation where everyone was watching me with the urge to decapitate my head.Then my eyes moved towards a masked man standing behind the leader.To be precise, my eyes moved to the white band, more like a white tassel at the sword at the waist of the man, which was clearly visible to me.\u201cPain is fleeting.\u201dThe moment the masked man raised his blade to cut my head, I pounded my head on the ground and shouted loudly as if I was possessed.Thud!\u201cBlood Demon King! Fourth Blood Star! Long live and prosper the Blood Cult! This lowly person greets a prominent person of the Blood Cult!\u201dWhisper.As soon as I said it, the masked men all looked at the person I was seeing. It was the same with the man with the scar. The masked man standing behind him looked flustered and took off his mask. His handsome face was accentuated with sharp features, like that of a sword.\u201cUh?\u201dThe leader and the other masked men quickly knelt down after being momentarily shocked at seeing the man there.\u201cFourth Blood Star, we greet you!\u201dThe person who was also known as the Killing Blood King opened his mouth.\u201cInteresting.\u201dThe object of his interest was me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Get Back On My FeetPublished onJun 29, 2022\u202211 min read\u2022788 viewsI gingerly lifted my head.From among those kneeling and bowing, the man I had pointed out was looking at me with an incomprehensible expression.Still, I recognized this man, despite the others not noticing.Fourth Blood Star.There were around 11 people who led the Blood Cult.The Fourth Blood Star was a person that fit his rank among the Seven Blood Stars. It was only natural for him to react like this since he was an existence that was difficult to know, revealing his identity was a huge deal. Actually, this development shocked even me.\u2018This is crazy.\u2019I only said it out loud because of my fear, but he really did turn out to be the Fourth Blood Star. Something I said desperately to save my life ended up bringing attention to the Fourth Blood Star.\u2018I am an idiot!\u2019What would people think? They would definitely get suspicious of me.Well, this was my first time ever coming this close to meeting a Blood Star.The Fourth Blood Star, Do Jangho.He was a person who has a reputation for his skills, not just in the Blood Cult but the entire Unorthodox Faction.\u201cOur Fourth Killing Star has come here to this shabby place?\u201dThe man who was this group\u2019s leader asked the Fourth Blood Star.\u201cLeader Oh.\u201d\u201cYes, please\u2026.\u201dI can\u2019t keep up with what was being said. The man slowly lowered his head with a contorted face, similar to a human being suppressed by fear. He then said,\u201cI-I apologize.\u201d\u201cBe faithful to your duties.\u201dWith those words, Do Jangho walked toward me. Every step he took closer to me made me want to choke.\u2018It is frustrating.\u2019To be honest, I was afraid. Even in my previous life, when I was a spy for the Blood Cult, I never had this kind of anxiety rush through me.\u201cSo.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI quickly shook my head and answered.Instinctively, I understood that my life or death will depend on how I spoke here.\u201cHow did you find it out?\u201dDo Jangho was showing interest in me, who recognized his true identity. I spoke as calmly as I could in reply.\u201cThe sword.\u201d\u201cSword?\u201d\u201cThe bundle of white threads hanging from it as well as the leather casing around it.\u201d\u201cOh. You have sharp eyes.\u201dDo Jangho, the Fourth Blood Star, spoke in a hoarse voice. The decoration around his sword was to commemorate his status and ranking. This was famously known within the Blood Cult.\u201cInteresting. I am more curious about you now,\u201dThud! Thud! Thud!That was the sound of my heart beating loudly.\u201cWho are you?\u201dAs he went directly to the point, I became speechless and hesitated to answer.\u201cYou can\u2019t seem to answer\u2026\u201dBecause I couldn\u2019t answer him straightly, the people around me looked ready to eat me up. The Fourth Blood Star raised his hand, asking them to not get involved.\u201cThe rules of our sect must have loosened. Since when did you people have the right to intervene when a Blood Star is speaking?\u201dThe men trembled at those words. The existence of a Blood Star was enough to make the people of Blood Cult shudder in fear.\u201cDisciple. Don\u2019t be shy and tell me.\u201d\u2018Phew\u2026\u2019There was nothing else to be said. If I said anything wrong, I would either die or get taken away by them.If that was going to happen, I\u2019d rather use my hands to change the situation in my favor. So I lifted my head and spoke with confidence.\u201cI have inherited the blood of a Blood Cult member.\u201d\u201cA Blood Cult member?\u201dDo Jangho\u2019s eyes widened with a look of suspicion.\u201cHa!\u201dThe others also had expressionless faces. If I lost my nerve here, I would lose everything.I spent over seven years of my life as a spy. If it was a lie, I was confident I could say it without wavering.\u201cThe Yiyang So family is a prestigious sect and family.\u201d\u201cIt is indeed famous, but my maternal grandfather was a low-ranking member in the Blood Fire squad.\u201d\u201cBlood Fire squad?\u201dDo Jangho seemed to show interest in my words. What makes this lie believable was that the Blood Cult actually had this squad within it, but its existence was not known to all.I saw looks of disbelief on their faces.\u201cI heard my maternal grandfather could only have done what he did because of leader Noh Choman.\u201dThe masked people\u2019s reactions changed at the mention of this name. Noh Choman was the correct name of the former Blood Fire squad leader, after all.\u2018This is helpful.\u2019I was abducted and trained by the same unit in my past life. I remembered the leader who, from time to time, brought up stories about his father, who died during the time of the civil war. Do Jangho looked at me and smiled.\u201cThat is the information your grandfather, who participated in the war, would know.\u201dOf course.I didn\u2019t expect to deceive him with just this. I still have a secret weapon.\u201cMy grandfather also heard that around that time, the leader Noh Choman was strict when it came to educating his son, Noh Songgu, who also participated in the training at a young age.\u201dAt the name of Noh Songgu, the masked men glanced at each other. At this time, the Blood Fire squad had not made its presence known in the lands yet. However, since the names of its leaders and their children were mentioned, such a reaction was natural.But it was difficult to know what the Fourth Blood Star was thinking. He had an expressionless face as he asked.\u201cThen how does the So family enter the picture?\u201d\u201cMy grandfather had barely survived the war and left to find my mother as his only blood. He wandered aimlessly until he reached Yullang to live with her.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cMy grandfather was already greatly weakened with the injuries and internal wounds, and then my mother went to the Yiyang So family to work as a maid and make money.\u201dThis was a clich\u00e9 plot but plausible. It is publicly known that I, So Wonhwi, was the 3rd son of the family and was also the son of a maid.Do Jangho asked.\u201cAnd your maternal grandfather has passed?\u201dI bowed and tried to speak with as much sadness as possible.\u201cHow much can a servant earn? My grandfather didn\u2019t live long after that.\u201d\u201cOh. Such a pity.\u201dHe said that, but he didn\u2019t seem to really be feeling the emotion. It felt more like he was trying to find something in my story.\u201cEven at the moment of his death, my grandfather didn\u2019t forget the ties with the sect.\u201dOne of the most effective ways to lie was to stimulate emotions. Some of the masked people\u2019s eyes looked visibly sad as they listened to my words.Though Do Jangho was staring at me with an expressionless face, which made me anxious.\u201cThe descendants of our loyal sect members were hiding in the shadows of the Yiyang So family.\u201dI felt like I was contradicting myself. I was hesitant if I should show the basic knife skill that I learned during my past life now to further support the lie.At that moment, Do Jangho, who was looking at me, laughed.\u201cHahahahaha.\u201d\u2018Did he not buy it?\u2019I felt uneasy.\u201cIf your maternal grandfather is from the sect, then you are like our brother.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dA sigh from my tense mouth, I was bathing in cold sweat already. This was a huge gamble.\u201cTo show your roots openly to me means that you want to come back?\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201d\u2018Shit\u2026\u2019Instead of being kidnapped, I was entering the sect on my own two feet! I had my life saved, but things were getting more twisted like this.In any case, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to change the things that might happen in the future as long as I can stay alive?\u201cPlease.\u201dInstead, the masked man who was about to kill me came and untied the rope around me.\u201cLong live the Blood Demon! Long live the Bloody Heaven!\u201dDo Jangdo spoke in a satisfied voice.\u201cWelcome back. The descendant of one of us who left his home and is now reunited with the family. Do you have any wishes for the sect?\u201dThe masked person looked shocked at these words.This question wasn\u2019t being asked by just anyone but by the Fourth Blood Star, who was known to be a high-ranking official in the sect. It was only natural that they are shocked and jealous.But this wasn\u2019t something worth being jealous over.\u2018\u2026 I am being tested right now.\u2019I had only met him for the first time, but I heard that the Fourth Blood Star was quite a fickle person. Depending on his mood, the treatment of the person would change. I\u2019m unsure what would happen if I willingly told him what I wanted.\u201cNo. How could a lowly person wish something from the Fourth Blood Star?\u201d\u201cHahaha. It is because I am excited that you came, don\u2019t worry and say it.\u201dA second suggestion. And if I refused now, he would lose interest in me.\u201cIf I can, can I get back the short sword which is my mother\u2019s keepsake?\u201d\u201cKeepsake?\u201dI lifted my head and pointed to the short sword that Leader Oh was holding onto. Leader Oh clearly didn\u2019t like this as this was the dagger that had killed two of his men. Wordlessly, Do Jangho held out his hand.\u201cLord. No matter what, this is the dagger which\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t say it twice, Leader Oh.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dWithout any more resistance, he handed over the dagger.Srng!Taking the short sword, Do Jangho checked the rusted blade and then smiled. He then pushed the dagger\u2019s tip between his index and middle finger.\u2018Uh?\u2019Crack.The tip of the short sword was broken. It was rusted all over, so breaking it with just his fingers shouldn\u2019t be too shocking.Do Jangho smiled and said,\u201cThis is the price to pay for the short sword which had taken our member\u2019s blood. We must take good care of precious things.\u201dPak!A flick of his hand made the dagger penetrate the ground. What amazing power.I could feel goosebumps rise on my body. It wasn\u2019t that the power he is showing is amazing, but it was because he is warning me with a smile.This man was a terrifying person.At the place where the masked men stopped coming after me, the Fourth Blood Star, Do Jangho, gave separate orders for his men.\u201cSend someone back to Yulang county in Yiyang city and investigate the maternal side of Wonhui and keep an eye on him.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLeader Oh did not like Do Jangho\u2019s decision to spare me and smiled creepily.This was expected.The Blood Cult wasn\u2019t made up of stupid people. I didn\u2019t think they would trust me right away.\u2018They are suspicious of me.\u2019The eyes of the masked people had disbelief in it. They were keeping an eye on me.\u201cThat one.\u201dThe wagon I had to ride was a wagon with the other kidnapped boys and girls. It looked like an ordinary wagon but was blocked with iron bars inside so people couldn\u2019t escape. Even if people entered it voluntarily, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape.\u2018Should I just think myself lucky enough to still be alive?\u2019\u201cGet in.\u201dThe masked man pushed me into the wagon.\u201cDon\u2019t stir up shit and stay quiet.\u201dI nodded. Compared to my previous life, this felt fine. This time, I wasn\u2019t tied up and thrown in like trash.\u201cUp!\u201dBut well.There were Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun in the wagon. The self-proclaimed Honam\u2019s Twin Swift Blades were both tied up and groaned.It isn\u2019t like they had their mouths shut, but it was because they had their blood points sealed. This made it impossible for them to speak.\u201cUp!\u201dThe two who saw me tried to shout. Unlike the twins, the others in the wagon didn\u2019t have many obvious restraints.\u201cHa. Even if we seal their blood points, they are still filthy.\u201dA masked man showed annoyance at the two. If the blood points were fully sealed, they would faint. When they did faint, the masked man walked away with satisfaction.He then locked the door from outside the wagon before it began moving shortly after.Clack! Clack!I sat in the corner of the wagon and sighed.In addition to the unconscious twins, the other kidnaped boys and girls were shivering in fear. It was strange to be calm in this situation.Shh!I pulled out the short sword wrapped in a cloth to my arms. Still, I was able to take back my mother\u2019s keepsake. After removing the cloth, I grabbed the short sword, and a scream greeted me.-Kuaaaaaak!And I covered it with cloth again. The Small Short Sword was screaming at me.-My head! Give me my head back!It must be in shock as its tip was broken. I could understand the pain, but it was too loud.\u2018Please be quiet. It isn\u2019t like you have been completely broken.\u2019As it heard my words, it replied in a monotone voice.-If I shave all the hair on your head, would you say the same thing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - TianshuPublished onJun 29, 2022\u202210 min read\u2022782 viewsThe memory of getting into the wagon in my past life was clear in my mind.My condition was no different from the other captives inside the wagon at that time. I knew the identities of our captors now, but the other kids had no idea. This was a situation where the future seemed dark and bleak.\u2018Because the days of hell will begin.\u2019Their fear would soon turn into reality. I was a living witness.-What do you mean days of hell?Short Sword\u2019s voice was ringing again in my head. It kept crying out all night as it complained about its broken tip. Now it was sounding a little calmer.\u2018It will happen.\u2019-How do you know what will happen?\u2018What can you do knowing how I know?\u2019At my blunt words, the sword said.-Shame on you. You owe me big time.\u2018I already said I\u2019ll get a blacksmith to fix you later.\u2019-It is more precious than life!\u2018Your head is more precious than life?\u2019-You are too stiff. You and I are bound by fate. When you are having a hard time, I help you, and when I have a hard time, you suddenly change your attitude?Look at this one. It could have spoken its way to the top if it was a human instead of a short sword.\u2018Are you trying to persuade me?\u2019-Ah. Persuade? Don\u2019t bother even thinking that. Huh? But I am curious.Short Sword seemed like an existence that couldn\u2019t hold back its curiosity. It also kept declaring its curiosity.\u201cPhew.\u201dActually, I was still a bit overwhelmed with all that had happened so far. From the time I regressed to this present reality, I never had time to think about what had happened. I then stared at the short sword.\u2018You won\u2019t tell anyone, right?\u2019-\u2026 uh. What, are you crazy? How can a sword talk?\u2018Are you calling me crazy?\u2019-Well, you are crazy with a bit of uniquenessMy mind wandered a lot at its words.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Right. How can a short sword spread rumors? Who would\u2019ve known I would have a short sword that could complain like a human?This was good. To get to the hideout of the Blood Cult, I had to stay in this wagon for a fortnight.\u2018Did you know I was the trash of my family?\u2019-Yes, the trash 3rd young master.Ha\u2026 this one seriously didn\u2019t seem to understand!What was I expecting from a short sword? I began to complain about my life. At first, I was planning to keep the story simple.But as I spoke, the words began to change. I spoke of my life as a spy and things I never told anyone. Maybe this was why the things I kept in my heart exploded.From the circumstances of being born to a servant, to being called trash by my family, to wandering away from my home, to being kidnapped by the Blood Cult, and finally ending up working as a spy, all of it came out in a torrent of complaints.\u2018\u2026 and when I woke up, I saw that I returned to 10 years in the past.\u2019My entire rant lasted for half a day.The life I had lived was very turbulent. The Short Sword then said.-You have no skill in talking.\u2018What?\u2019-Why are you arranging such a short story into a whole biography? When you do business like this, customers leave.In an instant, I felt the urge to curse it. When it talked, it was funny, and when I talked, I\u2019m just spouting shit? Ah, forget it, I should break this thing myself.-Don\u2019t do that. I am your mother\u2019s keepsake.\u2018\u2026 right. It is a good thing you are a keepsake.\u2019Otherwise, I would have broken you in an instant. I didn\u2019t like its reaction, but I still managed to confess everything for the first time in my life, and it felt good. However, things weren\u2019t going too well. The Small Short Sword then said to me.-Yah, wouldn\u2019t it be advantageous for you to know what will happen?\u2018What?\u2019-You know. You realize when bad things will happen in advance. You can avoid it\u2026 or make it better.\u2018\u2026!\u2019-Right?\u2018\u2026 Ha!\u2019I was stupid. I was worried about how to deal with things I would need to go through again, but this talking sword gave me a different answer.\u2018You are smart.\u2019-Uh, that is true. But you are plain stupid.Even at its harsh words, I still managed to smile.\u201cHahahaha.\u201dThud! Thud!I heard the sound of fists hitting the outside of the carriage. It was a warning for me to be quiet.For a moment, I anxiously thought I had made a mistake. The Small Short Sword was right.I knew what will happen in the future, and I remembered many significant events that will occur. This was a tremendous asset to me.The Small Short Sword who told me this suddenly looked at me.-Don\u2019t look at me like that. It is burdensome.This guy was an idiot. But it was good. As Small Short Sword said, if I could make things work in my favor, everything can end differently.-What do we do? Are you going to escape and go home? Even if you are trash, you are fine.I shook my head at its words. Escaping was impossible. The inside of the wagon was covered with iron bars. How can I get out? Besides, it was unreasonable to even think of dealing with the number of people guarding the outside.-Then, what do we do? Are we going to Blood Cult? They are some scary brats.\u2018Scary, that\u2019s true.\u2019-Then why go to the Blood Cult?\u2018If we run, our lies will be exposed.\u2019I\u2019ve already met one of the officials of the Blood Cult in this life. If I run now, would that man let me live in peace?Instead, this would endanger not just me but my family too.-You are quite the goody-two-shoes.\u2018Goody-tw- What?\u2019-You were ignored for being a child of a maid. It shouldn\u2019t matter if the family is going to end up in ruins.\u2018If it has to be ruined, it should be done by me.\u2019-Uh?I couldn\u2019t let that deed fall into the hands of the Blood Cult. Even though he was head of the house, the lord did treat me fine as a child.-\u2026 I get it. It\u2019s because of her.I didn\u2019t respond back.Because Short Sword was right. My only remaining blood relative, my younger sibling, was still in the family.-Then will you head to the Blood Cult like this? What is going on in your mind?While it continued to ask about my plan, I said.\u2018You, what is the most embarrassing thing in my life?\u2019-Being called trash?\u2018\u2026 stop it seriously.\u2019-Then what?\u2018Being swung around by some third-rate warrior!\u2019My life would have been different if this dantian of mine hadn\u2019t been damaged.A third-rate warrior, who couldn\u2019t even gather internal qi, damaged him to the point of being expelled from the family. The result of which led to his eventual kidnapping by the Blood Cult to be used as a spy.I had been swayed around all my life, and I didn\u2019t want to live like that anymore.-Right, okay. Everything is fine, but what will you do now?\u2018I will change it from now on.\u2019-It can happen, and you can change. To live without being swayed around by others, you need to learn martial arts. But by what means can you master martial arts without internal qi and a broken dantian?\u2018There is a way.\u2019-There is?There was one incident that happened before I joined the Blood Cult. If I hadn\u2019t missed that chance, I wouldn\u2019t have known that a broken dantian could be saved.\u2018If I am lucky, I might be able to learn cultivation.\u2019-Oh? Really?\u2018I don\u2019t know. I need to try it out.\u2019It\u2019s not easy. If I was not lucky, I was bound to fail.And I would miss the chance to restore my dantian.-Hmm, there is one. If you can master martial arts, I can also teach you the martial arts of my former owner if you want?\u2018What?\u2019-I told you, right?I felt strange as I heard it ask about teaching me martial arts. Come to think of it, I was only able to live because of this dagger. I wonder why it felt so natural for it to respond. It must be because of its former owner that it can know martial arts.\u2018Is that true?\u2019-Ha! Have I lied to you? I will teach you what is the problem here?I didn\u2019t say anything and listened as it began to tell me about the martial arts. It was, obviously, martial arts for short sword users.I was surprised as I listened to its words, and a strange feeling hit me.Wheik!Suddenly blue flames shined from my right hand.\u2018Kuk!\u2019It\u2019s not a huge deal, but I was shocked at how suddenly this was happening. I shook my hands to try to put out the flames, but it was futile.\u2018W-what!\u2019Even stranger was that the flames did not feel hot. Then suddenly, a voice echoed in my head.[Now that you have acquired the Sword Heart, the Tianshu (Big Dipper) will open.]This was not the voice of the short sword. At that moment, the blue flame flaring from my hand began to subside. As I looked at the back of my hand, wondering if I had been burned, the fading flames were sucked in.Chik!\u2018What?\u2019A blue dot appeared at the point where the flames were sucked into the back of my hand. But it wasn\u2019t just simply blue dots that appeared.I\u2019m not sure, but there were 7 dots on the back of my hand. To say that it was normal made no sense, but the position of the dots were similar to the Tianshu (Big Dipper) constellation in the night sky.\u2018What is this?\u2019One of the seven dots on the back of my hand was blue.\u2018Tianshu?\u2019The location is the celestial equinox, which corresponds to the first star of Tianshu.I can\u2019t understand why this is happening so suddenly.\u2018What is this?\u2019It is difficult to guess why this is happening. Then, suddenly, swordsmanship comes to my mind. Come to think of it, a clear inscription on the record of Sword Immortal mentions this star. Did that have something to do with this?-Yah!At that moment, the sword speaks.-Why aren\u2019t you concentrating? I am being generous here by teaching martial arts to you, and you keep waving that hand like a crazy man.\u2018Didn\u2019t you just see that?\u2019-What?\u2018I had something like a blue flame on my hand.\u2019-Are you hurt somewhere?\u2019The short sword was utterly unaware of the blue flames on my hand and thought I was waving my hand like a mad man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Six Blood Valley (1)Published onJun 29, 2022\u202212 min read\u20221004 viewsThe points that resembled the Big Dipper on the back of my hand were formed by blue flames.I was sure that these points somehow were related to the Sword Immortal. Come to think of it, even when Moyong Soo tried to kill me with his sword, the blue flames were what shot up from my body and made me regress back 10 years.What secrets did it have for this to happen? At this time, no one would have been able to find the Sword Immortal, so if there was a chance, I need to look for it.It had already been an entire month since I\u2019ve been stuck in this moving wagon. Typically, we should have arrived in less than a week, but there was a delay along the way. From the sounds outside the wagon, it was probably bandits.At first glance, it seemed like the unit was arriving late back to the Blood Cult.Clack!The wagon door opened. A subtle light flowed inside, which made me close my eyes.All the boys and girls who were tied up began to tremble in fear.Shhh!The light that came into the wagon was covered by a person\u2019s shadow. It was Leader Oh. He had a scary face to look at.\u2018He seems to be hurt.\u2019It seems like I was in for a ride. But it didn\u2019t matter. After all, from here on out, Leader Oh wasn\u2019t the one in charge.-Have we arrived? I don\u2019t see anything.The Small Short Sword in my arms begged for me to take it out.\u2018No.\u2019-It\u2019s stuffy here.\u2018Endure it.\u2019Taking the sword out would only bring more suspicion to me. This would obviously be a very awkward thing to happen to me.Leader Oh glanced at the others inside the carriage and shouted.\u201cCome out right now.\u2019The boys and girls inside began to crawl out at his strong words. I was the first one to get out. As I left the wagon, I could see a space that was surrounded by large mountain peaks outside.\u2018I am here again after such a long time.\u2019The moment I saw this place, the sight of which was firmly seared in my mind, I could feel a chill run down my spine. Memories of the truly hellish time I had here came rushing back.This place was a hiding place for the Blood Cult known as the Six Blood Valley. A new home for the Blood Cult after the war.After being defeated by the Murim Alliance in the war, members of the Blood Cult had scattered all over the central plains.It was safe to say that they are operating as an information organization.\u201cUh. So Wonhwi.\u201dLeader Oh called me.\u201cSalute!\u201dI bowed my head to not bring in too much attention, and a low voice warned me.\u201cI will keep watching you.\u201dHe was really suspicious of me.Meanwhile, the other girls and boys were dragged out of the wagon by force. Among them were Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun.The twins, still stunned from having their blood points sealed, looked angry.-Grrr!In addition to the wagon we rode in, there were two more wagons with children inside. Among them, one face caught my eye.\u2018Ah!\u2019The face was still young and beautiful, but it was someone I knew well.That girl had distinct concave facial features and was white as a sheet. No one would think that she, Dam Yehwa, would be the disciple of the infamous Blood Witch\u2026The Blood Witch was the Sixth among the Seven Blood Stars. Dam Yehwa possessed an innately cold body and was destined to become the Blood Witch\u2019s disciple.\u2018I am lucky.\u2019Someone like me ended up being a third-rate spy. It was hard to decide if I am lucky or not. Even being selected as a disciple happened without considering the disciple\u2019s will.\u201cSee that?\u201dLeader Oh pointed his hand somewhere. There was a podium at where he was pointing to with a man in gray robes who stood with his back to us.\u201cI will give you 5 seconds. Run there.\u201dEveryone was hesitant at the sudden command to run and unsure what to do. But upon hearing the command, I immediately ran there.\u201cW-what?\u201dThe twins who saw me run also began to run after me. I began to move faster, knowing what was coming.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, run!\u201dA loud voice shouted this from behind. Knowing that this would happen, I ran.Grrrr!The others, too, began to run behind me. I arrived at the podium first and knelt down on one knee.\u201cOh.\u201dThe man with his back to us seemed a bit curious at my reaction. In fact, this was part of the basic things which were taught to people after being brought here.\u201cShit. What is this!\u201d\u201cRight. What are you doing here?\u201dThe twins stood in stunned confusion for a moment before kneeling down like me. What I did was being followed by the others since I arrived first, and this was the right choice for them.The other children who rushed in looked at me and then did the same thing.\u201cIt is the first time I am seeing this.\u201dThe man on the podium mumbled. I know who he was.\u2018Gu Sang-woong, the Tyrannical Blood group commander.\u2019He was a man who stood above the group leaders and had the head position here. A single commander who led five leaders.Gu Sang-woong was tasked with the role of selecting new members for the sect.-Tat!Four men and women appeared next to the podium. The kids around me felt intimidated by their appearance as they all seemed like high-ranking people.The woman smiled and said,\u201cWell, this is a first. Someone is taking the proper greeting form before teaching has even begun.\u201dThank me for that! I made them do this before you by setting an example for the rest of these kids.-Are you so proud of this?Short Sword laughed at me.\u2018I just did what I had to do.\u2019-Yeah, right.Right. This wasn\u2019t something to be proud of.In the middle of my short argument with Short Sword, people of the Blood Cult surrounded us. It was to prevent us from escaping.\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d\u201cThey might kill us.\u201dThe kids were all anxious as they whispered among themselves.\u201cQuiet!\u201dEveryone covered their ears at Gu Sang-woong\u2019s shout. It was so loud that even my ears were in pain. When we all turned silent, Gu Sang-woong smiled proudly and says,\u201cRejoice, children. You have been chosen.\u2019Chosen my ass! Since when did kidnapping turn into being chosen?!\u201cThe will of the great Blood Demon has led you all into the Blood Cult.\u201d\u201cB-Blood Cult!\u201dWhisper!As soon as the name of the Blood Cult emerged, it became noisy, and the kids forgot the warning to be silent. Even if this wasn\u2019t Murim, there is no one who did not know the name and cruelty of the Blood Cult.-Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe group fell into silence at the sound of someone screaming. It was from a boy who reacted the most out of everyone.\u201cI think I told you all to be silent.\u201dLeader Oh just simply killed the boy. He smiled bitterly as he pulled the sword from the dead boy\u2019s neck, causing everyone\u2019s minds to race.-What? Did someone die?Even though it couldn\u2019t see, the short sword still noticed when someone died.\u2018As an example.\u2019-Wow. That is brutal. Who kills a person to set an example?This was the way of the Blood Cult. They aimed to select a few useful jade stones and abandon the others.Of course, most of them would be made to pledge loyalty to the Blood Cult.-How did you last in such a place for 10 years?\u2018You just need to obey them like a dog.\u2019-\u2026 Ah. As if being called trash wasn\u2019t enough, you turned into a dog. A piece of dog shit.\u2018You are taking a shortcut to make me break you.\u2019This was insane. This sword\u2019s ability to use words in strange and harsh ways was evolving daily. At the same time, people of the Blood Cult approached with wooden boxes and set them in front of the podium.Thud!Ah, this too had to come. Everyone must be wondering what the boxes were for.When Gu Sang-woong gestured, one sect member opened the boxes\u2019 lid. As soon as they were opened, something red immediately crawled out.\u201cEik!\u201d\u201cW-worm?\u201dThe disgusting red worms inside the wooden box were bloodworms. The Blood Cult used them as a means to control its members.I frowned at the sight of the bloodworms I had seen for the first time 10 years ago in a different past. I had that thing inside of me for 10 years.\u201cUhh. There. Right, you.\u201dGu Sang-woong, the commander, called for me. He grinned and asked.\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u2019\u201c\u2026 A bloodworm.\u201d\u201cOh! Truly a descendant of a member of the Blood Cult.\u201dAt his words of praise, everyone\u2019s attention turned to me. With a single word, the seed I sowed sprouted and I became a member of the sect. The ripples caused by his words were significant.All the other children looked at me like I was an evil person.\u201cWhat do we do with this child?\u201dSong Jwa-baek, next to me, mumbled those words after hearing Gu Sang-woong\u2019s statement. What else can be done since this already happened?If this was of any benefit, they too should start using this. Gu Sang-woong looked at everyone and says,\u201cYou chosen children, listen to me. If you want to truly become a member of the Blood Cult, come and accept the bloodworm of your own will.\u201dThe children began to turn anxious as what they had feared became a reality with his words. They can\u2019t run nor scream. I know what they were feeling a lot better than anyone else here. Then someone raised their hand.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019I sigh.Just like what happened 10 years ago, if there were a lot of people, there were bound to be those who couldn\u2019t understand their situation.\u201cW-what if we refuse?\u201dAgain, it happened. As soon as he asked the question, a nearby sect member slammed his sword down on his head. The effect was immediate. No one could refuse, not unless they wanted to die.If you don\u2019t want to die, then don\u2019t speak.-They will kill everyone here if they think killing is the right way to set an example.\u2018\u2026 They are doing this because there are many left here.\u2019Two people had died, but around 50 were still left. It was brutal but still an effective way to subdue the rest of them. Killing two wasn\u2019t a loss when compared to that.-It is amazing that you endured like this.\u2018This is just the start.\u2019A blood parasite was a means to control the new recruit. The Blood Cult placed the bloodworm into the body before pushing the children into a hell-like training. They are then gradually transformed into loyal members of the sect.\u201cNow. Who will accept this first?\u201dGu Sang-woong pointed to the wooden box. Everyone hesitated, even though they were scared. No one would willingly step up to touch that poisonous worm.\u2018Ha.\u2019Not knowing anything else, I knew there is no way to skip this event. I moved first, deciding that I should get something out of this. Again, everyone looked at me.\u201cI want that glory.\u201d\u201cAh! As expected.\u201dWhen I walked up first, Gu Sang-woong showed a satisfied expression.On the other hand, Leader Oh clearly still disliked me. He was still doubting me. Did he see any gaps in my acting?Shh!I got up and picked up the blood parasite on my own with chopsticks and brought it to my face. The worm was wriggling between the chopsticks.\u201cEat it.\u201d\u201cWith water, it would be easi-\u2026\u201d\u201cDown it.\u201dI hate this!-shh!The wriggling feeling inside my mouth. I hated this fucking sensation so much that I even asked for water.Gulp!As if the parasite was waiting, it moved down my throat and into my stomach. I wanted to frown at this foreign feeling of something sliding down my throat, but I tried to stay as calm as possible and raised my fist.\u201cIndeed from the descendant who inherited the blood of the sect. See that\u2026 Uh?\u201dGu Sang-woon praised me or tried to as he looked at me with strange eyes. It\u2019s not just him. Anyone who had an affiliation with the Blood Cult looked at me.\u201cWhy are you looking at\u2026 uh!\u201dA sharp pain right in my chest.Something wrong seemed to be happening within my body. As I was in a strange state, the woman who stood next to the podium rushed to me.\u201cWhy is his face this blue? Did the worm become pinched by the chopsticks?\u201d\u201cN-No. He ate it down like normal\u2026\u201dWhat they were saying was only throwing me into despair. Did I take the wrong blood parasite? The pain in my chest made it hard for me to breathe.\u201cHuk\u2026 huk\u2026\u201dIt was burning inside.\u201cShit!\u201dThe female woman hastily placed her hands on my back. It seemed like she was injecting qi into my body to prevent the poison from spreading. Warm energy radiated from where her hands were.\u201cKuak!\u201dBut something felt strange. The burning pain I felt in my chest was slowly going down. Down to the stomach. This\u2026 no\u2026.\u201cWhat is it? Is that side hurting?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 miss! Wait for\u2026\u201dWithout even listening, she continued to infuse qi into me, and I tried to hold on but,Pung!\u201cHuh!\u201dThe woman who infused qi into me hurriedly took off her hands and covered her nose.-Puaaaah!And my short sword laughed like it would pass out.\u201cYou!\u201dHow unpleasant it must have been for this female leader. Her face turned red as she stared at me in disgust. I could say nothing as I had just farted right in front of her.Ah\u2026 I am done.\u2018Uh?\u2019But after the fart escaped me, the pain in my stomach subsided, and my stomach felt comfortable.Instead, I felt energized.\u2018What is this?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Short Sword was teasing me by saying I am good for a boring person, but it\u2019s still quite disturbing. The humiliation was also short-lived.\u2018It is strange.\u2019-What is strange? You farting? Puahahaha!\u2018Ha\u2026 not that.\u2019-Then what?\u2018The pain has completely stopped.\u2019-Good. I was worried for you.\u2018\u2026 worried?\u2019-Of course. We are destined partners. Anyway, I won\u2019t feel different even if we\u2019re not that.\u2018Funny, I\u2019d rather trust a bug over you, but it isn\u2019t that. Something feels different.\u2019-What?\u2018What should I say? There is no sense of incongruity. I feel refreshed.\u2019It was like that in my previous life. After accepting the blood parasite, there was this peculiar feeling within me.A worm the size of a finger would wiggle inside my body. It\u2019s something difficult to adapt to at first.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dI could tell by looking at those who have eaten their bloodworms and returned to their places.The twins, too, were grabbing onto their chests with disgusted expressions.-You mean you aren\u2019t like them? Isn\u2019t that because you are used to it?\u2018Not at all.\u2019It wasn\u2019t something that someone can get used to. Surprisingly, it was shocking that my body even felt this nice despite still adjusting to it.\u2018No\u2026\u2019Was there something wrong with the blood parasite in my body? Actually, there was a simple way to answer it.-What is that?\u2018I can stimulate internal qi to check the blood parasite.\u2019-If you do that\u2026It was then.\u201cKuaaak.\u201dSong Jwa-baek, who sat next to me, convulsed as he collapsed. Shocked, Song Woo-hyun grabbed his older twin.\u201cHyung (brother)! Hyung!\u201dI clicked my tongue while looking at them.\u2018\u2026\u2019If you tried to control the blood parasite with their qi, the worm inside would run wild. Then it would make you hurt to the point of fainting. Unless one was an expert at controlling internal qi and can control it in their blood, this was a shortcut to death.Gu Sang-woong, who was on the podium, pointed to Song Jwa-baek and said,\u201cSee that? That happens if you try to control the blood parasite with your stupid tricks. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAll the kids who heard his words answered him immediately.\u201cYes!!\u201dAt that sight, Gu Sang-woong smiled. Maybe it was because I had set an example. It\u2019s not my intention to help them, but I wanted to do something to reduce the sacrifice that would end up happening.-What? Is your purpose to look good to them?\u2018Right.\u2019I had no intention of ending as some third-rate spy here. I wanted to rise up in rank and pay respects to those who toyed with my life.To do that, I had to prove that I\u2019m not some card which can be tossed away but a hidden card they had no choice but to use.When everyone was done eating the blood parasite, Gu Sang-woong, the commander, took out a small nail-sized ball.\u201cSee this?\u2019That was the Life Pill.\u201cIf you don\u2019t take the Life Pill In my hand once every 12 hours, you die.\u201dAfter hearing that, the faces of the kids immediately darkened. The only way the Blood Sect could continue its legacy after its defeat by the Murim Alliance was to increase the number of people under its banner. This was the most effective way.If you don\u2019t take the pill for 12 hours, the parasite within your body would feed on your heart.\u201cThere are four balls in the bottle you will be given now. If the supply of the Life Pill isn\u2019t carried out promptly, the consequences will be immediately obvious.\u201dGu Sang-woong looked at the corpses in rags in front of the podium, and I could see everyone around me feel their despair rising from within.Controlling servants through fear was the most effective way.\u201cWell. Once your loyalty to the sect is proven. In that case, the distribution will happen regularly, and our sect will put great importance on you.\u201dHe pointed to the leaders in the front and said.\u201cDo you see the belts around the leaders\u2019 waists here?\u201dThey were all senior warriors with blue belts.\u201cThat belt represents that they are important to the sect. If you become a high-ranking warrior of the cult, in recognition of your skills and achievements, we will remove the blood parasite within the body.\u201dHearing these words, the children\u2019s faces lightened up slightly as they heard of a way to get their parasites out.One cannot run a sect with just whips and punishment alone. There must be a slight hint of hope to turn them into full-fledged members of the sect.\u201cBecome recognized by the sect, and you will receive your just reward.\u201dHe was instilling false hope. In the end, they and I were nothing but monkeys to them. Gu Sang-woong looked at everyone and said,\u201cI sincerely welcome you all to the sect. as of today, you have become our sect\u2019s trainees.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, I shouted.\u201cLong Live the Blood Sect!\u201dAnd those watching me, the other kids, followed me.\u201cLong Live the Blood Sect!\u201dThanks to me as an example, no other kids would be killed today. An escape for at least one more person.Leader Oh, no matter what I did, he seemed to hate me.\u201cFrom now on, I will start organizing you in ranks. Leaders start.\u201d\u201cYes!\u2019Hearing the commander\u2019s order, the leaders standing behind us moved to the front.Behind the podium was the entrance to a cave leading inside the cliff of a mountain. There were three entrances to the cave, and three leaders went into them individually, leaving the fifth leader and the female leader outside.Kik!The sect members cleared away from the podium and led the children to the caves\u2019 entrance. As the children approached the entrances, the commander standing in front showed something similar to a wooden plaque and said.\u201cThis is to check the abilities. You should do your best to get a good rank.\u201dThe wooden plaques in the commander\u2019s hand had markings that read Upper, Middle and Lower.In my previous life, I had received a lower ranking evaluation. That was the worst.-Why is that the worst?\u2018If you receive that, you will start as the lowest ranking warrior.\u2019And it doesn\u2019t end with that. It meant they could discard you at any time. Even if I had to struggle, I needed to get at least the Middle rank.-But will that be fine? You said you wanted to check your body, but your dantian is broken.For some reason, the short sword seemed worried.\u201cI will wait on the other side. I hope you get a good rank.\u201dWith that, Gu Sang-woong, the commander, went inside the cave. The two other leaders followed behind him.However, Leader Oh, who is going into the cave, glances back and smiles at me.\u2018He is up to something.\u2019It was as if he had prepared something already. As the leaders entered, the middle-rank warriors took control of the trainees.The trainees\u2019 clothes were marked, and they were markings made when we were kidnapped. Of course, my clothes had marks too.Since my mark said \u2018middle\u2019, I must enter the middle cave. When I, who was in the front row, got up to enter the middle cave, one of the sect members stopped me.\u201cYou go in last.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI jumped at first when I heard that they wanted me to go in last. Leader Oh probably had a hand on this.-Leader Oh is acting like a child.\u2018\u2026 I agree.\u2019I thought something might be up, but it was happening too fast. I watched as the other kids went in one after another. Song Jwa-baek, who was next in turn, spoke in a determined voice.\u201cEh! If this happens, I might be an upper-rank warrior. I will be ahead of you!\u201d\u201cRight. Go first.\u201d\u201cYah. If it isn\u2019t your turn yet, sit down.\u201d\u201cUh.\u201dSong Jwa-baek snorted back at his younger brother, who was about to follow him, and bravely entered the cave.I am no match for anyone here. Why even bother showing me that brave face?\u2018I envy him.\u2019-Why? Does he get an upper rank?\u2018Yeah. It was confirmed.\u2019On the surface, they might look sloppy, but they were quite skillful. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have gotten the famous nickname of the White and Black Swift Swords.I remembered that their skills were something that definitely got recognized. After half an hour, all the trainees entered the cave. It was now my turn.\u201cWait.\u201dBut I wasn\u2019t allowed to go in right away. A middle-rank warrior continued to ask me to wait before finally letting me go in.Well, I will find out what they prepared.Step!The cave was lit with torches. In this cave, one person stayed to grasp each trainee\u2019s qualities and skills. The leader who entered the middle cave is called Hae Gyeom. He was known to have a generous personality compared to the other leaders.\u2018Uh!?\u2019However, a completely unexpected person was waiting for me instead. The man appeared to be in his late 30s and had a moustache and an eye patch, Noh Songgu.\u2018Ahh\u2026 so this is what you did.\u2019So that was the reason why Leader Oh looked happy. Noh Songgu looked much younger than when I first met him in the past. However, rather than feeling pleased, I instead hated this situation.It was at that moment.Pa!Noh Songgu flew like a weapon and grabbed me by the neck.\u201cKuak!\u2019There was no way to escape. I couldn\u2019t even comprehend how a person can be this fast.-Ugh. As if you can handle this! Get me out.Short Sword shouted at me to get it out, but even if I unsheathed it, it couldn\u2019t handle this person. Noh Songgu was a senior warrior, an expert.Even if I took the sword\u2019s help, my body couldn\u2019t keep up with this man\u2019s movement.Pak!Noh Songgu kicked my leg, and I proceeded to fall.Tuk!\u201cKuak!\u201dIt felt like my back was breaking.Srng!At that time, he drew his blade out and aimed it at me as he spoke in a voice of anger.\u201cYou said your maternal grandfather was one of my father\u2019s subordinates?\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes.\u201dHe pushed the blade slightly against my neck as soon as I said it.\u201cAck! What are you doing? Are you trying to kill me?\u2019At my question, he replied.\u201cHa! You were the one who wanted to die. Did you think that I, as a member of the squad, wouldn\u2019t remember the people I had trained with?\u201d\u2018\u2026.!\u2019I was at a loss for words. I was losing it.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dNoh Songgu grunted through his teeth.\u201cWhat is your true identity?\u201dIf I didn\u2019t speak the truth, I would die right here. My heart was pounding.Ba-dump!What did I think about when I tried to run with this plan?Was it because I already died once?Pak!I grabbed his blade and spoke to him, not caring if the sword cuts into my hand.\u201cLet\u2019s make a fair deal!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNoh Songgu\u2019s eyebrows rose at my words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ha!\u201dNoh Songgu, the Blood Wolf leader, responded to my suggestion like it was ridiculous. In fact, it was he who was taking the initiative, but it probably seemed like an idiot\u2019s move to try and make a deal right now.\u201cYou must be out of your mind.\u2019\u201cI am sane.\u201dActually, I was out of my mind.As Noh Songgu\u2019s hand pushed his blade ahead, my body and mind still felt fine. What could I not say in this state?\u201cI mean it, sincerely.\u201dPak!\u201cKuak!\u201dNoh Songgu stepped on my chest. Man, he was as relentless as much as I still feared the Blood Cult. No matter how hard he stepped on me, my words still managed to come out.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t just kill you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 right.\u201d\u201cIf you want to prolong your life even a little more, you will have to speak your purpose for using my father\u2019s name and trying to get a place in the sect.\u201dClench!Noh Songgu pushed his foot further. If he stepped just a little harder, my chest might explode.\u201cNoh Sehwa.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what?\u201dNog Songgu\u2019s foot, which was trying to kill me, lost its strength as his face hardened.\u201cHow do\u2026 you know that name?\u201dThe reason he reacted to the name like this was simple. Noh Sehwa was his sister. To be precise, she was the sister who disappeared about 15 years ago.\u201cTell me! How do you know that name!\u201dNoh Songgu pushed me. Truth be told, I was scared out of my wits, but I couldn\u2019t just reveal all my cards immediately, right?\u201cAre you going to keep doing this? Or will you make a deal with me?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dNoh Songgu stared at me and lifted his foot off of my chest. But he still didn\u2019t withdraw his blade on my neck.\u201c\u2026You think this is enough for us to make a deal?\u201d\u201cI know that even enemies will take responsibility for the words they speak.\u201dThe Noh Songgu I knew was a man who was generous and faithful to his subordinates, very much unlike other Blood Cult members.-His voice is shaking.\u2018It is his sister who he has been looking for.\u2019Noh Songgu had judged me to be an enemy here. Yet, when I mentioned the name of the sister he had been searching for, his heart could not help but be shaken.\u2018How will you respond, Blood Wolf squad leader?\u2019I stared him in the eyes. Soon, Noh Songgu opened his mouth.\u201cWhat do you want? Do you want me to keep my mouth shut about your truth?\u201dSure, that\u2019s something I wanted, but this was too huge an opportunity to waste.\u201cThat\u2019s why I said, let\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you don\u2019t have any hope of holding on to your life.\u201d\u201cThen the leader will never be able to find his sister.\u201dIn exchange for my life, this man could find his sister.In a way, that too would be the beginning of his life\u2019s misery.Clench!Noh Songgu asked me with a grimace.\u201cWhat more do you want?\u201d\u201cBe my strength when I need you.\u201d\u201cHa! Did you just ask me to become your crutch? You must really want to\u2026\u201d\u201cNot that. It\u2019s just that if I get into trouble here, I will ask the leader for help.\u201dNoh Songgu was soon to become a peak master. If he cpi;d come to my aid, I won\u2019t be at the bottom of the pecking order any more.\u201cNonsense! I am not someone like that! I cannot close my eyes when you could bring harm to the sect and help? I am not going to let myself be played by you.\u201d\u201cYou are only in the Blood Cult to pay back the debt that your father left? Right?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 How do you know this?\u2019Noh Songgu was in shock. The only person who knew of his condition was in the highest position of the cult. Most of the Blood Cult simply thought that this man was just walking after his father\u2019s path, but the reality was different.\u201cDidn\u2019t you take charge as the squad leader in exchange for information about the man who killed your father?\u201dThis was something I heard directly from the man.\u201c\u2026 What is your fucking identity?\u201dI thought that even I would be curious in such a situation, but it was impossible to say \u2018I have returned from ten years in the future\u2019.So I had to shift his attention.\u201cLet\u2019s do this. I will not only tell you the whereabouts of your sister but also about the man who murdered your father and who made your eye like that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe was a bit shaken by everything he would receive from this deal. Anyway, these are things I heard from a future Noh Songgu, so I had nothing to fear.\u201cHow do I know that you aren\u2019t lying just to escape this situation?\u201d\u201cI have the blood parasite within me. Can\u2019t the leader kill me at any time?\u201dNoh Songgu\u2019s face was clearly contemplating my words. I did have the blood parasite within me, and if I tried to run, they could kill me.After hesitating for a while, he eventually made up his mind.Sh!Then he took his blade off of my neck.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI never thought it would be such a relief. My gamble managed to work.\u201cIf it is false. You die.\u201d\u201cWhatever you like.\u201d\u201cWho killed my father?\u201dThat is what he wanted to know first, even more than his sister\u2019s fate. I knew who it was, but I hesitated before saying it.\u201c\u2026 First Blood Star.\u201dAt the unexpected name from my mouth, his expression changed.At this time, he still believed that the Murim Alliance was the one who had killed his father and kidnapped his sister. So he entered the Blood Cult, vowing to take revenge on those people.However, when he learned that the true culprit is the highest member of the cult, he seemed to doubt me.\u201cAre you playing with me now?\u201d\u201cPlay with you? Not at all. I shall correct my words. To be precise, it was done by another leader who had received orders from the First Blood Star. When he tried to kill your father, there were traces of the Murim Alliance left in\u2026\u201dTak!\u201cHuak!\u201dNoh Songgu went back to stepping on my chest.I try not to show it, but my expression was clearly changing as the pain turns my face red.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask your sister directly?\u201d\u201cSister?\u201d\u201cLeader\u2019s sister knows the truth.\u201d\u201c\u2026 my sister knows?\u201d\u201cYour sister is in Jinhai county of Zhejiang Province. If you go there yourself, your sister might end up dead, so send someone you can trust.\u201dThat place was managed by the First Blood Star. In his previous life, Noh Songgu met his dying sister there and heard the truth. He could not win over his anger and went to confront the First Blood Star, after which his squad was disbanded, and all his members were dispersed to other groups.\u201cYou\u2026 how\u2026\u201dNoh Songgu glanced at me and turned away like he had nothing to say.-He must be too shocked\u2018Right?\u2019I knew at once what he wanted to know. I just wanted things to not be the same as in my previous life.He\u2019s a Blood Cult member, but this man was someone I admired a lot. If only his sister, his only blood, didn\u2019t die, no matter how strong his father\u2019s killer is, he wouldn\u2019t lose his cool and could challenge the First Blood Star.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter looking at me for a while, Noh Songgu regained his calm. He then took his foot off my chest and extended his hand.Hold!When I took that hand, he pulled me up. Noh Songgu then looked at me with a firm expression.\u201cI will trust you just this once.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think you are out of danger. If this turns out false, I don\u2019t care who you are or what you know. I will kill you myself.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cBut if this is true\u2026 I will consider you as my life\u2019s benefactor.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re not just saying that, right?\u201d\u201cI believed you, but you cannot get yourself to believe me?\u201dI smiled.\u201cNo. I believe you.\u201dYou are a man who is full of faith and would never go back on your words.I could not help but believe you.But I had been beaten up so much in my previous life that asking that question had become a habit. Even beasts you could eventually trust, but not people.\u201cThen the deal is sealed.\u201dNoh Songgu nodded at me. As it seems that I managed to barely hold onto my life, I began tearing up. Moments later, Noh Songgu looked at me and said,\u201cBut I cannot tell if you are smart or stupid.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even speak of your grandfather\u2019s name, but you decided that you were caught, and this happened.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019When I heard that, it felt like being hit in the head with a hammer.As Noh Songgu said, he never mentioned my grandfather\u2019s name. I simply guessed that they had done a background check on me and jumped to conclusions.-Well, this is how you do things.\u2018What?\u2019Even the short sword seemed to enjoy it when I am in trouble.But when I thought back, I don\u2019t think it would have worked out anyway else.Even if my grandfather\u2019s name wasn\u2019t mentioned here, this man remembered everyone he trained with, so I couldn\u2019t possibly have fooled him.\u201c\u2026 I just thought it was natural.\u201dI spoke with pride, and Noh Songgu seemed to be in a better mood after seeing my expression. Now all that was left was to receive the plaque.\u201cThe deal is done. So can I go and get my plaque?\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t want to, I had to get a middle or upper-rank plaque.However, that was only possible with skilled or talented people, so if I received it, especially an upper-rank plaque, people would doubt me.However, Noh Songgu\u2019s expression seemed strange.\u201cTrue. Here.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI am keeping my mouth shut for now, but I haven\u2019t confirmed my sister\u2019s whereabouts yet. And you are hoping for me to give you benefits already.\u201d\u201cNo, this much should be fine.\u201d\u201cFunny. If you want to receive it, prove your skills.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe conversation was turning again. I felt like we have been going in circles for quite some time.-Kikiki. You got caught too.I thought he was a good man who didn\u2019t use his head too often, but now I was seeing new sides to him.\u201c\u2026How do I prove it?\u201dHe was different from the man I knew, so I had to be certain.Noh Songgu waved his hand at me.\u201cI heard that you have a body that cannot cultivate internal qi. I won\u2019t use qi and attack you with my bare hands.\u201dOh! Fair play!Noh Songgu continued with a confident voice.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cEven if I don\u2019t use my internal qi, there will be no gap in my movements. I will give you whatever rank you want if you can hit me just once.\u201dRight.First-rate warriors don\u2019t have run-of-the-mill bodies. I was also at an overwhelming disadvantage because I had only trained physically.But\u2026\u201cCan I use this dagger?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want. What difference will having a dagger make when you don\u2019t know martial arts or have internal qi?\u201dAt those words, I smiled.\u2018Hear that?\u2019Small Short Sword spoke with determination.-Dagger? Hey! I am Short Sword! Take me out already!At the other side of the cave\u2026Excluding one person, all the trainees had received their plaques. As the rest of the trainees took longer than expected, Gu Sang-woong, the commander, began to get anxious.Meanwhile, Leader Oh\u2019s face was filled with joy.\u2018I told him to teach him right, and he must have been caught. I did say I was going to watch him. Hehehe.\u2019It was worthwhile to call for Noh Songgu.Instead of waiting for the person he sent to Yulang to investigate and report back, he could simply save himself the trouble by calling someone who would know the truth behind the kid\u2019s story.And it seemed like there was going to be a tragic end.\u201cCommander. If my guess is right I\u2026\u201dThe commander raised his hand and signaled Leader Oh to be quiet. Leader Oh wondered why before he saw someone coming out of the cave.It was So Wonhwi.\u2018What?\u2019So Wonhwi, who came out of the cave, proudly lifted something up in his hand.[Middle]Not a lower plaque but middle? Leader Oh\u2019s expression became distorted at the sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without the help of Small Short Sword, I wouldn\u2019t have even been able to touch Noh Songgu.Even though he didn\u2019t use qi, he moved so fast that it was difficult to catch him.\u201cAh.\u201dMy body and face were covered in bruises. The man had no mercy in his hands.\u2018I need to train.\u2019Otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to last. Either way, I got what I wanted, a Middle-rank classification. As a result, I was one step further from just being a card to be discarded. However, there was no peace in this place, as people often fall down to the lower ranks during training.\u201cAh\u2026? He is coming.\u201d\u201cHe is.\u201dThe twin brothers looked at me with displeasure. I thought they would definitely get upper-rank classifications, but shockingly they were with me in the middle. It seemed like they had a pretty rough time.\u201cMan.\u201dHowever, the men grumbled as if they were dissatisfied with my presence there. In a place like this, where they had no connections, the only face they knew was me, so even if they acted strongly on the outside, they would have eventually returned to me.\u201cCommander. Please reconsider.\u201d\u201cUh. Speak softly.\u201dThe emergency meeting was being held twenty feet away from the trainees. It was because Leader Oh was expressing a dissenting opinion.\u2018I can\u2019t hear them.\u2019At first, I could hear everything, but now they were lowering their voices and using Voice Transmission techniques, and I could hear nothing.Voice Transmission was a technique for delivering the voice right into the person\u2019s mind using internal qi.\u2018Well. Even if you do it like that, I can mostly understand what\u2019s being said.\u2019Leader Oh was obviously trying to figure out if Noh Songgu had simply let me pass, but the latter was shaking their head.\u2018You are doing well.\u2019After all, he was a man who kept his promises.Leader Oh, who lost his reasoning, couldn\u2019t even shout. Thanks to this, everyone else bowed their heads as the conversation progressed to avoid any sensitive actions. It looks like it won\u2019t be solved for a while.After the ranking evaluation was complete, the trainees were given clothes. It wasn\u2019t a flashy outfit, just the right type for training. However, since there were no pockets, I couldn\u2019t put the short sword inside and had to put it around my waist.-Wow. I might live.It began to cheer up and was speaking up more in excitement. Of course, no one else could hear it even if it spoke.After all the trainees changed into their clothes, We were moved into place according to our ranks. Our guide was a female leader.Her name was Hae Okseon, and I didn\u2019t even look at her after my gaseous incident. Whenever I even glanced over, she would return it with a glare.-You have made enemies.\u2018I know.\u2019I was unintentionally increasing my enemies here.Still, I was glad she wasn\u2019t suspicious of my identity like Leader Oh.-You farted. That is the reason.\u2018\u2026\u2019Ignoring Short Sword\u2019s words, I walked ahead. When an instructor was officially assigned to conduct training, the whole process formally started.-How long does this last?\u2018One year.\u2019-That\u2019s not that long, is it?\u2018A low-ranking trainee usually ends up training alone.\u2019After one year of training, the basic course of a warrior in the Blood Sect was complete. Once that happened, those who do not possess further qualifications would be assigned positions as low-ranking warriors.I was at the bottom of the sect in the past.-What did you do here?\u2018Supplies.\u2019-Supplies?\u2018\u2026 Yes, I carried luggage, you idiot!\u2019That was literally the bottom of the pile. Even if I could master martial arts, I couldn\u2019t be better than normal people. As a result, I had to take on chores in the sect, such as carrying luggage. Still, it was a more comfortable time than my eventual role as a spy.-You have to be at least middle rank to avoid chores.\u2018I will get away.\u2019I will put in a decent amount of work to climb up. I\u2019m aiming to at least become a middle-rank warrior and take up the role of a captain.If I could make a good impact and name to sharpen my skills, maybe I could even become a first-rate warrior.-What is a middle-rank warrior?\u2018I need to become one within a year.\u2019-Eh? With what means? You are still the same.\u2018I did tell you that there is a way.\u2019-How?It was curious, so it kept on questioning me.\u2018The opportunity will come in ten months.\u2019In fact, despite knowing all this, my stomach began to hurt. Of course, I did manage to learn things, but it was no use to those who are not given a chance to utilize their education.-What happens then?\u2018In 10 months, an important person will come here.\u2019-Person? Are you saying someone precious will come?\u2018Right.\u2019-Who?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019-\u2026 are you messing with me? You farting trash.I can\u2019t give it an answer just once, and my whole character changed.It felt like Short Sword was getting more of a taste for making fun of me.\u2018If you say that one more time, I will break you.\u2019-Ah. You\u2019re angry? You said nonsense first! You raised my expectations!Right. My fault. Let\u2019s just get to the point.\u2018I know who that person is. It\u2019s not the person who is important, but the one who accompanies him is important.\u2019-Who is that?\u2018The Divine Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths.\u2019The Divine Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths. He was a physician who was known to have a cure for all diseases. He, who didn\u2019t belong to any side, will cure a diseased person no matter who they were as long as they could pay the set price.-Oh, oh! Then can he cure your dantian too?\u2018Right. I heard that he can heal broken dantians.\u2019-But why will he help you?\u2018He is coming here to find a certain medicine.\u2019-Medicinal herbs?\u2018The reason for bringing that person to this place for treatment is that the moment the herb is uprooted. It cannot last over a day, so it must be done nearby.\u2019I couldn\u2019t remember the herb\u2019s name, but it was some kind of grass. All the trainees were mobilized to find this one herb, and whoever found it was given a promise by the Divine Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths,\u2018He will give us anything.\u2019-Then you can aim for it.\u2018Right.\u2019I remembered exactly where this herb was found.Even though my dantian wasn\u2019t in great condition, I tried hard to get into the middle ranks this time.From the time I was in the wagon, I had been making plans.\u2018If I become a middle-ran warrior and transfer into the Blood Wolf squad\u2026.\u2019It was like everything was going to happen. If I could achieve success with the help of Noh Songgu, there was a chance that I could rise even further.After all, this was how I came to the Blood Sect, so I should try and make a life out of this.-Puahahaha, you are a funny one. A person from a well-known family with a good name is thinking about making a career in an Unorthodox Sect.\u2018Well, people will live the same way, and rotten people, be they Murim Alliance or not, are always rotten.\u2019It was a truth that I realized during my life as a spy. To the one who wants to climb up anywhere, surviving was best.While I was chatting with the sword, we approached the center of the mountain, where there was a training center for middle-rank trainees.\u201cOh?\u201dAs we arrived, Leader Hae Okseon seemed to be slightly shocked. I looked ahead, and around 20 people were lying on the ground of the training floor.\u2018What is this?\u2019Even I couldn\u2019t comprehend this event that is happening out of the blue. I had never heard of such a thing happening in my previous life. Then I saw someone lying on the floor slowly getting up.From a distance, he had a very large physique and is stout. His clothes weren\u2019t normal either.He was wearing leopard skin around himself, and his entire face was covered with a beard, making him look like a barbarian.Phat!At the same time, this man ran towards us at a great speed like a bull. He was able to come close to us in just a couple steps by using Light Footwork.\u201cEveryone, get back!\u201dHae Okseon hurriedly shouted at us as she drew the sword from her waist. It felt like she, too, was unaware of this man\u2019s identity.Like any first-rate warrior, she tried to stop the man by swinging her sword. At that moment, something unbelievable happened.Papak!The man blocked her sword with his bare hands and then threw her away.Puck!\u201cKyak!\u201dWith a scream of pain, she flew quite a distance. The blow sent her rolling on the ground before she slumped over in a heap.\u2018No way.\u2019This was the first time I had seen a leader taken down this easily. This would have been impossible even for the commander.\u201cS-she\u2019s dead!\u201dSong Jwa-baek panicked.\u201cNo. She isn\u2019t dead. Calm down.\u201dShe may have looked dead at a glance, but her body was still twitching. At the same time, the man who easily defeated her began to walk toward us.It was unusual for me to feel intimidated by just steps. Everyone was unsure of what needs to be done now, but the man opened his eyes wide before we could move.\u201c\u2026.?\u201dThen his hands met. The strength behind them caused an immense wind pressure and generated a sound that threatened to tear off our ears.Pat!The impact was so strong that I covered my ears as I could not withstand it.\u201cAhhhhh!\u2019The strange noise was hurting my ears.Beeeeeeik!I couldn\u2019t hear anything else from around me. As I struggled in pain and confusion, I saw the other trainees collapsing around me. They, obviously, couldn\u2019t withstand the sound.\u201cEuk!\u201dI removed my hands from my ears, and blood was dripping from them. I felt dizzy to almost the point of fainting and puking, but suddenly something happened.Ba-dump!I felt a warm energy in my chest beginning to soar up little by little.\u201cHuk\u2026 Huk\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what this energy was. But then I heard a scream.\u201cFuccckkkk! I-if you want to kill someone, kill me! Do not touch my brother!\u201dLooking at where the scream came from, I saw Song Jwa-baek covering his ears and standing in front of his brother, who was hurting.That crazy guy! This was unexpected. But the results weren\u2019t as expected either.With just one punch from the man, Song Jwa-baek\u2019s body made a creaking sound. The man who easily defeated one of the twins then moved toward Song Woo-hyun\u2026 No, the place he was heading to is\u2026-Run away!Small Short Sword shouted at me.But my legs were frozen, and I couldn\u2019t immediately regain my senses.Pak!Eventually, I lose consciousness and feel a dull sensation on the back of my head.Cold.It feels like my mouth is transported to the back of my head. I wake up with a cold touch on my skin and a terrible headache. Then came the hoarse voice.\u201cKuku, surprising. This guy\u2019s dantian is broken, so you are someone who cannot handle internal qi but woke up first?\u201dThe voice is too close. It startles me and wakes me up.\u201cUgh!\u201dIn a state of confusion, I step back.Right ahead of me is the giant barbarian leaning on a stone chair covered with leopard skin. I am so afraid that I can feel my whole body shaking.\u201cEuk!\u201dSomething touches my foot, causing me to trip backward.\u201cUh?\u201dIt is Song Jwa-baek. However, it isn\u2019t just him. His younger twin is also sleeping soundly next to him.\u201cW-where is this?\u201dI look around and note that this isn\u2019t a large cave.I also can\u2019t see any of the other trainees, which means that only the 3 of us were taken here.\u2018Damn it.\u2019I had such a perfect plan, but what is this? This is embarrassing.\u201cAh!\u201dI remember the short sword and look around, trying to look for it.\u201cKuk, looking for this?\u201dI look at the large man. He is holding the short sword in his thick and large hand. For some reason, I can\u2019t hear its words. When my head was hit, he must have taken it away.\u201cYou are a funny one. They said that all the trainees who just came in are kids, but you have this dagger.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019This man. He knows I am a trainee here. I don\u2019t think he is from the Blood Sect, but I am not sure anymore.After some hesitation, I decided to muster up my courage to ask.\u201cW-who is the elder who brought us here?\u201d\u201cKulkulkul.\u201dThe man breaks out in a roaring laugh.\u201cMe? I am Hae Ack-chun.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019I feel a shiver run through my body when I hear that name. I have to be hearing this wrong.\u2018No!\u2019If this man\u2019s words are true, he is one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries of Blood Sect, the Ghastly Monster, Hae Ack-chun.He is known as the most bizarre and unique of the four.\u2018W-why is he? Wait\u2026. No!\u2019My trembling gaze falls to the twins lying next to each other. They are asleep and without a care in the world.I am sure.\u2018No\u2026 was it Hae Ack-chun who passed down martial arts to these two?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Ghastly Monster (2)Published onJul 4, 2022\u20229 min read\u20223100 viewsTwo people were climbing up a steep mountain peak. They were also jumping up the mountain\u2019s cliff face as if it was flat ground. Even criminals wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.As they climbed the cliff, one of the two opened their mouths.\u201cSorry. It was my fault, commander.\u201dThe one who spoke was Hae Okseon, the female leader who had been leading the trainees.Gu Sang-woong, who was moving with her, shook his head.\u201cHe isn\u2019t someone a leader could have handled.\u201dThough he was telling her not to worry, even the commander didn\u2019t seem confident. He only learnt that the trainees were caught up with the man atop this peak by learning about what happened to Hae Okseon\u2019s group.\u2018Tch. I knew that crazy old man would be coming here often.\u2019But he never dreamt that he would touch their trainees. He truly was the possessor of one of the more bizarre personalities among the Four Venerable Dignitaries of the Blood Cult.He was so eccentric that even the First Venerable Dignitary disliked dealing with him.And since no one can know where he would pop up from, everyone was afraid of him.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have killed them, right? They aren\u2019t low-rank trainees. Middle-rank kids are hard to find.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dEven Gu Sang-woong couldn\u2019t be sure about this. From what he heard from his predecessor, this bizarre and eccentric man changed his actions depending on his mood.As they hurried up the mountain, they found a cave at the top of the peak. They could feel the qi from inside the cave.\u2018Here.\u2019As they stood in front of the cave, their faces were taut with tension.Pak!Gu Sang-woong got down on one knee and then took a bow. Hae Oksoeon followed right after.\u201cLong Live the Blood Cult! Commander Gu Sang-woon, who is in charge of the Six Blood Valley trainees, greets you.\u201dNo sound could be heard in response, and Hae Okseon asked.[What? Should we go in?][Wait. It would be better to listen\u2026]It was then.Shhh!Something moved from inside the cave, and Gu Sang-woong kicked the ground with great speed and blocked it with his blade.Pak!But despite blocking the object, commander Gu Sang-woong\u2019s body was still pushed back five steps.Drrrr!\u201cHuh!\u201dGu Sang-woong, who was pushed back, began to concentrate his qi on the soles of his feet to stay balanced. He would have fallen down the cliff if he had been pushed back just a little further. However, he was still in shock.\u201cA seed?\u201dOn the blade of his sword was stuck a seed of a fruit. How amazing.The qi inside this seed was subtle, but his weapon could not cut it, which resulted in him being pushed back.\u2018He is a monster.\u2019A voice emanated from within as he admired the man inside the cave.\u201cCommander, huh, you are good. Huhu.\u201dPak!Gu Sang-woong knelt down and shouted.\u201cYou compliment me too much. A thing like me cannot even follow your footsteps.\u201d\u201cHuh. that is obvious.\u201dGu Sang-woong frowned at the voice. He had simply said something appropriate to this situation but did not expect that kind of reply.\u2018He is really insane.\u2019The rumours were true, and it felt like this would take quite a lot of time. However, it was impossible to come up here and simply get the trainees and leave. The commander then spoke carefully.\u201cLord. The training we are doing\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you afraid that I would harm the children?\u201d\u201cAh, no.\u201d\u201cThen stop worrying and go back down.\u201d\u201cLord. The children are to be raised as warriors of the sect\u2026.\u201dPa!\u201cKuka!\u201dA flying fruit hits Gu Sang-woong on the chest. He could have stopped it, but he accepted it thinking that blocking again would complicate things. Thanks to that, however, he felt like he was suffering from internal wounds.\u201cClearly, the children I took in seem to have good qualities, so I plan to teach them some tricks by keeping them here.\u2019\u2018\u2026!\u2019Hearing that, the two people outside the cave couldn\u2019t hide their shock.To instill his own teachings onto the children the Blood Cult had taken in meant that he planned to mold them into different beings.\u2018Until now, this old man never took in any disciples.\u2019Of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, he was the only one who didn\u2019t have disciples.\u201cI don\u2019t get what you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just to keep me entertained during my stay here.\u201dDespite not saying that he would take the children as official disciples, he would still teach them. Receiving teachings from such a man was nothing short of a miracle. Besides, who could treat a person like Hae Ack-chun lightly?However, there was one curious thing.\u201cBut lord. Among the trainees you took is a child called So Wunhwi, who has his dantian broken, so it will be impossible for you to teach him\u2026\u201d\u201cKuk, who said I was going to teach him? That brat will be here on his feet for a while.\u201dIn other words, it would be like pampering one while making the other do chores.While Gu Sang-woong was speechless from shock, Hae Okseon sent him a Voice Transmission.[Isn\u2019t this alright? Commander. After all, even if he received a middle rank, he is someone who should be taught in the low rank. Please just turn your attention to the other ones.][Hmm\u2026]Gu Sang-woong, after giving the matter some thought, nodded his head. As she said, it seemed acceptable to give up So Wonhwi, but he couldn\u2019t let this crazy old man harm the other two.[I heard he came from the Yiyang So family, so I thought of using him as a spy and sending him to the Murim Alliance later, so he is no big deal.]If So Wonhwi heard this, he would probably lose his mind. The Blood Cult was already thinking of using that child as a spy.Gu Sang-woong took the initiative and spoke politely.Pak!\u201cAlright. I will retreat if you want to do that.\u201d\u2018This is insane!\u2019I was confused by the words I heard from outside.Now they were leaving me alone with this crazy old man. Song Jwa-baek broke out in giggles and laughed in disbelief.\u2018Damn it!\u2019This guy was out of his mind.It was I who woke up, rushed to the old man and then was beaten to a pulp. However, I was still delighted with the idea of this old man treating me like some servant of his.\u201cThe disciple will bow to the teacher. What are you doing?\u201d\u201cUhuh\u2026 I will bow.\u201dSong Jwa-baek and his younger brother were bowing down to the old man. Knowing his great identity, they seemed desperate to appeal to him.But\u2026\u201cWho is your teacher?\u201dPuk!\u201cUk!\u201dHae Ack-chun kicked the bowing twins on their heads. This man was really crazy.He\u2019s not called a mad man or a freak for nothing.\u2018Ahh\u2026\u2019This variable was entirely outside my expectations.This was the worst. I don\u2019t know how long this old man will stay here, but if he stayed more than a year, my plan to restore my dantian was a bust.\u2018What do I do?\u2019This man was too strong to even consider running away. However, even if I succeeded in escaping, the commander would bring me back and hand me over to the old man, so I couldn\u2019t just run to the training ground.Hae Ack-chun then shocked me out of my thoughts by saying,\u201cGet me something to eat within 2 minutes.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI want meat. Hehe.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDid this old man just ask this? I knew that this cave was on a cliff.It was also so steep that it would be difficult to travel without light footwork techniques.\u201cBut in two minutes\u2026.\u201d\u2018Wait.\u2019Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just run away?There was a saying I heard in my previous life.The men who even the Blood Cult members were reluctant to touch\u2026 If I got caught by him, it might be better to try and escape instead of thinking about life within the cult.\u2018Phew.\u2019I tried to calm down and hide my emotions.\u201cAll right. But I don\u2019t have any martial arts, so it is difficult to get anything, let alone meat, especially without a weapon.\u201dIt was a trick to try and get the Small Short Sword back. Since I didn\u2019t know when I would return, this was better.\u201cKulkul.\u201dHae Ack-chun then snapped his hand.Kwak!The fruit seeds in his hand flew past my cheek and lodged themselves into the cave walls. Blood was dripping from my cheeks, but I didn\u2019t even dare to turn my head.\u201cYou are a cunning one. Kulkul. I won\u2019t be bored, but keep in mind that the more you do, the shorter your life gets here.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI nodded without saying another word. I was not lying when I said that I suddenly felt the urge to pee.Tak!When my body refused to move, he threw another thing at me.I managed to catch it and saw that it was my Small Short Sword. When I opened my eyes to look at the old man, I saw that he was smiling.\u201cTake it. That old dagger doesn\u2019t have the right to stay in my hands.\u201dI think it was fortunate that this sword was so rusty that he didn\u2019t desire it. I then heard a voice that I felt like I haven\u2019t heard in a long time.-Kyaaaaak! That furry beast touched me! Absolutely disgusting!Disgusting? What did it mean?While it was nice to have Short Sword back, this was not the time to listen to its grumbling.I needed to run. As I was about to leave and save myself with Short Sword in tow, I heard.\u201cIf I catch you trying to run, be prepared to die.\u201dI felt a chill run down my spine. The human heart was quite remarkable.Because he threatened me not to run, I felt like running even more now. I then walked out of the cave.I gulped.-It is really steep. Can you run quickly from here?\u2018I need to do whatever it takes.\u2019I grabbed a rock on the cliff and lowered my leg with care. It was too steep to just slide down. So I slowly lowered my trembling hands and feet one after another.And then I heard the scream.\u201cWowwww!\u2019\u201cAaack!\u201dLooking up, I saw something unbelievable.\u2018\u2026.!\u2019Hae Ack-chun was walking down the steep peak like it was flat ground with the twins at his side. He appeared in front of me and then promptly disappeared. Short Sword then asked me plainly.-Can you really run away from that?Fuck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Ghastly Monster (3)Published onJul 5, 2022\u202214 min read\u20222714 viewsMy palms were all scratched and covered with scars. I slipped once in the middle of the climb bow, and two of my nails were completely busted.It hurt so much, but I desperately mustered up the will to escape this hell.Tatatak!I was running like a mad man, digging through the bushes. There wasn\u2019t much time for me. It seemed like I spent almost 4 hours just coming down here. If I had trained my body just a little bit, I could have come down in a better way.And that man wanted me to go out and come back within 4 hours? Crazy old bastard.It would take more than 8 hours to get back unhurt and with a meal.-Phew. This is really frustrating, especially since you cannot use qi.\u2018Shit. Do you want me to leave you?\u2019This was making me hate my childhood. I still wondered what my thoughts were at the time. Still, there was no time to complain. I needed to run and get away from that old man.Shhh!A shadow fell in the blink of an eye, and my vision darkens. Since I was wading through the bushes, I thought the thick leaves might have cast a shadow from the light.But then the Small Short Sword sighed.-Haa\u2026\u2018What is it?\u2019-You are done.\u2018What? Done?\u2019Then I realized.Shh!Something huge and bulky had jumped ahead of me. Seeing the large figure, I froze. The one who stood in front of me was that furry, savage being.\u201cYou took my warning lightly.\u201d\u201cI-It isn\u2019t that.\u201d\u201cAre you ready to die?\u201dPuk!\u201cKuak!\u201dI lost my place as stars seemingly appeared right in front of my eyes. When I woke up again, it was due to the pain in my face making it feel as if it would explode.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dMy head felt heavy and hot as I opened my eyes in fear, terrified of what I would see.\u201cUh, uhaaaah!\u201dSeeing the peaks upside-down was terrifying to me. As I lifted my head, I saw a steep cliff.\u201cFucking insane!\u201dI cursed out loud. In the meantime, all the blood rushing to my face made me feel like dying. I also came to realize my hands were bound behind the back. What was even more absurd is that my ankles were also bound.Which means that I was hanging upside down with my limbs tied up.\u201cUhhhh! Save me!\u201dHow many people can stay sane in such a situation? Even a hardened criminal would lose his mind.I shouted out like an animal to ask people to save me and that man to spare me. Curses too escaped my mouth, everything echoing down the mountain.Kiiiik!My body swayed with the occasional wind. This was true terror.\u201cAckkkk! Ackkkk!\u201dI was screaming like a beast asking for help, barely registering just how my throat is beginning to hurt. Only a hoarse voice was coming out of my throat now. Blood was still rushing to my head, and all I could see were the cliffs as I hung upside down. The tension might just cause my heart to explode and kill me.\u201cKuaaak!\u201dIt was strange. As fear began to rise, my will to live also began to soar. I forcefully lifted my body to stop the pain of all the blood rushing to my head and face.\u201cHuh!\u201dMy stomach was cramping, but I didn\u2019t care. When I tried to bend my body up, I could feel the blood start to drain away from my head.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dFortunately, the rope tied to my ankle is tightly done, so it doesn\u2019t seem like I would fall off.\u201c\u2026 damn it.\u201dThe problem was that my hands were tied too. I had to remove it, but I wasn\u2019t sure how. I continued to hold my upper body in a lifted position, but now it felt like my back was going to rip itself apart.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dI closed my eyes and straightened my back. I didn\u2019t want to see the cliff again. Blood flowed to my face once again as my back and stomach relaxed.\u201cAckkkk.\u201dThis half up and half down angle wasn\u2019t good either. Finally, I bent my back again, and my face became comfortable, but then the pain shifted to my back and stomach.\u201cUgh.\u201dThanks to the pain, I straightened my back again. After some time, I ended up having to repeat that action constantly. I am forced to do it, so either my head will hurt, or my back will scream in pain. This cycle of pain repeated itself for almost an hour.Along the way, I enjoyed the rare experience of hanging up on a cliff and vomiting.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa..\u201dThis was so excruciating that I might just die like this. But then.Tak! Tak! Tak!I looked up as I heard the sound approaching.\u201cHuk!\u201dHae Ack-chun was hanging by the cliff and looked at me. I was in so much pain that I ended up begging that beast.\u201cS-Spare me! Please let me go!\u201dMy voice was hoarse from the screaming. I sounded pathetic.\u201cKulkul.\u201dBut he just laughed before quickly putting me on his side, wrapped the rope to his other hand, and climbed up. It didn\u2019t take long to reach the cave that he lived in.Pak!He untied my ropes and threw me down. It hurts, but I didn\u2019t have any strength left to scream.It felt like my stomach and back were already torn apart, and my neck was faring no better.\u2018Fuck\u2026.\u2019I only uttered a curse inside my head. This damned old man was really the devil. I even thought about beating him up!In the middle of this, I saw the two brothers trembling and clinging to the wall on one side of the cave.\u2018What?\u2019I thought this man would nicely teach them, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. The older one, Song Jwa-baek, was clenching his fists which were beginning to scar over, and the younger one was upside-down on his head.Song Jwa-baek looked at me with tears in his eyes and was trying to say something.\u2018That demon-like bastard.\u2019I nodded as I looked at the face of the man who could understand my pain. At this moment, we all felt a sense of unity.\u2018Ah!\u2019Then I spotted my Small Short Sword on the floor. I dragged myself to it like a bug to grab it.-Ahhhhh! I thought you were dead.As soon as I grabbed it, it greeted me with its squeaky voice. I really thought I was going to die too.Rrrr!In the meantime, there was the signal that my stomach was suffering. It had been a whole day, and I haven\u2019t even had a proper meal yet. The twins also seemed to be on the same boat.However, that man was just sitting on the leopard skin-covered stone chair and was eating something. A piece of dried jerky.A thousand fires shone inside me. If he had such a thing, why did he want me to go and hunt?\u201cHungry?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, the twins nodded. He then glanced at me and said.\u201cHe was punished for running away without hunting, so you two don\u2019t get food either.\u201dPushing the responsibility onto me. Hopefully, this won\u2019t happen all the time.\u2018\u2026.\u2019Song Jwa-baek was already angry with me and turned to glare at me. But he was a simple-minded man and wasn\u2019t really the problem.\u201cI am hungry\u2026 I want to eat\u2026 that.\u201dHis younger brother, Song Woo-hyun, who was still upside-down, wanted to eat the jerky the old man was having. Song Jwa-baek looked at his salivating brother in shock and covered his crotch.\u201cIdiot. Hold on!\u201dThen Hae Ack-chun pulled something out of the sleeve. I, who saw what it was, became shocked.-What is it?\u2018He will kill us.\u2019What was in Haek Ack-chun\u2019s hand was a small flute. The problem wasn\u2019t the flute. The problem was if the flute was blown, it would hurt.\u201cStupid boys. Do you know what this is? Hehe.\u201dThe twins had no way of knowing. They looked at the old man with puzzled faces as he blew into the flute lightly.\u201cAck!\u2019\u201cUgh!\u201dBoth twins just fell to the ground while grabbing their chests.Their faces became red, and their body began to convulse. At that moment, I, too, fell to the ground and started screaming like them.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cPeople like you cannot be handled with words. Kulkul.\u201dThe mad man smiled at our pain. There was a reason why people called him the Ghastly Monster. After some time, the twins returned to their senses and exhaled out a breath.\u201cHuh! huh!\u201dI, too, did the same actions as them. Then Small Short Sword said to me.-You\u2026 aren\u2019t hurt?Because Short Sword was stuck to me, it noticed right away. I purposely curled up in the opposite direction and hid my face as I screamed.\u2018Right.\u2019I could barely stop myself from smiling. I was not hurt. Obviously, hearing the sound of the flute made my chest hurt, but I was fine otherwise.\u2018What happened to the blood parasite?\u2019I thought it was strange when I couldn\u2019t feel the pain in my chest. Yet when he blew into the flute, I really felt nothing, and I had no idea what happened to the blood parasite within me.\u2018What is it?\u2019The short sword was excited at my question and said,-What do you mean, what is it? The blood parasite obviously failed.I hoped so too. I haven\u2019t had the chance to confirm it yet, unfortunately. But now, I felt that the blood parasite was no longer an issue.\u201cGet out tomorrow morning and get something to eat. I will give you 4 hours.\u201dEven if someone was in good condition, it would take nearly 4 hours to get down the cliff. And he wants me to do what?\u201cIf you try to escape again or go past the time given, you should start getting prepared to hang off the cliff again. Kulkukl\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Hearing his words, my sword said.-He is nuts.The second day.I had to wake up early in the morning and head down. I felt like my body would break down as I rushed down the cliff. It feels strange.Without even thinking, I was trying to go down the cliff.-Will you give up?The short sword suggested trying to escape one more time, but I couldn\u2019t risk it now.I tried to escape once, and this man hung me upside down. I needed to at least assure him this time. I had to do my best to not get hung again.But I had just 4 hours to get this done. I wandered around the nearby forest to hunt. Thanks to my experience of doing chores as a low-rank warrior, I succeeded in making a trap that caught a pheasant.It then took me another 4 hours to climb back up.After returning to the cave, I was immediately left hanging for another 4 hours. Like the day before, I screamed at the top of my voice the entire time.Third day.On the third day, I rushed down the cliff desperately to get the task done. But then I slipped and almost fell down the cliff. Even with my nails ripped out and my palms scraped, I couldn\u2019t finish hunting in the allotted time.This day too was a failure, and as soon as I got back up the mountain, I was beaten up by the old man.Gu Sang-woong, who had come to check up on us, clicked his tongue as he saw me hanging.Seventh day.It was difficult to handle the cliff in 4 hours. It was almost impossible for me, who didn\u2019t learn martial arts or have any internal qi.I climbed the cliff little by little and slowly got used to it, but my climbing time didn\u2019t shorten by much. As expected, I was hung on the cliff again.But I\u2019m not too scared since I was getting used to it. However, it was still painful to have blood rush down to my head, so I had to do crunches again and again. I could feel the muscles in my stomach getting tighter.Tenth day.I was getting used to going up and down the cliff. As I climbed the cliff every day, I had no choice but to feel the muscles in my body start to harden. My palms, too, became hard as they were covered by calluses.I made a bow to shorten my hunting time. I didn\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this on the first day.In less than 30 minutes, I managed to successfully catch 2 pheasants. As there is more to eat, perhaps the old man was in a good mood since even though I returned late, I was left hanging for only two hours.I was delighted with this. However, the younger one of the twins had come over and gotten punched by the old man. He had a bloody bruise on his head.Fifteenth day.Finally, the day came. After obediently following what he asked me to do, the surveillance on me became looser.I convinced myself that the man wasn\u2019t too late before trying to escape again. This time I even had an escape route planned. After coming down the cliff, I ran straight into the woods, but before I could even get out, the old man knocked me out with a hit to the head.For the first time since my death and regression, I was left hanging on the cliff for over half a day.One month had passed.I got used to moving up the cliff. Only now did I notice a good path to go up and down the mountain. Maybe that is why I could shorten the time of the trip. Still, considering I had to hunt, I would go over time and hang again.However, unlike before, it felt like training, and I would even do sit-ups. Now there were even washboard abs visible on my stomach.I could feel my stamina increasing significantly in just one month when compared to my time as a third-rate warrior.And another month passed.-So boring. The slave duty begins again?\u2018Don\u2019t say it.\u2019-Yes, yes.The short sword responded with sarcasm. Who would want to do this work? Now it\u2019s trying to pin me against the man.\u2018I will survive from here!\u2019But this hellish suffering was bringing benefits to me. The muscles in my upper body were developed. My thighs were thick enough to resemble horse thighs, and my stomach was as hard as a stone.Even during my third-rate warrior training period, I never felt like this.-What about him?\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019Song Woo-hyun seemed strange. A big wound on his head looked more like a bump. It was the first time I saw hair stand up like that. Is that baldness or partial hair loss?\u2018I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not a guy who cares about hair.\u2019All he was probably thinking about was eating together with his brother. Other than that, he\u2019s not interested in other things.I\u2019m not sure how long I will have to continue my routine of traversing the cliff and hunting, but my life was more important than his.\u2018Damn old man!\u2019I stared at Hae Ack-chun, who was on the stone chair. He never sleeps lying down.\u2018Maybe he is afraid of being attacked.\u2019Even I wanted to stab him with a dagger. But then the old man opened his eyes.-He woke up!\u2018Kuk!\u2019I was shocked as I hurriedly tried to avoid making eye contact with him. He then got up from the stone chair and said.\u201cIt has been about a month or two.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSaying something strange, he lifted me up, put me between his hands, and left the cave suddenly. This was the first time I have gone up to the peak.The peaks were covered by fog, and it felt like a place where gods wander. The old man then looked at my body.\u201cNow you are ready.\u201dI had no idea what he was trying to say. It was scary. Is he making another plan to torment me? I was anxious until he asked me an unexpected question.\u201cWhat if there is a way to deal with internal qi without a dantian?\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - GamblePublished onJul 6, 2022\u20229 min read\u20222684 views\u2018How can I deal with internal qi without a dantian?\u2019Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words ran through my mind. Firstly, I had no idea this crazy old man would make this offer.Besides, did it make sense to handle internal qi without a dantian? This was my first time hearing about it.\u201cKulkul, of course. It must be hard to believe.\u201dAnd he seemed to be able to understand my thoughts. Well, it was likelier that he was just stating the obvious and not reading my mind.-Yah. I don\u2019t know what, but this man is up to something.\u2018I think the same.\u2019In my messy life, I had come across too many people. But even I still had difficulty understanding this man.Up until now, everything he made me do was beyond normal.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is something bad for you. Why are you looking at me like I am up to something?\u201dWell, it was hard to tell if you were being honest or not?It was impressive how well he could read my thoughts. Even though he was eccentric enough to be called the Ghastly Monster, he was someone who had been walking down a difficult path for decades.-Wonhwi. I think you need to be careful. You know how much you have suffered because of this crazy man.Phew.Short Sword was right. I needed to know why this man wanted to help me. After thinking, I knelt down.Thud!\u201cSect elder. You have spoken with the intention of making me raise my head. Still, this foolish young man can\u2019t understand your profound teachings.\u201dHae Ack-chun laughed at those words.\u201cI didn\u2019t know since you kept your mouth shut, but you are a sly one.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I am just speaking my true feelings.\u201dI was speaking frankly.If this conversation went on any further, this old man wasn\u2019t eccentric but crazy. On Hae Ack-chun\u2019s forehead, three lines appeared.\u201cHuh. Well, I made my body like that.\u201d\u2018Made his body?\u2019Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dHae Ack-chun kicked me in the chest.Thankfully, he didn\u2019t use internal qi, so I wasn\u2019t not too hurt. As I crawled in pain, the old man said.\u201cAs I thought, speaking doesn\u2019t work for you.\u201dWith that, he took out the flute from his clothes.It was the flute that would make the blood parasite inside the body go crazy. It was useless to me, but I must act like I was in pain.Hae Ack-chun blew the flute, and it was at that moment that I began to crouch and scream.\u201cAhhhh! My chest! My chest is!\u201dI tried to hide my face as much as possible, but then I heard him shout.\u201cChest, my ass!\u201dPuck!\u201cUgh!\u201dI received a kick to my back. Thanks to that, I ended up rolling on the rough ground for some distance. Hae Ack-chun shook his head.\u201cI hate seeing that clumsy acting of yours.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIt must take a lot of work to pretend like a blood parasite is inside you. Kulkul.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019It was a shocking moment that made me go dumb.I was surprised. I was half-sure that someone like Hae Ack-chun could not figure out if the parasite inside me was making an impact or not.Now I was worried about how this man would accept it. In my confusion, I tried to come up with an excuse.\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d\u201cOh my. Do you think someone like me cannot know your condition by looking at you?\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Come to think of it, I had been hit a couple times. For example, when climbing the cliff, when trying to escape, and many other times.\u2018This is bad.\u2019However, I couldn\u2019t figure out why he kept silent even though he knew the truth. All the people of the Blood Cult needed to have the blood parasite inside them. As I struggled with my shock, I heard him say.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you got rid of your parasite. You do know that you can be disposed of right away?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA complicated feeling ran through me.I couldn\u2019t even imagine what this man is up to, but I knew one thing. Even if he knew about this parasite not working inside me, he wouldn\u2019t just kill me.\u2018\u2026 this is going to take a long time.\u2019This would be no different from my last life. It would be impossible to know if this old man would simply decide to use me and drag me around.I had to take the initiative.\u2018Let\u2019s get some courage. So Wonhwi, you third-rate spy! To live a better life, you have to risk your life in this gamble.\u2019-Are you talking to yourself?I ignored Small Short Sword\u2019s words, and it stopped at only a few words. I calmed my mind and said\u2026\u201c\u2026 Then dispose of me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I should be disposed of?\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dAs I came out with a strong statement, Hae Ack-chun became dumbfounded, and I decided to continue my words.\u201cThe absence of the blood parasite in my body isn\u2019t intentional. After accepting it at the ceremony, I had a stomach ache, and it just\u2026 happened there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd it was only after you played the flute that I realized it was gone.\u201d\u201cYou came to know thanks to me?\u201d\u201cRight. If you ask me why I didn\u2019t tell you that, well, it is because I am a human who deserves to live. I joined the Blood Cult by my own choice. Wouldn\u2019t it be scary if I had that kind of thing inside me all my life?\u201d\u201cHuh! it is something that you have to work hard and gain merit\u2026\u201d\u201cInitially, the blood parasite\u2019s purpose is to control the people who aren\u2019t loyal to the Blood Cult. Is there a reason why I, who has the blood of a cult member flowing within me, need to have it inside?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s expression changed with my words. Rather than looking astonished, it felt more like he was looking at a different person. Then he laughed.\u201cKuahahahahaha!\u201dThen, he suddenly turned his face and grabbed me by my neck.Clench!\u201cKuak!\u201dWell, the gamble seemed unsuccessful. Hae Ack-chun spoke to me as I was suffering.\u201cIsn\u2019t your life precious to you?\u201d\u201cKuK!\u201d\u201cEven if I get rid of you, do you think anyone would question me?\u201d\u201cKuak\u2026 ack\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is the privilege that those who have power get to experience. What kind of guts do you even have to think someone would ask me about a third-rate like you?\u201dSpeaking was difficult with my throat in his grip. But strangely, my mind felt clear.Obviously, I was on the edge of the cliff and dangled by the hand of a huge man, but maybe because I had been through death once before, I don\u2019t feel too scared.I looked him in the eyes.\u201cHaa. I am afraid. But\u2026 if I live like this, I will die giving up my life by the orders of the elders\u2026 my whole life\u2026 I\u2019ll stay stuck\u2026 as a third-class warrior\u2026 and dying now is better than living like that.\u201d\u201cYou idiot!\u201dClench!\u201cKuak\u2026 do it, kill me!\u201dMy eyes were starting to roll over, but I tried my hardest to not look away. The man kept looking at me as well. Then, he let go.\u201cCough! Cough!\u201dAs I began to breathe again, I ended up coughing. Looking down at me as I struggled with pain, Hae Ack-chun said.\u201cI guess you aren\u2019t a coward.\u201d\u201cCough\u2026. Uh?\u201d\u201cIt would be better to not push your luck the next time. The end is obvious when a man with neither strength nor power tries to play around with courage.\u201dHe was saying that, but he didn\u2019t seem too angry. I\u2019m not sure what the man was thinking inside, but on the outside, he seemed to appreciate my courage in risking my life.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dI sighed without realizing it.This was a gamble, but I felt like I escaped from the chains of my former self. And this made me feel strong.Confidence without a base was a shortcut to death.-You really died and came back to life! Why take such detours to death again! What if you die, I\u2026Even the Small Short Sword couldn\u2019t understand it.\u2018Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t die.\u2019-You almost died!\u2018No. if he planned to kill me, he would have done it when he figured out I didn\u2019t have the blood parasite in me.\u2019I gambled on that.There was something to gain here, so I decided to play my hand. I was convinced that there was something beyond just this man trying to teach me to utilize internal qi without a dantian.After my coughing subsided, Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cGood. I will make you an offer which might interest you.\u201d\u201cInterest me?\u201d\u201cIf you follow my instructions well, the thing about blood parasites will stay between us. How is it? Isn\u2019t it a good condition? Kulkul.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad condition. He could have told me he would put another parasite in me, but instead, he said he would turn a blind eye to this issue.\u201cInstead, after learning \u2018it\u2019 you can fight those twins I\u2019m teaching martial arts to.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dNow, this was unexpected. I didn\u2019t expect this man\u2019s reason for teaching me how to handle internal qi would be to fight with the twins.\u201c\u2026 but why?\u201d\u201cHuh! Don\u2019t think about questioning things just because I am giving you an option!\u201dHe warned me with a terrifying face, and despite being curious, I decided to not ask further.It seemed like there was something bad about this.\u201cYou just need to fight them as and when told. Get it?\u201d\u201cCan I ask a question?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cListening to what you are saying, \u2018it\u2019\u2026 is that not the skill of the elder?\u201dAt that question, Hae Ack-chun kept silent. It looked like my question hit the mark. Then he answered.\u201cYes.\u201dThis was enough for me. I don\u2019t know the reason, but I knew that he was trying to confirm the result of \u2018it\u2019 by making me fight the twins.\u201cAny more questions, and I will break your leg.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201d\u201cThen I will understand that you will follow me. Come on!\u201dPat!He picked me up suddenly and placed me on his side as he quickly moved somewhere.He crossed over to the other side of the peak and climbed down the cliff before going into a cave.\u201cHere.\u201dThe inside was visible as bright light streams in, and the cave wasn\u2019t too deep. However, inside the cave were just broken bones and rusted iron swords.\u2018Where is this?\u2019I couldn\u2019t understand anything but the Small Short Sword\u2019s voice echoes in my head.-Wonhwi. That sword\u2026 is strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - South Heavenly Iron Sword (1)Published onJul 7, 2022\u202210 min read\u20222828 views\u2018That sword is strong?\u2019No, are you talking about that rusty iron sword? I am too puzzled by what the Small Short Sword is saying, but Hae Ack-chun points his finger at the skull and says,\u201cThat will be your teacher.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019When he pointed to the dead and called it my teacher, I felt thoroughly creeped out. And the skeleton wasn\u2019t even in good condition. Despite being a third-rate warrior in my past life, I lived as a warrior, and I could tell a good-conditioned skeleton from a bad one.-The skeleton is missing one arm.\u2018Not just the hand.\u2019The bones in both legs looked broken. To be precise, it looked like the knees were crushed, and at this level of damage, he would have been unable to walk until his eventual death.Just what did this skeleton do to live such a life?\u201cHe must be an idiot. To end up like this in a cave where people cannot even reach.\u201dThere was something odd about calling the dead an idiot. Rather than laughing, I felt bad.\u201cFollow me.\u201dHae Ack-chun took the lead and entered. And as we went inside, we walked through the skeletons.\u2018Ah!\u2019Now I know.I didn\u2019t realize it when I saw it from the entrance, but words were engraved at the place where the skeleton\u2019s owner had fallen. The writing looks like it was made using just fingers.How powerful did the person have to be to engrave this on the ground?\u201cThis is what you will learn.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 you mean this?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d-Skeleton teacher. Creepy,As Small Short Sword said, the dead man was now my teacher. I had a gloomy feeling without realizing why, and my eyes looked at what he wrote.The first words were as such.[Self Destroying Internal Qi]\u2018Uh?\u2019I frowned at the words, which felt absurd. I thought I read it wrong, but no, the words I read refer to the destruction of the dantian.\u2018This is why you brought me here.\u2019It was for this reason.To learn this skill, you must either voluntarily or involuntarily destroy the dantian.From Hae Ack-chun\u2019s point of view, there was no need to create a dantian and to test this skill out, I was the most suitable person.\u2018I don\u2019t like this.\u2019This would be a different story if I was someone who didn\u2019t know martial arts, but I was from a martial arts family.It is just that I can\u2019t cultivate, but I know everything about the process.-Then, the theory will move fast.\u2018But I never heard of destroying the dantian to accumulate qi.\u2019Who would risk their dantian to learn this if that is possible? I had heard about life qi, but that was different.And it was known that if people tried to learn martial arts without internal qi, they were bound to experience major side effects.\u201cWhat? Did you think I was going to test things on you?\u201dOkay, this man surely was reading my thoughts. And when I said nothing, he continued.\u201cDespite having the fruit which the others cannot eat, you are full of doubts.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWho do you think is this skeleton?\u201dHow could I know when I don\u2019t see any badge or plaque? Just say it already.\u201cThis one\u2026 is\u2026 no.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dIn an instant, I had a terrible feeling in my stomach.Whether he intended to say it or not, I was already on the edge of anxiousness. And even Short Sword already felt annoyed.-Is this a new torture method?Whether he knew Short Sword\u2019s words or not, Hae Ack-chun continued.\u201cDo you know what Essence, qi, and spirit are?\u201dEssence, qi, and spirit.The first things you were taught when learning martial arts. Essence meant the process of polishing one\u2019s self.And the essence, qi, and spirit in martial arts were\u2026\u201cEssence is here. The dantian.\u201dHae Ack-chun pointed to his navel.The qi was precisely supposed to go around in the dantian.\u201cThose who learn martial arts will purify their qi into their Essence through a cultivation method in their dantian. That is what internal qi is.\u201dI knew that too. This was also what one calls training.You constantly trained, built skills, and one day realized and awakened as an expert.\u201cThen what is qi?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Qi?\u201dThis was what I was going to learn. I was taught that qi is innate in people since birth. All three are innate, essence, qi, and spirit.Hae Ack-chun shook his head.\u201cHalf internal and half learned.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cSpirit is the same, but the thing that sits in the middle of the body is called the innate internal qi.\u201d\u201cInnate internal qi?\u201dI remembered hearing about this. But I heard that innate internal qi was literally your life\u2019s qi, so exhausting it would be like suicide.\u201cIt is said that innate internal qi has twice the strength of internal qi built by a person.\u201dIt was because it isn\u2019t forcibly built but was innate, and from what I knew, that qi only had one use.It was to be used to die with an enemy you cannot beat.\u2018No, is he going to tell me that I need to deal with internal qi in the same way\u2026\u2019As I worried, Hae Ack-chun smiled.\u201cYou are lucky in that manner. It is because it is written here a method that allows you to handle innate internal qi.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026 he really doesn\u2019t deviate from what I think.\u2019He was up to something.There was no way that he, known to be strong, could not know what happens if such theories were tested.\u201cThere is only one task for you. You need to learn it.\u201d\u201cYou mean right now?\u201d\u201cDid someone call you a genius or what? Start by feeling the innate internal qi.\u201dI hated this.Learn to feel qi and then drain it. Even if I did manage to learn it and my qi ran out, I won\u2019t live long.\u201cIf you cannot do it, I have no use for you anymore.\u201dThis was truly a dire situation. The only difference was that my life was in danger whether I touched the internal qi or Hae Ack-chun killed me when I failed.With those words, Hae Ack-chun was about to leave the cave.\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cWhat else? You want me to stick by your side and watch over you?\u201dI shook my head. Having this old man next to me was like sitting on nails.Maybe he was going to teach those twins.\u201cIf you can feel the innate internal qi, you know where you should come back to, right?\u201dI hated how he was speaking so casually.He looked back at me with anger as I didn\u2019t reply.\u2018Phew.\u2019I suppressed my anger. There was no benefit for me here if I showed my true feelings.Instead, the way out was to get this done as much as possible and not express my true feelings.\u201c\u2026 can I ask just one thing?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe returned my question with another question.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me about the presence of spirit?\u201dEssence, qi, and spirit, his explanation ended at just qi. At my question, Hae Ack-chun tapped his head with his finger and went out.Then Short Sword said.-Head?\u2018He isn\u2019t an idiot.\u2019Hae Ack-chun, who was returning to his cave, was grinning. Judging from the kid\u2019s expression, it felt like the kid knew what would happen if the innate internal qi was touched.He is probably trying to use his head right now, but still, he will learn it.\u2018I do feel pity. But if the words there are true, it would also be a blessing to you.\u2019Of course, if possible, he would be more suitable than So Wonhwi. Even if the dantian was broken, this was a secret that many warriors would like to covet.\u2018What is this?\u2019As I read what was written, I was shocked. The technique wasn\u2019t complete. It got cut off along the way because he died due to exhaustion.\u2018This!\u2019When I saw this, I cursed aloud. The last thing wasn\u2019t written; it just had to be the method to prevent the innate internal qi from becoming exhausted. That said, it was said that the qi can be stopped.But here, it felt like it was cut off at the most crucial part.\u2018You should have written it down first!\u2019This man was dead, but I couldn\u2019t stop my anger. If I learnt this, it only talked about consuming the innate internal qi and not the method for recovering it.And Small Short Sword said.-Wonhwi.\u2018Wait. Short Sword. I need time to think.\u2019I felt like I had to find a way.I didn\u2019t know when the time would be, but Hae Ack-chun would make me fight the twins when they are ready. And I cannot be running out of innate internal qi before then.-Yah.\u2018Should I adjust it to save qi as much as possible?\u2019Small Short Sword kept talking loudly.-Yah, idiot!\u2018Ah, stop it! That shocks me!\u2019-It is because you aren\u2019t hearing me. Yah. How about we just ask him?\u2018What?\u2019I had no idea what she was talking about.-Ask him. That skeleton\u2026 ah, he is saying, brat, how dare you call my master a skeleton.\u2018Wait, you\u2026 you are talking with the iron sword?\u2019-Yes. We can ask him. if he was with the skeleton all this while, then he can know\u2026 ah, seriously! It seems sensitive. How can I know if your master is Ho Jong or not!\u2018\u2026!?\u2019For a moment, I was doubting what I was hearing.\u2018What did you say?\u2019-How can I know if your master is Ho Jong or Mo Jong? He said his master is Ho Jong-dae, the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u2018South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019-Why are you so surprised?Anyone would be surprised by the famous swordsman who shook Yunnan with just one sword. He was such a great warrior that if he didn\u2019t disappear suddenly 15 years ago, there was a widespread opinion that he would have become one of the Eight Great Masters.-That good? No wonder the sword is acting like that.If this skeleton was indeed the South Heavenly Swordsman, then this was shocking.But why is a person known to have gone missing in Yunnan ended up dead like this on an unknown mountain in Guandong?\u2018Did that crazy old man do this?\u2019-He\u2019s smiling?\u2018Why?\u2019-That old man cannot beat his master, it seems.\u2018\u2026.!\u2019This was shocking.Hae Ack-chun was one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries in the Blood Cult, and no one could defeat him.\u2018I see.\u2019Perhaps, it was to restore his honor. Regardless of the origin, most warriors were proud of their martial arts.And no one liked to lose.\u2018If he is the real Ho Jong-dae, then it is a good thing.\u2019Short Sword had said that the iron sword might know the rest of the cut text. It was like a miracle had come true.I asked the short sword to help me ask the iron sword how to use the innate internal qi.But\u2026-Am I some matchmaker for a couple? It is right in front of you, so ask it yourself.I took a deep breath.I touched the other sword, but I heard nothing. It was the same as when I touched the throwing knives.I could only hear this one short sword.\u2018You need to tell me.\u2019It was impossible, yet I grabbed the sword without thought. And at that moment, a voice echoed.-Haaa. A touch I haven\u2019t felt in so long.In an instant, my body trembled, and I released my grip around the iron sword.\u2018W-what was that just now?\u2019Small Short Sword answered.-Its voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - South Heavenly Iron Sword (2)Published onJul 11, 2022\u202210 min read\u20222942 viewsAside from feeling something gloomy, I really did hear a voice. And I couldn\u2019t hear it at all before\u2026 So why can I hear it now?\u2018Iron sword\u2026.?\u2019I look at the short sword in my waist.Even if it is a short sword, it is still a sword. And what these two have in common is that they are both swords.\u2018Sword?\u2019It is that they are swords.\u2018Sound of swords\u2026 voice? Ha! Right. Right. This is what Sword Heart meant.\u2019It is then that I realize that I have misunderstood those words.Sword Heart.I took that concept somewhat abstractly when looking at various martial techniques. They often abstractly describe their feelings rather than simply saying them out loud.\u2018It really is the Sword Heart.\u2019A swordsman who can be called the best swordsman in the world.And since it is the vision left behind by that man, everyone thinks it is just the Sword Immortal\u2019s enlightenment and has some profound meaning.\u2018But it is to hear the voice of the swords, not all weapons but just swords.\u2019Even if I think of it as a technique, looking at the current situation, I am certain that I can hear the voice of swords.In the end, the short sword is nothing special\u2026-You have become extraordinary.At those words, my body trembles. At first, it feels absurd, but now it feels different.To have this unique ability within me fills me with joy.-I am going to rip that smile out. Stop liking it so much and ask him.Short Sword blows out the light on the metaphorical candle. I lived a hard life, so I just want to enjoy this moment.But, it is correct.\u2018There is no other chance like this.\u2019I don\u2019t know if I will be able to ask it and hear its answer.-So try and coax it into answering.I grab the iron sword again.-Haa.\u2018\u2026!\u2019I lift it in my hand again. Ah, that feeling of holding something creepy isn\u2019t just an illusion. It sounds like an angry woman.-What do you even care about?\u2018\u2026 that?\u2019The problem is that it isn\u2019t the tone of a woman but that of a middle-aged man.And thanks to it speaking like that, it feels creepy to me.\u2018Short Sword.\u2019-What?\u2018Can\u2019t you just ask? I cannot do it.\u2019As I speak to Short Sword, my whole body is shaking. Short Sword takes a deep breath and tries to talk with the iron sword.And its answer is\u2026-If you want to know, try negotiating directly.\u2018Negotiating?\u2019Does this even require negotiation? I thought Short Sword is unique, but this iron sword doesn\u2019t seem easy either.\u2018\u2026 don\u2019t say weird stuff and try to negotiate well.\u2019-Okay.I grab the sword again. There is a slight squeaking sound as if it is flaring its nose.-Excuse me.\u2018Yes.\u2019-Ah\u2026. You can hear my voice?The iron sword seems shocked, and I think back to when the short sword was similarly shocked.Have I ever heard of a human who can listen to the voice of swords?-I made another mistake. I am the South Heavenly Iron Sword. It is a name given to me by my deceased master.It is surprising.I am afraid to hold the sword, but when we talk, it feels fine. Whether influenced by his old master or not, when he speaks, he feels like a noble person.\u201cI am So Wonhwi.\u201d-Right. Wonhwi. I am glad to make acquaintances with you. I heard you wanted to know the method of innate qi my master used.This is an unexpected way that the technique is going to come out. He knows about it, and I want to learn it.\u2018Right. I am in a difficult situation now. I have to learn your master\u2019s technique.\u2019-I know that because I watched it.Then I am in a better situation. That should be enough to persuade him with the context of my upcoming fight with the twins.\u2018If you say that, then you would know\u2026\u2019Before I can finish, he answers.-I get it.\u2018Do you now?\u2019-Right. I will teach you.What?He accepted at once. It progresses so quickly that I am confused.-The honor of my master, the South Heavenly Swordsman, is at stake. If you are defeated after poorly learning my master\u2019s technique, then the name of my master will be tainted. Wonhwi.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019-What is it?\u2018Nothing. Because I just thought it was surprising that you are so proud of your master. But I didn\u2019t realize it can be irritating.\u2019Well, it can be like this.I was expecting a reaction where he would state that he could not speak about his wonderful master to me.-Interesting. I am just a sword, and I was created to be used. I cannot do anything alone. The honor of my master is important to me, but I do not want my existence as a sword to lose its value.This one is a lot better than I thought. I might have respected him if he is a human and not a sword.-And I hope my master\u2019s martial arts are passed on to the next generation. That is my wish.-Nice. This guy is so cool.Even Small Short Sword agrees.I am glad things are going well. Despite being a little nervous, I am considering negotiating right and getting what I need. I am still rejoicing when\u2026-Now, let\u2019s start the negotiations.\u2018What?\u2019Now, this is unexpected.\u2018Didn\u2019t you just say you wanted to pass down your master\u2019s vision to the future generations?\u2019-That is my master\u2019s wish.Then you have your own wishes? This sounds like something a teenage boy would say!-I have been lonely all this time. haha\u2026 I want it. a new master of mine, a touch of a swordsman, to stroke my blade each day\u2026Phat!At the creepy request, I release my grip around it. I made a mistake. I misunderstood this bastard for something nice.And thinking the same, short sword asks me.-Should we just give up getting the technique?In the end, after a bit of talk, the negotiations end. The condition is that I become its new owner.I, too, put in my conditions.I say that if he makes perverted breathing sounds or requests me to touch him, I would throw him away right then.And the sword accepts it.\u2018To sweat like this when negotiating with a sword.\u2019-True.Short sword agrees. Anyway, the negotiations end safely, and I begin to concentrate on feeling the innate qi within me.-The innate qi should be felt from within the chest. My former master called the position in the center of the chest the correct spot.This is my first time hearing this.I only knew about the place which collects the qi under the navel called the dantian. However, the South Heavenly Iron Sword calls the middle of the chest the dantian.\u2018If there is a lower and a middle spot, then there is also an upper-level dantian?\u2019-My former master told me the center of the forehead is the upper level.\u2018What kind of qi gathers in the upper level?\u2019-I don\u2019t know\u2018It wasn\u2019t mentioned? Did you watch him closely?\u2019-He called it the top dantian and is where you find enlightenment.\u2018Enlightenment\u2026\u2019It is an abstract concept that I can\u2019t understand. The important thing right now is to solve something else.I need to be able to feel the innate internal qi. But I can\u2019t grasp it even after 2 hours have passed.-No need to think too hard. It is just the innate qi of life.\u2018I know that.\u2019But I don\u2019t know how to feel it. It is difficult because this differs from the dantian you first form.And as I continue to struggle, the South Heavenly Iron Sword says.-If it is difficult to feel with thoughts, then maybe experience it with the five senses.\u2018Five senses?\u2019-The qi of life is most notable when facing an extreme crisis. If you can feel the power, you cannot usually feel now, or if you feel a weird heat rising within the chest, that is the innate internal qi.This is surprising.If it is easy to feel it in crisis, I should force that crazy old man to harass me.\u2018Can the innate internal qi be felt from the start?\u2019-You think I know that?I close my eyes without answering. I remember the time of my regression and revival, the sensation I felt then.The heat I felt when I was stumbling down the cliff and almost died, and when I was hung on a cliff or when the blood parasite\u2026Thud! ThudMy heart begins to beat loudly. I can feel the blood circulating within. And with that comes a warm feeling in my chest.\u2018Ah!\u2019I knew it right away. This hot qi that is rising in my chest is the innate qi.South Heavenly Iron Sword notices what I feel and says.-Congratulations. This is the innate internal qi. You are more talented than I thought.I feel better at his compliment.-My former master also worked hard for several months to feel it, but you did it within 4 hours.\u2018Several months?\u2019I didn\u2019t know it would take this long. But I understand that this is hard to grasp in just a couple of hours.This was bound to happen because I struggled for two months on this cliff and faced many crises.-Concentrate on the innate internal qi.Following his instruction, I concentrate my focus on the hot qi rising in my chest. This feels different from how it feels from when I still had my dantian.This is purer.-You will probably be able to feel the innate internal qi at the size of a fingernail.\u2018Uh?\u2019I ask with a mental grunt.-You cannot feel it? If that is the case, it is a pity that yours is much smaller than ordinary people. But it is okay. If you learn it, you can develop it\u2026.\u2018Not that.\u2019-Hm? Then what?It is the opposite.As this brat said, it isn\u2019t the size of a fingernail.Instead, it is the size of 2 fingers together.-\u2026 That can\u2019t be possible.Even he can\u2019t believe it. He keeps mumbling as if something unusual is about to happen.-Use the qi within the body and activate it there.\u2018Like this?\u2019I move my innate internal qi along the path he tells me to, and I can feel the warmth spreading through my shoulders, arms, and wrists.This is a different feeling but something I have missed for so long.-Hit the cave with your fist.Well, I am curious too. How much power does innate qi have?\u201cPhew.\u201dI clear my breath and punch the wall.Thud!At that moment, a creaking sound echoes through the cave, and I can see the wall dented by my fist.\u2018Ha!\u2019Even I, who threw the punch, can\u2019t understand how I can be this strong. Then the South Heavenly Iron Sword mumbles.-\u2026 I guess it was true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - South Heavenly Iron Sword (3)Published onJul 12, 2022\u202211 min read\u20223201 views-This is my first time seeing this.The South Heavenly Iron Sword kept mumbling the same thing. It was said that the standard innate internal qi within any human tended to be around the size of a fingernail. It was natural to be shocked as mine was several times that size.-My former master was also excellent in internal qi, but even he couldn\u2019t do this much.-Yah! Then you should say, \u2018my new master Wonhwi is more talented\u2019 and like it. But what is with that constant whining? This is a good thing.-Hmm. True.He agreed with what Small Short Sword said. Well, it was upsetting. For some reason, it felt like the South Heavenly Iron Sword was getting trapped by its words.Naturally, it felt like a hierarchical relationship was being established here.-A good start is definitely something to celebrate. With this level of internal qi, it is possible to cultivate at least 10 years worth of qi.\u201810 years?\u2019If that was true, I could call myself lucky. There was innate internal qi in this body, equivalent to 10 years of training. It saved me 10 years of time.-You are lucky\u2018Lucky\u2026\u2019I remembered hearing that what my family lacked the most was the internal qi. In the meantime, I also got my dantian damaged.And I always thought my life was unlucky. But, it felt weird that I was instead far superior to ordinary people.-If this is the case, I think it would be good to start practicing cultivation.\u2018Cultivation?\u2019-It is literally what it means to collect all the qi within the body and concentrate it to ensure the qi doesn\u2019t dissipate. However, know that the proper cultivation is what makes innate internal qi work.My heart pounded at his words. When I was young, I wanted to learn the So Yang cultivation technique, which was my family technique, but the chance was gone, and instead, I found a new chance.It was an opportunity to learn the skills of the South Heavenly Swordsman, who was called the best in Yunnan.So I asked with excitement.\u2018What is the name of the cultivation technique?\u2019-It is Xing Ming cultivation.What a name. I think that learning this would make me feel different. And then he spoke in a confident voice to me.-Admittedly, if you can master around 8 levels of the skills in this cultivation technique, your achievement will be great in Murim.They are words that are great in giving confidence.It was natural for the South Heavenly Swordsman to have such pride in himself, especially since the innate internal qi was stronger than normal qi. I cannot even imagine how strong he was.I then asked it, curious.\u2018How many levels did the South Heavenly Swordsman reach?\u2019-Around the sixth level.\u2018\u2026Sixth level in this state alone?\u2019This was amazing. It was unbelievable that he increased his innate qi through this method alone. Man, he was indeed worth admiring.-If you are born with this, you don\u2019t have to work hard for 10 years. If you, Wonhwi, can do this, you will reach the 6th level within 10 to 15 years.Ah\u2026It was darker than I thought.Still, if I thought differently about it, it\u2019s as if I was being told that I don\u2019t need to work too hard. If I honed my level constantly, I could reach the level of the South Heavenly Swordsman in just 10 years.\u2018Let\u2019s walk on the line of death!\u2019Motivation rose in me.After that, I spent around 3 hours inside the cave. I didn\u2019t even feel hungry. For a long time, I was just someone who was starving for martial arts. I realized it only when the sun goes down, and the cave was turning red.\u2018I need to go back.\u2019-Right. Who knows what that crazy man will do.Short Sword agreed with me. It would take a while to get on top of the mountain and head back down. As I was about to go out, I hesitated and bowed to the skeleton.-What are you doing?\u2018Well, I should at least greet him properly now that I learned his martial arts.\u2019The sword taught him, but somehow it was also right to show respect to the man who created this technique.-\u2026 My former master will recognize you as his successor.Iron Swords\u2019 voice sounded like it\u2019s moved by my actions. After standing up, I hurried out of the cave with the new sword on my back.As I looked up at the cliff, I sighed. I\u2019ve gone up and down the cliffs for two months, but I still get tired from seeing them. Then Short Sword asked me.-Why don\u2019t you learn some footwork techniques?\u2018Footwork?\u2019-Right. It is hard to walk up and down the cliff like this. And if you learn footwork techniques, you will be able to climb the mountain quickly.It was right. Watching Hae Ack-chun take me around like he was walking on flat ground, I did want to learn.Typically, the most essential thing in martial arts was footwork. It would be no exaggeration to say martial arts depended on it.\u2018Hmm.\u2019Short Sword did tell me that it would teach me, but I thought it might be better to learn what the iron sword is saying. Especially after what I learned today, I had expectations of him.But he stayed silent.-Sigh\u2026I could hear the sound of him moaning.-\u2026 your back is so lovely.This was insane. I warned him to not act like this. Just hearing that made me feel creeped out.Despite knowing that, the iron sword didn\u2019t seem to care.-Hmm. Footwork?I wanted to say something back, but I stayed silent. Thanks to him, I learned something good, so I decided to be patient.However, I could do nothing about the goosebumps on my arm.-I will teach you. But first, you need to learn the basic footwork form. You cannot even walk, and you are thinking about running.Well, it made sense. But now I don\u2019t have the time to learn. The old man would come running for me if I arrived too late.Tak!I held onto the stones and began to climb up. After learning footwork, would I be able to walk upright on the peaks like the crazy old man?-That is impossible.\u2018Uh?\u2019I was puzzled by his answer.-No matter how fast you learn the technique, walking on such a steep mountain like flat ground is unreasonable. My previous master couldn\u2019t do it either.\u2018Then how did the crazy old man do it?\u2019-That has to be his own technique. The former master always admired people who created their own techniques, especially footwork.Something that even the South Heavenly Swordsman accepted. This was surprising. I thought the man wouldn\u2019t care since he was strong, but that seemed to be a mistake.-He has the upper hand.Iron sword\u2019s answers were making it certain. In any case, Hae Ack-chun had his own weird technique, which made even the South Heavenly Swordsman acknowledge him. After climbing for a while, I could see the top.\u2018Uh?\u2019But when I reached the top, I saw something shocking. Song Woo-hyun, the younger of the twins, was standing upside down with his head on the ground and both arms behind his back. It\u2019s not normal balancing.And the balance came from the neck and not the head. It could be noticed from the veins standing out on the neck.-This is why he was turning bald. Oh my.As the short sword said, the hair loss was in the center of his head, and it was because of this training. He was going to lose all his hair.In addition, I also spotted Song Jwa-baek.Tatatat!Song jwa-baek was running. Instead of just running, he clenched his fists and ran with his hands on the floor. It looked painful to watch.-He caught them. Those poor kids.It truly was horrible to see. The teaching method the old man had was beyond normal. Constantly pushing one to the limit.Someone who hung people from a cliff for hours.-Where did the old man go?I could only see the twins on the peak, as the short sword said. It was normal to stay and watch when one trains, but he wasn\u2019t the kind to stick around.Maybe I could try running?\u201cDid you feel the innate internal qi?\u201dAh! That surprises me!I thought I would fall off. Hae Ack-chun arrived next to me. Just how great was this man that he could recognize even the minute amount of qi?He was quite tricky.\u201cWhy are you silent?\u201dI shook my head at his question.-Eh? You couldn\u2019t feel it, so you learned to do it.-Shut it, Short Sword.Because I was nervous, I listened to the two swords talking. The old man told me that he would abandon me if I couldn\u2019t feel the innate internal qi.So I was afraid about what words to say to him.\u201cYou aren\u2019t cheating, right?\u201dHae Ack-chun puts his hand on my chest and then infuses qi.Warm energy entered my chest and spread around.Tak!After moving the qi for a long time within the body, he released his hand and grinned.\u201cYou didn\u2019t feel it.\u201dThere was no sign of disappointment or anger. Instead, it was as if he expected this to happen.I lick my lips.\u2018He really cannot feel it.\u2019Actually, I did learn the proper way to realize the innate qi within my body because I couldn\u2019t normally feel it. The reason why my body can deceive him is\u2026Firstly\u2026-Innate internal qi is different from internal qi. It cannot be noticed until you intentionally create it.That was what Iron Sword told me, and Hae Ack-chun obviously could not feel it. I was a bit afraid, but I was happy that he couldn\u2019t find it.\u201cWell, it cannot be felt in one day. Kulkul.\u201dLooking at Hae Ack-chun, who was smiling, I felt excited. Exposing all your tricks in Murim puts you at a disadvantage. So I had to hide more than 60% of it.-Oh! That is good Wonhwi.Short Sword praised me. Hae Ack-chun, who was fine with me not growing, frowned.And then he smiled.\u201cMust have thought I was deceived. Kulkul.\u201dThud!In an instant, my heart dropped. Did he actually notice it?\u201cI think you are trying to slow it down as much as possible by using your head, but I need to remind you that you need to be able to do it.\u201d\u2018Haa.\u2019Fortunately, he didn\u2019t know the truth. Man, this old man was clever, but he was making a mistake. After all, he absolutely had no idea that I managed to do it and wasn\u2019t just trying to avoid it.\u201cGood. If you fail to do it, I will put the parasite back in you.\u201d\u201cUh.\u201d\u201cAnd you will never rise from a low-ranking warrior in this life.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that different from our promise?\u201d\u201cThat was before you used your head to not train properly.\u201dSomehow, he thought that I was delaying the learning process. Well, in the end, I had to achieve it.\u201cKulkul, aren\u2019t you motivated to learn now?\u201dAnd I had a thought.\u201c\u2026 You said if I failed, you would dispose of me, but what if I managed to get it down?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou said I need to learn the innate internal qi in the body. Otherwise, I will live as a low-ranking warrior, but shouldn\u2019t there be a reward?\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled at my bold words. I knew how to get this man interested after staying with him for two months.\u201cYou are still gutsy.\u201dAt this, I bowed down on the ground and spoke desperately.\u201cI don\u2019t want much. But as I climbed up and down the cliff, I grew admiration of the elder\u2019s talent.\u201dWhen I looked up, he was frowning.\u201cTalent? Are you talking about footwork?\u201d\u201cI will not ask if the elder says no, but please give me a chance to learn what the elder did.\u201dAt my words, the old man glared down at me before nodding.\u201cGood. I will listen if I need to do that to revive your will to train. But you need to get it done.\u201d\u201cThank you so much! Long live the Blood Cult!\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s expression softened. Maybe it was because he still thinks I can\u2019t finish it.\u201cHuh. You, go back to your place now. Those brats there aren\u2019t done with their training yet.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dPak!I bowed and turned away, and my lips curled into a smile as soon as I turned away.\u2018That light footwork technique is mine.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Bet (1)Published onJul 13, 2022\u20229 min read\u20222823 viewsFrom that day onwards, Hae Ack-chun no longer made me go up and down the cliff to get food or tie me to a cliff for hours. It was really fortunate.He told Gu Sang-woong to regularly send meat and beef jerky to the cliff instead. Thanks to this, I had an environment that could be used to train. However, realizing that going up and down the cliff is good for the body, I still spent two hours doing it.About 6 days later, Hae Ack-chun could feel the innate internal qi and realized that I had begun my training.Of course, in reality, I was using the Xing Ming cultivation technique. But the majority of my qi stayed hidden.The place I was using to train is the cave that contains the remains of Ho Jong-dae.\u201cBe careful.\u201dHae Ack-chun says it while giving me two things.One technique is the Ming Wheel Footwork, which originated from the forgotten Whole Wheel technique. After that came a surprising one, the Xing Ming Sword technique.-I was thinking who stole it, was it him?\u2018Him?\u2019The South Heavenly Iron Sword saw the technique book and was angry. According to the guy, there was a time when the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s residence was robbed, and his important technique book was stolen.And the culprit was this old man.-Right. It seems like this crazy old man desperately wanted to win.Short Sword was right.He wanted to win so badly that he was even stealing the opponent\u2019s technique books?The only thing inside the cave was an incomplete cultivation technique. I wondered how I could win with just one technique alone, but now this problem was solved.\u2018I have this one.\u2019One way or another, a sword technique.\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t know the skeleton\u2019s footwork method. However, this Ming Wheel footwork is quite balanced, so you can handle it without much difficulty.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Still, isn\u2019t this imperfect?\u201d\u201cI am giving you something nice, don\u2019t stress about things that seem incomplete.\u201dSurprisingly he was both careful and dedicated when giving things to me. But still, there was a difference between giving something fully written and something incomplete.And this man stole books from his opponent!\u2018This man is shameful.\u2019-Don\u2019t bother thinking about him.Iron Sword chimed in.\u2018Why?\u2019-The Xing Ming sword technique stolen by this man is from before my former master completed it.This meant that the man developed the technique further after the book was stolen.-I will make sure to get it done.Iron Sword spoke in a voice full of determination. It was reassuring. It was a battle with my future at stake, so I had to win it.And I needed to get the old man\u2019s footwork technique.A month passed.The sun was setting in the sky. As the days got colder, the sun set faster.Once every ten days, the commander would send in food and meat around the morning hours, and I would receive them.Usually, I would bow down to either the commander or the leader, but today an unexpected guest also came.\u201cLong live the Blood Cult! Leader Oh Jongi greets the elder.\u201dA familiar voice was heard from outside the cave. It was Leader Oh.-Tch, we have an annoying guest.I nodded at the Short Sword\u2019s words. If possible, I didn\u2019t want to see his face, but Hae Ack-chun hadn\u2019t returned yet.And the role of receiving food was my responsibility.- Just pretend to be the old man and get it done.\u2018What?\u2019-I mean, imitate his voice and tell him to leave the food and things out there?\u2018I wish he could be deceived.\u2019That man outside was quite famous. A skilled warrior with a blue belt.At this distance, he might notice that the cave is rather empty. With a sigh, I left the iron sword and went out.\u201cMiddle-rank trainee, So Wonhwi greets the leader.\u201dLeader Oh greeted me with a creepy smile.Swosh!\u201cYou seem to be doing well by serving as a servant to the elder.\u201dMan, this guy hated me. It had been a while since I\u2019d seen him, and he didn\u2019t seem to have changed.-Send him away. We never know when that old man will come back.\u2018Same here.\u2019Anyway, whether Leader Oh hated me or liked me, his job was to deliver food for now. Other than that, there was no reason to stay here.\u201cThe elder will be out late. You can hand the food and drink to me and leave.\u201dAt those words, Leader Oh extended to me the things he brought up. But, the ones coming here are usually the commander or Hae Ok-seon. Instead, I saw someone who looked like a trainee here with Leader Oh.At first glance, he looked to be around just 16 or 17.\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cBecause I need to see the elder.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I thought, he was annoying. So, he wanted to wait here? But his face was telling me that he had something up his sleeve.\u201cYou cannot enter the cave. You should know that, right?\u201dWith that, I decided to head back into the cave.\u201cStop.\u201dLeader Oh called me. As expected, it seemed his purpose wasn\u2019t the old man but me. When I stopped and turned, he smiled and said,\u201cYou won\u2019t need to go in either.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what luck you had to serve as the servant to the elder. But you won\u2019t escape from my hands.\u201dMan, he was stubborn. If he could train with this stubbornness, he would have succeeded much more.\u201cI proved my credentials with the Blood Wolf ladder.\u201d\u201cBullshit! I don\u2019t know how you persuaded him, but no one in Yulang county had ever seen your maternal grandfather.\u201dWell, this was as expected. My mother had told me that my grandfather died when I was young.And I made up the story with that knowledge. I replied with a smile.\u201cMy grandfather had to hide his origin, so how could he show his face recklessly to people?\u201dLeader Oh, stared at me as if wanting to kill me, said.\u201cYou will respond like that? Fine. But your time ends now.\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\u201cFrom this time onwards, this child will help the elder instead of you.\u201dThe trainee nodded his head with a strange smile. It was clear that the child didn\u2019t want to do this.Well, the purpose for bringing the trainee was revealed. His plan was to bring someone here to replace me.Rather than trying to deny me the training, he had a stronger will to keep me in front of his eyes.\u201cIt will be difficult.\u201d\u201cDifficult? That man will be satisfied if it is him.\u201dSeeing him talk, the child couldn\u2019t be just a trainee. Still, it changed nothing.\u201cHe won\u2019t be satisfied.\u201d\u201cHuh! Your origin is unclear, and you were brought as a helper. Did you think he had an interest in you?\u201dFor a moment, I almost smiled.I don\u2019t know what he was planning, but this idiot had no idea how crazy that old man was. I wanted to make fun of him, but I knew it would rile him up, so I said.\u201cAlright. Whatever it is, I will obey the orders.\u201dThis situation had to end. And Leader Oh said.\u201cGood. To change the person, I must prove that this child is good enough to look after the elder.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cShow him your skills, upper-rank trainee, Dohyun.\u201d\u2018Upper-rank trainee?\u2019This disgusting guy was an upper-rank? How come I didn\u2019t remember seeing him during the ceremony?\u201cI will follow the orders.\u201dClench!The upper-rank trainee called Dohyun began to get closer to me. Then he clenched his fists as he takes a stance.Leader Oh had a sly smile.\u201cI, the leader, will be responsible, so please correct his attitude.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThe guy who came up to me spoke confidently.\u201cI have no resentment or anger towards you, but I cannot miss this chance, so bear with me even if this hurts a little.\u201d-That cheeky bastard.Short Sword seemed more annoyed than me. Looking at his face, it felt like this child was treating me like trash.Well, he had been training as an upper-rank trainee for more than 3 months, and although I was a middle-rank trainee, I knew there is bound to be a difference.Phat!He holds out his fist.A fist technique, the Eight Blood Fist technique that everyone here learnt. As an upper-rank trainee, his form was perfect.But\u2026Grrrr!He seemed slow to me.As I had been honing my skills on the cliff, I thought he, too, would be learning a lot, but he didn\u2019t seem that strong.Pak!I only had to shift my body a little to dodge his fist, which caused him to frown. He then spoke with some surprise.\u201cGood. But how long will your luck\u2026\u201dPuck!\u201cKuak!\u201dBefore he could even finish speaking, my fist flew at him.Who talks when fighting?Still, I didn\u2019t use the innate qi, so he should be able to handle it\u2026Thud!\u2026 I guess not.With just one punch, my opponent fell down. It ended so blandly that even I was surprised.\u2018Why is he so weak?\u2019No, it felt like I got stronger. It felt like my strength has improved by climbing the cliff every day.Even though my downed opponent was just an upper-rank trainee, I didn\u2019t think he would be knocked out with just one punch.\u201cEh\u2026 this!\u201dLeader Oh\u2019s expression changed. He must be in a state of confusion as the opposite of his expectations happened. Unable to hold back his anger, he began to move\u2026\u201cYou bastard!\u201dIt was at the moment that he was about to pounce on me.\u201cHuh?\u201dSomeone appeared and pressed down on his shoulder. It was the Ghastly Monster.Leader Oh was shocked as he didn\u2019t expect the elder to come like this.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cE-elder. I am Leader Oh, who is under the Blood Cult.\u201d\u201cLeader? Just a leader dares to stand in front of my place and raise his hand?\u201dLeader Oh tried to explain it.\u201cElder. It isn\u2019t like that\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh! What isn\u2019t like that!\u201dLeader Oh\u2019s head was hit by the Ghastly Monster\u2019s large hand.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dI thought it was a light hit, but the man screamed and collapsed. Well, the real monster was here.He knocked down a first-rate warrior with just a swat.\u201cKuak\u2026\u201dLeader Oh\u2019s face was rubbing against the stone floor, and I looked down at him as he groaned in pain.\u201cI told you it will be tough.\u201dI definitely warned you.Do not touch the mad dog.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Bet (2)Published onJul 14, 2022\u202212 min read\u20223039 views\u201cKuak!\u201dLeader Oh, who was suffering, coughed blood and trembled as he collapsed.Well, he was the one who ignored the warning, so this was bound to happen. As of today, it felt like the eccentricities of the old man were unmistakable.At the same time, it made me think.\u2018This is what true strength is.\u2019It was difficult to even estimate the level of martial arts skills Hae Ack-chun had to take down a first-rate warrior like this.Then what about the South Heavenly Swordsman who defeated this monster? It made me realize just how difficult the Murim actually was.I needed to have strength.-If you want to become as amazing as that old man, bleeding to death will not get you those results.I knew you didn\u2019t have to put it like that.\u201cUgh, damn\u2026\u201dJust then, the trainee Dohyun woke up. He seemed to have come to his senses since I didn\u2019t hit him with innate qi.But as he just woke up, he couldn\u2019t understand the situation.\u201cI was talking to you bastard\u2026\u201dPak!Hae Ack-chun lifted him up by the nape.\u201cUh?\u201dHe was startled by the enormous savage-like man who lifted him up. And it felt like a child being lifted.\u201cW-who?\u201d\u201cMe? Hae Ack-cun.\u201d\u201cEik! E\u2026 elder!\u201dWhen he realized the situation, he felt shocked.\u201cWho are you? Did you follow him?\u201dThe trainee looked at the prone figure of Leader Oh. He wanted to answer, but he couldn\u2019t say it out loud.\u201cT\u2026 that\u2026 I\u2026 i\u2026 I\u2026 with\u2026 le\u2026le\u2026leader\u2026. Oh\u2026\u201dAnd there was just one answer.\u201cStuttering? Tch. Well, and you are an upper-rank trainee?\u201dPak!\u201cUgh!\u201dThe old man threw him away in annoyance. No matter how softly he threw, the guy rolled on the ground and stumbled.Tatata!I heard the sound and looked at the twins coming back up. However, seeing them skillfully descend, it felt like they had learned what Hae Ack-chun was teaching them well.-They are getting things too easily. Right?Right.Some got it by winning a bet, and some got it from luck like them. Then Hae Ack-chun asked me.\u201cWhy did these ones come up today?\u201dAnd I spoke the truth.\u201cThey brought new talent to help you.\u201d\u201cIs it that one? Ha!\u201dHe arrogantly evaluated the trainee. This was bad luck for him. He only received training below, so he is bound to suffer here.-Yes.Short Sword smiled, knowing that even if that guy was better, there is no way I would be replaced. Hae Ack-chun approached me and asked.\u201cBut why are these ones attacking you?\u201dIt felt like he\u2019s seen the situation since the upper-rank trainee fought with me. Well, annoying things kept happening when Leader Oh was involved.How do I explain this? At that time, Song Jwa-baek said,\u201cThat\u2019s because Leader Oh seems to be involved in a fight with Wonwhi. It feels like there are bad feelings between them.\u201dSong Jwa-baek looked at me and winked. Was he actually saying, \u2018Thank me for talking on your behalf?\u2019\u2026 Thank you.\u201cWho told you to answer?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s shout, Song Jwa-baek went silent. Man, this old man is really crazy.\u201cKulkul, a replacement guy? Once I get my hands on something, I need to finish the task with them.\u201dAnyway, I was curious to see how this old man would react to this. It was expected that no one could go against him. I didn\u2019t want him to know things from another source.So I told the truth.\u201cI killed two people under Leader Oh.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s eyes lit up. Even Song Jwa-baek, who didn\u2019t know this, becomes shocked. Unlike them, who were caught running away, I had killed two people before being captured.\u201cHa! Killed his subordinate?\u201d\u201cAt that time, they were wearing masks, so I had no idea. He recklessly tried to catch me, and it was self-defense.\u201dIn any case, it was self-defense. Of course, I knew they were from the Blood Cult, but it was still a defense. And I couldn\u2019t have let myself be kidnapped.-In the end, you were kidnapped.\u2018I came on my own two feet.\u2019-Right, right, you did.In any case, I killed two. I looked at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s eyes.No matter how crazy he was, I thought he would take the side of Leader Oh as he was a high-ranking member of the cult.However, this was unexpected.\u201cKuahahaha! I see that we have such stupid people? Getting hit by a kid with no internal qi? Even if they die is less punishment.\u201dHae Ack-chun seemed happy? It\u2019ll only make things weird if I tried to understand a mad man. The man laughed and said,\u201cIt is only natural for people without power to die. I. Am. Not that.\u201d-In a way, it is the same, but he speaks coldly.Short Sword clicked their tongue. But from my point of view, I could understand it.\u2018This is the essence of the Blood Cult.\u2019The Blood Cult was indeed a cult and not a sect. The reason why the Murim Alliance had come after it was because of this. But the Unorthodox Faction was colder in this regard.In that sense, Hae Ack-chun could be called a genuine Unorthodox Faction member.\u201cEuk!\u201dHae Ack-chun slapped me on the back.\u201cI wanted to know how you\u2019d deal with it, but you man have some guts. Kulkul.\u201dIt was shocking. The first compliment this man had given me.I had a strange feeling when this old man said such things. But it ended there.\u201cSo bothersome. Go down.\u201dHae Ack-chun had a stiff expression and spoke to both Leader Oh and the trainee. I didn\u2019t bring them here, nor do we get along. How did he expect me to take them down?-Just push them down the cliff. Then they will go down.\u2018\u2026 A genius.\u2019But the reality was that it could not be done. I glanced at Song Jwa-baek, who looked at me to help me.\u201cUh?\u201dSong Jwa-baek averted his face and looked down as he bit his lip.Annoying. I was going through hardships, and he wasn\u2019t even responding. Seeing how they enjoyed my misfortune, they also seemed to be learning the cult\u2019s way of life.Song Jwa-baek glared at me as I said.\u201cYou learned to climb the cliff with footwork.\u201dHearing the praise coming down from my lips, I saw his expression change.\u201cHmm. Who is better than you?\u201d\u201cRight. I acknowledge it. So I will listen.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI carried Dohyun on my back, and Song Jwa-baek\u2019s face went stiff.Just in case things happened, I wrapped the man around me before hearing Hae Ack-chun\u2019s voice.\u201cIt will be quite annoying if you get bitten by that dog. And he is at an advantage if he is tied and bites you.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t get such an opportunity ever again, okay?\u201dWhen I looked back, he was smiling.\u2018Opportunity\u2026.\u2019Just the thought felt heavy for both Song Jwa-baek, who had Leader Oh on him, and me.\u201cAren\u2019t you coming down? Brat.\u201dObviously, he learned footwork from Hae Ack-chun, so he was fast.I, too, learned a couple things from the South Heavenly Swordsman, but I was not confident enough to climb a cliff like he was doing. As I had to hide my skills, I went down slowly.\u201cHahaha, you are slow.\u201dAs soon as I arrived at the bottom, Song Jwa-baek laughed while looking at me.Right, laugh now. Because I will learn footwork in the future.\u201cI think we should put them down.\u201dTak!I loosened the strap that wraps around my body and lowered Dohyun.And when I looked at Song Jwa-baek, he was holding onto the right leg of Leader Oh, who he put on the floor. It looked like he was going to break his leg.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSong Jwa-baek smiled.\u201cTo help you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDid you forget what the crazy old man said? That there will be no other opportunity. You said it too. He wanted to show the anger off. You must too.\u201dThe former was not the purpose. The latter is. It had accumulated too much within me.\u201cHe will not recover until his leg heals.\u201dIt was meant to be bait. And I shook my head.\u201cYah. We have the blood parasite, so if we want to survive, we need to act like them. If you don\u2019t have a poisoned heart, it is done.\u201d-He, too, changed a lot.As Short Sword said, Song Jwa-baek had gone through a hard time, but his attitude had also changed.\u201cIf you cannot do it, I will.\u201dTatatak!Song Jwa-baek touched Leader Oh\u2019s blood vessels. He\u2019s learned a lot.It seems that the reason for touching it was to prevent breaking it too severely. I said to him,\u201cYah.\u201d\u201cIf you are too weak to do it, I will.\u201d\u201cNo, I think you misunderstood something.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou think that crazy old man wanted us to break his leg?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019His expression went stiff at my words as realization dawned on him.\u201cNo\u2026 to kill him?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t enough to cripple one leg. I was a spy in my previous life, after all.A person with such an obsession didn\u2019t change with a bit of punishment. Perhaps if the legs were crippled, he would just be angrier and try to kill me.\u201cKill?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know this, so he was confused. It felt like killing is too tough for Song Jwa-baek. It was less troublesome, and I told him myself.\u201cYou want to help me? Kill him.\u201d\u201cWhat? Ki-kill him?\u201d\u201cAre you feeling weak?\u201dSong Jwa-baek frowned and couldn\u2019t answer. I think this was enough.He had never had blood on his hands. But I was different. To be honest, I had a lot of blood on my hands as I did everything dirty to survive.\u201cMove. If you cannot do it, I will do it.\u201dI returned the words straight to him.Hae Ack-chun had planted the idea, and it\u2019s probably the right choice to kill him. Then I heard\u2026\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dShit! He didn\u2019t seal the blood points correctly, so Leader Oh was waking up.\u201cDamn it!Song Jwa-baek hurriedly tried to break the leg, but the opponent was a first-rate warrior.Leader Oh kicked Song Jwa-baek in the ribs.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dIt must have been very painful to be hit, but Song Jwa-baek endured it and twisted the leg in the opposite direction.Clench!\u201cOuch! You bastard!\u201dLeader Oh became angry and hit him in the chest again. Song Jwa-baek\u2019s body bounced back almost ten feet this time!Tatak!I ran behind and tried to stab Leader Oh in the head with my short sword.And Leader Oh rolled to the left.The lazy donkey roll. Surviving was more important than the pride of a first-rate warrior.Phat!He threw the dagger in his right hand, and I caught it with my left.-Right! That is it!This was the trick I learned from Short Sword. A dagger technique that used both hands freely, and although I only learned it recently, it was successful in practice.Holding the dagger with my left hand, I tried to stab him again.\u201cKuak! You!\u201dPak!He grabbed the dagger with both hands. Man, he was skilled.Although this was not a favorable situation, he responded well.Tak!To kill him, I did the best I could as he spoke in a sneering voice.\u201cDo you think a bastard with no internal qi like you can stab me?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong. His qi was so much greater that I couldn\u2019t handle it.He was even trying to turn the short sword\u2019s blade towards me.\u2018Tch. You are nothing.\u2019There was no way my strength could be hidden. I began to use the Xing Ming cultivation, and as I did, the blade stopped turning towards me.Leader Oh was shocked when I could stop him.\u201cW-who are you?\u201dHe was surprised, but I was having a hard time too. It was difficult to withstand his strength.\u201cUhhh.\u201dAnd with his life at stake, he held onto the short sword. It felt like my stomach was doing rounds at this moment.It was then.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dSong Jwa-baek, who ran in like a bull, smashed the head of Leader Oh with a kick loaded with internal qi.Crash!\u201cKuak!\u201dAs his head was being crushed, he lost the strength in his hands.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe short sword pierced Leader Oh\u2019s chest. The guy opened his mouth in shock. The kick also damaged him enough to the point where blood dripped down his face.The top of Leader Oh\u2019s head looked quite wounded.\u201cKuak!\u201dSong Jwa-baek held on to his hurt side.\u201cFuck\u2026..\u201dI was exhausted too, so I tried to get back up. Now we have to deal with the corpse. I looked at Song Jwa-baek and said,\u201cIt has to be your first kill, huh?\u201dIt had to be his first murder because I could see it from his kick.\u201cDon\u2019t act up. Bastard. You owe me your life.\u201dI smiled bitterly and nodded. As he said, if the fight lasted a little longer, it would not have ended well for me. A first-rate warrior. A position that was not given to just anyone. As I was trying to catch my breath, Song Jwa-baek said.\u201cWhat about our fight later?\u201dIt\u2019s like he didn\u2019t understand it till now. Or, it could be that he didn\u2019t think of saying it out loud.\u201cIt is unfortunate, but I will win. That is how I can become a disciple of that crazy old man.\u201dHae Ack-chun made a suggestion to me. He would abandon me if I failed and teach me if I did well. And seeing Song Jwa-baek, they too seemed to be getting something out of this.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cIt is natural. You think you can even grab my hair if you and I are together?\u201dConfidence.Did he not see things after he got beaten? He didn\u2019t understand my skills at all.Right, and I told him.\u201cShould we make a bet?\u201d\u201cBet?\u201dHe frowned, and I smiled as I looked at him and said.\u201cThe one who loses is the servant to the one who wins. What about it?\u201dThe notorious Black and White Twin swords will become my subordinates.And I am already craving it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Showdown (1)Published onJul 18, 2022\u20229 min read\u20223512 viewsLate at night\u2026At the cave where Hae Ack-chun lived, he asked Song Jwa-baek, who had come back late after taking Leader Oh down the mountain.\u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d\u201cI came up first since I know footwork technique, and he was left behind. He\u2019ll be back.\u201dHae Ack-chun nodded at those words. This was expected. Although he did pass down the know-hows, there was no way So Wonhwi, who never learned internal qi, could even catch up to Song Jwa-baek.\u201cIrregular breathing because of an internal wound. Kulkul.\u201d\u2018You ghostly old bastard.\u2019He tried to not show it as much as possible, but when Hae Ack-chun still figured it out, Song Jwa-baek clicked his tongue.\u201cTake off your shirt.\u201dResist and get beaten is the hidden message. So he took the shirt off. The marks on his torso had only gotten bigger over time. A blue bruise formed on his stomach, and a large one of the same color on the ribs.Hae Ack-chun looked him straight in the eye and asked.\u201cWho killed?\u201dHe asked as if he was sure death was involved.\u2018\u2026 damn it. I guess that jerk was right.\u2019Song Jwa-baek was cursing the man for not making his initial intentions clear. Still, his own move was what decided the life of Leader Oh.Even if the dagger hadn\u2019t pierced through his chest, the man would have collapsed and died from his kick.\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cRight. Okay. You have the final blow.\u201d\u201c\u2026!?\u201dHearing these words, it felt like Hae Ack-chun knew that the two worked together to kill Leader Oh, and he clicked his tongue.\u201cFrom the level of internal wounds, he is a first-rate warrior. If he could deal with you alone at your level, do you think you would have come out with just this level of injuries? Stupid. Tch.\u201dBut despite saying all this, Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t look angry. He was pushing their limits by training them, but he was satisfied with their progress in just three months.\u2018He must be a mess too.\u2019Hae Ack-chun was known to be eccentric. After a while, So Wonhwi appeared, and his expression became stiff.Song Jwa-baek felt like he was being made to sit on thorns.\u201cI mainly dealt with the man. He was just using his short sword on the guy with a broken leg, so he is fine.\u201dHe made excuses to explain why Wonwhi looked fine. But what should have happened was happening.\u201cIn the future, train more.\u201d\u2018D-Damn it!\u2019Song Jwa-baek glared at Wonhwi. And Wonhwi turned his face away to avoid the gaze. Seeing this, Son Jwa-baek\u2019s glare only intensified.\u2018I need to win.\u2019He swore on this promise.Finally, the day when Hae Ack-chun would make them fight was announced. It was in exactly three months.It was probably around this time that the twins decided that they had to defeat me. As much as the monster old man taught me, I can\u2019t be careless, so I was training myself to death.Meanwhile, commander Gu Sang-woong came around to inquire about the whereabouts of Leader Oh. He went down quickly after a roar from Hae Ack-chun.I wondered if he would find Leader Oh, but after that shout, I doubted the man would come back up to search again.Even if a leader-level person died in the hands of Hae Ack-chun, no one would talk. This was good news for me.Now I could focus on my training without worrying about anything.Sak! Sak!The sound of a sword being swung echoed through the cave. For more than one month, the same thing repeated.\u2018When will you teach me a technique?\u2019South Heavenly Iron Sword answered my question.-There is no technique until your body masters these movements.Until now, I didn\u2019t learn a single technique. For over a month, all I did was repeat the same basic movement.-My former master said that the technique will only look like a sword dance if the basic moves don\u2019t come out naturally.This was true, but I became even more curious about the technique.Although Hae Ack-chun showed me a few demonstrations illustrating the transition, I still couldn\u2019t quite learn it.And I wanted to learn the technique the iron sword told me about.-It isn\u2019t too late to check all of the 8 basic forms.\u2018Kuak.\u2019But this sword was one hell of a pervert that liked being touched. Looking at him, I could guess how the South Heavenly Swordsman must have been. Perhaps, he was a stubborn and inflexible master.He trained himself to death and managed to leave his name in the world. It made me wonder.Who defeated such a man and left him with such a bitter end?-I don\u2019t know.\u2018Don\u2019t know? Not even the name?\u2019-My former master had a reputation for being the best. He was challenged every day.\u2018And he dealt with all of them?\u2019-It isn\u2019t like that. At least, he would accept the ones worthy enough to fight with.\u2018He was like that too with his last challenger?\u2019-No\u2018Uh?\u2019-My master was nervous after receiving that challenge.This was shocking.A challenge to the South Heavenly Swordsman that left the man nervous must have come from someone that is second to none?-The nameless challenge only contained a place and time of the challenge and a flower with its stem cut in half.\u2018A flower stem?\u2019-My former master, who saw it, went to the promised place despite not knowing the person.\u2018Ha\u2026.\u2019I\u2019ve heard of such things. The better a swordsmanship was, the more powerful the stabs and cuts from the sword.-My master lost in just 40 seconds.\u2018What?\u2019That was an unbelievable time. It was incredible that one known to be one of the best in the world had gone and lost in just 40 seconds.\u2018By any chance\u2026 did someone of the Eight Great Warriors or Four Great Evils come?\u2019This felt the most likely. Maybe they had come to take down a man who would threaten their position in the future?In any case, there was a higher chance that it was one of the Four Great Evils.-He was too young for my master.\u2018Young?\u2019-I don\u2019t know the standards for humans, but when I saw him, he looked to be someone in his 20s.\u201820s?\u2019The South Heavenly Swordsman became famous in his late 30s. How could a man in his 20s defeat such a man?Then, wasn\u2019t Iron sword saying that the even Ghastly Monster Hae Ack-chun would be no match to him?-The land is vast. There are many warriors. No one can guarantee that they know all the strong ones.Despite talking about someone who drove his master to their death, the iron sword kept his calm. Was it because he lost in a fair match?\u2018So you don\u2019t know till the end? Do you think you can speak about it?\u2019Maybe a hint about him being a famous man now. Since I know the future 10 years from now, I might be able to know the man\u2019s identity.Staying silent, the iron sword recalled.-There was nothing unique. He looked normal, like someone you would see on the road. However, there was one unique thing.\u2018What?\u2019-The color of his eyes was different. I saw it when he was fighting my master. One of the eyes was gold.\u2018Um\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never heard about anyone with a golden eye.\u2019Two of the Eight Great Warriors changed in the future, but neither has a golden eye. So who?-Wonhwi.\u2018Huh?\u2019-There is an important lesson here.\u2018Lesson?\u2019-Even my former master, who didn\u2019t neglect his training, was killed by an unknown man. Do you have time to chat now?\u2018\u2026\u2019Right, I was at fault.For some reason, after he began talking with Short Sword, the Iron sword was talking a lot more. But unlike Short Sword, he didn\u2019t joke around.Trees on the mountain peak were showing their bare branches. The red and yellow mountain turned white as the snow began to fall.This was peak winter.6 months had gone by.Chachachacha!Light sounds resounded throughout the cave. The trajectory of the sword was split in all directions.The technique being shown now is the Tiger Tooth Sword. It was a technique that subdued the opponent using fierce momentum.I could use the technique because I am using the iron sword. When using the last form, South Heavenly Iron Sword said.-Connect this technique with the past form.This technique was known as the Hidden Clam Sword. It created an explosive force and countered the opponent\u2019s attack while at the same time reversing the opponent\u2019s strength.-3rd one.As he kept speaking, I continued to flow into the following technique.Unlike the previous ones, the sword changed to soft movements, like a willow branch. Like a loach-shaped sword. It was soft like a fish and dazzled the opponent with unexpected soft movements.\u201cPhew,\u201dAfter finishing the three techniques, I exhaled.-Now it seems good.I shrugged at the Short Sword\u2019s words, but Iron Sword evaluated it calmly.-Still a long way off. In the middle, your force shakes a little. And your current level is just half of my former master\u2019s.My proud shoulders drooped down. Maybe because he was acting like my mentor, his words had more impact on me.-Still, the growth is impressive in just three months. You\u2019ve done well.And I smiled at those compliments. When it came to martial arts, he was amazing, so I trusted him a lot.-Me?\u2018\u2026 uh. You too.\u2019-Don\u2019t answer in such an emotionless way. Trash So Wonhwi.\u2018\u2026!\u2019This bastard cursed people by attaching trash in front of their name. How abusive can swords be?-What did you say!Short Sword yelled.\u2018Enough. Can I really win with these three techniques?\u2019Normally a total of 7 are learned. As with most swordsmanship, the more we knew, the better it was.Techniques were used to connect and execute in sequence. I think that I would be at a disadvantage since I haven\u2019t finished learning all of them.-Don\u2019t worry. I was just saying that you weren\u2019t at the level of the previous master. But seeing the sword technique, you are close to perfection. It is better to focus on three and perfect them than learn all in a hurry.I was nervous but decided to trust him, so I tried to learn just the three.-Take care Wonhwi.-Take care!\u2018Right!\u2019The preparation was done.Now I was at the peak. The sun was in the middle of the sky as noon approached.The time for confrontation had come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Showdown (2)Published onJul 19, 2022\u20228 min read\u20222391 views\u201cPhew.\u201dThe air was cold to breathe.Clench!When I reached the top of the mountain peak and stepped on the snow-covered ground, it reached up to my ankles.A battle on snowy peaks under the sky. It sounded glamorous in words, but I can\u2019t feel it.There was Hae Ack-chun with his giant arms crossed together. Standing beside him were the twins. The atmosphere felt heavy.Like me, they were committed too.-Don\u2019t this seem a bit similar?As Short Sword said, in just 3 months, Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun had grown considerably. As a result, they couldn\u2019t even be arrogant, unlike before.Compared to Hae Ack-chun, they were still small, but they were bigger than me. The twins were now easy to tell apart.-He looks fine today\u2026.The person Short Sword referred to was the younger twin, Song Woo-hyun. The way his smooth head reflected the sunlight was dazzling.It\u2019s shocking how his hair loss led to such a dazzling bald head. But thanks to that, he gave off a stronger impression.Clench!I stepped into the snow and walked to them.\u201cKulkul, are you ready to lose?\u201dAs soon as he saw me, he asked me this. But I wasn\u2019t going to fall for this shallow provocation.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we fight to know?\u201dI harbored no thoughts of falling for their cheap words. Then Song Jwa-baek said.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just surrender now and call me master?\u201d\u201cYou seem confident?\u201d\u201cOf course. Because you and I are different.\u201dBeing confident meant being sure of victory. Right? At that time, Hae Ack-chun hits Song Jwa-baek on the back of his head.Pak!\u201cHuh! Who gave you the right to talk about surrender? This fight will have to go till the end.\u201dSong Jwa-baek frowns.Well, we didn\u2019t know the real purpose of this confrontation, so this was to be expected. For Hae Ack-chun, this confrontation was like a way to avenge the humiliation of his past.He wanted his next-generation disciple to defeat the might of his enemy\u2026-He is trying to win mentally.Look at his witty conclusion. Well, in the end, it was true.Whatever the past was, he wanted to surpass his opponent, the South Heavenly Swordsman, who outmatched him.-No, stay quiet, Short Sword. If the fighting spirit dies, he cannot fight.-Shh.At South Heavenly Iron Sword\u2019s words, Short Sword grumbled. But she knew the importance of the confrontation, so she stopped.\u201cWho will I fight again?\u201dI knew that I had to compete with one of the twins first. But fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to take on both of them at the same time.Song Jwa-baek stepped up.\u201cIt is me.\u201dI thought so. Song Woo-hyun, the younger twin, didn\u2019t fit the concept of the fight as he was still a bit immature.Of course, a typical opponent would be intimidated by his current appearance.\u201cElder. Will you keep your promise?\u201d\u201cKulkul, that happens only when you win.\u201dI never thought that I would lose.As he continued to show a confident expression, I slowly became nervous.\u2018Because he isn\u2019t the kind of person to brag.\u2019I had to be careful. Song Jwa-baek and I looked at each other as the other two moved back.Then Hae Ack-chun shouted.\u201cStart!\u201dSong Jwa-baek took a stance. As he approached me with extended arms, I could see the iron wrist guards on him.It seems like they weren\u2019t there just for protection. He then looked at me and said.\u201cYou use a sword, so I cannot come bare-handed, right?\u201d\u201cYou are right. I am holding a rusty iron sword. Yours looks pretty good.\u201d-Rusty sword\u2026-Quiet. You\u2019re hindering him.-\u2026Iron Sword tried to speak back until the short sword made him go silent. I then smiled at Song Jwa-baek.\u201cThis is nothing. Elder said he used them when he was young.\u201d\u201cYoung?\u201dSo these weren\u2019t normal things.Where was the fairness if you were going to provide things? The only thing that the old man taught me was throwing books at me and telling me to learn from them.Well, what did I expect from a man who stole the technique of others?Chuk!Regardless, I pulled out the South Heavenly Iron Sword and took my stance. The opponent was ready too.I heard that his martial art was called the Black Iron Fist and was known to enhance the fist\u2019s power and develop strength in the body.Of course, this was what Hae Ack-chun considered fairness.\u2018If that is the case, I can also consider it.\u2019Actually, I could just dismantle the technique. Song Jwa-baek and I looked at each other. No change in the stance, both of us were ready to act.It was then.\u201cI come first!\u201dPhat!The snow moved as Song Jwa-baek ran like a wild horse.The force at which he was coming wasn\u2019t normal. If he rushed in like that, I needed to ensure the distance.Swosh!I skilfully thrust my sword towards his forehead. At that moment, Song Jwa-baek crossed his hands and blocked the sword with his iron wrist guard.Chang!\u201cHuh!\u201dAs the tip of the sword trembled, my body got pushed back.Tatak!Surprised by my attack, the guy didn\u2019t give me another chance and began to attack.\u201cHaaa!\u201dI swung my sword to defend myself and not stab him this time, and each time I blocked, I got pushed away.\u2018It makes his fist like iron.\u2019This was not an ordinary wrist guard, and his strength was different from what I saw 3 months ago. If he had become this strong, I could be suspicious of him.\u201cDid you take any pills?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dSong Jwa-baek denied it, though his eyes trembled a little. The kind of guy who could not lie.Chachacha!He attacks more fiercely than before.-Wonhwi! Keep your distance. At this level, he is close to being a first-rate warrior in terms of internal qi.Iron Sword, who was feeling this, tells me.\u2019First-rate?How good was the pill for him to be considered a first-rate warrior? It had to have given him around 20 years\u2019 worth of internal qi.\u2018Tch. I need to move.\u2019Phat!I followed Iron Sword\u2019s advice and widened the distance. The more space I made, the more I tried not to fall behind and track his movements.\u2018Kuak!\u2019His footwork was superior to mine, making it difficult to catch up. Each time I tried to follow him, I almost fell down. It looked like Hae Ack-chun had properly taught the twins.\u2018Ah!\u2019At that moment, his fist was coming to pierce me in the chest, making me lean back. I then made some space to widen the distance again.\u201cHa!\u201dSurprisingly, Song Jwa-baek didn\u2019t predict this. This wasn\u2019t something I learned but rather an improvisation in crisis.\u201cYou are flexible!\u201dI was slightly surprised when he praised me.And now the fist came right for the face.Chang!I blocked it again with Iron Sword, but my body was being pushed back.\u201cI won\u2019t miss this!\u201dSong Jwa-baek tried to close the distance again.\u2018I am annoyed.\u2019Iron sword mumbled.-This is the basic tactic one uses when going against a sword with fists. Of course, there is more of an effect he has since he knows most of your sword technique.This made me realize just how much Hae Ack-chun had studied the stolen technique. It would be no exaggeration that these fist techniques were born from the bitter memories of the old man.So he must have read the book and polished his technique over the years.\u201cKilkil.\u201dIt seems like pushing me was fun. At least his smiling lips told me that.\u201cHow long will you dodge and defend? Why don\u2019t you try some techniques?\u201dHe was provoking me.Maybe he knew how to counter my movement. If not, he wouldn\u2019t say this.\u201cOkay?\u201dMy hands were ready to unfold the sword technique, and he smiled.\u201cWait!\u201dHe came in like a bullet, and it felt like dozens of fists were coming toward me.Chahcahchang!I quickly blocked the guy\u2019s fist with the side of my iron sword. My form then began to get pushed back again.\u201cBe ready to call me master!\u201dHe was shouting in joy already.\u201cWake up from the dream.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen my body was pushed back, I bent backward and jumped ahead.\u201cUgh!\u201dIt was the Hidden Clam Sword. A counterattack technique for explosive attacks.When the swordsman, who was supposed to be almost dead, rushed for him, Song Jwa-baek took a defensive stance.Chachachang!\u201cKuak! W-what is this?\u201dHe was visibly shocked. Well, this was expected.This was different from what the technique Hae Ack-chun must have taught him. And this wasn\u2019t the Xing Ming sword technique, either.\u201cHik!\u201dThe opponent blocked my offensive and tried to use a technique. He rotated like a top and tried to push me back with his stronger hand.But I expected this.\u2018If you come at me with force.\u2019I utilized the third technique I learned, left myself to the flow, moved like a loach, and swung my sword.\u201cKuak!\u201dSong Jwa-baek was startled by my curving attack as my iron sword approached him gently rather than speedily to pierce through his chest unerringly. In his panic, he made space between us.\u201cDamn it!\u201dTatatak!I tried to widen the distance again instead of chasing him.\u201cAre you going to keep running away?\u201dBut despite my provocation, he didn\u2019t stop. His eyes were looking elsewhere. It was the direction where Hae Ack-chun was standing.\u2018Oh my,\u2019Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t look normal. His expression clearly showed that he was shocked at how I managed to cover the shortcomings in the technique he showed me.How would he look if I turned the tables then?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Showdown (3)Published onJul 20, 2022\u202214 min read\u20222051 viewsHae Ack-chun had a puzzled expression. He, too, didn\u2019t seem to expect that I could do this.Well, I, too, had a hidden card to use.-Look at that face. Seems like he\u2019s scared.As the short sword said. He seemed surprised, and then his face went stiff. It\u2019s almost like trying to catch the opponent by the throat.-Did it work out the way you thought it would?Well. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll get in trouble. What happened 3 months ago flashed through my mind.Early morning, 3 months prior.Chak! Chak!In front of my eyes, Hae Ack-chun showed off the swordsmanship technique in one of the books. They were one of the seven written down by the South Heavenly Swordsman.Considering Hae-Ack chun\u2019s martial arts focused on the fist, I never imagined that he could use the sword that amazingly.-This means that he analyzed the book thoroughly.Short Sword was right.Without a lot of analysis, there was no way he could have shown it to me so skillfully.He is undoubtedly great. To defeat his opponent, he even stole their martial arts and learned them.\u2018\u2026 he is quite good at it.\u2019\u2018This is a sword technique. You can understand it even with your eyes closed. Kulkul, it will be good for you to see this technique clearly. I will show this to you for exactly 3 days.\u2019\u2018Uh? 3 days?\u2019\u2018I will show it to you the entire time.\u2019\u2018\u2026\u2019Crazy old man.He showed off the sword technique for 3 whole days. But it was still helpful to see it, especially the parts in the book.But he expected me to see them for just 3 days and then learn it? Did he think I was some genius talent?No, that couldn\u2019t be it. I was just a means for this old man to get his revenge, and he wouldn\u2019t care more than he needed to.-Yah, be patient. It is better than being stuck without any example.Short Sword was right. Instead, it was better to take it with the twins.\u2018Then I will remember what you showed me.\u2019Hae Ack-chun went back to the cave of the South Heavenly Swordsman and left after finishing the instruction. As soon as he left, Iron Sword mumbled.-It is so uncomfortable. So irritating. I wish someone could clean me.Man, this sword liked being touched, but he hates Hae Ack-chun touching him. Short Sword smiled.-It has been a long time since I have been able to directly see a sword technique being done, so I can understand it.\u2018What?\u2019-The sword technique before completion shows so many loopholes. If he hadn\u2019t stolen the book, my former master might not have thought of changing it.On the contrary, that theft was a wake-up call for the South Heavenly Swordsman.-Trust me. This is luck. My former master did not just complete the technique but also further evolved the sword technique by changing a couple things.Hearing that, I began to think that he was reliable. Hae Ack-chun would be shocked once he saw that.He couldn\u2019t have dreamt that the man he wanted to defeat so much was also developing a much stronger technique.\u2018Hm\u2026\u2019But I suddenly thought.\u2018If I use a more advanced technique, will that crazy old man be shocked?\u2019-Ah! Right, rather, he will be suspicious!No. He would think I was suspicious.I just learned one technique, but I didn\u2019t stop there and managed to evolve it? It was possible for the ones called geniuses. But if a criminal like me showed it, it would raise doubts.It would be impossible to believe unless the dead South Heavenly Swordsman returned to life to help me.-But you lose if you don\u2019t use the completed technique. You memorized it so well that you can use it with your eyes closed. Don\u2019t you know what weaknesses it has?Short Sword pointed at it. I thought it might just be a joke, but no.And now I was in a dire situation.If I win with a modified technique, I would be questioned, and if I lose, I get the blood parasite put inside me again.-\u2026right. Then, Wonhwi, how about this?\u2018Uh?\u2019-If the extent to which the former master evolved the technique is questioned, how about showing a level enough to cover the weak points?\u2018Cover the weak points?\u2019-Right. Obviously, as you said, further evolving the technique is possible if you have talent like my former master. And it is unreasonable for you, who is just learning to hold a sword.This was right. And the South Heavenly Swordsman was really strong.-If the opponent is Hae Ack-chun, then dealing without the completed form is different, but your opponent isn\u2019t him, right?It was one of the twins.\u2018Right!\u2019Even if Haek Ack-chun learned of the gaps in the technique, the twins\u2019 level played a role in the fight. Besides, if they panicked, I could counter them.And the plan worked.Song Jwa-baek can deal with what he was taught, the imperfect technique with weak points. Now Hae Ack-chun should know it.-It is going to be hard to question. Your judgment was right in leaving some gaps when showing the technique.As Iron Sword said, I didn\u2019t use the entirety of the completed swordsmanship. For example, if the sword technique was perfect, the forms would all come out cleanly. They wouldn\u2019t be deceived by just that.\u2018Can I avoid the suspicion?\u2019-There was nothing suspicious about your move.\u2018Then I am glad. South Heavenly Iron Sword, you were right.\u2019This was why the iron sword asked me to focus on the three techniques alone. If I didn\u2019t perfectly learn those three, then I cannot deceive them.I was mastering it to deceive.\u2018You will soon find out there is more to this.\u2019I have already won.When Song Jwa-baek kept running away, the match favored my victory. It was up to that crazy old man to decide, but he won\u2019t just accept it.Because I had broken down his predictions and defeated his disciple.\u2018\u2026 Ah!\u2019But Hae Ack-chun, who had a scary face, raised his hand as he shouted.\u201cHuh! The fight is done. Stop\u2026\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t done yet!\u201dSong Jwa-bek had a dissatisfied expression as he stopped running. Hae Ack-chun\u2019s eyebrows rose at his student\u2019s words.-Wonhwi, what is he up to?Song Jwa-baek ripped off his shirt and stopped running with an odd expression on his face.Was he up to something?\u201cAhhhh!\u201dI could see the change begin to show as he clenched his muscles. His skin was darkening and began to take on a pale copper tint.\u2018What is it?\u2019-Wonhwi! That is the True Blood Gold Body of the Ghastly Monster! Widen your distance!Phat!As soon as Iron Sword warned me, Song Jwa-baek began to run for me. Originally, he was already fast with his footwork technique, but now he was even faster.\u201cThe match isn\u2019t over yet!\u201dHe was closing in fast, but it was difficult to widen the distance.\u2018Tch!\u2019It is hard to avoid.I was trying to use any technique I could to escape from him. I had to win here. I wondered if my opponent thought the same thing as he unleashed this power.Papapak!As my opponent\u2019s wrist collided with my sword, the snow at our feet flew off in all directions. The confrontation was intense.Again, I needed to aim at the gaps in the technique. But it was of no use.I used an attack that was aimed at the center of his chest. He had to avoid it. Otherwise, he would die.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019But the opponent wasn\u2019t dodging my sword.\u2018He isn\u2019t dodging?\u2019It looked like he might die, so I withdrew my sword. Withdrawing it caused a rush of qi to be left behind. Besides, I also risked getting counter-attacked.\u2018The match.\u2019This idiot was serious enough to risk his life. Then, I had no choice but to respond.One step before my sword touched him, the guy turned around.Puck!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe sword\u2019s tip didn\u2019t pierce the chest but the shoulder area instead. However, it didn\u2019t go too deep.Pak!At that moment, Song Jwa-baek grabbed Iron Sword\u2019s blade. It was shocking. This was like giving away flesh to crush the bones of the opponent.\u201cIt is my victory!\u201dHe swung his fist towards my face while continuing to hold my sword. I raised my left hand to block the fist.Crack!\u201cKuak!\u201dI blocked his fist with my bare hands, and it felt like I was hit by an iron ball. My palm was definitely broken.It hurt so much, but if I pulled back, I would lose. Both of us were holding the weapon and the hand. It was a confrontation of internal qi.\u2018Damn it!\u2019My body was being pushed aside because the qi this man had was close to a first-rate warrior.-Wonhwi!This shouldn\u2019t happen.As expected\u2026It was then.Drip!Blood flowed from the eyes and nose of Song Jwa-baek.Why was this guy bleeding from using internal qi? It was then.Pak!\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cKuak!\u201dOur entangled bodies fell as we separated. It was dangerous since we were fighting with qi, but at the same time, we managed to avoid internal wounds.The one who separated us was the old man.\u2018You crazy old man.\u2019He could have just pushed us. Why bother lifting us by the neck?The match wasn\u2019t done, so why are you doing this!Hae Ack-chun looked at Song Jwa-baek and shouted.\u201cWho told you to use it?\u201d\u201cE-elder!\u201d\u201cI said that the True Blood Gold Body isn\u2019t for your level. You foolish bastard.\u201dPak!Hae Ack-chun threw him to the other side, and he fell on his butt as he breathed roughly.\u201cHuh, huh\u2026.\u201dThe copper color skin was turning back to normal. Hae Ack-chun\u2019s face turned stiff as if wanting to say something more.And then he looked at me.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you carry out the sword technique according to the book I gave you?\u201dAgain, this question. I was afraid of being hit, but I spoke while looking straight into his eyes.\u201cI am not stupid.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI know well enough how practice is done with books.\u201dHae Ack-chun frowned.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cSo you must also know about the loopholes in the technique.\u201d\u201cHa! So you changed the technique?\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes.\u201dHae Ack-chun asked.\u201cDid someone teach that to you?\u201dHe doubted that I could do that myself.\u201cYou asked me to not speak about this to anyone, so how can I tell anyone? And who is allowed to enter this place without your permission?\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at me fiercely. He seemed to be trying to find out if I was lying or not.The first thing I learned as a spy was to never be shaken by others and to hold a calm face.Hae Ack-chun, who was staring at me, said.\u201cHuh! Well, there is a limit for you. And there are still loopholes in there.\u201dOf course, there were.I had left behind those weak points on purpose. It wasn\u2019t something I did myself, but it was advice from Iron Sword.\u201cOf course, if it is by the elder, then it will be perfect execution.\u201d\u201cPut away those sleazy words.\u201d\u201cBut you must know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cElder taught me this sword technique and made me act like a proxy.\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cThen, would the original person who left the sword technique and the elder not notice and think of the loopholes? I don\u2019t know, but wouldn\u2019t you have had the chance to develop it?\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Hearing this, his expression changed. His eyes trembled in confusion.Tak!\u201cAh?\u201dHae Ack-chun lets go of the hand holding my collar, and I land on the ground.Grunt.The sound of teeth grinding together. The old man\u2019s expression changed through myriad emotions, and, after a moment, I stepped back as he screamed.\u201cSouth Heavenlyyyyy!!!\u201dBang!With his roar, the ground around us trembled, and the snow flew up.It was a tremendous power. The snow got scattered around and disappeared. There were also cracks in the ground.\u2018What a monster.\u2019He was strong enough to make people bite their tongues. Hae Ack-chun expressed his anger as he yelled out loud. The feeling of despair on his face was clearly seen.\u201cPhew.\u201dHowever, his expression returned to normal. Hae Ack-chun looked at me and said,\u201cThis is invalid. You didn\u2019t win.\u201dHa! What is this outcome?Realizing that he could never defeat the South Heavenly Swordsman, he took his anger out on me.\u201cYou could have known if you saw it. If you had waited till the end, I would have won.\u201dOne could tell by looking at Song Jwa-baek, who was being supported by his twin.He didn\u2019t seem to be in good condition. If he tried to endure this more, his life would be in danger. Knowing that the old man had intervened.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWas he going to do this? Then even I can act like an invalid judge.\u201c\u2026 you are really drawing this out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHonestly, do you think this was a fair match?\u201d\u201cI learned every technique the old man told me, and you told your disciple about the weakness in my techniques, gave him a pill to eat, and made him strong. And even gave rare wrist guards to protect his hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHae Ack-chun didn\u2019t say anything.I kept pouring out the words which were pent up within me. If the man disagreed and tried to kill me, I would face my end here.\u201cWhat am I supposed to do in this situation? Do you mean that you won\u2019t admit I won because you designed it so I would lose? A plan to kill me? Am I one of the elder\u2019s punching bags?\u201dHis face was turning red. It felt like his head was about to explode. It didn\u2019t matter. I was prepared to die too.\u201cIf it was fair, do you think he could have been my opponent? At least even if you didn\u2019t give the pill, the match would have\u2026\u201dIt was then.\u201cKuahahahah!\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s face was red, but then he burst into laughter. For a moment, I thought he had become so angry that he began to lose his mind.But he smiled and then looked at Song Jwa-baek.\u201cDid I give you a pill?\u201dAnd the man who looked like he was dying on the ground said.\u201c\u2026 was it those little pills we were eating every evening?\u201d\u201cKuahaha! And that is a pill? Stupid idiot. If I had so many pills, why would I give them to you?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dNot just Song Jwa-baek, even I couldn\u2019t understand it. The old man laughed to the point of tears and said.\u201cWhy do you think I have passed down my martial arts to people like you when I haven\u2019t done this to my own descendants?\u201d\u201c\u2026.?\u201d\u201cIt is because those idiots have the natural body to learn it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThose idiots have faster blood circulation within their body compared to others. The thing is, it helps build up internal qi quickly from the start.\u201dAt that, Song Jwa-baek became puzzled.\u201cUh? T-then what about the\u2026\u201d\u201cUntil the True Blood Gold Body is perfected, the fast-flowing blood is poison. Therefore, before they can master it, they have to learn to control it. Otherwise, they will live short lives.\u201dI didn\u2019t think something like this would happen.I thought they were being given a pill, but I didn\u2019t realize they had special bodies. Hae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.\u201cAnd weapon? Are you talking about this despite having that sword in your hand?\u201d\u201cIt is rusted\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt is just rusted. That iron sword is better than any other sword as it is made with cold iron.\u201d-Hmm\u2026 he is right.Iron Sword said in a calm voice. For some reason, I felt angry when I heard Song Jwa-baek was given something.\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t win over the wrist guard despite that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven if the two issues were ignored, it didn\u2019t change that I have been at a disadvantage. However, unexpected words came out.\u201cWell, it is true that you were at a disadvantage. Kulkul.\u201dFor a moment, I doubted my ears. This man admitted it?\u201cLike you, you cheeky bastard said, this match is made for a win for my side in the first place. You are just a punching bag to test things out.\u201dHe was saying it. Am I wrong in speaking out?\u201cNevertheless, he boldly went against me and almost won.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just winning. I won it. Hae Ack-chun smiled.\u201cThe contract is canceled.\u201dMan, he was an idiot till the end. My six months of hard work felt exhausting.\u201c\u2026 in the end, I was a disposable piece.\u201d\u201cI will collect that disposable piece as a disciple of mine.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019What did this crazy man just say?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Showdown (4)Published onJul 21, 2022\u20229 min read\u20221843 views\u2018Disciple?\u2019I was speechless for a moment at the words I heard. This was unexpected.All I wanted was for this old man to keep his promise. I didn\u2019t know that he would suddenly say such things.-It has to be a trap. I cannot believe this old man.-I agree with you too. Wonhwi.Short Sword and Iron Sword had seen the old man all this time. All three of us agreed on this. To be honest, it felt like he was up to something.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me? Do you want to die as a disposable piece? Shouldn\u2019t you be bowing down if I said I will take you in as a disciple?\u201dHae Ack-chun made a frowning expression. Could I believe him?\u201cThis is too sudden\u2026\u201dI was not the only one thinking this way. Even Song Jwa-baek was clearly thinking the same, considering his puzzled expression.It was a face that said, \u2018Why are you talking about him so suddenly?\u2019.Hae Ack-chun continued to look at me and smiled.\u201cIt is a waste to dispose of a healthy horse like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That is an exaggeration.\u201dWas he complimenting me? There was a part of me that wanted to believe this.\u201cThere are things called excellent qualities. If you teach them one thing, they understand more independently.\u201d\u201cI am not that good.\u201d\u201cThrow that humility away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI only showed it to you four times, and you were able to learn the other things on your own?\u201dYou taught me just four times while knowing no one could salvage it? If I couldn\u2019t hear the voices of the swords, I would be dead by now.-Hm.\u201cWell, if that is the only case, I wouldn\u2019t take you in as a disciple. But you have the eyes that can see the truth of a sword technique. That kind of talent\u2026 hmm, no. anyway, I have decided to take you in as a disciple.\u201dNow, this, I expected. Finding loopholes in techniques was a highly appreciated skill.Though this wasn\u2019t something I discovered myself, but something the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s sword told me.And if I could analyze the old man, I could grow into the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s level.-The result is beyond our intention.Short sword said it. I was being considered as if I had great talent. And this hurt my conscience.-That is also your talent, Wonhwi.\u2018Uh?\u2019-Who in the world can listen to us? To swords?His words made me feel better. Maybe it was a talent to compensate for this unhappy life of mine. Of course, it seemed like everything was still impossible to see even now.-But it is Wonhwi. Didn\u2019t that old man come out as crazy? But he still has a high position in the Blood Cult, right?He was one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, the absolute power in the Blood Cult.-Then, if you become his disciple, we can reach the goal faster even if it calls for handling this man a little.\u2018I didn\u2019t think of that.\u2019-You can use the old man.But the problem was elsewhere.Even if it was my talent to figure out the loopholes in the sword techniques, there was a downside to covering it up.And without that talent, I\u2019m not sure if this man would really want me as his disciple, and there was a chance of me being disposed of after being used once or twice.-Then, let\u2019s think about it.\u2018Let\u2019s do that.\u2019\u201cBut Elder. Your martial arts, the\u2026\u201d\u201cTrue Blood Gold Body.\u201d\u201cYes. Didn\u2019t you say that only people with special bodies who have high blood circulation like those twins are the only ones who can learn it?\u201d-Ah, right!Unlike the twins, I was an average person. He did say he would take me, but it was unreasonable for me to learn the same thing.\u201cKulkuk, I will not teach you that.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYou need to be grateful to me.\u201d\u201cWhat is that suppo\u2026\u201d\u201cThe sword technique you learned is that of the South Heavenly Swordsman, who was once called the ruler of Yunnan.\u201dIt was surprising.I didn\u2019t think he would speak of this due to his pride. Did he get some kind of enlightenment from my back talk? I just pretended to be shocked.\u201cI-Is that true? That skeleton was the South Heavenly Swordsman?\u201d\u201cRight. The remains of the missing man.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cKulkul, how can someone who just began to learn martial arts know that?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI sighed and tried to look like I was deeply moved by being allowed to learn this technique.-Wow\u2026 you, I have been thinking for a while, but man, you excel in acting.Short Sword clicks her tongue.I lived 8 years with this acting. If I could not act this well, I couldn\u2019t have survived as a spy. Hae Ack-chun, who watched my reaction, smiled.\u201cI was the rival of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201d-Liar!Iron Sword shouted.Don\u2019t get riled up.When you shout like that, it is my head that hurts.\u201cYou must have seen him. He suffered a mysterious death. Unfortunately, he had no family, so I was the first person to find his remains.\u201dI did hear that from Iron Sword. It was said that he had no close people around him, so no one searched for him.Such a cunning man this opponent was.The only one who found him was Hae Ack-chun, who had been anxious to defeat him.\u201cWhich is why I know that man much better than anyone.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt means I can teach you the perfect sword technique. Kulkul.\u201dSorry, but I was already learning a better technique. There was nothing I could learn from you.\u201cAnd don\u2019t you want to revive your broken dantian?\u201d\u2018Ah!\u2019It was the second time this had been used.I learned I could use the innate internal qi thanks to the perfect cultivation, but Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t know this.From his point of view, I must be consuming my qi without replenishing it, but I still couldn\u2019t understand why he wanted me as a disciple.But asking that would be wrong\u2026\u2018He must be being honest!\u2019It seemed like he really wanted to take me as his disciple. I no longer needed the dantian, but I felt happy knowing that the old man genuinely wanted me.Still, he was such a crazy man that I must be suspicious of him.But if he was being serious\u2026Pak!I fell to my knees in a hurry and bowed.\u201cDisciple So Wonhwi, bow to my mentor!\u201dI never did get a chance to be anyone\u2019s disciple, especially a higher member of the cult.From my point of view, as someone who had no ties to the Blood Cult, I could have a greater advantage if I had this man on my side.-\u2026 respect the position. Wonhwi.Iron Sword said.I understood his feelings. Becoming the disciple of his former master\u2019s rival wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u2018Hold on for a while cause one day, this will turn.\u2019I had no intention of taking him as my mentor. He was just a stepping stone.-I know. I will do my best too. So that you can get strong quickly.He agreed. I was still bowing when I heard the laughter.\u201cKukukuku!\u201dHae Ack-chun was laughing loudly. And the laughter was a bit too loud, considering he just got one new disciple under him.I glanced at him; he was laughing while looking at the sky.\u201cKuahahah! You are amazing. Someone not much different from my rival. Hahaha. You are now my disciple. It is a victory for me!\u201d\u2018\u2026 Ha.\u2019This was his real intention. He was such an annoying man.-This is a true mental victory.-Wonhwi\u2026 I take back what I said. I am not going to help you if you go under him.Crazy old man.He was changing good things for me. I was sweating, trying to appease him. After a while, he stopped and said.\u201cGet up.\u201dI lifted my head up and got up.\u201cKulkul, as long as you become my disciple, you must be prepared to become strong enough to not bring shame onto me.\u201d\u201cI will keep that in mind. Teacher.\u201dIt was already terrifying. I had been watching him for 6 months, so how could I not know him?And then came a weak voice.\u201c\u2026 Elder.\u201dIt was Song Jwa-baek, the older of the twins.As the aftereffects had subsided, the boy was looking better than before. He seemed sad as he saw how I had been taken in as a disciple.I frowned while looking at him.\u2018No.\u2019The boy looked puzzled, and Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cN-No, it isn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh. I am not a fan of this, but I will accept both of you as disciples.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSong Jwa-baek\u2019s eyes widened. And even his younger twin seemed shocked.\u201cI didn\u2019t win the match\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you have a lot of courage.\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at Song Jwa-baek, and although he criticized him for being over-excited, he seemed to appreciate the desire to win to the point of self-sacrifice.\u201cWill you continue to stand still?\u201dWhen I smiled and nodded, Song Jwa-baek bowed.\u201cWhat are you doing? Follow me.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026. Ah. Yes.\u201dSong Woo-hyun followed him to his knees and shouted.\u201cLong Live the Blood Cult! Song Jwa-baek bows to his teacher.\u201d\u201cLong live the Blood Cult! Song Jwa-baek\u2026\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019\u201cNo. You should say your name!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cNot Ah.\u201dHe was suffering for his brother.\u201cDisciple Song Woo-hyun bows to his teacher.\u201dAlthough there were mistakes, the twins pledged their loyalty to their new teacher.\u201cKulkul.\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at them with a satisfied expression. Regardless of the match\u2019s outcome, I knew this old man would take the twins as his disciple.It was natural for him to bring in the two who meet the special conditions of a body that was required to learn his martial arts.\u201cGet up!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSong Jwa-baek was full of smiles. And to him, I said.\u201cCongratulations, sajae (Junior Disciple).\u201dAnd the smiling face distorted.Well, I indeed became a disciple before him. We should be following the hierarchy, right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - God Of Ten Thousand Deaths (1)Published onJul 25, 2022\u202210 min read\u20223276 viewsThe day I became the disciple of Ghastly Monster, I had a drink after a long time.Hae Ack-chun was excited after getting a disciple for the first time, so we all went down to the bottom of the mountain and brought the alcohol. He threatened that he wouldn\u2019t let us sleep until we emptied it all.But Hae Ack-chun was weaker than I thought. He didn\u2019t even drink a couple glasses, and he already looked like he was down and out.And he would recount the past days of his youth, shed tears, and talk about meeting women he longed for.Usually, skilled people could control poison in their bodies. But this old man said that alcohol was meant for one to get drunk on and that he wouldn\u2019t use his internal qi to remove the effect.This felt like having drinks with a squad leader. Occasionally, funny things would come up. But that was a trap.\u201cPuah!\u201d\u201cYou smiled?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Song Jwa-baek, who burst into laughter, was punched on the spot.Maybe that made him come to his senses. The bruise on his eyes and the nervous way he drank the alcohol proved it. Everyone was a long way from being normal in front of this man.I was so hungover the following day that I couldn\u2019t do anything. I realized I couldn\u2019t do anything, so I decided to sharpen the blade of Iron Sword to soothe its mood.-Shhh!The rusted parts would have to be worked on by a blacksmith, but it wasn\u2019t too difficult to sharpen the blade.-Ah, right there\u2026At first, he acted all moody, but now he seemed to be liking it. I wanted to tell him to shut up, but for the sake of the cause, I decided to let him enjoy it.-Haaa, soo good\u2026Clench!-Kuak!Ah, sorry.My hand clenched on its own. However, the blade wasn\u2019t damaged at all.\u201cWhat are you doing right from the morning?\u201dI turned my head at the sound of a voice next to me. It was Song Jwa-baek, whose face was still swollen from emptying the drinks last night.One eye was also still black.\u201cWhy are you speaking without honorifics? Especially to your sahyung?\u201dAt my words, he shouted.\u201cYah! What sahyung? The only difference is the number of times we bowed.\u201dYesterday, Hae Ack-chun was in front of us, so he couldn\u2019t speak and went along with it. But he seemed miserable about me being his sahyung.\u201cSo who became the disciple first?\u201dBe it half a day or half a minute, if one came first, they were sahyung.\u201cYah. Are you going to act rudely? You owe me your life.\u201d\u201cAh? Owe?\u201d\u201cRight. Thanks to me, your life got saved, so let\u2019s just be disciples.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to call me his sahyung.\u201cThat is true.\u201d\u201cRight? Huh. Then let\u2019s be friends. You tell the teacher too.\u201dI smiled at him and said,\u201cOkay. Then call me master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI won the match, remember?\u201d\u201cNo. It was a draw.\u201d\u201cIf the teacher hadn\u2019t intervened in the middle, you would have crossed into the other world by crossing over the Sanzu river. Do you realize that?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026\u201dThe Sanzu River was a river that was often thought to lead to the underworld.After hearing my words, Song Jwa-baek tried to catch me by my throat. His internal wounds were healed, so it can be that my words were burning inside him.\u201cStill, in terms of internal qi, I am ahead of you!\u201d\u201cContinue to say that. But did you lose? Or did you not lose?\u201dClench!As this exchange continued, I noted that he seemed exhausted. Still, seeing that he didn\u2019t insist on winning, it felt like he had a clear view of how the fight went. Song Jwa-baek, who had been staring at me for a long time, trembled and said,\u201c\u2026 Sahyung.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSahyung.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I cannot hear you. Maybe my ears aren\u2019t working well? What was that?\u201d\u201cOh! Sahyung!\u201dAnd he screamed, unable to hold back his anger, and lay down.I smiled at that. He wasn\u2019t even cute to look at. And ten years from now, they would become known as the notorious White and Black Swift Twins.\u201cShit. I was ahead in internal qi\u2026\u201dHe kept complaining. Maybe it was because he knew I was listening.-Wonhwi. You wouldn\u2019t be able to say something like that if you weren\u2019t taught all of that either.If Song Jwa-baek heard this, he\u2019d probably be shocked.I was fighting with half my instincts, and if Hae Ack-chun intervened a little later, I too would have done my best to take him down.-What would be the result if I used the completed Xing Ming Sword?\u2018Well.\u2019I have no skills, and I had returned to when I was 15 and weak. I have more innate qi than internal qi. Wouldn\u2019t I have used up all my innate qi?-It would have been you using up all your skills.As Iron Sword said, I would have ended up using the perfect Xing Ming Sword technique.Until I hit the 3rd level in innate qi, I needed to take time and polish my cultivation. However, from the start, I was in the 4th level, which was entirely different.It was said that it takes longer to develop because of the realization of the qi, or it could also be short, depending on the opponent\u2019s perspective.\u2018How long will it take me to grow?\u2019The level that the South Heavenly Swordsman climbed.He reigned around in Yunnan. Although it wasn\u2019t known officially since he didn\u2019t enter a sect, he was someone who could have had the best cultivation.-It is up to you, Wonhwi.\u2018I will have to work twice harder.\u2019At least in order to not bring shame to him.-That\u2019s a good resolve. With that resolve, touch the blade once again\u2026\u201cKulkul.\u201dAnd then I heard that familiar voice from the entrance of the cave.\u201cI see that you are awake.\u201dHae Ack-chun was back and seemed to be in a better mood than usual.\u201cYou are lucky.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand him, but the man approached me, put me on his side, and walked out.How long did I have to smell this stinky man? He carried me like some bag and went down the mountain instead of heading to the top.Normal people would be terrified, but now I was too used to this, so I asked in a normal voice.\u201cTeacher, where are we going?\u201d\u201cTo get your dantian fixed.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dDid he just say to fix my dantian? Is he saying that it was possible?---In front of me was a black tiled roof with red pillars. This was the entrance of the main building of the Six Blood Valley.The place where Gu Sang-woong, the commander and his subordinates, stayed.Despite being here for a long time, this was the most recent time I was coming here. The last time I came here was when I was brought into the cult.Two low-ranking warriors greeted us.\u201cLong Live the Blood Cult!\u201dThey were surprised to see Hae Ack-chun, but then they looked at me with puzzled eyes.Well, a guy dressed as a trainee is coming with one of the most influential people of the cult, so anyone would be shocked.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI entered the hall alongside the man. Upon entering, I saw a two-story inner building with a large yard.\u2018Uh?\u2019There was an old-fashioned carriage in the yard with six women around it with their faces covered in cotton cloths.In addition to the women, there were 20 or so middle-rank warriors. Judging by the atmosphere, they didn\u2019t seem to be of the Blood Cult.People of the Blood Cult were often terrified when they saw Hae Ack-chun, but these people didn\u2019t even recognize him.Tatata!At that moment, someone rushed from the front of the building.She was Hae Ok-seon, a female leader. She came to the front with an expression and eyes full of shock.\u201cElder! Didn\u2019t I tell you that now isn\u2019t a good time?\u201dHae Ok-seon seemed to have run out to stop us from entering, and the man said,\u201cHuh! Not a good time!\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026\u201dAt his question, she hesitated but failed to find a correct answer. The opponent was Hae Ack-chun. No one in the position of a leader could disobey the man.\u201cAre you going to block my way?\u201d\u201cNo. Elder. It isn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dWell, what else can someone with the name of Ghastly Monster do? Ignoring her embarrassment, he shouted out loud.\u201cIs the Great Doctor of the Ten Thousand Deaths here?\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019What was that?Now I knew why he had called me.\u2018Today is the day!\u2019-Is this the day you spoke of? The arrival of that noble man?Short Sword must have remembered my words.\u2018Right.\u2019I came here a little over 6 months back in my past life, so the timing was right. This had to be the way to save my dantian.Now I was at the place that I had only heard rumors about.\u201cElder\u2026 if this happens, then\u2026\u201dDrrr!The door to the two-story building opened. Two people came out of it, one was Gu Sang-woong, and the other was a woman I had never seen before.At first glance, she looked like a grim reaper.Pale face, purple lips, and sharp eyes. No one would approach her with only her face visible and garbed all in black.-Doesn\u2019t she look a little old?As Short Sword said, she looked to be in her mid to late 40s.Yet, she looked beautiful, contrary to the eerie feeling she was giving out.Tak!The woman with cold eyes walked toward Hae Ack-chun.\u201cIt has been so long. Elder.\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled.\u201cKulkul, you were a noble? Even though years have passed, you still look so pretty. Bloody Hand Witch.\u201d\u2018B-Bloody Hand Witch?\u2019When I found out who she was, I was shocked.Han Baekha, the Bloody Hand Witch.She was one of the Seven Blood Stars in the cult and 6th in the overall rankings.The high-ranking members of the Blood Cult, who were a rarity to even see, were now in front of me. Knowing her identity, I was ready to bow. But as I was about to bend my knees, someone grabbed me by the collar.And I can\u2019t bow.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe person holding me by the collar is Hae Ack-chun. And he had a dissatisfied expression as he shook his head.\u201cHow can you bow down to someone when I am right next to you?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dFor a moment, I almost made a mistake.The Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha said.\u201cIf he is a trainee of the cult, he should be bowing to us, don\u2019t criticize him too much.\u201dHearing her words, Hae Ack-chun laughed.\u201cCriticize? Are you saying that a guy who is my disciple is to leave my side and bow to everyone with a higher position?\u201dAs soon as he said that, everyone went silent and looked at me. Even Han Baekha looked a bit taken aback as she spoke.\u201cYou took in a disciple?\u201dAhh\u2026This was an unexpected announcement. Now the world knows that I was the first disciple of the Ghastly Monster, Hae Ack-chun.-Oh my. Look at you being shocked.Short Sword chimed in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - God Of Ten Thousand Deaths (2)Silence flowed in the front yard of the Six Blood Valley\u2019s main hall.Various expressions were mixed in the crowd as everyone looked at me with shocked eyes. It was natural for attention to come.Hae Ack-chun, the Ghastly Monster who was someone who never took a disciple, now declared that he had a disciple.Even Gu Sang-woong was very suspicious of what he heard. It was hard to believe that the man took a disciple who had a broken dantian.It was nothing.Tuk!I bowed my head and wrapped my right fist with the palm of my left hand in an upright position.\u201cLong Live the Blood Cult! I am So Wonhwi. Despite being a lowly trainee, the elder saw my qualities and took me in as his disciple.\u201dI greeted with politeness and dignity. Although he didn\u2019t really express it, I could tell that Hae Ack-chun smiled.\u2018Seems to be real.\u2019\u2018That man took in a disciple?\u2019Thanks to re-emphasizing the statement of me being his disciple, I could hear whispers from all over.And it was the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, who broke the silence.\u201cCongratulations, elder, you took in a disciple. I am happy.\u201dShe, too, bowed and gave her congratulations.Then, all the people related to the cult, including the women in veils who were brought by the Bloody Hand Witch, and those affiliated with the cult, bowed.\u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cElder. Congratulations.\u201dNow it cannot be taken back. Since everyone now knew about me being the disciple, the rumours would inevitably start to spread.I never got such attention in my previous life, but I hated it.Is this why the background of a person is important?-The world is like this. You have to get solid backing to be successful.Short Sword spoke like an old man who had lived for many years. But she was right. This is because I received a lot of attention which I didn\u2019t get in my previous life.The attention I received lasted for just a short time.\u2018I have to gain power.\u2019-Right, right.It felt more intense.But this wasn\u2019t a mistake, right?The gaze of the Bloody Hand Witch, who was still politely bowing, was aimed straight at my eyes.Flinch!Obviously, it was because she was one of the eleven influential people who led the Blood Cult. Still, she had a unique atmosphere around her that was different from others.I could feel a strong sense of oppression from her gaze.-Lower your eyes. Isn\u2019t she saying that?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019I didn\u2019t mean to look. But strangely, it felt like I was being sucked into her eyes.Just as I was about to become dizzy, the innate internal qi in my chest suddenly rushed to my mind, and I returned to feeling normal.And the Bloody Hand Witch, who was still looking at me, had a different look.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019What was that just now?At that time, Hae Ack-chun covered my body with his. And I heard in my head.[Do not look into that woman\u2019s eyes. You, who are still inexperienced, will be deceived.]I guess that\u2019s why I felt dizzy. But I was fine now.I didn\u2019t know why the innate qi moved on its own, but it relieved me from the dizziness. Hae Ack-chun, who didn\u2019t know this, spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t do useless things here, Bloody Hand Witch.\u201d\u201cWould I do that? How can you possibly think I would do that in front of you?\u201dShe bowed her head and denied it. Man, what a scary woman she was.She was testing me right before her eyes and spoke without hesitation.It wasn\u2019t just due to luck that she took the position as the Seventh Blood Star.She was probably someone who excelled in martial arts and boldness.\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cHuh! It would be better if you didn\u2019t touch my things. You do know that a Blood Star doesn\u2019t stand a chance in front of me, right?\u201dOf course, Hae Ack-chun was also a bold person. The epitome of a freak.Even so, I liked that he took care of me, his disciple. Or maybe it was just because of his ego.\u201cWould I ever act out?\u201dShe answered without losing her composure, and Hae Ack-chun just snorted at her words.\u201cHuh!\u201dStill, because he was one of the members of the Blood Cult and the opponent was a Blood Star, he couldn\u2019t just act out.\u201cEnough, I need to look at the man now.\u201d\u201cElder\u2026\u201dCommander Gu Sang-woong tried to say something with a shocked expression, but Han Baekha raised her hand and answered on his behalf.\u201cIt is difficult now.\u201d\u201cIt looks like his duties are done, so what is the problem?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know the disposition of the Great Doctor?\u201d\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019I could hear the words before they even got into the conversation.What is this man planning to do by provoking the man he wants to ask for help from? If not, would he use force to make him work?This was too burdensome.\u201cNot now.\u201dBut the woman also came out strong.I thought she would step back due to this crazy man, but she didn\u2019t. Did she have the confidence to not get pushed back?\u201cHoh. Right.\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s expression changed. Seeing the thick muscles in his arms wriggle, I began to get nervous.\u201cPlease come in.\u201dA soft low-pitched voice echoed from inside the main hall. Even Gu Sang-woong looked puzzled at it.The door was slightly opened to the point where I could almost see through the gap.\u201cIt is fine.\u201dA small voice.Gu Sang-woong, the commander of the Six Blood Valley, looked at Han Baekha.She let out a shallow sigh and stepped aside.\u201cGo in.\u201d\u201cKulkuk, we will be done quickly.\u201dHae Ack-chun clenched his fist. The atmosphere which had been suffocating returned to normal\u201cKulkul, let\u2019s go in.\u201dAh, this was embarrassing.Regardless of strength or anything else, Hae Ack-chun was a man without shame in doing such things.Anyway, I am glad that things were working out.Drrr!The large door opened, and a room revealed itself. And I was actually looking forward to this.It was the moment when I could receive help from one of the best, someone who could save anyone except for the dead.\u2018Ah!\u2019A half-white middle-aged man was sitting in front of an antique table.He was quite the handsome man. When he was young, I was sure he made his fair share of women cry over him. Even now, he was handsome enough to do that.Somehow, this face was different from what I had in mind. And the Small Short Sword growled.-White hair, white skin, isn\u2019t that white dye?\u2018Isn\u2019t that normal?\u2019Maybe it\u2019s because he had a name? I thought everything about him was normal despite being unable to look away.However, he wasn\u2019t the only one in the room.\u2018Who is that?\u2019A person could be seen behind a veil made of thinly-cut bamboo, and looking at the slender body, it looked like it was a woman.And in front of the bamboo veil were four women who appeared to be escorts, all with their faces covered in white veils.-Puah, why are they so fat? And their double chins\u2026\u2018Well\u2026\u2019As the short sword said, the women weren\u2019t of normal size. They were large enough to have a double chin. In a way, they looked like an alternate version of Hae Ack-chun.\u2018Don\u2019t judge people by their looks.\u2019-\u2026 is that so? Let\u2019s see if you can say that when you get married to someone like that.\u2018\u2026\u2019I couldn\u2019t deny it.\u201cWhy are you coming?\u201dHa Ack-chun voiced his irritation to Gu Sang-woong and Han Baekha, who came along.To this, she responded with an expressionless face.\u201cIt was a bit upsetting. My elder has come all this way, so we must accompany him.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dHearing her words, Hae Ack-chun sat in front of the handsome man. The only odd thing was this man\u2019s reckless behaviour.\u201cGreat Doctor. Long time no see.\u201d\u201cYou have a majestic skeleton, elder.\u201dThe Great Doctor of Ten Thousand Death\u2019s voice sounded so cool as it resonated around the room. It was a voice that any woman would fall for. And maybe middle-aged women too\u2026\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201dThe man pointed to the teapot on the table.Because they are people with the highest-renowned names, they were being polite to each other.\u201cNo need. You are the one doing a lot of work, so you drink tea.\u201d-Such a quality conversation.Short Sword clicked her tongue.Right, it has been a long time since this old man had even acted like a normal person. It was like watching two people with entirely different tendencies meet.Hae Ack-chun chuckled and smiled.\u201cI will say it without dragging it out. Heal my disciple.\u201d\u201cHeal?\u201dAt those words, the man looked at me, who was standing behind Hae Ack-chun.\u201cI bow to the elderly. I am So Wonhwi, the elder\u2019s disciple.\u201dI hurriedly bowed my head and greeted the man as he glanced at me from top to bottom. And then he said,\u201cThe disciple doesn\u2019t seem to be ill.\u201dThis was expected.The problem with my dantian was inside, so I obviously looked fine on the outside. Hae Ack-chun pointed to where my dantian was.\u201cThe problem is here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 dantian.\u201dThe man noticed it right away.Hae Ack-chun nodded his head.\u201cIf you heal my disciple, I will give you my plaque (proof of identification). It will be useful.\u201dTak!Hae Ack-chun took something out of his pants and placed it on the table. Each plaque was nothing more than a badge to show their status.And for the people of murim, giving their plaque meant they would help the person they gave the plaque to if they were in crisis or needed help.-Ah. This old man cares for you.I agreed with that. I didn\u2019t think he would go this far.I thought he would have many questions before getting the treatment done, but seeing this, he seemed to care a lot for his disciple.\u2018He must be worried.\u2019This man was the Ghastly Monster.Maybe he thought he should give the proper response to secure help. Especially if he didn\u2019t know if a broken dantian could be cured. But the Great Doctor refused.\u201cI will decline.\u201dHe pushed the plaque back to Hae Ack-chun.\u201cWhat?\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s face became contorted. His feelings were understandable. I didn\u2019t know what he could even think of this situation.\u201cGreat Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths!\u201dAt that moment, the man took something out from under the table and placed it on top.Trr!The moment they saw it, everyone was shocked. Even Hae Ack-chun.-Wow\u2026 how many are there?On the table were many plaques which were tied with a thread.At first glance, there seemed to be around 50 or so. And the names etched on them were the most shocking.\u2018Wudang sect\u2019s sect leader\u2026\u2019-Aren\u2019t they all great people?\u2018Great? They are excellent people!\u2019One couldn\u2019t speak less of them.\u2018\u2026 ha!\u2019This was great too, but one name caught my eyes.[Cheol Shim]A name with just two letters.Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t know that name?I knew that this man healed numerous murim warriors regardless of their sects and nature, but I didn\u2019t think this person would be helped by him.-Who is it?\u2018\u2026 Four Great Evils\u2019Cheol Shim the Ferocious Murderer.A member of the Great Evils and someone everyone in Central Plains was afraid of. He was called the worst monster who killed many young and old people. Even children stopped crying at his name.-\u2026 His connections are\u2026This was what he was aiming for.Eight Great Warriors and Four Great Evils were said to have reached the peak realm in murim.But in actuality, it was different, and Hae Ack-chun trembled at the sight of the plaques.-It would be ugly to push in now.Step back before this turned any worse for us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - God Of Ten Thousand Deaths (3)A whole pack of plaques was placed on the table.And I could tell for sure as I saw it, regardless of the relationship, if I had to pick a person who is the most difficult to touch, it would be this person.His connections were terrifying to that degree.\u201cHuh. You have a lot of them.\u201dHae Ack-chun was surprised to see so many of them, but then he calmed himself and spoke like it was nothing.Man, he was so shameless.\u201cAs expected of you, elder.\u201dThe Great Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths smiled brightly and placed the plaques below the table again. Now that their appearance had made an impact, he had the upper hand.Short Sword said.-This is bad.The table still had the Hae Ack-chun\u2019s plaque, left untouched. The moment he placed it there, he placed his name on the line. He couldn\u2019t just take it back, right?-Well, you have innate qi, so there is no need to restore the dantian anymore, right?\u2018True.\u2019However, Hae Ack-chun believed that I couldn\u2019t handle the internal qi.I couldn\u2019t reveal that there was no irreversible consumption of innate qi due to my proper cultivation. So I had to stay silent while Hae Ack-chun was negotiating to restore my broken dantian.-Should you tell him?Short Sword asked.I knew the treatment wouldn\u2019t come if it wasn\u2019t asked for, but I didn\u2019t need it now, yet I couldn\u2019t speak about that either.\u201cYou are a physician. Can\u2019t you help save one person?\u201dHae Ack-chun spoke with a softer voice.Going strong didn\u2019t work, so he changed his way of speaking. Although still eccentric in his actions, the old man did have a brain to use. He is the kind of person who would do anything to get things done.\u201cIf there is a problem with the dantian, it isn\u2019t a disease that causes death, so how can you call it something like saving a person?\u201dThe man on the other side, too, had a clever way of speaking.He is definitely someone who was educated with good eloquence.How would Hae Ack-chun convince him?Tuk!Just as I became curious, Hae Ack-chun placed his hand on my head.\u2018Uh?\u2019His palm was so big that it was covering my head, and I asked him, puzzled.\u201cWhat are you-?\u201d\u201cI did say that it is a matter of life. I will kill him on the spot if you don\u2019t heal my disciple.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019In an instant, my hopes shattered. I didn\u2019t know he would come out like this.The Great Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths frowned.\u201cI like this kid\u2019s talent, but if I cannot use them to its best, he is of no value to me as a disciple. So I will kill him right now.\u201dClench!\u201cKuak!\u201dAs Hae Ack-chun clenched my head, I groaned.\u201cThink I\u2019m lying?\u201dIf you don\u2019t treat him, I will crush his head right here, was what he was trying to say.-This crazy old man! I made a mistake thinking he was good!We were wrong. This man is a bad person who doesn\u2019t know any kind of spring.\u201cWill you heal him? Or do I have to kill him?\u201dHae Ack-chun pushed on and attempted to blackmail the Doctor. As the second passed, the Doctor\u2019s face hardened.When I saw that, I clicked my tongue at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s ridiculous actions.\u2018Ha! Is this the only thing that he could think of?\u2019-Think of?This was dangerous from my point of view, but this was still a remarkable move.The task of making the man heal me. If I wasn\u2019t saved here, he was trying to frame it as if the Doctor failed to do his role as a physician.Even if it was absurd, Hae Ack-chun made use of his brain.\u201cWill the elder really go through with this?\u201d\u201cHave I ever said something I didn\u2019t mean?\u201d\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dBut, both Hae Ack-chun and I misunderstood something. This man wasn\u2019t just an ordinary person.\u201cIt is unfortunate. I heard he is the first disciple you took in.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you want to kill him, take him out and do it. I am taking care of patients here.\u201dHe came out strong too! Kill the kid if you want to.-He isn\u2019t buying this. What do we do now?\u2018Damn it.\u2019I will die like this.Grunt!Hae Ack-chun grunted his teeth and looked at the Doctor. The momentum seemed like he would try to kill everyone here.Shhh!The strength of Hae Ack-chun\u2019s grip on my head disappeared as he released me.\u2018Phew.\u2019Maybe I was unconsciously nervous about him potentially killing me, so I was glad. At the same time, Gu Sang-woong intervened.\u201cElder\u2026 the Great Doctor, is busy right now, so why don\u2019t you come back later\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, if it weren\u2019t for the child behind that bamboo veil, he wouldn\u2019t be busy, right?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dHae Ack-chun was looking behind the man.When things didn\u2019t work out the way he wanted, he was ready to take his anger out on anything.\u201cElder!\u201dTat! When Hae Ack-chun jumped out to capture the woman behind the bamboo veil, Han Baekha hurriedly blocked him.The two faced off against each other.\u201cThis is the second time you are blocking a path of mine.\u201dHae Ack-chun raised his eyebrows.\u201cPlease step back.\u201dShe was on the verge of fighting a failing battle. Who was it behind the bamboo veil that this woman was desperately protecting her?Even if she was someone higher-ranked than a Blood Star, Hae Ack-chun wasn\u2019t ready to back down now.\u201cBloody Hand Witch. When you come out like this, I wonder who is behind that veil?\u201dThe air became electrified with the energy of the two. It became suffocating to stay here. A tense and dangerous situation, but then I could see the neck of Han Baekha tremble.\u2018Voice transmission?\u2019Even though Voice Transmission cannot be heard, I also heard that such things can be noticed from the body.She was speaking with Hae Ack-chun. He was ready to fight the woman until a moment ago, but he suddenly changed his expression and said.\u201cYou, go out and wait.\u201dAnd it wasn\u2019t just me.The Bloody Hand Witch also instructed her people guarding the bamboo veil to get out. Thanks to this, they and I were asked to leave.-Why are they doing this? They are telling you to go out when you were the main reason to come here.Well.I couldn\u2019t figure it out either. One thing I could guess is that the person behind the bamboo veil made them act like this, someone who even Hae Ack-chun couldn\u2019t take too lightly.-Any noble that even the crazy old man of the Blood Cult would be wary of? If there is one, then\u2026My stomach hurts.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019-What is it? Were you hurt?\u2018It isn\u2019t that.\u2019-Something hurting you from inside?\u2018No, I just had too much to drink yesterday.\u2019The three of us drank a lot.-Humans are so high maintenance.Man. Look at her. If someone drank all night, anyone would be hurt in the morning.But how can a short sword know? I went down that cliff to work every day for six months, and I probably could not do it in my current state.\u201cHow about the bathroom?\u201dAfter I asked for the location of the bathroom in the main building, I ran there. It was to the back of the main building, and the door didn\u2019t open.It was as if someone was inside.\u2018What is this?\u2019Thud!\u201cIs someone in there?\u201dI could hear nothing.\u2018Ah, for real!\u2019I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I decided to use my innate qi and pulled on the door, but at that very moment, the door swung open.\u2018\u2026.?!\u2019I thought no one was there, but there was someone actually inside?-Uh? It is that fat woman.The person in the bathroom was a woman in a cotton dress. One of the guards of the bamboo veil. I then looked at her hand.She was hiding her presence and grabbed the door, and when I tried to look, I saw that she was eating dried jerky.\u2018\u2026.\u2019-Wah\u2026 as you live, you see the weirdest things.Trust me, you aren\u2019t the only one who is shocked. Eating a jerky inside a stinky bathroom.Is your hunger that huge?But I had to do something more.\u201cAre you busy?\u201d\u201cAh, no. That\u2026\u201dThe woman answered back, shocked.Even if she was this fat, she was bound to be embarrassed if she was caught eating in the bathroom.\u201cThen go somewhere and eat. I need to use the bathroom.\u201d\u201cW-wait a minute.\u201d\u201cI am sorry, but I have an urgent need, so please come out.\u201dAt my solemn words, she came out of the room like she had been kicked out and soon left, closing the door.I felt the anger draining from my body.\u2018Thank god.\u2019It would have been difficult if there was any other change within my body. After I finished, I opened the door and went out.\u2018Uh?\u2019But the fat woman was waiting in front of the bathroom a little distance away. No. Why was she waiting?I must have made a lot of noise from the bathroom. This was embarrassing. Either way, the woman ran to me as if waiting for my exit.\u201cAre you the disciple of that old man?\u201d\u201c\u2026 right.\u201dAnd I am confused.\u201cPhew.\u201dShe comfortably pulled something out of her arm, glanced around, and gave it to me. I saw that it was a silver coin.\u201c\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\u201cForget what you saw before.\u201d\u201cHow do I forget that?\u201dIt is so deeply engraved in my memory that I can never forget it. At my shocked words, she apologized.\u201cI am supposed to lose weight now, so I shouldn\u2019t eat anything.\u201d\u201cAnd the jerky before?\u201d\u201cIt was\u2026 I had to endure it, but I thought that if I didn\u2019t eat anything, I would collapse, so I ate little, just a little.\u201d\u201cYou ate half.\u201dAnd if I didn\u2019t open the door, you would have eaten all of it. I noted her skin, visible under her veil, turned red at this.\u201cHa,\u201dShe sighed and took out another silver coin.\u201cI get it, fine. You are really good at trading.\u201dMan, this girl was unique.This was something I would listen to if she talked to me normally, so I didn\u2019t know why she was giving me silver coins.-It is good to have then. Just take it.Short Sword was speaking sense. Getting two silver to keep my mouth shut is a good deal.But before I could receive the coin, someone else showed up.\u201cI asked you to wait patiently at the front. What are you doing here?\u201dIt was Hae Ack-chun.It looked like he was looking for me, and, surprised by his appearance, the woman put the silver coins back in her sleeve, bowed, and then ran.Hac Ack-chun, who saw this, mumbled.\u201cWhat was with that fatty?\u201dHae Ack-chun, together with me, had left the main hall and put me down again after we arrived in the forest. And then he said\u2026\u201cIt was bothersome.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? Teacher.\u201d\u201cWe need to find some grass or plant or something.\u201d\u2018Right!\u2019It has been so long, so I couldn\u2019t remember the name either, but there was a medicinal herb that the Great Doctor of Ten Thousand Deaths was using.Undersea grass.I remembered that this was the only place it could be found in.\u2018Did he get persuaded?\u2019Seeing that Hae Ack-chun, who was in a rage until a moment ago, mentioned the herb, it felt like he had to get it.Hae Ack-chun spoke with an annoyed tone.\u201cWe need to find it first. Only then can we restore that dantian of yours.\u201d\u201cFirst?\u201d\u201cThat damned man said that anyone who finds that herb first will be able to receive treatment from him at any time.\u201dHae Ack-chun shook his head.Finding herbs wasn\u2019t such an easy thing. And it didn\u2019t matter the level of your martial arts when it came to finding things.But I could.-We need to find it right away.I knew where this plant was located. As Hae Ack-chun was not aware of this, he began to work.\u201cDamn it, it just has to be that miss.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u2018Miss?\u2019Hae Ack-chun looked at me with a questioning look and stroked his beard.\u201cHuh. Only you get to know. If you say anything, even my disciple will get killed.\u201d\u2018If that is a high-level secret, don\u2019t bother telling me.\u2019Are you really acting like I am your disciple? Either way, the man continued to speak.\u201cRemember that woman behind the bamboo veil?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was a blurry image, but it was a woman. Then came the unexpected words.\u201cShe is the granddaughter of the deceased cult leader.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Oh god.The blood of the Blood Demon is alive.This was information I didn\u2019t know in my previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Undersea Plant (1)Published onJul 28, 2022\u202218 min read\u20221469 views(Long chapter)Blood Demon.A giant figure who created the Blood Cult by gathering all kinds of evil people and people from Unorthodox Sects in murim.As a result, the cult behind the scenes began to attack the Murim Alliance, and even others who were strong had to join hands to resist.In a fierce battle during the war, the Blood Demon, leader of the cult, was decapitated.At that time, the Murim Alliance and other sects searched for his blood relatives, but it was never revealed if they found them all. And that is all I knew.\u201cThe Blood Cult leader\u2019s\u2026 granddaughter is alive?\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled and nodded. Today was a day with a lot of extraordinary happenings. The Blood Demon\u2019s blood is alive.\u201cYou are lucky. You saw such a precious person up close.\u201dRegardless of luck, I was surprised.Who would have imagined that she would still be alive after so many sects searched and went after the bloodline of the Blood Demon?Somehow, I knew this old man wouldn\u2019t have just backed out of a fight.\u201cDon\u2019t tell your sajaes.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd look for that herb. It is the only thing that can restore your dantian and well-being too.\u201dThe Bloodline of the Blood Demon.Her safety is essential to the cult. The reason searchers for the herbs are being mobilized also had to be for her.-Wonhwi. Didn\u2019t I say?\u2018What?\u2019-People should be good at knowing the timing. Find the herb.Short Sword said, excited.Right. Perhaps, this was the golden chance that came for me.Hae Ack-chun ordered the twins to find the herb too. From what I heard, most of the Blood Cult members were also searching for it. Gu Sang-woong, and the Bloody Hand Witch, who were like the heads of this place, scattered everyone all over, saying that this herb had to be found at all costs.Actually, it was a waste of manpower to search for it together.-But what are they doing here?The place where I was in was the cave where the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s corpse was in. Instead of looking for the herb, I sat in front of a bonfire and cultivated my innate qi.\u2018I am cultivating.\u2019-But what if someone else finds the herb?\u2018They cannot find it.\u2019Short Sword clicked her tongue at my confident voice.-You better go and find it sooner. Wouldn\u2019t it be unfair if someone else finds it?\u2018Even I cannot find it.\u2019-Why can\u2019t I find it?\u2018Right now, the flower buds of the herb are buried, so I cannot find them.\u2019-What are you even talking about?\u2018Wait. It will take three more days to find the herbs, even with the help of all the trainees.\u2019-You\u2019re the one who returned back in time. How could I have known that?\u2018Then wait. Because after all, even that man doesn\u2019t know when the buds of the sagebrush would bloom.\u2019The sun had to be in the middle of the sky, and then I would have to wait in the cold for a long time before taking it out.So staying in this warm place was nice. As time passed, the red sun was about to set.-Are you going to go now?\u2018A little more.\u2019Small lights could be seen at the bottom of the mountain when the sun completely set.It was light from torches.Lights were moving here and there. After a while, they all gathered and headed to the main hall of the Six Blood Valley.\u2018Done.\u2019I waited for this time. I went down the mountain with Iron Sword on me.And when I went down, I could only feel the darkness and no presence.-This is so creepy. It feels like everyone has withdrawn.\u2018Because it is dark.\u2019-You were waiting for this.The current weather was too terrible to rely solely on torches to find herbs. The whole area was covered with white snow, so how could they find it in darkness?Now was the right time, especially with everyone out.Tat!It was dark, but I knew where the herb was, so I moved. Although not as good as Hae Ack-chun, I had learned the footwork technique that Iron Sword taught me.\u2018I feel good.\u2019Even the cold wind was making my heart flutter.I envied the footwork technique when I watched the other warriors use it in my previous life.The feeling of running so lightly on the ground under the moonlight couldn\u2019t be explained. Though the feeling didn\u2019t last long.Tak!A sound rang in my ear. And it was coming from behind me.-Wonhwi.\u2018I know.\u2019I nodded at the words of Iron Sword. I thought everyone had withdrawn, but it didn\u2019t seem like that.Someone was following me.\u201cPhew.\u201dIt seems that I was ready to use my cultivation for the first time outside of training. Warm qi welled up in my chest, leading to the soles of my feet.The moment it reached my feet, my speed accelerated.Phat!I could see the surroundings pass so quickly. I thought it would be difficult to catch me, but the opponent could catch up.And the sound kept ringing in my ear.Tak! Tak! Tak!Who was following me? To be able to catch up with me right now, they had to be a skilled warrior.\u2018Iron Sword, can you see who it is?\u2019I asked the sword which was on my back.-\u2026 amazing.\u2018What?\u2019-A fat woman is using a footwork technique at a similar speed to you.\u2018What?\u2019At that instant, I thought of the woman I met with the veil on her head during the day. I glanced back with a hopeful thought, and it really was her.\u2018Ha!\u2019Tak! Tak! Tak!She was so fat that I wondered how she could even move, but she was able to catch up with me. Then she shouted.\u201cStop there!\u201dAnd she was telling me to stop. This was insane.It was an unexpected ambush. If I stopped, I would have to give up looking for the herbs.-Hold on. If she is that fat, she cannot run for long.Short Sword was right. No matter how great her skills were, it would be difficult to maintain this speed with her body.If we continued this a little longer, then she would fall behind.-Wonhwi! Be careful of your back!Surprised by the cry from Iron Sword, I looked back. At that moment, I saw something shocking.That fat woman with a veil on her face was gliding on the snow like a hawk?\u2018What is she?\u2019What skill was this?With the speed she was moving with now, she would catch up right away.She reached out to me.\u2018Tch!\u2019I had to twist my body to avoid being touched. However, her hand turned red and bent in a strange direction.Pak!I hurriedly stopped her with Iron Sword, but her hand was faster. The red hand touched my left shoulder, and my balanced body rolled to the ground.\u201cAck!\u2019Thud!I had to roll around ten times to stop.-She is more skilled than you.Even without it stating the obvious, I could feel it. When I rolled to the ground, I could feel my body ache and could not get up. Then I felt someone come over to me.\u201cI told you to stop.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019That fat woman. Her face was exposed as the veil ripped through the running, and she was more beautiful than I thought.Round eyes and white skin. If she wasn\u2019t fat, she would be called a beauty.\u201c\u2026 why did you follow me? You scared me.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dShe frowned as I asked her.Did she think I was going to let her say it first? She wrinkled her forehead.\u201cYou were going somewhere in the middle of the night, so I chased after.\u201d\u201cWhat business do you have with me to know where I go?\u201dI came out strong. After all, I did nothing wrong to this woman.But man, she was so unexpected.\u201cAh, right? But, I heard that the elder\u2019s disciple has trouble with dantian, but you seem to be doing the footwork technique fine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis is why I waited for everyone to withdraw. My luck must have run out. But it wasn\u2019t like I had no excuses.\u201c\u2026 Yes, the innate qi is being used.\u201d\u201cUh? Innate qi? You mean you are using innate qi to do that?\u201dShe was surprised. When anyone speaks of innate qi, they think about essentially burning up life. Those who overuse their innate qi will die.\u201cCan\u2019t believe it? Check it out.\u201dI held out my hand.If she was someone who could handle qi, then she would know the difference from my condition right away by infusing her qi.But she couldn\u2019t do it. She hesitated to check, sighed, and said.\u201cThen you will die.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do then? I have no dantian to store qi.\u201d\u201cYou are stupid. You should not do that if you don\u2019t want to live a short life by exhausting the innate qi.\u201dWas she worried?A person who was under the Bloody Hand Witch.\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t that why I struggle with my teacher to heal the dantian?\u201dAt my words, she put on a sad expression. She must have pitied me for trying to kill myself by using my innate qi.\u201cIf your doubts are cleared up, can I go? It feels like my back is freezing as I am lying on the snow.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a lie. It was really cold. At my words, she held out her hand.I took her hand and stood up.-What do we do? Will you give up for today?Short Sword asked me.If I showed her the herbs, my achievements and merits would disappear. If I found it alone and took it out, I would receive trust from the cult and would have made an enormous contribution to the cult leader\u2019s daughter.\u2018Right.\u2019I thought so as she said,\u201cSo\u2026 was it young master Wonhwi?\u201d\u201cYou seem to be older, so please call me by just name.\u201dAt that, she had an upset expression. Did I do something wrong?-My former master said this. No matter how old a woman looks, the smooth way to live is to give regard to a woman.I wanted to dismiss his words, but then the woman said,\u201cYou are the Elder\u2019s disciple, so I cannot do that, and I am not old.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 no wonder you looked younger than me, but your martial arts were so good that I was being cautious.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to fix it.\u201dAnd she was smart.I already knew it in my past, but women were difficult to handle.\u201cI am a disciple of Sixth Blood Star, Ha Yeon.\u201dShe took the initiative and introduced herself. As expected of a disciple of the Sixth Blood Star.\u201cNo wonder I thought it was unusual to have red hands. You were doing the technique of the Sixth Blood Star.\u201dThe Blood Jade Hand.A defensive skill of the Bloody Hand Witch. I remember being told that her martial arts would turn the body red and bloody.\u2018I cannot do it today.\u2019It would be hard to get rid of the disciple of the Bloody Hand Witch. It felt like I had to give up and aim for this tomorrow.\u201cPhew. I was going to look for the herbs, but it is getting dark, so it will be difficult. I need to head back\u2026\u201d\u201cLie.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYoung master So, you know where the herbs are, right?\u201dI was speechless at her words. I didn\u2019t know what made her come to this conclusion, but she was speaking it out!So I casually asked her.\u201cIf I had known where it was, would I be looking for it in the dark?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u201cMaybe?\u201d\u201cEven for today, you should have returned back by now. I met the elder on my way back heading up.\u201dAh\u2026I don\u2019t like this.\u201cBut unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201cHas to be a coincidence. It\u2019s because I am not the kind to stand out.\u201dAt my words, she smiled.\u201cIs that possible? Among the herbalists, a few helped us quite a bit.\u201dThree, the twins and me. This woman was more intelligent than she looked.\u201cIt is strange. To show up when everyone is leaving.\u201d\u201cTrue. It is a coincidence, but you are misunderstanding.\u201dI should just let this pass casually. I didn\u2019t want her to catch onto anything else.\u201cIs it possible for a young master to look for the herb without even shoveling the snow?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen I said nothing, she continued.\u201cThe last and most decisive thing I realized after chasing after you was that you didn\u2019t even look around for it but kept going ahead.\u201dShort Sword sighed.-What are you going to do now?This woman was too smart to be deceived with excuses. It didn\u2019t seem like my excuses could work anyway.\u201cMiss Ha is special.\u201d\u201cAre you acknowledging it?\u201d\u201cPhew. I have no excuses if you have seen all of it.\u201dHer face brightened at my words.\u201cYou know where the herbs are, right? Right?\u201d\u201cI am not sure, but I have a guess.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go together!\u201dShe said excitedly, to which I responded.\u201cIs there any reason I should?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI also need the help of Elder Shinui, and this is a great chance for me to be given credit for helping a great person. Do I need to divide my merit with you?\u201dI said it honestly.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cWhat? You are a person who is trying to ride the carriage when someone else is doing all the hard work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, I did my share today, so I will head back.\u201d\u201cAre you going to act like this?\u201d\u201cYes. I will.\u201d\u201cHuh! Then I will continue to follow the young master until you find the herbs.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you need the merit that much?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t the merit! Hmph!\u201dShe had a subtle expression and said,\u201cI am not doing it for the merit. I am doing this to save the person I serve. Can I not be greedy?\u201dThe person that she is serving meant the granddaughter of the Blood Cult leader. She must have escorted her all the way here.I thought I could be closer to Ha Yeon, but I needed the merit all for myself.\u201cI will save her, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYou are being too much.\u201dHer face turned red, and she bit her lip. And she tried to persuade me.\u201cDon\u2019t do that, young master. I will give you all the merits in front of Elder Shinui. Then is that fine? \u201c\u201cYou will give the merit to me?\u201d\u201cYes. Even if the two of us go and find it, it doesn\u2019t mean that the merit is divided, right? And you know if we are lucky, Elder Shinui will give help to the two of us too.\u201dI couldn\u2019t be sure of that.If the two of us found it, wouldn\u2019t that change a lot of things? But I wasn\u2019t going to change my stance just because of this.\u201cIf that happens, then the elder will give me a plaque, and you\u2019ll get one too, then I will give it to you.\u201dHer words sounded nice. Not one but two plaques which said that Elder Shinui would help me.This wasn\u2019t such a bad condition.-Fine. Accept it. She will keep coming after you anyway.\u2018Let\u2019s try taking some time.\u2019She might change her stance if I was too difficult to compromise with.-Either way, you are already doing that.People can always turn greedy.Anyway, I think it would be alright to work with her if her conditions didn\u2019t change. I pretended to be concerned and tapped my chin.\u201cPhew, I don\u2019t know if Miss Ha can be trusted.\u201d\u201cTch. Why do you have so many doubts? How can I make you trust me?\u201dJust accepting it right away was more suspicious, right?She had an anxious look. She wanted to get the merit shared.\u201cI am just saying this, but don\u2019t even think about running away. Even if I look like this, you realize I am faster than the young master, right?\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019As soon as I heard that, a good idea struck me.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cMiss Ha, how about doing this?\u201d\u201cDoing what?\u201d\u201cTo have trust in each other, let\u2019s put up something more than the plaque. Isn\u2019t it possible that we may not receive the plaque?\u201d\u201cAdd something more? What is that?\u201dShe narrowed her eyes. It was an anxious look.\u201cTeach me how to do that horizontal flying thing you did before.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dI coveted it the moment I saw it. It was a new technique that made her look like a flying hawk.\u201cHa!\u201dMiss Ha Yeon was excited.Or was I just mistaking the angry steam rising over her head for excitement?Miss Ha Yeon and I went together to look for the location of the herbs. In the end, she accepted my offer.\u2018Do you know how rude it is to ask other people for their martial arts?\u2019\u2018I know.\u2019Which was why I had made the request. If she didn\u2019t accept it, she would have to head back. If she did, she would pass on this mysterious technique to me.-You aren\u2019t an easy guy.Short Sword said.\u2018Fine. I will teach you. Instead, there are conditions.\u2019Her condition was simple.Don\u2019t use any reckless moves using your innate qi. Use it only when it is dangerous. Use it only to kill the opponent.She seemed like a good person, but a person of an unorthodox sect can never be good.In the end, she agreed to it. The condition she gave out, I could also accept. After all, a new technique such as that can be considered a trump card.\u2018It is a good deal.\u2019Tak! Tak!While we were moving, she asked.\u201cYoung master\u2026 what happened during the day. You didn\u2019t tell anyone, right?\u201dIt seemed like she was talking about the bathroom incident.\u201cI was thinking about telling someone since I got one less coin.\u201d\u201cI am sorry!\u201dShe screamed with her face turning red.\u201cWell. I was given something better, so I will erase it from my mind.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI promise. Hmm, was that the reason you created this plan and came after me?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t! This is important for me!\u201dWell, she didn\u2019t like being found out.After all, no woman would want people to know about having jerky in the bathroom.\u201cIs it still far away?\u201d\u201cIt has to be near soon.\u201dI heard that it is in between the two mountains. In front of a frozen waterfall\u2026\u201cWow!\u201dHa Yeon exclaimed. As we entered the place between the mountains, a wide field of snow came into view, and through it, we could see purple flowers sticking out.The undersea plant.\u201cWe found it. Has the young master been here before?\u201dShe spoke with a bright face. Was it so fun to get merit?Or was she glad to be able to save the granddaughter of the deceased cult leader?\u201cNow take it and go\u2026\u201d-Wonhwi! Move up!\u2018\u2026?!\u2019At the cry from the South Heavenly Iron Sword, I moved ahead. I couldn\u2019t feel anything, so what was he warning me for?Papak!\u201cUk!\u201dBefore I could avoid it and turn my head, someone touched my blood points.I fell to the front. When I was about to lose consciousness, a hot qi soared through my chest and spread to where the sealed points were.And then I heard the sound.Papak!The sound of a hand-on-hand clash.\u201cWho are you? Ah!\u201dAnd I heard the voice of Ha Yeon.Fortunately, she seemed to be better than me and could avoid the opponent\u2019s surprise attack.\u201cStop there right now!\u201dTatatak!The sound of people running and their footsteps could be heard. It seems like she was being pursued.Not long after, there were clattering sounds from the sealed points on my back, and my stiff body began to relax.\u2018Is this the effect of innate qi?\u2019I didn\u2019t know that it could solve such issues. Well unknown to all, innate qi had a lot of benefits.-This isn\u2019t the time to be thinking that. The guys who attacked you took the herbs and ran.As Short Sword said, some of the grass was torn off. It felt like they followed us both. And the fact that Miss Ha Yeon, who was supposed to be a first-rate warrior, didn\u2019t feel them meant that they were of a higher caliber than her.-Hurry up! You need the merit!Short Sword told me, but do I have to pursue them?-What?I went before the rest of the plants blooming above the snow.Five yellow beads were visible from the purple petals. And when I looked at it, I smiled.\u2018Because this isn\u2019t a fully grown undersea plant.\u2019You had to wait a little more for them to grow, you idiots.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - Undersea Plant (2)There were two figures in the snow. Two men, their faces covered in masks, were moving rapidly.[She\u2019s slowly lagging behind.]The masked man on the right nodded at the voice transmission from the man on the left.Behind them, a fat woman was in pursuit. But little by little, the distance between them was widening.[I think her stamina is dropping because she is fat.][Still, she is good. A servant of the Bloody Hand Witch. She is quick-witted and also skilled in martial arts.]The masked man on the left bit his tongue at this. Because of her large frame, they thought she would be easy pickings, but it turned out that she could chase them.Initially, they aimed to stun both the fat girl and the boy.[Just a little more time Leader Mak.][Yes.]The tired look was gone. It felt like they had to go back.The masked man on the right spoke as he looked at the herb.[We are lucky, though. We are fortunate to have followed So Wonhwi.][Right. But I have doubts on one thing.][About what?][How is a guy with a ruined dantian using footwork?][True.]They searched the mountain till late sunset. Then they found So Wonhwi moving around.They were curious to see a guy who could not perform martial arts with a damaged dantian move around in the forest in the evening.As a result, they overheard the conversation between the two and then stole the herbs.[Whatever you are curious about, there is no way we can know it right now, so let\u2019s just go after what we are sure about. In any case, the elder will keep his promise, right?]Surprisingly, they mentioned elder Hae Ack-chun.What was this?[He said that if we bring the herbs, he will give us anything, so he will keep his word. It is a promise made in his honor. How can he break it?]Hae Ack-chun was seriously searching for the herbs and proposed a deal to a few people in the cult.He said if the herbs were given to him, he would give them anything they wanted. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of trying to seal the blood points of Hae Ack-chun\u2019s disciple.They were convinced that he wanted the herbs for himself and that they wouldn\u2019t be yelled at for touching his disciple and the fat girl.[Elder asked for it, but what could we ask for it? Hahaha.][Hahahah][If we do well, we can break away from the Six Blood Valley and go elsewhere.]At that moment, they were in love with this thought.As they moved with the light footwork technique, a faint image appeared. Something blurry was running towards them.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Upon discovering this, they stopped. Because they realized who was approaching them.\u2018Bloody Hand Witch!\u2019The Sixth Blood Star, Han Baekha.They were shocked as they did not expect her to come here. Besides, they also had masks on.Pat!The Bloody Hand Witch approached them with her expressionless face\u201cWho?\u201dThe two hesitated on what they needed to do. If they took off their masks, their identity would be revealed.\u201cWho are you?\u201dShhh!Han Baekha\u2019s hands were turning red.\u2018Shit!\u2019They thought they might die if they didn\u2019t say anything, so they took off their masks and bowed.\u201cLong live the Blood Cult! I am Leader Mak Wihong of the Blood Sealing group!\u201d\u201cLong live the Blood Cult! I am Sa Hyeon of the Six Blood Valley.\u201dTo get over this situation, they had to reveal their identity. It was better than being mistaken as the enemy. And then a scream came.\u201cHuh! Teacher! They attacked me and stole the undersea plant!\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019The two\u2019s faces hardened.\u201cSixth, Sixth Blood Star! This\u2026\u201d\u201cElder\u2026\u201dBefore he could make any excuses, Han Baekha\u2019s hands moved faster.Papak!\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201dHer hands slammed into their bodies instantly, and the two fell backward. No matter how skilled they were, the gap between them and the Blood Star was too great.\u201cHow dare you attack us?\u201dHer eyes were as sharp as a sword. Approaching the two that she had dealt with, she then took the plant they had.\u201cHuh!\u201dAnd then, the fat woman, no, Ha Yeon arrived.\u201cGasp!\u2019Her face was wet with sweat. Han Baekha lowered her head and looked at Ha Yeon, who was gasping for breath.\u201cWhy did you leave without informing me?\u201d\u201cKuk\u2026 kuk\u2026 sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cI am glad you are safe.\u201dTat!After that, three women in white veils arrived from the same direction. Unable to keep up with the speed of Han Baekha, they arrived late and bowed to her.Han Baekha said.\u201cNow that we obtained the herbs, we can head back to the main hall.\u201dAt her words, Ha Yeon barely caught her breath and said,\u201cHaaa\u2026 teacher, please head back first. I have to go back.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dHan Baekha was puzzled.Crack!The ice cracked, and the pieces fell.I was using the Xing Ming sword technique to break the ice, but it was so thick that I couldn\u2019t do it properly.How cold should the weather be for a waterfall to freeze?-Is it here?\u2018Right.\u2019The real undersea plant was behind the frozen waterfall.I didn\u2019t know who attacked me, but the real herbs would have been stolen if they had come out a little later.-You were lucky.\u2018Right. Or maybe they were stupid.\u2019They should be patient if they want to perform an ambush.-Who were they?I can roughly guess who they were. Judging from the fact that they and Ha Yeon fought, they weren\u2019t from the side of the Bloody Hand Witch.Then, it had to be from someone higher-ranked in the Six Blood Valley. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to have at least that level of martial arts?-They had no fear. They will have to face that crazy man if they attack you.This was the shocking part.It was apparent that they attacked us for the herbs. Even so, there was a high chance that they resorted to such an attempt because of the herbs.\u2018I cannot imagine it.\u2019And the place was a dark cave. There was a space similar to a cave behind the waterfall. Unlike the moonlit space outside, it was too dark to see inside.\u2018Should we light a torch?\u2019But it is hard to find branches in a place with ice everywhere. As I was about to move, Short Sword said,-What is that?\u2018What?\u2019-Can you see something in the back?I narrowed my eyes and looked into the dark cave. At first glance, I could see nothing, but when I looked closely, I saw something shining softly.And as I approached it, I saw small bead-like things emanating a green light. There were also purple petals around it.\u2018Found it!\u2019-Is this the real undersea plant?Seven small beads with a soft green glow inside the purple petals.These are the fully grown Undersea plants. There were only two here, unlike the huge number of plants outside.Would these two work?\u2018It is cold.\u2019It is said that this cold plant only bloomed on winter nights, and it felt like my palms would freeze from just holding it.I thought I had to cover my hand in a sleeve and then catch the stem. I carefully pulled them from the roots.\u2018If this can be used in summer, it would be really cold.\u2019As I was pulling out the second plant, Iron Sword said,-Wonhwi, a broken sword is at your feet.\u2018Broken sword?\u2019-It is saying something, but the sword\u2019s core seems broken. I cannot hear it.\u2018Okay?\u2019I put the other plant in my hand and reached under my feet. My fingers touched cold metal, and I heard a voice in my head.-Avo\u2026id\u2026 it\u2026 goe\u2026s\u2026for\u2026 the..feet!\u2018What was that?\u2019-Ru\u2018Ru?\u2019-n\u2026\u2018n?\u2019Was this guy telling me to run? Why would it say that in such a creepy way!And then Short Sword spoke in a whisper.-Wonhwi, do not make a sound and stay quiet; when I say run, run outside.Why are you scaring me? What was it?But for now, I decided to follow the instructions.-Run!As soon as it told me to run, I began to look around carefully and ran to the outside of the frozen waterfall.At that moment, I heard something strange come from behind me.Papapal!It was walking, more like scratching, on the ground as it moved, maybe crawling?But it was terrifying, big, and fast.-Too fast. Take me, Wonhwi!As Iron Sword\u2019s words, I pulled him out of the sheath. After infusing my innate qi into it, I quickly turned back and swung the sword.Pak!I could feel something brush past the sword.Kik!And then I saw something strange. Four eerie purple-colored eyes were staring at me.Papapak!The purple eyes in the light seemed to be looking at my head and moved with great speed.-Wonhwi, defend with the sword while avoiding it.As instructed by Iron Sword, I held out my sword, avoided it, and kept moving back.Papal!It felt heavy. Each step from it made ice shards bounce up.How the hell was this thing so big that the ice was shattering? I became even more afraid since I couldn\u2019t even see it!-This is the time! Hidden Clam sword!I hurriedly unleashed it, the Hidden Clan Sword technique.A counterattack technique that used the opponent\u2019s force.Chachachachak!When I used the technique, I heard the sound of scales being hit. It felt hard, too hard, and there was a feeling of the sword getting stuck.Papak!And then, perhaps as it tried to avoid the attack, the four eyes which were shining began to move to the side.-Do not miss it.\u2018I know.\u2019I began to look towards the purple eyes, which were disappearing. Then, I used the Tiger Tooth Sword technique.Chachacha!My sword moved in front of me with a stronger force than the previous technique. I instinctively understood this feeling of cutting into something.\u201cKakakaka!\u201dA terrifying scream resounded in the cave. It felt like I was in pain.I frantically swung the sword and moved ahead again as I heard the sound of pounding on the floor.Thud!-He is down!Iron Sword informed me that the monster had fallen.Papak!I tried to swing the sword a couple more times just to be sure but found no response.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dEven though it was cold here, I was sweating. I almost died to this invisible monster. What was this?-Totally disgusting.-My first time seeing it.Only these two seemed fine. It was then.Puck!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dSomething sharp pierced the back of my foot. I cut it with the iron sword.\u201cKuak!\u201dI tried to check if the thing I could hit was the mouth, but then the movement stopped. I thought I killed it. I was too careless.Damn it, my toe hurt so much! It felt like it was on fire.Poison?Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be getting these symptoms.\u201cKuak!\u201dI could feel the poison qi rush into my body. It reached inside in an instant.The poison was so intense that it felt like my body was on fire.Ba-dump!As my heart pounded, the innate qi in my chest moved to fight the poison. But the pain didn\u2019t die down.\u201cSo hot\u2026\u201dMy throat began to burn. I felt thirsty and wanted to drink cool water. I picked up the ice cubes and shoved them into my mouth.-Yah! Get yourself together!-Wonhwi! To drive out poison, do cultivation right now!I knew that.But it felt like I would die if I didn\u2019t drink something cold.I wanted to cool down, but even ice had its limits\u2026\u2018Ah!\u2019At that moment, I remembered the cold plant in my hands.The herbs I found with a lot of effort. Like a possessed person, I put them in my mouth and chewed on them several times.Gulp!I could feel the coldness running down my throat. It was different from the ice cubes I ate.aA white fog came from my mouth as this cold qi ran down my throat.-Calm down! Cultivate the qi!Iron Sword urged me, and I sat down to fight against the poison.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe hot poison from my foot and the cold feeling from my throat clashed in the middle of my body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Undersea Plant (3)\u201cKuak!\u201dIt felt like my body was exploding from inside. The pain was difficult to describe as the cold energy collided with the poison.I tried to suppress it by using my innate qi, but all it did was stimulate the poison.Clench!\u201cAck!\u201dMy back, which was bent, straightened.-Wonhwi, you need to calm down. Don\u2019t stop the cultivation.Iron Sword kept telling me this. The pain felt like my five internal organs were being torn apart. I was in too much pain to even concentrate.-Yah! Did you come back to this time to die here? Get yourself together!The cry of Short Sword echoed in my head. It felt as if cold water was poured on me at that moment. It was right. I already died and got another chance.And if I lose without being able to fight this pain, wouldn\u2019t this life be worse?Thanks to that, I could control my emotions and concentrated on the hot poison and the cold energy, both running wildly inside me.\u2018Two different qi are fighting in my body.\u2019Both qis were in conflict with the other, and they tried to harm each other, which was causing harm to my body. My body was not a battlefield!\u2018Focus.\u2019Do not be swept away by any of the qi. I imagined my innate qi in the middle of the conflict of energies, calm as a lake.A lake which endured even as lightning strikes. And peace came to my heart.\u2018Slowly\u2026 carefully\u2026\u2019Tuk!A drop of water fell into the calm lake, causing ripples to slowly spread around.Tud! Tud!At that moment, I felt a weird pulsation of innate qi within my chest. And as this pulsation grew louder, my body responded. The innate qi gradually increased enough to surround the wild conflict of qi within my body.Phat!I could feel the blood vessels working hard. Ignoring that, I only focused on the image of ripples.\u2018Ah!\u2019I could feel it. The innate qi, which was stronger, caused the poison and the cold to subside.To be precise, it felt more like they mixed. As cold ice qi and the hot poison qi mixed together, my five organs felt normal and relaxed again.-Iron Sword! Look at that! The wound on his foot is healing.-Just watch. We cannot be too careless.It sounded like they were mumbling something. Just what were they saying?Were they worried for me? I listened to what they were saying but couldn\u2019t hear it clearly.-\u2026-\u2026Whispers came in from all directions. I felt like I was getting dizzy with the sounds coming from around me.What are these sounds? What was it saying to me? Then came a clear voice.[Since you listened to the sword, Beta Ursa Major will open.]\u2018This voice?\u2019My mind felt hazy.When I opened my eyes, I saw a blue flame flare in my right hand.Ching!A change happened on one of the dots on the back of my hand, followed by a burning sound.\u2018This?\u2019Among the seven dots in the shape of the Big Dipper, the Beta Ursa Major spot corresponding to the second star was turning blue.And when it turned blue entirely, the flame subsided. It was like it got sucked into my hand.-Are you awake?-Wonhwi. Has the poison gone down?Both of them asked me with worried voices.\u2018Didn\u2019t you see the blue flame just now?\u2019-Blue flame? What flame?-What? Didn\u2019t you say something like this before?Again.I was the only one who could see it. Did I imagine this strange phenomenon? I had no idea what was happening.-Wonhwi. Is the body fine?Iron Sword asked me in confusion. I thought I had to evaluate my body\u2019s condition.\u2018Hmm?\u2019My body felt refreshed. Obviously, after cultivating on the spot, I could feel my five internal organs, which were on fire, begin to cool down, and my body also felt lighter.\u201cPhew.\u201dI was going to look inside to see how much innate qi was used. I cleared my breath and once again began to cultivate my qi. First, I moved the innate qi to the\u2026 uh?-What is it? Do we have a problem?Iron Sword asked in a worried tone. There was a problem. Something extraordinary had happened.\u2018It has grown.\u2019-What has grown?\u2018\u2026 My innate qi.\u2019The innate qi, which had been the size of two fingers, had grown in the middle of my chest.-How much did it grow?\u2018I think double?\u2019Normally I had qi worth about fifteen years of cultivation, but now it has doubled. And if I had to put it in words, it is around 30 years\u2019 worth of cultivated qi now.-Amazing!-Oh my!Short Sword and Iron Sword were startled by it.Why are they more surprised than me? I couldn\u2019t even dream that something like this could happen.-How did this happen\u2026 My former master said it would be difficult to increase innate qi even with pills and elixir. He said only constant cultivation\u2026-What is it?-I think I know.\u2018What is that?\u2019I was curious. Why did it double suddenly?-Since the innate qi is directly related to life, the more extreme the situation the life is put in, the more stimulated it becomes.\u2018Then it is like this because of the poison.\u2019-The poison and that coldness, too, must have stimulated it.Is that so?It seems like the war of the two different qi had stimulated my innate qi. It was so painful that I even thought I would die.\u2018If we overcome the pain of death, will I get stronger?\u2019The more I learned about innate qi, the further its nature deviated from internal qi.Anyway, for me, this was an amazing catalyst. If I was twice as strong with innate qi, then I could be at a level to overwhelm even first-rate warriors.-Congratulations, Wonhwi.-Brat, you are so lucky!When they spoke like this, even I felt better.Is this a chance?However, I noticed that I could see in the dark better than before. It was still dark, but it felt strange to see in it.It is as if I had eyes that could see in the dark.-What is it?\u2018It is strange. I can see the cave\u2026\u2019\u201cKuak!\u201dI looked around and unconsciously looked at the back of the cave and stumbled back. Behind me was the iron sword inserted into the ground. There was also a giant monster which had been cut down. The body looked like a snake, but it was huge.\u2018What is this?\u2019However, the head wasn\u2019t in the shape of a snake but a human face.To say that it was a completely human face would also be wrong. It had sharp fangs and four eyes and looked like a frog?It was so disgusting that I frowned. What was this?-Well. Maybe it\u2019s a spirit beast?\u2018This is a spirit beast?\u2019-If not, I cannot explain what this is.Iron Sword\u2019s words made sense, but it looked too creepy to be called a spirit beast.I didn\u2019t know it, but my eyes were so bright that I could see inside the cave. My vision was so good that I could even look at all the bones around the cave.Perhaps that monster had killed all of them.\u2018Ha!\u2019This was too horrible for a spirit beast.And if it was a real spirit beast, it had to spit out something like a core when it died. It died, and the tongue was hanging out, but that was all.\u2018Spirit beast? It looks like just a monster.\u2019I wondered. Did the guy who had found the plant in my past life also encounter the monster? At that time, Iron Sword asked me.-\u2026Wonhwi, can you hear my voice?\u2018I always hear you. What are you talking about?\u2019Suddenly I shook my head, realising why he said it.\u2018Uh?\u2019I wasn\u2019t even touching Iron Sword right now, but I could still hear his voice.As I came out of the cave, I hurriedly looked around. I was told I had been cultivating for an hour to deal with the poison.It felt short, but a lot of time had passed.-So amazing.The mumbling voice of Short Sword echoed in my head. As she noted, I was shocked too.Normally, it was possible to hear their voice only when I touched the sword, but not now. I could listen to them despite not touching them.-How far away can you hear me?I didn\u2019t have the time to check it, but even five meters was still good enough to listen.\u2018Is this the power of swordsmanship?\u2019What was certain was that this changed after that unknown voice spoke to me again. I glanced at the back of my hand.Could it be that this mysterious ability got stronger every time the colour of the dots changed? The doubts grew deeper in me.If there was a chance to escape from the Six Blood Valley, I think I should look for it.Tatata!I heard small footsteps approaching. As I looked over, someone was running toward me.\u2018Miss Ha Yeon?\u2019The person running was Miss Ha Yeon. She was still quite far, but I could tell who it was.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019This happened because of my innate qi, which grew. Usually, I could only hear at that distance, but now I could even feel my eyesight improved.-Such a good thing. The more you build your innate qi, the more you notice the presence of an opponent. Of course, I assumed it must be someone weaker than you.Iron Sword said.The more I experienced, the stronger I got.\u201cHuk! Young master!\u201dMiss Ha Yeon panted as she called for me. She was sweating so much that her face was red, and her hair was stuck to her face. It was apparent she had been through a lot.\u2018Did she chase after them all this while?\u2019If that was true, then she is a good one. She was so big, but she ran after them and returned to me.\u201cMiss. I am glad you are safe.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Ha\u2026\u201dShe exhaled, trying to pick up her breath and asked.\u201cHa\u2026 Ha\u2026 how is the young master?\u201d\u201cI am fine.\u201d\u201cI am sorry. I should have released the sealed points before running after them.\u201dThis woman was nicer than I thought. As soon as we met, I didn\u2019t think she would apologize.\u201cNo. The situation didn\u2019t give us time. They hadn\u2019t sealed them right anyway, so I got out.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 I am glad. I was afraid the cold was going to freeze you.\u201dI wondered if I should tell her the truth.I wondered if I should tell her that it was my innate qi which helped me, but before I could say anything, she smiled and said,\u201cI have good news.\u201d\u201cGood news?\u201d\u201cWe caught those who attacked us. Fortunately, my teacher\u2026 ah! Young master, what is with your foot?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is their doing! How can they have done this!\u201dShe coughed out angry words, and thanks to that, I didn\u2019t have to explain about the monster.\u201cLook. You seem to be hurt.\u201d\u201cIt is fine. It isn\u2019t that huge.\u201d\u201cThe blood stains seem huge, though.\u201dIt was hard to see. The wound had already healed after I cultivated, so only the stains remained, so I changed the topic.\u201cYou said they were caught. Did you get the plant back?\u201dShe nodded.\u201cFortunately, the teacher had caught them.\u201d\u201cThe Sixth Blood Star?\u201d\u201cYes. I was lucky.\u201d\u201cWho were the culprits?\u201d\u201c\u2026 leaders in Six Blood Valley.\u201dThis was expected. Who else would have done this?Still, we were lucky. They stole the not fully grown plants and even got caught. Tch.However, Miss Ha Yeon had an apologetic expression.\u201cYoung master, I will apologize first.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know, and I asked the teacher to take the herbs with her first. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I will give the plaque to you right away.\u201dYou gave it to the Bloody Hand Witch?It didn\u2019t matter since they weren\u2019t the right herbs, but she will still hand over the plaque to me? But I held back my curiosity.\u201cI will definitely give the plaque to you.\u201d\u201cHow can I believe that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I will make a request that the young master\u2019s teacher, the Fourth Venerable Dignitary, gets his request handled.\u201dHm\u2026Then that changed things a little.A scene in front of the guest house on the right side of the main hall in the Six Blood Valley.In front of the place where the Great Doctor was staying, the Ghastly Monster, Hae Ack-chun and the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, stood facing each other.Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t have a pleasant expression and was frowning. To him, she said.\u201cI heard this. You would give them your plaque if they granted your request.\u201dAt her words, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s expression went stiff. What made him go this stiff?\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t interfere in the matter.\u201d\u201cAfter all, you made your stand.\u201d\u201cIt is a choice I had to make. Do you think the man inside will grant the request and save one disciple\u2019s dantian?\u201d\u201cYou say it so easily.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late to give up on him.\u201dShe was silent at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s stubborn words.\u2018Is it a false or sincere request?\u2019Hae Ack-chun was a cold-hearted person and difficult for anyone to convince.But he didn\u2019t want to miss this chance.\u201cTo support the young lady\u2026\u201dDrrr!The door opened before she could speak.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201dThe Great Doctor came out. At this, she looked at Hae Ack-chun with an apologetic face.\u201cIt cannot be helped. And I think it will be tough to hand over the plaque.\u201dWith that, Han Baekha handed a cloth wrapped around\u2026 something to the Great Doctor.\u201cHere it is.\u201d\u201cYou found it quick. I thought it would take a few days.\u201dThe man was satisfied with getting the herbs. Watching that, Hae Ack-chun frowned more.He wanted to make a mess of things right here.\u201cTeacher!\u201dSo Wonhwi and Ha Yeon were running to them, and Hae Ack-chun nervously said.\u201cYou are late. Your broken dantian cannot be fixed\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish.\u201cI am sorry, Sixth Blood Star. That isn\u2019t a fully grown plant.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dAt those words, Han Baekha frowned.Ha Yeon, too was flustered at the unexpected results. They struggled so much and even fought spies trying to take them down for an immature plant?\u201cKuahahaha!\u201dAnd Hae Ack-chun welcomed this situation. It was uncomfortable for him to see the hope snatched away from his disciple, so he said.\u201cBloody Hand Witch. What do we do? You will have to search for the herb once again.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHan Baekha sighed.Everything was turning into a mess after a moment, So Wonhwi, who watched them, said,\u201cI am sorry for taking too long, teacher. But we don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSo Wonhwi took something out of his pocket.It was a purple flower with seven beads which emanated a soft green light.A fully grown herb.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The expressions of everyone looking at it were of different colours.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Plaque (1)A fully grown Undersea plant. It was markedly different from the immature ones in the Great Doctor\u2019s hands.Looking at the softly shining green beads, it was easy to know which were the real herbs.\u201cReally clever. How many beads are in your petals?\u201dThe Great Doctor asked.\u201c7.\u201dHearing the answer, he smiled and nodded. It was the proper certification that the herb was right.\u201cKuahahaha! You are indeed a disciple of mine.\u201dHae Ack-chun praised me. Looking at this, he was trying to mock the Bloody Hand Witch.-He likes this too much.\u2018Because he is a crazy old man.\u2019Han Baeha looked at the herbs with a frown. Surprisingly, there was no resentment toward me. Instead, was it more regret?\u201cHa\u2026\u201dI turned my head at the sound of a sigh that came from my side.Miss Ha Yeon looked at the herbs and then at me with a shocked face. It was a face that asked why I didn\u2019t tell her about this.Well, isn\u2019t it natural?In the first place, the two of us decided to find the herb. But she entrusted it to her teacher. She trusted the woman who taught her martial arts, which changed things.\u201cWe have something to check, don\u2019t we, Miss?\u201dAt my words, she nodded, and I approached Hae Ack-chun.\u201cTeacher. Can I ask you one thing?\u201dHae Ack-chun, who was intoxicated with joy, said,\u201cDid the Sixth Blood Star give you a plaque request?\u201d\u201cPlaque?\u201dIt was difficult to speak with her right there, so I just pointed with my eyes. And Hae Ack-chun snorted.\u201cGive me a plaque? Ha! If the request wasn\u2019t completed, I would never give the plaque nor receive it. What nonsense is that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by nonsense?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, Han Baekha frowned.\u201cHuh! Then you said you\u2019ll give me your plaque?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t speak up. This was an atmosphere where the crazy old man had the upper hand, and it was clear that the plaque wouldn\u2019t be given if the request wasn\u2019t completed.And the conclusion came. I turned back and winked at Miss Ha Yeon.\u2018I am right, Miss.\u2019Seeing that, she nodded with a stiff expression. The expression said she wasn\u2019t in a good mood.What can I do? A deal is a deal.\u201cThen thank you.\u201dAt my words, both the Bloody Hand Witch and Hae Ack-chun\u2019s faces took on a puzzled expression. Here was another bet I had made before coming here\u2026\u2018Uh? You don\u2019t trust my teacher?\u2019\u2018I am sorry to put it like that, but I don\u2019t think the Sixth Blood Star will give the plaque.\u2019\u2018That\u2026 is what my teacher said.\u2019\u2018What if my teacher rejects the request of the Sixth Blood Star?\u2019\u2019Even so, I will give the plaque. That is something I can assure the young master.\u2018Well.\u2019\u2018Huh, young master, were you deceived in your previous life? Why is it so hard to trust my words?\u2019The word \u2018previous life\u2019 made me flinch.\u2018I taught you my technique, and you still don\u2019t believe me?\u2019\u2018\u2026 I trust Miss. Just think the other way around. If the teacher changes what you promised, you would have no choice but to follow her, right?\u2019If her teacher changed her words, she would need to follow her. As a disciple, she is lower in stature than her teacher.If she asked Hae Ack-chun for something in exchange for the plaque, there was a high chance that the plaque wouldn\u2019t be given until the request was done.\u2018That won\u2019t come to pass. My teacher will definitely do it.\u2019\u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u2018Of course. How dare\u2026 you not have trust in my teacher?\u2019The Bloody Hand Witch raised her disciple well with trust.\u2018Should we make a bet then?\u2019\u2018\u2026 Bet?\u2019\u2018Anyway, Miss Ha took the herb, and you gave it to your master, and weren\u2019t we the two who actually found it?\u2019\u2018T-true. Right. I am sorry\u2026.\u2019\u2018No. You were attacked, so you left the herbs in her hand for safety, right?\u2019\u2018Right! But as I said before\u2026.\u2019\u2018But isn\u2019t that different from the deal we made?\u2019\u2018\u2026 True.\u2019\u2018I lost my chance to get two plaques, so shouldn\u2019t there be something I can get from this?\u2019She looked at me.\u2018Young master\u2026 you are like a thief.\u2019\u2018I am not a thief. I am taking what is rightfully mine.\u2019\u2018Tch. You use your head too much. You will never starve.\u2019\u2018Thank you for the compliment.\u2019\u2018It was no compliment. So, what is the bet?\u2019She grumbled and took the bait.\u2018Simple. Miss will trust her teacher, and I will trust my judgment.\u2019\u2018You are overconfident. You will lose big time.\u2019\u2018Then what if the bet is lost?\u2019\u2018There is a wager?\u2019\u2018If my side is right, shouldn\u2019t I be given at least the plaque of the Great Doctor?\u2019\u2018Ahh\u2026! You\u2026!\u2019Was she going to call me a thief again?Unlike Miss Ha, I am not made for the Blood Cult, so I had to work hard to survive. So if there is a chance, I will seize it.\u2018Huh, so then a plaque of the Great Doctor or one equivalent to it?\u2019\u2018It seems like the Six Blood Valley is quite great at serving the Sixth Blood Star.\u2019\u2018\u2026 Right.\u2019\u2018And I would like someone of her level or even a higher-ranked plaque.\u2019\u2018Ha!\u2019I understood her reaction. It wasn\u2019t someone else\u2019s, but I asked for the plaque of the granddaughter of the cult leader.I was pushing my luck a little. But Miss Ha Yeon wouldn\u2019t have to care too much because she was close to her.\u2018Is that difficult? Didn\u2019t you say you were close to that person?\u2019\u2018I am close, but\u2026\u2019\u2018Aren\u2019t you going to win the bet anyway? No way, does Miss Ha not trust her teacher?\u2019\u2018I believe her!\u2019\u2018Then let\u2019s make a bet.\u2019\u2018What do I get if I win?\u2019\u2018Didn\u2019t you say that your teacher had something to ask my teacher?\u2019\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018I will persuade my teacher to do it. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u2019He wasn\u2019t the kind of person to listen to my request. But I will still talk to him.\u2018Then isn\u2019t it my loss? What is so hard about talking to one?\u2019\u2018You must not know my teacher. He isn\u2019t called the Ghastly Monster for nothing.\u2019\u2018Uh?\u2019\u2018I was made to hang upside down from the cliff for more than 4 hours a day since I was taken under his wing. And it takes great courage to convince such a person.\u2019\u2018That\u2026.\u2019She had a surprised look. Of course, anyone who didn\u2019t know the crazy side of the old man would react like that.\u2018Still, the fact that I am at a loss doesn\u2019t change. Aren\u2019t you trying to get too much from me?\u2019\u2018Tch. Then don\u2019t bother.\u2019\u2018I will not be fooled by your words. Give me a nice price.\u2019\u2018Then I will also give up the doctor\u2019s plaque which my teacher gets. Okay?\u2019\u2018Losing one each? Then what about your dantian?\u2019She was shaken as I came out strong. Of course, she would be.This was like giving up on the life of a warrior.\u2018What will you do? I am also giving a fair price. In any case, wouldn\u2019t it be enough to make a bet under these conditions?\u2019I am sorry, Miss Ha. But your teacher will not get a plaque.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019After some thinking, she nodded.\u2018Let\u2019s do it. However, giving up the plaque isn\u2019t needed.\u2019\u2018Uh?\u2019\u2018I also taught you my footwork technique, but I think I would be too upset if you don\u2019t get your dantian healed.\u2019\u2018Is that fine? I am fine\u2026.\u2019\u2018Instead, risk your life to convince your teacher.\u2019\u2018Alright.\u2019\u2018Phew. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d make a bet which you\u2019d lose. Well, don\u2019t blame me if you get hung off a cliff again.\u2019Looking at her expression, she was sure of her victory and accepted the bet.This happened before coming back to the main hall. Thanks to this, I received the plaque of the Great Doctor and the granddaughter of the sect leader. A good bet.[I believed.]I could hear Ha Yeon\u2019s words in my head through voice transmission.It was a woman who didn\u2019t know that the herb her teacher held was an immature one. I am sorry.But I would have to suffer if the Bloody Hand Witch had the actual herb. I wanted to apologize, but I haven\u2019t learned how to apologize yet.-Shall I teach you?Short Sword asked me. I just looked apologetic.This should be good. Anyways, the person who should be sorry is Miss Ha Yeon as her teacher just broke her trust.[Phew\u2026 good. A bet is a bet. I will give you the plaque of the lady.]She surrendered cleanly.Judging from this, this woman had more credibility compared to others. Most of the so-called people or disciples with famous teachers would never do anything like this.There would also be violations of the agreement, but she didn\u2019t break her word.Is it because she was always an honest person?I liked this.Swish!After I did that, I looked at the Bloody Hand Witch who had bitter eyes. Still, as a teacher, who wouldn\u2019t stare like that? Won\u2019t Ha Yeon be scolded too?No matter how disappointed she was\u2026\u2018Uh?\u2019At that time, the hands of Han Baekha turned red. She was using the Blood Hand Jade.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dHae Ack-chun yelled at her actions as something unexpected happened.Pak!\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Han Bakha slashed her own index and middle fingers with her sword qi. What she did was so powerful that the fingers were cleanly cut as if cut with a blade.Blood dripped on the floor.\u201cHa!\u201dEven Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t understand this. After that, Han Baekha frowned and bowed to Hae Ack-chun.\u201cThe Sixth Blood Star, Han Baekha apologizes to the elder.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Plaque (2)The Bloody Hand Witch had cut her own fingers. This kind of behavior was enough to make even the crazy man speechless.And then she said.\u201cI apologize to the elder for this. Giving up on one arm wouldn\u2019t be enough, but please consider that I have been serving a very important person.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, she was also an important member of the cult. For her to take off two fingers, she had made a great sacrifice.-That woman looks crazy.Short Sword said. I didn\u2019t even think that she would apologize. Even that ferocious old man couldn\u2019t criticize or ridicule her anymore. Seeing how it turned out, this woman played it well.But\u2026\u2018Strange.\u2019-What is strange?I wondered if her act of cutting off her fingers was a message to Ha Yeon for her actions. Telling her to cut off her fingers as well.Just looking at her, she had been eyeing her own disciple for a while. And the fact that her disciple should apologize for it, but she only kept staring\u2026\u2018\u2026?!\u2019-What is it?\u2018No\u2026\u2019I looked at Ha Yeon. She let out a shallow sigh and looked at her teacher. And there was a hint of disappointment.\u2018The teacher cut off her own finger. So what would a normal disciple do?\u2019-Run and stop the bleeding. Anything.As Short Sword said, they would take immediate action. However, Miss Ha Yeon was just watching. It was like she was ranked higher than the Bloody Hand Witch.\u201cI don\u2019t think these are things you do in front of a doctor.\u201dThe Great Doctor removed a salve from his waist and tried approaching the Bloody Hand Witch.That man who had been so stingy with his treatment couldn\u2019t bear seeing someone hurt in front of his eyes. However, Han Baekha showed that she was fine.Tatata!She stopped the bleeding by stopping her blood points. Someone as strong as her could do it perfectly.\u201cYou are as merciless as ever, Bloody Hand Witch.\u201dHae Ack-chun accepted her apology.\u201cThank you for forgiving me.\u201dShe was also one of the most important people in the cult, so ending it here was the right thing. But the Bloody Hand Witch was quite nervous as she failed to notice one thing.-What didn\u2019t she notice?\u2018Miss Ha Yeon\u2019s true identity.\u2019-Uh? True identity? Do you mean she\u2019s someone important?I wasn\u2019t sure, but if my guess was correct, she wasn\u2019t a simple disciple.-What about her is telling you that she\u2019s not a disciple? Is she like the daughter of that woman?\u2018No. She is the granddaughter of the cult leader.\u2019-What? That fat one is the granddaughter?-Huh!Both my swords were shocked. Right. Even I was too shocked to think about it further.-Then what about the woman behind the bamboo veil?-Fake.They could be a fake.Such things happened in my previous life. In order to protect a precious person, they would often place a fake decoy.-Right. It could be a fake.\u2018If one is a descendent of the Blood Cult, then many people will be targeting them.\u2019If her identity was exposed, there would be an uproar. That is why even the truth about her being alive hadn\u2019t even spread inside the cult itself.-Then, who could have even noticed? Who would think that a fat kid like her would be a descendant of the Blood Cult\u2019s leader?Right. That was true. It was such an amazing thing.It wouldn\u2019t be easy to gain weight to hide their identity.\u2018Hm?\u2019No. She was planning on losing weight, right? So what kind of fattening diseases does she have?-That.-It is a cursed disease for women.These two could understand women better than I. Rather, being fat was a fatal disease for any warrior.I\u2019ve never heard of or seen a person among the warriors who gained so much weight. Gaining weight made the body turn dull and placed the person at a disadvantage during fights.-Wonhwi. But isn\u2019t it a bit strange?\u2018What is?\u2019-Isn\u2019t this the territory of the Blood Cult?\u2018It is.\u2019-Then does she need to hide her identity and place a fake?Short Sword replied to the words of Iron Sword.-Yah. If it is like that, one should have pride in being the granddaughter of the cult leader. Would a person come out looking that fat?-Short Sword. Wouldn\u2019t she have tried to make herself look good if it is like you said?-\u2026Short Sword went silent. Iron Sword had a point. I was able to understand one thing from the conversation.\u2018\u2026an internal problem?\u2019I couldn\u2019t think of anything other than that. If not, there would be no reason to put up a fake even inside the Six Blood Valley.And if a blood relation of the cult leader was here, then she or he would be the center of the cult as they will be the next leader. Could there be an enemy within?I looked at Ha Yeon.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019-What is it?\u2018Ha!\u2019I was wrong. Why did I think that the cult leader had only one child?-Oh! Right.If there were two instead of one, then everyone would be careful.For example, if there was a risk that people would break into factions or sides, hiding the identity of one is understandable.-Sometimes, you look like a fool, but surprisingly your head is impressive at timesJust praise me properly, don\u2019t be mean.-Humans are hard to understand.\u2018Why?\u2019-If your guess is correct, then this is so odd. To set up a fake just because people might fight with each other.-I agree with Short Sword.Right.There are animals that fight each other as much as humans.Small families fight, and rulers of large nations fight. There were also cases of hurting others to occupy the throne. As I continued to think, Hae Ack-chun reached out his hand to the Great Doctor and demanded.\u201cKulkuk. Shouldn\u2019t we keep our promises?\u201dIt was a call for the plaque. The man smiled and said.\u201cI will give the plaque to your disciple and not to you, Elder.\u201d\u201cTch.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. There is only one possible request anyway.\u201d\u201cI will keep my word. However, since there was a poor discussion, I will look at the disciple\u2026\u201dAt that time, the Great Doctor who was speaking frowned and changed his mind.\u201cHmm. I will check the disciple\u2019s condition when the sun comes up.\u201dHis words changed.I looked at Miss Ha Yeon. Did she do something? Why did his words change?She seemed to be conscious of me and sent a message.[I will hand over the plaque, so do not worry.]I wasn\u2019t worried about it since I would get it.When I found out who she was, I felt mentally burdened. Should I just pretend like I didn\u2019t know?The next day, I headed to the main hall. I wanted to go with Hae Ack-chun, but the Great Doctor told me he would take care of me, so the old man didn\u2019t come.As for me, it was more comfortable to go alone than with the old man. As I went closer, I grabbed my head.-Can you still hear me?Short Sword asked anxiously. This was happening because of my condition.It was the same as yesterday, but the voices were getting louder.-\u2026Whispers, various sounds from everywhere around, the more conscious I became of them, the louder it got.\u2018The sound is getting louder.\u2019It wasn\u2019t like this yesterday. There were so many whispers.Most were from the warriors in the valley using their swords or the disciples brought by the Bloody Hand Witch who were using their weapons to train.-Wonhwi, don\u2019t be too conscious of it.Iron Sword advised me.\u2018It is too loud to do that.\u2019-Do you consciously listen to what other people are saying?\u2018That\u2026 no.\u2019-It is similar. Did you say the voices are like echoes in your head?\u2018\u2026 Yes.\u2019-You should be more conscious of it as this is something known. Try to not do that.It was easy to say, but how do I not think about the ringing sound in my head?-\u2026How about trying to cultivate the innate qi?That should be the last resort.As Iron Sword said, I decided to not cultivate but instead channel the innate qi to my head, and, miraculously, the headache that had bothered me gradually disappeared.\u2018My headache stopped.\u2019I could still hear the sounds. But I wouldn\u2019t hear as much if I didn\u2019t care about it. It\u2019s more like a passing sound that could be ignored now.-But Wonhwi, you are right.-There are many swords inside the main hall. Roughly 12\u2026 no 13 uh what?-One sword is suffering.-You can hear it too?They were reacting strangely. Unlike how they were normally, they were showing interest in this.I was curious as I could hear its voice and tried to focus on the sword.-\u2026 suffering\u2026 I don\u2019t want to die\u2026In an instant, I felt a chill run through my body. The sound of a dying person.I didn\u2019t know why such sounds were being made, but it sounded like it was in pain.I didn\u2019t have time to wait as the Great Doctor would be waiting for me.So I hurried to the entrance and saw the guards looking inside.\u2018What is it?\u2019Is something happening inside?As I approached, the guard who stood there bowed his head and greeted me. Well, everyone knew whose disciple I was.I passed through the gate and went in.\u2018Uh?\u2019But when I went inside, something unexpected happened.The front of the main hall was guarded by the disciples of Bloody Hand Witch, and in front of them were 12 men in bamboo hats, all with swords.-Something doesn\u2019t seem right.As the short sword said, the atmosphere seemed strange. I could hear the swords of the bamboo hat men speaking.-I want to see blood now.-I want you to pick it up sooner than replace it later.Each of the sword\u2019s words could be heard, all of them eager to fight.It seemed like I had arrived at a bad situation. The place where everything was happening was in front of the Great Doctor\u2019s building.Bang!Someone came out of it by opening the door. It was a person in a bamboo hat with hair long enough to reach the waist and a thin woman-like body.-I want\u2026 to die\u2026It\u2019s this sword. The sword on this person\u2019s waist was in agony. I didn\u2019t know why.\u201cYou are lucky.\u201dThe woman in the bamboo hat came out and walked down the stairs.Others also walked out through the door. After the woman came out, Han Baekha and three of her disciples were also there. Han Baekha\u2019s expression was darker than usual.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt the woman\u2019s words, the people guarding outside replied right away.She and her group moved toward where I was standing.To be precise, she was in the lead.\u2018Eik.\u2019I felt like I was caught for walking in front of them and tried to move out of their way. I then bowed my head, trying to avoid eye contact.Step!They kept walking. They were definitely passing by, but,\u201cHow did a trainee get into the main hall?\u201dThis was bad!She stopped when she saw my outfit. After all, trainees cannot enter this place until their training period is over.Entering the main hall was something that only happened when one was a true warrior.I didn\u2019t know who she was, but I felt like I had to reveal I was the old man\u2019s disciple.\u201cI\u2026\u201dIt was then.\u201cEven the trainees are slow.\u201dNo, give me time to answer then!Shh!Something suddenly appeared in front of me with the sound of wind splitting. The moment I lifted my head to see, I saw a hand pass over my head.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Was she planning to kill me?Confused, I crossed my arms and, at that moment, felt a massive shock on my wrist.Pang!\u201cHuk!\u201dMy body was pushed back. What power!Despite having 30 years\u2019 worth of innate qi, and despite the confidence I gained, I felt my five organs burn once again.\u201cCan a trainee withstand this?\u201dShe lifted the bamboo hat a little. I could see her red eyes in the dark shadow under the hat.Those eyes were filled with killing intent.What the hell is with that woman?The woman in the bamboo hat tried to approach me with an expression that showed her interest in me.Her white hands were ready to use the sword on her waist as I heard the cry of Miss Ha Yeon.\u201cEnough! He isn\u2019t a trainee but a disciple of Elder Hae Ack-chun!\u201d\u201cThe elder\u2019s disciple?\u201dHearing that, the red-eyed woman\u2019s lips curled into a smile.This was my first time seeing such a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Plaque (3)\u201cThe elder took in a disciple?\u201dThe woman in the bamboo hat released her hand, which was holding the sword. As she looked at my face, I noted that her face was really beautiful.However, the atmosphere around her was terrifying. With her round eyes and long lashes, maybe this was how Miss Ha Yeon would look when she lost weight?\u201cWere you surprised?\u201dThe woman in the bamboo hat asked me.Perhaps she was trying to hide her eerie, exposed red eyes as she pressed down on her hat. It was better to not look at her.\u201cYou should have told me earlier. I almost killed you.\u201d-This woman is weird.No. She is strange. What she said didn\u2019t sound different from saying that I would be killed if I was just a trainee.\u201cI was about to tell you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dLooking at her face, it didn\u2019t seem like she was back to normal yet, but her voice was natural.\u201cWell, the elder raised his disciple well. Outwardly you look no different from the trainees.\u201dI think I knew why she said such a thing.It is said that a good master knows their opponent\u2019s skill to an extent.It is called Ki Feel or Ki intuition. The South Heavenly Iron Sword told me it would be difficult for even the most distinguished master to realize my full capabilities as I used innate qi and not internal qi.\u201cYou are good.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cBecause you are the first among those around me to block my attack.\u201dShe seemed proud of her skills. But I knew better.Even now, her attack was still making my stomach go weak. I didn\u2019t think a single attack would push me to the corner like this.\u201cIs the elder doing well? I haven\u2019t seen him at all in the past, just like the Second Blood Star.\u201dShe asked me about my teacher. In addition, she spoke of the Second Blood Star. So this woman\u2026Tak!And then someone appeared next to her. Miss Ha Yeon.She glared at the woman with displeasure and said,\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were leaving?\u201dIt felt different from yesterday. It didn\u2019t feel like she was angry, but it seemed like she hated this woman instead.And the woman said,\u201cI was. Anyone who sees this would discover that you are the master of the Six Blood Valley.\u201dSuch blunt words.\u201cYou know it won\u2019t go to that.\u201d\u201cRight. Right.\u201d\u201cGo quickly. I might not see you out.\u201d\u201cI can go on my own. Stop pushing me out. I am starting to get annoyed.\u201dThe woman turned to the front.Sh!Miss Ha Yeon\u2019s hands were stained red. The atmosphere suddenly turned violent, and I felt like I shouldn\u2019t be here.Had I known this would happen, I would have come a little later to do what I needed to do.\u201cYou here?\u201dThe voice I heard from far away was quiet. The woman smiled at the voice of the Great Doctor.It felt like something terrible was happening.Sh!The woman in the bamboo hat held her sword and looked at me.\u201cGive my regards to your teacher. And let\u2019s meet again.\u201dThen, she raised the bamboo hat slightly and smiled with her red eyes. Something about that expression made her look more terrifying rather than happy.-My previous owner told me to be careful of such a woman.-Aren\u2019t the ones with red eyes usually gumihos (Nine-tailed fox)?It\u2019s crazy because we were both talking about the same thing. I could still hear the woman\u2019s sword. I could feel it was in pain. The sword itself hated the woman.-Kill me\u2026The sword was suffering. What did she make the sword do to make it suffer so much?The woman then turned around and stood in front of the group of bamboo hats. She waved her hand and shouted.\u201cThe next time we see each other, let\u2019s fight.\u201dThen she leisurely took her people and left the place.It felt like a typhoon had just gone through here. When I met Hae Ack-chun for the first time, I was surprised at his strength, but differently, this woman gave me goosebumps instead.-What do we do? Do we need to handle her next time?-We grind hard then!I had a headache.There was someone with a more troubled expression than me. It was Ha Yeon, who was looking outside with a complicated expression.Should I call it bitterness and anger?\u201cMiss?\u201dShe looked at me as I called out to her.\u201cAh. Young master.\u201d\u201cAre you fine? Miss. Just now\u2026\u201dShe cuts off my words.\u201cThe Great Doctor is looking for you.\u201dIt was no different from saying don\u2019t ask about it. I had one guess, but this was beyond what I was capable of.Being Hae Ack-chun\u2019s disciple didn\u2019t mean I had to know everything.In the main hall, it was just the Great Doctor and me.As I watched him, I wondered about something. Why did the red-eyed woman look for him?-Is it because he has the best contacts in the world?Well, that was true. The quality of plaques he possessed was shocking. And as I struggled with my curiosity, he said to me.\u201cI heard that you are the elder\u2019s disciple, but you don\u2019t have a face which suits this place.\u201dWell, mine wasn\u2019t a face with evil intentions.Still, my family was well known. This face had also changed a lot after the suffering I went through in my past life.\u201c\u2026 There were a couple situations.\u201d\u201cI guess so. What is a person without situations? Roll your sleeves up and show me your wrist.\u201dI extended my wrist for him to check the pulse. He touched my pulse with the index and middle finger when he reached out.Can the broken dantian be fixed?- It doesn\u2019t matter if it isn\u2019t fixed, right?\u2018No.\u2019As Short Sword said, the dantian is meaningless to me now. I was fine without the dantian because I was honing my innate qi.But to avoid suspicion from Hae Ack-chun, my dantian had to be saved.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Great Doctor, who was checking my condition, frowned.Was something wrong?When I looked at him, puzzled, he opened his eyes and said.\u201cWonderful yet odd.\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?I hadn\u2019t been using any innate qi for him to feel, so his reaction made me anxious.Did he detect the innate qi within me through feeling my pulse?-It cannot be. The innate qi is different from the internal qi. It cannot be observed from just a pulse.\u2018Is that something your former owner said?\u2019-Yes.He trusted his former master a lot. I was looking at the Great Doctor with an anxious mind. He then gave me another order without answering my question.\u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d\u201cShirt?\u201dI hesitated for a moment before I took off my shirt. When I took it off, I felt my blood flow quickly as my heart kept pounding. The Great Doctor, who was holding my hand, released his grip.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cDid you eat the undersea plant?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019It was shocking.I hadn\u2019t even said anything, but he managed to guess from just feeling my pulse.He wasn\u2019t called the Great Doctor for nothing.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cLooking at your pulse, I can see that you have more ice qi when compared to normal people.\u201dHe was highly perceptive. Apart from that, the fact that there was ice qi still within me bothered me.I sat down and even cultivated right away, and I felt all the ice qi had been discharged from my body, but apparently that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201cHow did you end up eating it?\u201dI hesitated before answering. Would it be better, to tell the truth?\u201cI am a physician, a doctor. I do not speak about the condition of my patients to the others.\u201dHe was reassuring me like I was a child. Hearing his voice, it felt like I should tell the truth after all. Wouldn\u2019t many people fall for such words and give their secrets?\u201cI was looking for the plant and ended up going behind the frozen waterfall.\u201dI told him what had happened there.The four-eyed monster which suddenly bit my foot, the hot poison which spread in my body, and my attempt to stop it by eating the undersea plant.\u201cDid you say it had four purple eyes?\u201d\u201cDo you know of it?\u201d\u201cIt is a rare experience to meet the Human-faced Purple Eyed Snake.\u201d\u201cIs that a spirit beast?\u201dSince it looked rare, I wondered if it was. To that question, the Great Doctor shook his head.\u201cIt is no spirit beast. Rather, it can be said to be closer to a monster or demonic spirit.\u201d\u201cA demonic spirit?\u201d\u201cI heard from a young age that the monstrous snake there craves human flesh. They say it hides in the dark and eats people.\u201dI was terrified.The bones of the humans I saw. If I didn\u2019t have my two swords with me, I would have been its next prey!-Ahem!Short Sword made a triumphant snort. Right, I lived thanks to you.\u201cBut, the Human-faced Purple Eyed Snake doesn\u2019t like bright things, so if you had a torch in hand, it wouldn\u2019t have come close to you. You were quite unlucky there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Uh?\u201d\u201cThe snake and its purple eyes are too used to the darkness. That is why there is a verse in the old books which tells us to not put out fires in places where there might be the Human-faced Purple Eyed Snake.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dI felt embarrassed. If only I had a torch, I wouldn\u2019t have encountered that thing.For some reason, seeing that there was no story about that snake in my previous life, the person who brought back the plant must have gone in with a torch.But thanks to that, I had grown a little.\u201cAnyway, that was the reason.\u201d\u201cReason?\u201d\u201cNot only is there ice qi, but scorching heat within your veins. So I ask you again, what happened?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 is there poison qi inside?\u201dThe Great Doctor shook his head.\u201cThat is something I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d\u201cThe plant you ate is filled with yin energy and ice qi. It doesn\u2019t have the ability to detoxify a poison. But there is no poison within your body.\u201dThis was good.If the ice and yang energy weren\u2019t enough, then the poison would have stayed, and I would have ended up a corpse?\u2018Is it because of the innate qi?\u2019There was a time when it naturally detoxifies the body.I don\u2019t know how the poison of the snake was taken down. But the problem is that there is still ice qi and yang energy in my body.\u201cElder. If so, are the yang energy and ice qi fine? I mean, if it stays in the body, won\u2019t it be bad for me?\u201d\u201cObviously, something will happen.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s if only one of them remains.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cRight now, the ice qi and the Yang energy are balanced, so they are dissolved into your veins. It is no different from qi that you gain after taking a pill.\u201dLike the effects after taking a pill? Then, wasn\u2019t it a good thing?\u201cThen if I get my dantian treated, can I turn them into my qi?\u201d\u201cThat is, if you can absorb and balance the two qi inside your body and dissolve it, then you will be able to build up your qi faster than others. But it will all depend on your efforts.\u201dI was happy about this good news.To be honest, I thought it was a little too late to build my skills even if my dantian was recovered, but now this changed everything.Maybe I can be better than just your average low-grade warrior.\u201cThank you, elder!\u201dFeeling good, I got up and bowed down to him.\u201cDon\u2019t do that. I have done nothing yet.\u201dThe Great Doctor stopped me and pulled something from his arm. It was a plaque with his name on it.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThis is a plaque of mine. Take this.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dWhat is this?Since he was already treating my dantian, I didn\u2019t have to receive this anymore, so why?\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give it to me as I will be getting treated.\u201dAnd then he said the most unexpected thing.\u201cHow do I treat a healthy dantian?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Position Test (1)My mind went blank at the Great Doctor\u2019s words. They were words I thought I would never hear.My dantian was still damaged not long ago, so I was stunned at this news.\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t know. Well, that is why you asked for your dantian to be healed.\u201dMy reaction must have seemed funny. He smiled, then he took his hand, put it on my abdominal muscles, and pushed.Clench!\u201c\u2026 why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cThis is where the dantian is located.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but if you touch this place, there should be a weird feeling, like something is moving.\u201d\u201cSomething moving.\u201d\u201cThe pieces of a damaged dantian.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt was said that even a broken dantian would have pieces remain.\u201cHowever, there is a small flow within, as if the embers were revived like a burning bonfire. It is quite rare. The dantian is reviving itself.\u201d\u201cYou are saying my dantian has healed itself?\u201d\u201cFor now, I can only guess.\u201dThis was something I never expected. The dantian which didn\u2019t heal all my past life was now being healed after my rebirth.-Ahh. I feel drunk.-Well, congratulations. Wonhwi.Both of the swords liked this.\u201cYou said it was rare, so were there such cases like me?\u201d\u201cIt is rare to be able to come across one like this. In the first place, if their dantian is broken, most people give up. So it is rare to see it healed.\u201dEven the Great Doctor hadn\u2019t come across such cases. Having said that, the Great Doctor placed the plaque on the table.\u201cI didn\u2019t treat you, so here is the plaque. Take it.\u201dHe was honest. If all people were like him, the world would overflow with trust.Either way, I was lucky. In this case, I even got a plaque from the Great Doctor. Even if I had gotten two without being healed, I could have used one to get the dantian treated.-Can it be useful?\u2018Yes.\u2019The Great Doctor placed his plaque on the table. Putting it there meant I should take it, and I thanked him.\u201cWhat are you so thankful for?\u201dAs he said that, he smiled. It would be the best thing if I had a good relationship with this man.After confirming the dantian inside me, I left the hall and returned to Hae Ack-chun.I requested the Great Doctor not to let others know about my dantian getting better. Recognizing my intention, he nodded.Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t the kind of man to speak about his patients. It is better for me to hide the truth because Hae Ack-chun might covet the plaque of the Great Doctor.-But, how about your dantian?Short Sword asked, puzzled. I had a few guesses.-What?\u2018Do you remember the cultivation I did in the waterfall?\u2019After the fangs pierced my foot, I performed cultivation, and my body felt clean.Within a short period of time, the qi in my body changed, and even my wound began to heal. I didn\u2019t realize that my dantian was also healed then.-Oh. Right. That could be. If that is true, you should be thankful to the demonic spirit for doing that.Honestly, I was thankful. If he hadn\u2019t attacked, all of this wouldn\u2019t have happened.-Why aren\u2019t you talking?Iron Sword said to Short Sword.-A healed dantian is definitely good. There is, however, a concern.\u2018Concern?\u2019-My former owner could only learn the cultivation method after he destroyed his dantian.\u2018So?\u2019-Can you do it now? Practice without internal damage?Ah\u2026 come to think of it, the cultivation technique I was taught worked with a broken dantian. I somewhat understand what the iron sword was saying.I was the same.Was it possible for innate qi and internal qi to coexist? I couldn\u2019t give a sure answer. I had no such skills.-Hmm. That makes sense.-I think it is better to be careful. Wonhwi. If we try to hold everything in our hands, we might lose everything\u2026-Did your former owner also say that?-\u2026 Yes.As Iron Sword said, there was a need to be careful. There was no such thing as bad luck if one learned internal qi, and it then affected innate qi.However, if it didn\u2019t affect me, then it was different. I hoped for both to work together. Before long, I arrived at the cave where Hae Ack-chun was.\u2018Uh?\u2019But as I climbed the cliff, I heard a voice from inside.\u201cPlease, elder, give me strength\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dThe voice stopped as I climbed closer. All I heard was a moment of conversation.And then two people walked out.It was Hae Ack-chun and Miss Ha Yeon.-When did she get here?It was only her. The twins seemed to be training at the top of the peak, as I couldn\u2019t feel their presence. Then Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cI was wondering who it was, it was you? Why are you back this quick? Was there something wrong?\u201dHe asked me one thing after another. It felt like he was deliberately changing the topic. Of course, no one would question him.And what could Miss Ha Yeon\u2019s request for strength mean? It must have had something to do with what Bloody Hand Witch was attempting to ask Hae Ack-chun.\u201cWhy is there no answer?\u201d\u201cNo. The Great Doctor said I am fine.\u201dEverything is put into one line. Then the expression on Hae Ack-chun\u2019s face changed.\u201cKuahahahaha. I see. If he has the name of the Great Doctor, he should be able to do that much.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, young master.\u201dMiss Ha Yeon smiled.She seemed genuinely happy.\u201cRight. How long did he say it would take to recover perfectly? Still, I know it will take a while to cure it.\u201dI could never be careless with this old man, but I was ready to answer as I came prepared.\u201cWhen the Great Doctor performed the procedure, he said I should follow the method he showed for a fortnight, and it would be completely cured.\u201d\u201cA fortnight. Hahaha! Truly as expected of him!\u201dFortunately, the old man didn\u2019t doubt it. Instead, he was satisfied that it took shorter than he must have thought. Looking back, maybe I had been too sensitive about this.\u201cGood. But right now, I am\u2026 talking with the miss, so go up and train.\u201d\u201cNo, elder.\u201dHa Yeon shook her head and said.\u201cSince the young master has come, I will head down.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is fine. I already said everything I had to.\u201dShe politely bowed and moved.Hae Ack-chun frowned at that.\u2018\u2026 she revealed her identity.\u2019I could tell by the change in Hae Ack-Chun\u2019s attitude. Not long ago, he was looking down at her. Now that she had revealed her identity, he was being careful.After all, was this all related to the red-eyed woman who came before?\u201cPlease consider what I said.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dSaying those, she bowed to me and then began to walk down. Her movements were as light as a feather.Her footwork was as excellent as Hae Ack-chun\u2019s.\u201cPhew.\u201dLooking at her moving away, Hae Ack-chun sighed. He seemed like someone who wouldn\u2019t worry about things but seeing this, I was wrong.After her form completely vanished, he turned back and asked.\u201cHow far did you hear?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dWhen I was confused, he asked with an annoyed face.\u201cDon\u2019t drag this out.\u201dWas he trying to find out how much I heard?But I heard nothing! Because he ended it and came out!\u201cI only heard what the teacher said and about giving strength\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t lie, but I chose to tell the truth. I wondered what the reaction would be as Hae Ack-chun sat on the cliff.\u201cThis is annoying. It is bothering me.\u201dHe looked over the mountain peaks covered in snow and mumbled.What was bothering you?Was it the request of Ha Yeon or the granddaughter of the former cult leader? Hae Ack-chun, who repeated the same thing again, sighed as he said.\u201cDid you see her in the main hall yard?\u201d\u201c\u2026 her, you mean the woman with red eyes?\u201d\u201cRed eyes? Huh, you went that far?\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue. Seeing his unusual expression, was it possible that something had happened?He kept looking at the mountain and said.\u201cYou are quite strange.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cNot just one, but you witnessed two.\u201d\u2018Two?\u2019At Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, I realized I was right. That red-eyed woman had something to do with the Blood Cult, after all.And she looked so much like Ha Yeon. If I pretended to not know, this old man would kill me.\u201cWhat does it mean to see the two?\u201dHae Ack-chun didn\u2019t answer and mumbled.\u201cThat woman is right. Maybe I need to make a choice?\u201dNow I understand.Hae Ack-chun was thinking about who of the two women he had to support. No, looking at the way he spoke, he had no interest in it, but he seemed to be worried about something that Miss Ha Yeon had said.Hae Ack-chun, who looked troubled, said,\u201cOnce upon a time, it was good enough to be called the best and strongest in the Forces of Evil.\u201dIt\u2026 did he mean the Blood Cult?\u201cA relentlessly raging storm. I thought getting Kangho in our grasp wasn\u2019t a dream with him. But no matter how strong we were, if there were large powers and forces on the other side, we could be broken. It was the same with him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter going through so much, everything felt useless.\u201dA voice of despair.He showed a different side from his usual eccentric one.\u201cThe other ones speak about how to revive the cult, saying it is a revival or revenge, but it all looks meaningless.\u201dHae Ack-chun got up and stood on the cliff as he continued to talk.\u201cSo I put down everything and wandered around doing nothing. I\u2019d rather finish things I couldn\u2019t in the past and live my life.\u201dHe was talking about revenge against the South Heavenly Swordsman. I used to think of this old man as crazy, but he wasn\u2019t that.Now I know his story.\u201cBut you know. I was going to live like that, but the seeds he left have grown like weeds and are ready to bloom.\u201dThe flower blooming had to be the red-eyed woman.The last blood of the Blood Cult leader.These are the women who would play a vital role in the cult.Sh!Hae Ack-chun strode to me. He looked surer as he looked at me and said.\u201cAt a time like this, what would you do?\u201dLooking at him, he had come to a decision. I don\u2019t know why he was asking me despite already having clearly decided.I thought it was better to express my true intentions.\u201cIf you are going to wait for the flowers to bloom, it is better to leave them as it is, as the teacher said. Otherwise, maybe prepare the manure to help the flowers bloom faster?\u201dHearing that, Hae Ack-chun frowned and then,\u201cPrepare manure. Hahahaha!\u201dHe laughed out loud and then mumbled.\u201cRight. No matter which flower we choose, we must manure it right.\u201dIt seemed like he hadn\u2019t chosen one yet. It meant that he probably liked both, as he said.\u201cI will have to raise all three.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019A simple statement that meant a lot.Unlike the other Four Venerable Dignitaries or the Seven Blood Stars, this monster was moving with the will of not raising his own position but developing his own power.If this happens, the history I knew about this Ghastly Monster will change.\u201cFrom now on, you will have a lot of work to do. Kulkul.\u2019\u201cWork to do\u2026\u201dWith a smile, he said.\u201cThere are still six months left. Turn into a leader in those months.\u201dSix months?Come to think of it, six months from now is when the trainees will be given their first official position after testing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Position Test (2)All trainees will participate in the position test, which will be held in 6 months.In my previous life, I completed one year of training as a low-level warrior and then took the test. As a third-rate warrior with no skill, even among the other third-rates, my position was the least glamorous.Of course, a few low-level warriors later turned into middle-rank warriors, but it was late.\u201cBy then, you can be a leader.\u201d\u201cLeader?\u201dI felt confused. When I was losing it, he clenched his teeth as if trying to express it.\u201cYou can do it.\u201dHe exhaled that as if pondering over his words.It was clearly visible on his face what this man was up to by saying those words. That reaction showed that he was making fun of me.\u201cDo you think it will be that easy?\u201dThe leader position is possible only for the high-ranking warriors, all of whom were first-rate warriors. That was the minimum condition.Song Jwa-baek licked his lips and said,\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy, but we have a teacher to help us, so there is no need to worry\u2026 right?\u201d\u201cHyung\u2026 is right.\u201dI snorted at the twins\u2019 words. Apparently, since they got kidnaped by Hae Ack-chun as soon as they entered the cult, they didn\u2019t know how things work.-Why? Aren\u2019t his words right? This is where your background helps you.Short Sword, too, agreed with them.If the Blood Cult maintained the same workings as before and was stable, the words of a high person would work. But now, it was in the middle of being revived. Since they were in a position where they had to strengthen their force, they would value skills over personal connections.-You mean that without skills, we can throw away the dream of being a leader?\u2018There would also be the shame.\u2019On the contrary, the expectations of a disciple of Hae Ack-chun would be high, so failing would instead lead to disgrace.If that happened, the crazy man would go mad. I didn\u2019t need to go through it to know what he\u2019d do.\u201cYou speak because you don\u2019t know. Teacher, no, elder treating you a disciple up here and the instructors evaluating you as a trainee down there are two different things. You\u2019ll make a fool of yourself if you go down there with those thoughts.\u201d\u201cHow do you\u2026 phew, no, how does sahyung know that?\u201dWell, it\u2019s because I had been through it before. This was my second life, after all.\u201cHmm, it isn\u2019t me, but that\u2019s what the teacher said.\u201dOf course, he didn\u2019t say it.Hae Ack-chun only gave me the task of becoming a leader. But I had to speak about everything to ensure that these two also came to their senses.\u201cAh, I almost forgot. He also told me to prepare myself if I don\u2019t receive a major position after 6 months. You know what that means?\u201dSong Jwa-baek\u2019s face went stiff at the word \u2018prepare.\u2019 Since he had been through Hae Ack-chun\u2019s lessons, he knew better than anyone.\u201cYah!\u201d\u201cUhh?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be fucked up, get up!\u201dThis was good.The twins went to train right away as if they were motivated. They also passed the message to me that they would start to train in earnest.Even for me, such a significant position was a wall I could never dream of overcoming in my previous life.I went to the cave where the remains of the South Heavenly Swordsman were located.There were no bones in the cave now. Still, he was the owner of Iron Sword, and he taught me swordsmanship, so I couldn\u2019t leave the bones alone.A tomb was built on the mountain\u2019s peak, higher than any place Hae Ack-chun could easily see.Later, if there is a chance, I should move them to a sunny place and also make sure to build a monument for him.-But Wonhwi, where did that old man go in a hurry?\u2018Well?\u2019Hae Ack-chun, who told me to tell the twins of his instructions, left in a hurry saying he had to go somewhere.He said it would be done within a week, but I couldn\u2019t figure out where he went. But, judging from Hae Ack-chun\u2019s hasty temper, it had something to do with raising us three.He was fast.\u2018I don\u2019t know what will happen next.\u2019The Ghastly Monster.The Hae Ack-chun I knew didn\u2019t have any force behind him.-What do you know?I had no details about Hae Ack-chun\u2019s life. But there was some information that I knew.Hae Ack-chun acted independently, contrary to what others of his level did. He was acquainted with one of the Eight Great Warriors and lost his right arm to someone.That was six years from now.-Then, it could be different?It seemed like things had changed. By now, it has already changed a lot.I was supposed to just be a low-level trainee. Still, this time I became a disciple of Hae Ack-chun and somehow made important connections within the cult.\u2018\u2026 It is already changing.\u2019Looking back on it, things have changed.Each change in my actions has changed the future. Come to think of it, if I hadn\u2019t become the disciple of Hae Ack-chun, I wouldn\u2019t have met Miss Ha Yeon.\u2018\u2026 I am influencing it.\u2019It was a small change, but I don\u2019t know what the future would be like. It could lead to more significant changes.Then, I don\u2019t know if I have to consider all these new variables before acting on them.Only then will I be able to utilize the future I knew.\u2018Right now, I have to develop my strength in the shadow of Hae Ack-chun.\u2019This was my chance now. Unable to escape, I was turned into a disciple. If Hae Ack-chun created a force behind himself, I could be on top of it as his disciple.To do that, I need to become someone in a high position.\u201cPhew.\u201dThe long-awaited time has arrived.I sat cross-legged and prepared to cultivate my qi.I was going to use a basic cultivation technique from my family, one I learned when I was a child.Then Iron Sword said.-Be careful, Wonhwi. It might not work well with the innate qi.Don\u2019t say such scary things right from the start.I knew he was worried for me, but saying this right from the start was too much.I inhaled and exhaled slowly and began to do what I was taught. I started by concentrating on the pit of my stomach, but it didn\u2019t feel easy.\u2018It is hard.\u2019It had been a long time since I had done this, so I couldn\u2019t recreate the same feeling.In addition, I was too used to the innate qi, so this felt different. So I then focused on my dantian.A little time had passed?My heart was calming down, and the area under my stomach gradually turned warmer. Then my dantian reacted.\u2018I feel it.\u2019For a moment, I became so happy that I lost my concentration. However, I made up my mind and challenged myself to cultivate once again.From here, this was the vital timing.If I do the So family\u2019s cultivation, the qi in my dantian will pass through the middle of my chest.-Don\u2019t be so nervous.If the two qi weren\u2019t compatible, I would have to stop. Otherwise, I would have more to do.I moved the qi slowly.\u2018Be careful\u2026 careful\u2026\u2019The weak qi in my dantian went up little by little and moved to the center of my chest. I was trembling due to being nervous.Please! Please do it!Srr!\u2018Ah!\u2019-What is it?-Did the qi collide?Short Sword and Iron Sword asked in a worried tone. At their question, I smiled.The internal qi had passed my dantian to the center of my chest. It was now in the middle part, and there were no problems.There was no bumping or backflow of qi. After finishing it slowly, I stopped the cultivation.\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dAs soon as I stopped, I laughed out loud.-Stop laughing and tell me, was it good?At Short Sword\u2019s question, I nodded my head without a word. What we feared didn\u2019t happen.-Ohh!This result showed one thing.Unlike the other warriors, I have two types of qi. It may only be the first time, but being able to use the middle and lower abdomen at the same time was something even the South Heavenly Swordsman couldn\u2019t achieve.-Haa\u2026The South Heavenly Iron Sword, the most anxious one, sighed. Today was a lucky day.It felt like my life, which had been stuck since my return, was slowly unraveling and moving.\u2018It has been a while, dantian.\u2019The one that left home had come back.Three days passed like that.During my three days of cultivating internal qi, I learned two things. Fortunately, I was able to handle innate qi and internal qi. Still, it was impossible to use both at the same time.The innate qi cannot be mixed with the internal qi. And the opposite was also true.If I tried to make it happen, I felt like both qi had different feelings and paths they took.It would be nice to use them both simultaneously, but for now, I had no choice but to be satisfied with this.Even if my internal qi is exhausted, I still have the innate qi left to use. Depending on the situation, I could use it like a hidden card.And the second lesson was that I needed a different internal qi cultivation method, not the one learned from my family.\u2018It is lacking.\u2019For basic learners, the cultivation method wasn\u2019t bad. Still, even if I used it for an entire day, I could not absorb the yang energy and ice qi in my veins.For this reason, the internal qi\u2019s growth was slower than the innate qi\u2019s. The most necessary thing right now was to get a technique that worked efficiently with my body.-How about learning the old man\u2019s method?\u2018What?\u2019-That old man\u2019s technique that makes the blood circulate faster or something!Ha! Look at this one.Well, it did make sense. In the beginning, meridians are just a path through which the blood and qi flow.If Hae Ack-chun\u2019s cultivation method can be learned, it should push the blood faster into the body. The paths played the same role in cultivation, so it might be possible to absorb the qi in my veins.\u2018You are smart.\u2019-Hehehe. Right? Right?Short Sword replied excitedly. Sometimes this one could think of things I had never considered before.This was definitely a possibility. However, Hae Ack-chun had made sure to let me know that the cultivation method required a specific body condition for it to work, like the twins.Although I am a disciple, I wasn\u2019t sure he would teach me. And he might not teach me, considering that it could harm me.-Still, there is nothing wrong with asking. Or if you let him know about the qi in your veins\u2026\u2018Not that. It is better to hide it.\u2019Hae Ack-chun had indeed changed from before. However, hiding my condition was still the right choice unless I had a more intimate relationship.-Then how about asking the twins?Iron Sword asked.-Ho. Right. They learned it, too, right?The twins came to know it after they officially became his disciples. They were properly taught the methods, but would they do what I asked?-Yah. You are so na\u00efve. Throw the bait.\u2018Bait?\u2019-They hated it to the point of death that they had to call you sahyung, right? Try using that. We never know. Right?Hmm, would that work?There was nothing wrong with trying. Anyway, there seemed to be a long time before Hae Ack-chun came back, so it would be a waste of time to train using a lacking method.I got up early the following day, went to Song Jwa-baek, and asked him to teach me the True Blood Gold Body Cultivation technique. As expected, he rejected it.\u201cNever ever\u2026~ Anyway, the teacher told me not to tell anyone.\u201dAnd he laid down and began to sleep again. He cannot tell me the method.I don\u2019t know if the short sword\u2019s technique will work, but I decided to try.\u201cEh? Really? My dantian is restored, but I don\u2019t know when the teacher will return, so I asked in advance. Since we are of the same level, it should work, right? At this point, if I learn the teacher\u2019s technique from my sajae, I was planning to live like disciples of the same level\u2026\u201d-You are clever.\u2018Well, I can do this much.\u2019But I wasn\u2019t too sure.This wasn\u2019t a simple method, so I didn\u2019t think he would fall, but he looked like he was considering it\u2026?He had a weird expression on his face.What? Was he actually being swayed by the concept of being equals?He hesitated for a moment by lying down and looking at me as he squinted his eyes and said.\u201cEquals?\u201d-Ah. He took the bait.Short Sword said proudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Position Test (3)Small Short Sword\u2019s devious scheme made him take the bait.I thought he wouldn\u2019t teach me the technique because he would be scared of Hae Ack-chun. Still, when he heard my proposition for us to become equals, he immediately fell for it.I guess he didn\u2019t like me being sahyung. In a way, I couldn\u2019t understand how Short Sword managed to know this guy\u2019s heart so well.-Right, a child is a child.Well, he hasn\u2019t even stepped into manhood.I am just 16 or 17 now, but it is hard to call either of us the same. Besides, he must have hated it even more since we were the same age.But what of it? Hae Ack-chun wasn\u2019t the kind to care about that.Right now, he doesn\u2019t like calling me sahyung and all, but in the future, he will be shouting my name and begging.-How is it? Wonhwi.South Heavenly Iron Sword asked me as I was cultivating the new technique. It was a feeling which couldn\u2019t be put into words. It felt like blood was gushing inside my body.It was like being hung upside down on a cliff.-You look very red. Like your face is going to explode.Short Sword said while clicking her tongue. I think I understood why she was saying that.Because the blood in my body was circulating around very quickly.\u2018It is hot.\u2019I could feel the temperature of my body rising. I could understand why this was a technique only those with a particular constitution could perform.Hae Ack-chun used this technique, but a normal person could never even attempt it.-Do you think it will work?\u2018It should. I am sure.\u2019When I used the technique of my family, the ice qi and yang energy didn\u2019t even budge, but now I could make them flow little by little.Getting the balance right was the key. It\u2019s been less than half an hour.\u201cHuk! Huk! No more.\u201dUsually, when one practices qi cultivation, they would enter a state of peace when they end it. On the other hand, the True Blood Gold Body Cultivation technique made it difficult to attain peace as it manipulated the flow of blood, making the heart beat violently.So doing this for a long time was impossible.-For the time being, I think you need to divide your cultivation using half of this technique and half using your family technique.-Right, look at how much you are sweating now.Do people sweat while cultivating? Well, this was a first for me too. Still, there were results.Even after three days of cultivating using my family technique, I could gather very little qi in the dantian, and the ice qi and yang energy stayed still. But using the new technique for just half an hour, I got better results than in the past.\u2018Six months.\u2019Can my internal qi reach the state of a first-rate warrior?I felt a presence outside the cave. The only other people who knew about this place were the twins and Hae Ack-chun, so who is it?Tak!Someone came into the cave. A woman who covered her face with a white cotton cloth.And her eyes were exposed.She seemed to be one of the women under the Sixth Blood Star. She looked at me and said,\u201cYoung master. Could we ask for your time? The Sixth Blood Star seeks you.\u201dMe?I followed her to the Six Blood Valley and the main hall.When I asked how she found me, she said that Song Jwa-baek had told her.There was a small vacant lot on the outside, and there were two other women, but not the Sixth Blood Star.-Isn\u2019t that the one girl?Short Sword recognized one of the women. No, she was still a girl.The girl with a pure white face and concave features, Dam Yehwa, had joined as a trainee at the same time as me. She was receiving something from a woman wearing a white cloth face covering.\u2018Ah!\u2019It had to be this time.I remembered when Dam Yehwa was selected as the disciple of the Bloody Hand Witch. She must have stood out while being a trainee.When I arrived, they stopped what they were doing. The woman I was with guided me and asked me to wait near the main hall.I can just be asked to enter. Why make me wait outside?\u201cExcuse me, you were that one boy, right?\u201dI was planning on waiting quietly, but Dam Yehwa came and spoke to me. I think she remembered me from back then.It would have been strange if she didn\u2019t remember me considering what I did when I received the blood parasite.\u201cIt has been a while.\u201dI answered with a slight bow. Dam Yehwa looked young but already felt like a woman. I couldn\u2019t treat her the way I treated Song Jwa-baek.When I first saw her, she looked so scared, but now she was quiet and confident.Perhaps because she was chosen as a disciple.\u201cAre you training as a middle-rank trainee?\u201dUh? It felt like she came to tell me about her being a disciple. Seeing the expression on her face, she seemed excited about bragging about becoming a disciple of Sixth Blood Star too.It was good, but well, this showed that she is young.\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cStop. Samae.\u201dThe woman in the white cotton mask stopped her from speaking, causing her to bow.\u201cI apologize. Miss.\u201dIt looked like the disciple was well-disciplined.She wanted to brag, but she was stopped, so she probably felt embarrassed due to being scolded in front of me.Not long after, the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha appeared.I don\u2019t know how many sets of black clothes she had, but she looked like a grim reaper each time I saw her. I also couldn\u2019t see Miss Ha Yeon.There were the other two of the women who had been there before, but Miss Ha Yeon was missing.Chuk!When I tried to greet her, she raised her hand and said,\u201cEnough.\u201dAnd then came close to me and pulled something out of her hand. It was a plaque.Showing her plaque, she spoke with an expressionless face.\u201cThe disciple of our elder did something amazing.\u201dIt seemed like she was giving me praise for being his disciple. Thanks to that, Dam Yehwa, who discovered I was that crazy man\u2019s disciple stared at me wide-eyed.Right, I had a better background.But why was Han Baekha showing off the plaque?\u201cSixth Blood Star, what do you mean by this?\u201d\u201cYou made a bet, right?\u201d\u2018Um\u2026\u2019I guess she heard it from Miss Ha Yeon.I don\u2019t know how much she said, but the fact that Han Baekha knew meant that Miss Ha Yeon at least told her.It was difficult to ever be given a plaque by the Bloody Hand Witch.\u201cMiss Ha Yeon\u2026\u201d\u201cYou cannot meet the child now.\u201dI wanted to ask why, but this woman was as scary as the red-eyed woman.She cut off her own finger without blinking\u2026 Uh? The bandage was wrapped around her hand.-Didn\u2019t she cut off her finger?Looking at the bandages, the cut finger area looked intact. This was miraculous.Could it be that the finger was attached?-Isn\u2019t that the Great Doctor\u2019s work?As Short Sword said, it did seem to be like that.They said he could cure anyone except the dead, but I didn\u2019t know that even a severed finger could be attached.-That is interesting. Can a severed neck be attached then?My dear Short Sword, you\u2019d die if the neck was cut. In any case, that man had stellar skills. Receiving his plaque was becoming better every passing day.Han Baekha clicked her tongue.\u201cTo bet and ask for the Miss\u2019 plaque. I don\u2019t know where your guts came from.\u201dHer eyes and voice clearly said she didn\u2019t like me. It\u2019s definitely because of the plaque I was getting, especially since I asked for the plaque of the person she was serving.And to give it to me at all. Why bother saying all this when all she got to do was follow the orders?\u201cBring it.\u201dOne of the female disciples behind her brought a small bag to me.I asked them what it was.\u201cThese are the herbs that will help you recover.\u201dAh\u2026I think this was Miss Ha Yeon\u2019s doing. Didn\u2019t she also take care of me during the search and ask me to not overuse my innate qi?Han Baekha showed the plaque in her hand.[Baek Ryeon-ha.]Baek Ryeon-ha?I think this was Miss Ha Yeon\u2019s real name. I did expect her to use a fake name, but she used her real name on the plaque.I hesitated because of Han Baekha\u2019s attitude, and she nodded to the plaque I reached out to take.It was then.Sh!She dropped the plaque down, and I hurriedly tried to grab it as she grabbed onto my wrist.Pak!Her clench was so strong that I couldn\u2019t help but feel stuck in it. What should I do?She was way too strong for me to even push her hand away.\u2018Ah!\u2019At that time, a cold feeling ran through my wrist.It seemed to be Han Baekha\u2019s internal qi. As it kept moving, it went into my dantian.However, with the vast gap of power between us, I began to feel cornered before it stopped.\u201cSixth Blood\u2026\u201d\u201cYou better keep your mouth shut.\u201dHer internal qi moved around as if scanning every inch of my body before it vanished.And then she said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you have as much qi as we feared.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019She was just checking my body? Does she have to startle me like this to just look at my condition?Or did she have another purpose?But thanks to this, I learned one thing. She looked into my body but couldn\u2019t notice my innate qi.\u2018This is good.\u2019Neither Miss nor this woman noticed it. Clearly, the innate qi is my trump card.And she smiled.\u201cOur Miss rushed this, considering how she got you a pill.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cShe said you are in the process of recovering your dantian, but it would be better to not overdo it. If you try to keep building qi in a hurry, it will break your body.\u201dThe pills and elixirs were things I would never be able to get.However, she seemed to have misunderstood that the yang energy and ice qi in my body were due to cultivation.Even the Great Doctor said it had a similar result to consuming pills.\u2018Ah.\u2019Then wouldn\u2019t I be misunderstood by Hae Ack-chun later?If he looked inside my body, he would definitely notice it. I had to find a suitable excuse for it.If not, do I have to get punished again?Sh!She let go of my wrist. How much do I have to cultivate to ensure that the two energies are fully absorbed?I bowed my head to her and stored the Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s plaque in my sleeve. And then Han Baek-ha said,\u201cI hope you don\u2019t use that plaque for useless things.\u201dUseless things.A warning.Well, considering who the plaque was from, a warning was a must. Now can I go?Tuk!\u201cThen, I will go.\u201dAs I was about to leave, she suddenly told me.\u201cWould you like to make a bet with me?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dWhat was this now?Was she trying to steal the plaque she just gave me? Well, as if she read my mind, she said.\u201cIf you are worried about me taking away the plaque you were given, then don\u2019t worry. Since the young master is a good person to bet with, I think I want to repay him a little bit.\u201dWhat was it if she wasn\u2019t aiming to take back the plaque?If I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t have to do it, so I grasped my hand and said.\u201cHow can I bet with the Sixth Blood Star? Please stop saying\u2026\u201d\u201cIf the young master wins, it might not be as good as the elder\u2019s, but I will teach you one of my techniques.\u201d\u2018\u2026 Techniques?\u2019What did this woman think of others? Anyway, I think I might just be tempted by that offer.Even if it stank, I liked it. It was common sense to try it, at least.\u201cI am sorry, how can I covet the technique of\u2026\u201dShe cut me off again.\u201cIf I win, the young master can tell his teacher to reconsider my proposal. Simple right? This wouldn\u2019t be much of a loss to the young master.\u201dThat was her purpose. It seems like she wanted me to persuade Hae Ack-chun. But I didn\u2019t know which side the old man was leaning towards.-Still, there is no harm for you.It was definitely not a bad condition, but these are just words. I can only judge based on what the bet is.\u201cYehwa.\u201dAnd then she called Dam Yehwa.The girl walked up to the front.\u201cThis low-level trainee is a kid I took in three days ago.\u201dHaving never mastered martial arts, she had to be a low-level trainee. That was why she was taken under the Sixth Blood Star.\u201cI will teach this child the lady\u2019s treatment for as long as I stay in the Six Blood Valley.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is a position test 6 months from now. Until then, the purpose is to raise this child into a higher rank warrior.\u201dShe said it so casually, but it was an arrogant statement.To make a first-rate warrior in just half a year. Well, she at least is better than Hae Ack-chun.The man just told me to take the place of a leader and not just a first-rate warrior.Looking at this, I could clearly understand why this was the reason those who mastered martial arts put in the effort to have excellent disciples.\u201cBetting is easy. It is a contest to see who will become a higher ranked warrior among the two.\u201dHan Baekha\u2019s eyes showed confidence. It was because she found a kid with inherent talent and coveted her.She thought of this bet because she was sure of making this child into a first-rate warrior.\u201c\u2026 what if both of us become first-rate?\u201d\u201cThen you two will compete, and we see who wins.\u201dA very warrior-like idea. There was no draw.-I said to listen, and you ended up accepting it.\u2018I have to aim higher than that. So be quiet and take it.\u2019My goal wasn\u2019t to become a first-rate warrior. It was to be a leader.It can be an adventure or a motivator for me.If I win, I get a chance to know one of her techniques which are known to be one of the best in the cult.-There is nothing wrong with losing. You can say that you will consider it.\u2018Not that.\u2019-Uh? Why?\u2018If I deliver those words, regardless of whether I bet or not, I will be giving the old man an impression that I stepped to the side of Baek Ryeon-ha.\u2019Perhaps, this was her goal.That was not good for me. There is something I learned as a spy.-What is that?\u2018If you are not sure, never bet.\u2019-You learned that as a spy? It is like some kind of gambling rule.\u2018It is similar.\u2019-What?\u2018When a power struggle happens, one shouldn\u2019t be biased.\u2019-Why? Isn\u2019t that fat kid better than that red-eyed one? At least she is helping you.Of course, in terms of friendships, this was correct. However, perhaps her favor was given after already calculating me to be the old man\u2019s disciple.Maybe this was her move to coax me.-Well, it could be. Still, I hate the other one more.You never know. Maybe the red-eyed woman holds the majority interest in the current Blood Cult.-Why? How can you know that without seeing anything?\u2018If that was not the case, she would have come to persuade Hae Ack-chun like Miss Ha Yeon or Baek Ryeon-ha did.\u2019-Ah, right.The red-eyed woman just asked me to send her regards to the old man. The way she spoke was relaxed too.Looking at that alone, she must already have had the upper hand in the fight. And she decided to not even hide that.\u2018Therefore, it is dangerous to get close to one side.\u2019If Baek Ryeon-ha doesn\u2019t become the cult leader, then the people on her side might be killed. Either they get taken advantage of or killed miserably.This applies to the Forces of Justice as well as all other sects.-I see.\u2018What?\u2019-The reason why you survived so long despite the power struggle.Right.If you don\u2019t get noticed, you don\u2019t die. And in this life, I was going after power.In the vacant lot that So Wonhwi had just left, a woman with a white cotton mask on her face appeared. Everyone, including the Bloody Hand Witch, bowed their heads to her.The woman was the formerly plump Baek Ryeon-ha.Normally, she should be around the same size as the other two fat women, but she had lost a little weight.\u201cDid he accept it?\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha asked as Han Baekha nodded.\u201cHe accepted. I don\u2019t think he is as smart as you said.\u201dHan Baekha was confident that she would win the bet. This child, Dam Yehwa, whom she had discovered has the best body, which works well with her technique.More than any of the disciples she had.If she taught her intensively for half a year, she was sure of making her a first-rate warrior.\u201cIf we win the bet, it will be easier to convince that man through the child.\u201dHan Baekha was sure.\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cDo you not believe in it?\u201d\u201cI do. But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t the kind to get into losing bets.\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha was convinced that Wonhwi would never bet on a losing hand. Han Baekha smiled and said.\u201cHuhuhu, don\u2019t worry, miss. With this child\u2019s talent. We will never lose.\u201d\u201cTrust me!\u201dDan Yehwa spoke in a voice of determination. She too, was determined to win it for the teacher who selected her.And six months passed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Leader (1)There is a large site called the town square in the Six Blood Valley.This place could accommodate the largest number of people out of all the training grounds in the Six Blood Valley. The site was usually never full, but today it was crowded with warriors and trainees of the Blood Cult.\u201cStand straight!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dA shout with a loud voice was heard along with a sharp sound. After one year of training, the trainees were transformed into warriors of the Blood Cult.Starting from the right, the upper-rank trainees were positioned with \u2018Upper\u2019 written on the back of their shirts. In the middle were the middle-rank trainees with the word \u2018Middle\u2019 written on their shirts.And lastly, even the lower-ranked trainees did the same.\u201cGood.\u201dStanding on the podium was Gu Sang-woong, the head of Six Blood Valley, looking down at the trainees with a satisfied face. Behind him were the five major leaders under him.Three of them were already replaced with new ones. One was missing, and the two were removed for attacking the lady.The man then began to explain the position test to the trainees. The position test would proceed as follows.All the trainees would participate in the Blood Demon Combat.All of the trainees practiced it. It was the basic combat technique of the sect that was taught. Only the Sixth form, the Twelfth form, and the Thirty Sixth form could be used.Once that was completed, they could attain the position of a regular warrior.\u201cAmong those who pass as warriors, those verified by the respective masters will take the position test for a middle-rank warrior.\u201dMiddle-rank warriors meant that they qualified as second-rate warriors. It required a test that utilized internal qi.Most low-ranked trainees were called third-rate warriors, and many couldn\u2019t master martial arts and other things because of low internal qi.On the other hand, to be recognized as one of the second-rate warriors, the trainee should have at least 10 years\u2019 worth of internal qi.One of the easiest methods was by using a Cataclysm Stone. The Cataclysm Stone was a stone that was hard enough and was able to handle an infusion of internal qi.Then the test continued with a fight against a middle-rank warrior of the Blood Cult. If a trainee can last more than 30 seconds, they will get that role.Clench!A middle-rank warrior standing in front of the podium was warming up. They, too, went through the same process to get these roles. Unlike the low-ranked ones, those in the middle rank got to learn the martial arts of the upper-ranked warriors as well as the martial arts of the Blood Cult. All of this was done through one year of additional training.\u201cWooo!\u201dThe trainees exclaimed as he explained.Of course, those who shouted were the ones aiming for that role.\u201cFinally, an upper-ranked warrior. Among the trainees this time, those taking the test for the position of an upper-ranked warrior are\u2026 um, 6 members.\u201dGu Sang-woong looked at one of the leaders. He was a leader with thick eyebrows and wearing a sword on his side. The man was also in charge of the upper-ranked trainees.\u201cNot bad.\u201dThat leader shrugged his shoulders. There were three more places like the Six Blood Valley where the test was happening, and having six such high-level trainees was a good thing.\u2018A well-trained first-class warrior can deal with dozens of soldiers on their own.\u2019Cultivating such warriors wasn\u2019t an easy task, not for Blood Cult at least. So having 6 people come out of this was a good thing.Usually, only 3 or 4 people would qualify.\u201cWho is that?\u201dFive of the trainees jumped up from their places.\u201cTrainee Lee Gyu!\u201d\u201cTrainee Ha Mun-chan!\u201d\u201cTrainee Jo Song-won!\u201d\u201cTrainee\u2026\u201dSeeing them all confidently stand up, Gu Sang-woong smiled happily. Behind the trainees were people who were observing everything.They were sent by elders and the Seventh Blood Star to select useful trainees from here.Usually, those who have been given the rank of middle or higher were chosen.\u2018This will be a fierce fight.\u2019Recruiting an upper-rank warrior was a war.Each side would want to hold such a warrior under them and do anything for it. This benefits the trainee as well.Unlike the second-rate and third-rate warriors, first-rate warriors could choose their own positions.That way, there would be no fights between selectors.\u2018Which side will we get good talent?\u2019He watched it every time, but this selection time was the most interesting one.Usually, it wasn\u2019t possible to select more than two people at most to one side, but people get greedy for talent. This was a chance to see the conflict between the factions within the cult.\u201cNow, let\u2019s start the test!\u201dWith Gu Sang-woong\u2019s cry, the trainees\u2019 test began. Testing of forms and basic movements was done in an hour.Among the 106 trainees, 50 were confirmed to be third-rate warriors. All but two of them were considered to be definite third-rate warriors.\u201cNow we start the test of middle-rank warriors.\u201dA total of 59 people were taking the test. Eight people failed the test that used the stone, and those were demoted to third-rate warriors.\u201cTch.\u201dSeeing that, Gu Sang-woong clicked his tongue, and Hae Okseon, who was in charge of the middle-rank warriors, was already losing it.Fortunately, the other ones succeeded in moving ahead.Because the upper-rank trainees were already different from the others, they could move up without a problem and attracted the attention of everyone.\u201cMiddle-rank warriors, come out.\u201dUrr!The next thing was the battle test involving the 41 remaining trainees. There were a total of 37 who managed to endure it for 30 seconds against a full-fledged middle-rank warrior.The four who couldn\u2019t endure were demoted.\u201cPlease give me a chance!\u201d\u201cCommander!\u201dBegging wouldn\u2019t help anyone.It didn\u2019t mean they would be given another chance just because they left a mark on the stone. The position test happened perfectly with no second chances.\u201cThere are 37 finalists, not bad.\u201dIt was confirmed that there were 37 second-rate warriors. After one year of training, they will be full-fledged second-rate warriors.\u201cIs it just one more test left for first-rate warriors?\u201dMore than 2 hours have passed. The position test started early in the morning and was now going to noon. With this speed, the position test would be completed before lunch.\u201cNow then, the test for the upper rank\u2026\u201dGu Sang-woong was about to announce the start but then turned around. The other leaders also did the same.A group of people was coming from the main hall. They were the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, and her disciple.\u2018What is this?\u2019Gu Sang-woong was confused.\u201cCommander, there\u2026\u201dGu Sang-wooned looked at where Hae Okseon was pointing to. Other people were coming from the other side.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019There was a giant savage dressed in leopard clothes. The Ghastly Evil.Even from a distance, the man\u2019s force could be seen clearly. Behind him were Song Jwa-baek, Song Woo-hyun, and So Wonhwi, all of whom had larger builds than normal kids their age.-We got the attention.\u2018Yes.\u2019It seemed like we popped out at the right time. When we appeared like this, everyone was bound to look.Everyone on the grounds was looking at us, from the trainees to warriors.-He is really liking this.Song Jwa-baek, who was next to me, was smiling at this. On the other hand, his twin had an expressionless face. Hae Ack-chun mumbled in annoyance.\u201cThat damned wench is doing the same thing.\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at the Bloody Hand Witch who was coming from the other side.He hated it because she was doing the same thing as him.\u2018Skip the low and middle-rank tests.\u2019\u2018Uh?\u2019\u2018Well, you are my disciple. I don\u2019t expect you to go through those lowly tests.\u2019That was what Hae Ack-chun told me before coming here. He was the one who suggested that we skip the basic warriors\u2019 test.However, Han Baekha seemed to have the same thought. When the upper-rank warrior test was about to start, I could see Dam Yehwa, her disciple, come forward.\u201cIf you make me lose face, prepare yourself.\u201dHae Ack-chun only made us nervous. I have been seeing him for over a year, so I was used to it.-I don\u2019t think he has.Song Jwa-baek\u2019s expression went shaky. I could understand him.While training together, I think I saw him get beaten up at least once a month. It was an indiscriminate beating.-Do you not remember that time?\u2018What?\u2019-When he found out that he taught you that cultivation?\u2018Ahh.\u2019We only got discovered less than a month ago.I didn\u2019t know it, but when I began to cultivate using Hae Ack-chun\u2019s technique, wounds began to appear on my body, and, thanks to that, we got found out. Song Jwa-baek ended up getting beaten and then hung from the cliff for almost half a day.Maybe the memories were too engraved into his mind. The brat never disobeyed him again after that.-What if it was done to you too?Do you think I haven\u2019t been through it already?Hae Ack-chun\u2019s training and martial arts always reminded me of hell. I thought he would give me advice on swordsmanship, but I instead spent half a day being honed alongside the twins.He rolled people around so much that it would probably be better to die.-Thanks to that, I have strong muscles.I admit it.It\u2019s not as much as the twins, but my muscles were as hard as a stone. While I was talking with the short sword, we arrived at the podium.\u201cLong live the Blood Cult!\u201dGu Sang-woong and the five leaders paid their respects to Hae Ack-chun and then bowed to the next in rank, the Bloody Hand Witch. The Bloody Hand Witch then greeted Hae Ack-chun.\u201cI greet the elder.\u201dBetween them, Gu Sang-woong carefully spoke.\u201cWhy did the two of you come to the site of the position test\u2026\u201d\u201cKulkul. Why do you think we\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cTo make my disciples take the test.\u201dHae Ack-chun pointed to us with his large hand.\u201cIt is the same with me. Commander Gu.\u201dHan Baekha put Dam Yehwa to the front.It had been six months since I last saw her, and she looked different from then. She was mature, and her shyness had been replaced with confidence.\u201cChanged.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue, looking at Han Baekha.Han Baekha didn\u2019t care and said to the commander.\u201cI was a little late, but fortunately, it seems like things are heading to the upper-rank warrior test, so can this child also participate?\u201d\u201c\u2026 The upper-rank warrior test?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGu Sang-woong was confused. It was natural for him to react like that.I, too, thought that taking the test from the start would be right. Seeing this, I realized that a trainee\u2019s background was important.\u201cWill that do? Or not?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked the commander as if threatening him and Gu Sang-woong looked shocked as he said.\u201cIf they are disciples of mine, they can easily pass the low and middle ranks.\u201d\u201cHehe. You are saying the obvious things.\u201dHae Ack-chun shrugged. Gu Sang-woong lowered his voice and said,\u201cBut Elder. Not just the trainees but the other people and the members of the Seventh Blood Star\u2019s group are also watching this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI looked at the two men the commander pointed to. They looked like other elders and people of the Seventh Blood Star. They were startled when Hae Ack-chun looked at them and bowed.\u201cLong live the Blood Cult!\u201dI could even hear their shouts.\u201cSo what about them?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad, nor worrisome, thing for him. Gu Sang-woong then said.\u201cStill, many eyes are watching us, so how about certifying the disciples first?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen Hae Ack-chun looked like he was about to get angry, Han Baekha intervened.\u201cElder. His words make sense. He is the commander and wants to do things according to the cult\u2019s laws, so not listen to what he has to say?\u201d\u201cHuh! You shouldn\u2019t talk about laws.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.\u201cSo, what do you mean by certifying?\u201dAt his question, Gu Sang-woong pointed toward the Cataclysm Stone, which was used during the middle-rank warrior test.\u201cIf the disciples prove they are qualified to head up to the upper-rank warrior test, no one will be able to speak against them.\u201dIn other words, it was meant to prove they had the right to go higher. At these words, Han Baekha smiled. It didn\u2019t seem like a difficult task for her.\u201cTo maintain the commander\u2019s face, I will do this. Yehwa.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher.\u201dHan Baekha pointed to the stone, and, realizing what she meant, the disciple walked towards it.Her hands were dyed red.\u2018The Blood Jade Hand\u2019She learned it for only 6 months but could still manifest it.The color of her hands was blood dark now. I heard that the darker it was, the stronger it was. Now I understood why she was taken in as her disciple.\u201cHap!\u201dWith a brief word, she struck the stone.Chhhk!And the part she touched began to crack around themark left by her palm.\u201cOhh!\u201dExclamations flowed from the mouths of the trainees. This was something they didn\u2019t get to see during their test time. Even the leaders were shocked.Dam Yehwa politely bowed and went back.\u201cI did my best, but it was embarrassing.\u201dHan Baekha smiled while looking at her and turned to Gu Sang-woong.\u201cIs this enough?\u201d\u201cYes. You have a really talented disciple. To achieve such a thing within 6 months.\u201dGu Sang-woong praised Dam Yehwa with a surprised look. Han Baekha nodded with satisfaction and looked at Hae Ack-chun.\u201cHuh!\u201dHae Ack-chun just snorted. He then looked at me and said loudly.[Be prepared if my name gets dragged down.]Ah\u2026What do I do to not let that happen? Does that mean that I need to show more than her?\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you going out?\u201dAt his urging, I walked forwards. I could see her palm print on the stone.I couldn\u2019t even take the middle-rank warrior test in my past life, so I don\u2019t know how much was needed to level up.-Are you going to do it with internal qi?\u2018Yes.\u2019After all, the innate qi is my secret weapon. I had to use just the internal qi for this.I clenched my fist and caught my breath.\u201cPhew.\u201dI then began to increase my qi. It was taking me a moment as I had been building up my qi through hard work.\u2018Eighth level!\u2019\u201cHap!\u201dI clenched my fist and then pushed it forward to the stone. If it was the eighth level of internal qi, it had to shake the stone at least, right?Crack!My fist had pierced into it.\u2018Uh?\u2019I thought that it would be hard, but this\u2026 It seemed too weak. Almost half my fist went into the stone.I turned my head in silence.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Han Baekha\u2019s forehead had wrinkled up, and Hae Ack-chun was smiling from the other side.-You set the benchmark high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Leader (2)\u201cH-his fist pierced the stone.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a mark that was left.\u201dI could hear the sound of whispers from the trainees all around me. Even the leaders have changed the way they look at me.Did those eyes, which looked at Dam Yehwa in a positive light, change as well?Well, those eyes at least looked more vigilant after what I did.-That\u2019s obvious. What you did was like showing off a part of your internal qi.The South Heavenly Iron Sword said that to me.As he said, I was showing just a part of my power. In just six months, my internal qi had progressed at a shockingly fast rate.There were several factors for this growth. One major factor, by far, was the yang energy and ice qi, which had been piled up in the body.-The old man was a big help too.Hae Ack-chun taught me how to do the Ming Wheel Cultivation.This method differed from the Xing Ming Cultivation technique, which was based on the invincible theory emphasizing balance in the body to complement cultivation. This other cultivation method was more about being appropriate for my body type.Shh!In any case, after the task was done, I bowed.\u201cHuhu, still far away.\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at me and shouted. Those words and his face said different things.Even though he said that his face kept looking at Han Baekha\u2019s pale face.\u201c\u2026 the disciples\u2019 results aren\u2019t normal. As expected of the elder.\u201dThe Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, who had been frowning, shortly returned to her expressionless face again. She was incredibly good at controlling her emotions. Dam Yehwam, however, bit her lip and looked at her master.-She seems like she\u2019s taken notice.\u2018Right.\u2019Actually, even Hae Ack-chun was a man who didn\u2019t know how to make a wise bet and did it only for the sake of his pride. Then what about her? The student who got caught in the middle due to my teacher and her master?She couldn\u2019t handle this.\u201cWhat are you doing? Show your skills too.\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, Song Jwa-baek moved to the stone. I could hear his voice in my head.[Look. How great I will do!]This guy was stupid. It seemed like defeating me was his life goal.\u201cPhew.\u201dSong Jwa-baek adjusted his breathing and began using his internal qi. His skin began to turn a little brown as he did.The reason for the change in his skin color was due to the cultivation method he used.-This was expected.As Small Short Sword said, the result of their own cultivation was greater compared to my results when I used the same method. I note that Hae Ack-chun kept looking at Song Jwa-baek. Perhaps he was figuring out how much this method worked for his other student.\u201cHaaah!\u201dWith that shout, Song Jwa-baek clenched his fist and punched at the stone.Papak!The moment his fist touched it, small pieces of the stone bounced off. And when the fist collided, parts of the rock shattered and fell all around.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cIt broke!\u201dThe trainees were full of admiration again.\u201cIsn\u2019t he stronger?\u201d\u201cIt almost seemed like the whole thing would break into pieces.\u201dHearing the voices of the trainees, Song Jwa-baek looked proud as he turned toward Hae Ack-chun.His expression was asking, \u2018I did well, right?\u2019. He longed for a compliment, but the teacher\u2019s expression differed from what he expected.\u201cTch.\u201dHe was clicking his tongue! The stone wasn\u2019t just pierced, but it even broke! Yet the reason he had this expression was simple.It was because Song Jwa-baek\u2019s internal qi wasn\u2019t concentrated in one place when he punched. That was why the stone\u2019s surface was damaged but not broken altogether.\u201cThe elder\u2019s disciple is expected to do this much.\u201dAt Han Baekha\u2019s words, Hae Ack-chun shouted at my fellow disciple.\u201cIf you are done, come back!\u201dEven I could feel that Han Baekha\u2019s words couldn\u2019t be taken as a compliment. Hae Ack-chun was clearly annoyed.-Look at that face, man. I feel bad.Song Jwa-baek came in with a gloomy expression as things didn\u2019t happen the way he wanted. Although he didn\u2019t meet the teacher\u2019s expectations, everyone else on the ground was looking at him in awe.\u201cGo.\u201dAt the command of Hae Ack-chun, Song Jwa-baek\u2019s younger twin, Song Woo-hyun, nodded. His body had changed so much in just 6 months.Normally, he would speak clumsily or imitate his older brother, but he no longer did that now.\u201cI know the results without even looking at it anymore.\u201dGu Sang-woong, the commander, now understood what Hae Ack-chun meant at the start. Three people who came in the middle of the examination showed results that regular trainees could not.It was then\u2026Bang!\u2018Bang?\u2019Everyone\u2019s eyes changed. They were all looking at one place because the sound was close to a roar, and they were all looking at Song Woo-hyun.They didn\u2019t think that he would use his head to hit the stone. The part where his head had impacted the stone was caved in, and that wasn\u2019t even the end.Crack!\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The stone split in half from the point of impact. No, was his head made of diamond or something? Short Sword clicked her tongue.-\u2026 Wonhwi. He is a boulder.The crowd went silent. The trainees opened their mouths one by one, but they were all at a loss for words. It was the same for the other observers too.Not all of them were flapping their mouths, but none could take their eyes off the stone.\u201cKuahahahah! Right. Right. That is the level that has to be shown!\u201dHae Ack-chun laughed wildly this time. I also spotted Dam Yehwa looking relieved?-Is she feeling relieved for not going against him?Um\u2026 it seemed like it. It looked like she would be sulky if she was asked to deal with a guy who breaks stones with his head.\u2018Oh, seriously.\u2019The achievement of handing over the crown to one another was displayed here. I had nothing more to say.Did he lose his hair to gain a superpower? I was curious how Song Jwa-baek would react.\u201cHaa.\u201dHe kept sighing too many times, being frustrated at the performance of his younger twin. This was expected.In this way, the show that proved the skills of the twins, myself and Dam Yehwa were done. No one objected anymore. Instead, they now realized how strong the teachers were.Our intrusion into the test was now done, and we were automatically pushed into the upper-rank warrior tests.Gu Sang-woong, the commander, then said aloud.\u201cWho will take the upper-rank position test?\u201dA warrior with a blue belt around his waist walked to the front. A blue belt signified his status as an upper-rank warrior. The biggest benefit of achieving this rank was being able to remove the Blood Parasite from within the body.That was why the trainees all looked at the blue belt. Song Jwa-baek then spoke to Hae Ack-chun.\u201cTeacher. I will\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dHae Ack-chun prevented him from going first. Thinking back on it, it looked like he wanted Dan Yehwa to head out first.But it wasn\u2019t just him. Even Han Baekha was preventing her disciple from going out first.\u201cLook carefully. This is about the level of upper-rank warriors, a first-rate warrior of our sect.\u201dAlthough knowing he would have the upper hand in any fight, Song Jwa-baek could understand Hae Ack-chun\u2019s meaning. Despite his eccentric personality, this man was a dedicated teacher, though he did suck at actually teaching.\u201cLong live the Blood Cult!\u201dSome of the upper-rank trainees jumped up from their places and bowed. Then one walked to the front, looked at the podium, and said.\u201cTrainee Ha Mun-chan.\u201dTak!\u201cBu Seo-jung.\u201dThe warrior, too, replied with his name and Gu Sang-woong on the podium said.\u201cIf you can last 12 attacks against him, you pass.\u201d-Just 12?\u2018It cannot be just that.\u2019A trained warrior means that he was a first-rate warrior.He was different from others because the level of martial arts was also different. It would be no easy task to defend the body from any 12 attacks or techniques he might use.I could tell from the trainee\u2019s tense face.\u201cStart.\u201dBoth the trainee and the warrior made some distance between each other at the commander\u2019s words. As if conceding to the young one, the warrior gestured for the trainee to make the first move.After some hesitation, Ha Mun-chun ran toward him.Tat!The trainee ran quickly and threw a kick at the warrior\u2019s head. Looking at his body shape and how he deployed the kick, I could tell he was well trained.But it was easily evadedPak!The warrior avoided it by moving to the side before aiming a counter at the trainee\u2019s leg. This was all done in one movement.However, Ha Mun-chun didn\u2019t dodge it. Instead, he threw his upper body at the warrior to elbow him in the face.Tatak!The trainee was pushed to take three steps back, which made him lose his balance. Yet, I noted that he used the loss of balance to stabilize his core strength.\u201cPretty good.\u201dHae Ack-chun mumbled.As he said, this trainee, Ha Mun-chun, was a fighter. The ability to judge, respond and understand instantly was important in battles, fights, and confrontations. If those skills were taught to this trainee, he would be an excellent, first-rate warrior.-I think he is being dragged around.Short Sword said, puzzled.\u2018It is fine to do that.\u2019-Why?This was a test that was supposed to select the future of the cult.In other words, it was to select those who had the potential to become first-rate warriors. If a warrior like the one in front of the podium wanted to defeat the trainee, he could do it in three attacks instead of twelve.The two collided again in earnest.The warrior didn\u2019t use any other martial arts other than close combat attacks. Despite the fight being difficult for him, the trainee managed to persevere until the time of the 14th attack.\u201cEnough!\u201dThe two stopped at the sound of Gu Sang-wong\u2019s voice. The commander had a satisfied expression on his face.\u201cThis is sufficient! Trainee Ha Mun-chun, you pass.\u201d\u201cWahhhh!\u201dThe trainees all cheered as if they all had passed. The first person who passed the test went to the podium and returned with a blue belt in hand.\u201cDo you have a sense of what this is?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked us a question, to which Song Jwa-baek replied confidently.\u201cI think it is good. I will not bring shame to our teacher\u2019s name.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue at the boy\u2019s words.\u201cDo you think I asked for that?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cTch. Tch.\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at him with pity on his face. I answered while recalling the movement of the warrior in my head.\u201cDuring the battle, the warrior there seemed to use about three to four percent of his strength.\u201dStrength referred to how much internal qi was used.That\u2019s what I meant when I noted how much strength was used by the warrior.It was hard to be sure, but at most, I can be certain that he didn\u2019t use a lot of internal qi. The trainee was already sweating profusely, but the warrior clearly didn\u2019t shed a single sweat. My observation prompted Hae Ack-chun to push further.\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cHis movement was also different from that of trainees, and when they came together, it didn\u2019t seem like he took more than three steps away from his original position. It\u2019s limited footwork.\u201d\u201cHehe. Your eyes work well.\u201dWith those words, Hae Ack-chun looked at Song Jwa-baek, who seemed embarrassed for not understanding the true intentions of the question.\u201cYou\u2026 enough.\u201dHae Ack-chun was trying to say something to the other twin but quickly gave up. Song Woo-hyun didn\u2019t even look at the man and kept observing the fight in front of us.-To make that old man shut up.\u2018\u2026 o envious.\u2019Meanwhile, the second trainee appeared. This time a different warrior came out too. The match was the same as before.The upper-rank warrior moved minimally and made the trainee struggle till the end before giving them a blue belt.I didn\u2019t know because I had never gotten this far in my previous life, but the five who qualified all passed. The smile didn\u2019t leave the face of Gu Sang-woong the whole time.\u201cLastly\u2026 hm.\u201dGu Sang-woong realized he had made a mistake and corrected it.\u201cWho will come as number 6?\u201dDam Yehwa hadn\u2019t gone ahead until this time and had only kept watching. It was the same with us. Hae Ack-chun told us to keep watching.\u201cTrainee Cho Sung-won.\u201dAmong the trainees, the last person came out and bowed.\u2018Cho Sung-won?\u2019Where have I heard this name?-Someone you know?\u2018I remember hearing it.\u2019It wasn\u2019t me in this life but me in the past who heard it. I remembered things or people who were memorable. But this name felt so familiar.Who was it?\u201cStart.\u201dWith the commander\u2019s shout, the trainee named Cho Sung-won began to move. I privately thought that I had to take a closer look at this.In my memory, I remember fights being different.Tatatak!The warrior called Go Jin-chang, and the trainee collided.As the two collided, all the other trainees exclaimed loudly. It seemed like the warrior was moving for the first time to avoid getting hit by a trainee\u2019s successive attacks.\u201cOhh. That guy has learned martial arts before.\u201dHae Ack-chun mumbled. After learning martial arts in this life, I think I understood his meaning.In addition to the basic footwork, the trainee was moving around to confuse and make the warrior take more than three steps for the first time.\u201cYou!\u201dGo Jin-chang, a warrior whose pride was injured, lifted up the restrictions he had to follow when fighting a trainee and pushed the trainee even further.Tatatak!Still, Cho Sung-won managed to block the attack and countered.\u201cOhh!\u201dThe trainees who were watching seemed to like this. I knew this. This guy was different from the other trainees. Not only did he have qualities for it, but he was close to beating a first-rate warrior.\u2018Ah!\u2019I remembered.I figured out why I couldn\u2019t remember his name.This guy was doomed to die in half a year.-Doomed to die? Why?In response to the small sword\u2019s question, I gave a reply while I looked at the fight.\u2018He is a spy for the Beggar Union.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Leader (3)Papapak!In an instant, the number of attacks that were exchanged between the two went past 12 all the way to 16.The warrior, perhaps forgetting that this was just a test, became greedier in his effort to defeat the trainee, prompting Gu Sang-woo to call out.\u201cEnough!\u201dGo Jin-chang stopped at his commander\u2019s order. The result might have been much worse if he didn\u2019t stop there.Typically, one had to calm their expression and bow to the trainee who did well, but all the trainee got was an annoyed look.Tuk!On the other hand, the trainee bowed to the warrior, prompting the other trainees to shout.\u201cWahhhh!!\u201d\u201cSo cool!\u201dAlthough the number of trainees was small for this test, not being pushed around by a warrior was significant enough for the trainees to lose their minds.Hae Ack-chun mumbled.\u201cKulkul. Such a nice one. The source of his martial arts seems to be the Lower District Sect.\u201dAfter saying those words, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s throat trembled. A message to someone. Perhaps the other person was\u2026\u2018The Blood Wolf leader.\u2019Said leader\u2019s eyes were also looking at Hae Ack-chun. As he was in charge of the trainees, he seemed to be asking for the child\u2019s details.Hae Ack-chun nodded.\u201cWell, right.\u201dHe looked satisfied as if his prediction was on point. Was Cho Sung-won using the martial arts of the Lower District Sect?-Didn\u2019t you say it was the Beggars Union?\u2018Yes.\u2019This kid had to be from the Beggars Union.The Blood Cult issued an order to kill him, and that was information known to all. That, at least, I remembered.-Couldn\u2019t he have hidden his martial arts? If he is of the Beggars Union like you said, why would he openly show it?Iron Sword\u2019s words were also valid. Obviously, there was no way he could use those martial arts here.In order to hide his identity, even the appropriate martial arts should be used.\u2018The Lower District Sect.\u2019Even if he was doing this to deceive, he was doing it with the Lower District Sect\u2019s martial arts. The Beggars Union and the Lower District were known to be top information-gathering places.And they might have had a competitive relationship.\u2018But.\u2019-What?\u2018He was daring enough to use the Lower District\u2019s name here. The Lower District is on the side of the Forces of Evil and Unorthodox Sects.\u2019While the Beggars Union was on the other side.Since the time of its creation, the Beggars Union at least had a sense of national patriotism and a general feeling of justice. Meanwhile, the Lower District Sect consisted of gamblers, thieves, and bandits, all typical of any evil sect.From the point of view of the Blood Cult, the Lower District Sect was the more favourable one.\u201cKuak, he would be in high demand.\u201dUh?What was this old man saying? A spy was a talent to covet? I was too flabbergasted.\u201cWho will take the next test?\u201dGu Sang-woong asked, his eyes looking at us and Han Baekha. The trainees, too, were looking over at this side.Now it was the turn of us disciples.\u201cTeacher, I will go\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHae Ack-chun stopped Song Jwa-baek from going out again and shouted at Han Baekha.\u201cHehe, I yield. You can send your disciple first.\u201dI thought he would send one of us to show a better form to the trainees, but the old man had different thoughts. Perhaps this was from an experience he had.Dam Yehwa had to take the test first, and he probably was trying to figure out what level a warrior she trained could end up being.Indeed, if Dam Yehwa was trained, she would be able to fight correctly, unlike the trainee before. But an unexpected answer came from her teacher instead.\u201cNo. This time, I will yield to your disciples.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHae Ack-chun raised his eyebrows. Still, this man had a higher position, and I didn\u2019t understand how she could refuse him.Was she telling him to show off the skills of his disciples first?Perhaps she said it with the same thoughts and aims that Hae Ack-chun had.But you see, my teacher wouldn\u2019t just accept that.\u201cHuh! If I said I would yield, just accept it\u2026 uh?\u201dHae Ack-chun, who was speaking, went silent. He looked at Han Baekha but said nothing. It seemed like they were using Voice Transmission.What are they talking about? He then frowned as he looked at me.\u201cDid you make a bet with the Bloody Hand Witch?\u201dAh\u2026I never thought I\u2019d have to explain that in such a place. Since the honour of her disciple and myself was on the line, I didn\u2019t think the woman would be foolhardy enough to talk about it.-Ugh? Such an evil one. Planning to win the bet like this?\u2018No.\u2019Some decided to attack the players to gain an advantage. But, this was intended to instill awareness within me. Well, this woman wasn\u2019t an average person.The Bloody Hand Witch smiled as she looked at me. She deliberately pretended to be friendly.-Acting. Acting.Short Sword clicked her tongue. But there is one thing she didn\u2019t know.Hae Ack-chun spoke with an annoyed face.\u201cHuh. A bet to persuade me through you? You idiot.\u201dI told him about how the Bloody Hand Witch was trying to convince him through me. Through all this, Han Baek-ha continued to smile.-You are being used. Hehe.Short Sword grinned as she laughed. Well, apart from the bet, there is nothing else that can be said to my teacher.If I lost, I would act according to her will. So I just told Hae Ack-chun. However, the bet was hidden, but she still decided to speak up and inform Hae Ack-chun while trying to overrule us. This was rather sad.\u201cActually\u2026\u201dI told Hae Ack-chun what happened.\u201cTch, well, if you have a chance to get something, you need to jump in.\u201dUnexpectedly, Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t seem angry.He seemed to understand, it\u2019s just like his personality, and I scratched my head.\u201cIf you use your head again, I will break your hands and legs.\u201dAh, right.It wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing either. But the man still smiled at me.\u201cHehe. You made such an interesting bet. To make the girl who only wore black clothes come out and speak like this.\u201dPak!\u201cUh?\u201dWith that, he pushed me on the back, and I stepped up.\u201cShow me.\u201dWords which meant a lot.He told us not to go first, but now he pushed me ahead, which left Song Jwa-baek looking dissatisfied. I didn\u2019t want to do it either.\u201cPhew.\u201dIt seemed like I had to do this first. It would have been better if the twins went out first to bring more attention, but nothing I could do about it now.Chuk!I bowed to the commander Gu Sang-woong.He, too, bowed slightly as I was a disciple of that old man before nodding to a warrior on the podium. The man, who had a scar on his eyes, stepped up.\u201cNow that we have a trainee let\u2019s start the test\u2026\u201dThen I said,\u201cI want to take the test for the position of a leader!\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Gu Sang-woong, the commander of the Six Blood Valley, went stiff.It was the same case with the other leaders behind him. Mumbles could be heard all around.\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\u201cA leader?\u201dThis reaction was natural. I came out to take the test for upper-rank warrior and requested to be made a leader instead.Even Han Baekha, who had been smiling at me, seemed to be frowning now. Even Dam Yehwa had a similar frown on her face.\u201cHehe.\u201dHae Ack-chun was the only one who was laughing in this situation.I was going to let Song Jwa-baek get the attention, but I received it instead. Gu Sang-woong, who first looked at Hae Ack-chun with a stiff face, then looked at me.\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201dOf course, I knew.I heard it from Noh Songgu, the leader of Blood Wolf. There are three ways to become a leader.First, if you fulfill the tenure of an upper-rank first-rate warrior and deliver both results and performance, the position will eventually be granted to you.Second, there was also a chance of getting the position after receiving considerable merit.\u201cI know. You must win in less than a hundred seconds against two ranked warriors using a sword.\u201dPuak!The trainees were all roaring. The difficulty level had gone up.This third method made sense. Even if they were first-rate warriors, not all of them would have the same strength.In order to be recognized as a skilled warrior, one must have at least enough skills to deal with other first-rate warriors. I could feel Gu Sang-woong\u2019s eyes pierce through me.[The elder seems to have taught his disciples well.]I heard something in my head.It sounded like a compliment, but there was a hint of sarcasm in it. Well, I could understand his emotions.Even if he was an elder, it is absurd to push a disciple who had only trained under him for just 6 months to the position of a leader.Besides, unlike the twins, I was known to have a broken dantian that only healed just 6 months prior.-That face is no joke.As Short Sword said, no one seemed to be liking this. Perhaps the source of their hate was the fact that I had only been training for 6 months.Clench.As they relaxed their bodies, I could feel their hatred toward me. They considered my act a disgrace, but they also seemed to think that a newcomer like me who had just started to learn martial arts was becoming cocky.\u201cAre you really fine?\u201dGu Sang-woong asked Hae Ack-chun.\u201cHehe, he has enough qualifications. That is why I sent him.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dHae Ack-chun sounded confident, and the commander turned to me with cold eyes.\u201cAre you going to use\u2026 that sword?\u201dI could see why he asked that.Hae Ack-chun was known for his close combat fighting style, so having a sword might be weird.\u201cYes.\u201dGu Sang-woong frowned. Then, he looked at the warriors under his podium.The warriors were all looking at me with zealous eyes. Then he called out two of them.\u201cDae Jong, Hoyun!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dBoth men had swords on their backs. They were swordsmen, and this looked like it would be a battle of swords.-But you are the disciple of an elder.Gu Sang-woong\u2019s intentions were clear. As both warriors approached me, I could see their gazes moving to the iron sword on my back.\u201cYou two will test him.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThey bowed and then widened the space between us to prepare to engage. Coincidentally the two also seemed to be talking to me.[If you came out because of the elder\u2019s orders, there is no need to covet the leader position. You will have a lot more chances.][Since you are the elder\u2019s disciple and wield a sword, I ask you to learn humbly from us.]Their expressions and words were so different! Their eyes were like they wanted to eat me and were burning with determination.As soon as the signal to start was sounded, they would move. So I said,\u201cDo take good care of me.\u201dI said it politely, but that only brought displeasure into their eyes. They clearly wanted to start right away.Hh!I grabbed my sword, and the crowd went silent. The eyes of the trainees didn\u2019t leave the warriors on the podium or me. At that time, Go Sang-woong said,\u201cStart!\u201dTat!As soon as the words were said, their feet instantly moved away from the ground as they came for me.Were they skilled in light footwork?Kang!The two warriors drew their swords and came for me, swinging them towards my head and left leg, hoping to end this at once.Tatatak!I stretched out my legs and stepped back. As first-rate warriors, the two also narrowed the distance.Chang!I drew out Iron Sword and clashed with the warrior Dae Jong\u2019s sword as he blocked my blade with his.Clang!Shh!At that moment, the other warrior, Hoyun, stabbed at my right chest, making me use my footwork to widen the distance.Chang!\u201cHuh!\u201dHoyun too hurriedly moved back. To prevent me from following, Dae Jong appeared from the left to stab me in the shoulder.Chang!I rotated the sword to bounce his attack upwards, making Dae Jong frown.It seemed like he was shocked by how well I responded to his attack without showing signs of fear.This was a matter of course. For nearly 4 months, I fought 100 mock battles with Hae Ack-chun over and over.They were almost real battles for me, so how could my body not respond? Dae Jong and Hoyun glanced at each other. It looked like they decided to change their tactics.Tat!Dae Jong ran to me and used a proper sword technique rather than just a simple movement. A fierce technique flew to me like a tiger running wild.Chachachacha!There was a way to receive it with the same force, but I chose a softer sword technique to respond to it.Chak!By using a technique that was like a soft loach, I aimed an attack at the gap in the warrior\u2019s sword technique. This shocked him as he didn\u2019t seem to expect me to come close.It was unfortunate, but the sword techniques we learnt were innately different.Puck!My sword went for his sword and pierced his shoulder and chest twice. He panicked at the light stabs but managed to move back.Tatata!I followed him with the intent of getting rid of him as he moved back, causing him to smile.\u201cYou are still young.\u201dIt was then that I bent my body as low as I could.Shhh!A sword which could have cut my head off instead cut nothing but air.\u201cWhat?\u201dI pulled out the short sword and stabbed at him without looking back.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dA muffled shout could be heard. Without stopping, I turned around while holding Iron Sword in my hand. At that moment, I rotated my body like a whirlwind and slashed my sword upwards.It was the Maneuvering Dragon Slashing Sword.Chang!Dae Jong, who was in front of me, couldn\u2019t control the force of my sword and bounced back. As I rotated while soaring in the air, I held both swords in my hands.I then struck both of them down using the Falling Meteor Sword.\u201cDamn it!\u2019Hoyun, startled at the force of my attack, tried to block it, but his sword got cut in half instead.Crack!\u201cKuak!\u201dHoyun fell to the floor. If he tried to get back up, he could die.I stopped the technique right in front of his nose.\u201cKuak\u2026.\u201dHoyun\u2019s face was nervous as he looked at the Iron Sword in front of him. I pulled my sword back as I said to him.\u201cYou are bleeding. Look at the dagger.\u201dThe dagger was stuck in Hoyun\u2019s thigh, and he mumbled as he didn\u2019t seem to perceive the pain until I pointed it out.\u201cH-How can you not\u2026\u201dI looked at his sword, which was split in half. No matter how much I killed his spirit, the sound of his sword being broken must have been a blow to him.\u201cWoahhhhhh!!!\u201dAnd deafening screams came from the side of the trainees.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Leader (4)\u201cWoahhhh!!\u201dThe trainees all shouted passionately for So Wonhwi.\u201cSee that? He stopped the sword right in front of the warrior\u2019s nose!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s insane!\u201d\u201cHe actually won! Didn\u2019t he say he needed to last for 100 seconds or something?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even look like a few seconds have passed!\u201dThe upper-rank warriors were like absolute beings for the trainees. However, that I managed to take two of them down with overwhelming force was enough to fascinate them.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019Gu Sang-woong, the commander, was speechless too. His expectations had been flipped.The Ghastly Monster, Hae Ack-chun, was known for his fists and kicks. So when Wonhwi came with a sword, he thought the boy would be taken down quickly.He was convinced that no one could go against a first-rate warrior after just 6 months of training, but this was something else!\u201cHas it only been just 6 months since his dantian was restored?\u201d\u201cI cannot believe this.\u201d\u201cIt has to be either of these two. Maybe he already knew things before his dantian was broken, or the elder just invented an amazing sword technique.\u201d\u201cIs the elder even good with swords? Ha!\u201d\u201cWhen one reaches an old age, they have a knack for everything.\u201dThe leaders couldn\u2019t help but admire my achievement, though they focused more on the sword technique. That was how incredible the technique\u2019s power was.\u201cTeacher\u2026\u2019Dam Yehwa couldn\u2019t take her eyes off her teacher. This was her first time seeing such an expression on her face after being brought in as a disciple.\u2018So Wonhwi, that person is really\u2026\u2019She didn\u2019t think he would embarrass her like this.She and Han Baekha had tried and set higher goals all this while when compared to the test. Their goal had been to not only endure 12 attacks but to gracefully break them. Son Wonwhi was clearly ahead of her.He didn\u2019t even let the two warriors show their skills.\u2018\u2026 Haa.\u2019A sigh.Even if she learned under Han Baekha, she wasn\u2019t confident enough to take on two warriors at once. Why does this man make things difficult for her?The frown on her teacher\u2019s face showed no sign of disappearing.\u2018Did that old man really create this sword technique?\u2019Han Baekha was confused. The bet aside, the sword technique she witnessed wasn\u2019t an ordinary technique.It was full of ascending movements and attacks. It differed from the methodology Hae Ack-chun followed, which was to work with the body and internal qi.\u2018\u2026 No. It cannot be that.\u2019She couldn\u2019t know that this wasn\u2019t a technique created by Hae Ack-chun.This was a technique created by someone who is both experienced and skilled with the sword. She looked over at Hae Ack-chun again, but the man instead looked at So Wonwhi with a strange smile.\u201cHehe.\u201d\u2018It reminds me of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u2019He remembered the battle against his former rival while looking at So Wonhwi. A battle he would never have again.-Ahh. You\u2019re a leader now. You did well.Short Sword was returned to me a little late after I used her to wound Hoyun\u2019s thigh, so she was making a fuss about it.As she said, in front of everyone who was watching, I managed to get an official title and managed to attain a leadership position.No one could disagree either after they witnessed my match. The two warriors who went against me had surrendered cleanly. I managed to burn away their hopes of winning while at the same time making the crowd acknowledge my sword technique.[You are qualified to be a leader.][I admit it too. This is like meeting a promising swordsman.]They all changed their thoughts. I am, after all, a swordsman who can talk with swords.That strengthens the friendship and performance between sword and user. This made sense.-I was worried about you telling us to not help, but you did well.-Still, training to feel the flow of internal qi of the opponent seems necessary. You would have lost if you couldn\u2019t hear the sound of their swords.Iron Sword was coldly analyzing the match.Right. Without the advantage of hearing the sound of their swords, I would have been in danger.-It was rather tight. If you limit your skills and still do something like that, you should be praised, right?-Hmm. That\u2026\u2018No. Iron Sword is right. I didn\u2019t achieve my goal.\u2019I did defeat the two warriors without showing my all. This wasn\u2019t my actual goal, however. The purpose of this fight was to win with just my internal qi and sword technique, but I still listened to the sounds of their swords and reacted.To reach higher, I needed to be strict with myself, right?-Brat. You act like a warrior these days.-A good change.I have been thinking a lot these past six months. To attain a vague level of power and strength was an abstract goal.It didn\u2019t even make sense to be strong.If there was an aspiration to be a warrior, I should at least dream of being a prominent one in the Central Plains. Hae Ack-chun was just a stepping stone.-We have a long way to go.Right. A long way.But not even a year after regressing, didn\u2019t I reach the position of a leader? This was something I would never even have dreamt of. I would never have known this possibility if I hadn\u2019t moved ahead.-Hehe, well. Because you won the bet, we can learn from that woman.As Short Sword said, I won the bet. Dam Yehwa came out right after my fight was over.She had no choice but to apply for the position of a leader because the pride of her teacher was at stake.But the result wasn\u2019t great. She fought hard but was defeated in less than 50 seconds. I couldn\u2019t forget the expression Han Baekha had.It wasn\u2019t a frown.-She is so dead.As she said, Dam Yehwa could not raise her head, acting as if she did something wrong. Seeing that\u2026-Why? Feeling bad?Why would I feel sorry for her? Just a bit sad.That was all. Since she lost, maybe she would be getting a good beating from the Bloody Hand Witch. I can understand since Hae Ack-chun would have done that.-Still, the achievement she had in six months is remarkable.Iron Sword praised Dam Yehwa.Clearly, her martial arts were amazing for someone who only had 6 months to learn. In addition, she even managed to meet the condition of surviving a battle against an upper-rank warrior and was recognized as an upper-rank warrior in turn.\u2018The problem\u2026 is him.\u2019\u201cTch.\u201dThe sound of Hae Ack-chun clicking his tongue. He didn\u2019t have a good expression, but I can understand why.Pak! Pak!Song Jwa-baek\u2019s fight was over 60 seconds long. He went out saying he would end it before me, but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201cThat idiot.\u201dHae Ack-chun said that while looking at him. In a way, Song Jwa-baek was his true disciple. At least he would have hoped for similar results to mine, but it was coming out differently.-I guess he is out of luck.I agreed with Iron Sword\u2019s words. After my fight, all the warriors were more cautious.In particular, they were warier of Song Jwa-baek, who was known to have directly learned Hae Ack-Chun\u2019s techniques.So the fights were getting longer.\u201cDamn it!\u201dSong Jwa-baek\u2019s irritated voice could be heard all the way here. Due to the pressure to end it quickly, he couldn\u2019t even show his skills properly.Well, if 100 seconds passed, he would get the position.-Then that old man will kill him.Right. That was a possibility. Still, I would love to see him being sympathetic to others.It was then.Papak!Song Jwa-baek grabbed the belt of the warrior who had been trying to widen the distance. The other warrior threw his fists at Song Jwa-baek\u2019s face while he resisted it and showed his wits.Boo!Song Jwa-baek threw the warrior he had grabbed by the belt. The throw was directed at the other warrior who was coming at him. This made the two collide and fall to the floor.-This was worthy enough.As with internal qi, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s training involved external qi too. It was nothing but pure physical strength, which was difficult for me.The warrior who fell tried to get up, but it was too late.\u201cWhy bother getting up!\u201dPupupuk!Song Jwa-baek\u2019s fists were like rapid fire landing on his opponent. Song Jwa-baek didn\u2019t pay attention to anything else and kept throwing the fist.\u201cStop! Stop!\u201dIn the end, the two surrendered.Tuk!Song Jwa-baek, who raised his fist at the win, looked around, but no one cheered.Drip.One of his eyes was swollen, and his nose was bleeding. It didn\u2019t really look like the image of victory to the observers.\u201cFuck, nosebleed.\u201d\u201cTch.\u201dHae Ack-chun continued to click his tongue.\u201cLook at him. Such disgrace.\u201dDespite that, he seemed happy that his disciple would be a leader now. Well, if you are happy, I am happy.[If those bastards didn\u2019t run around like hamsters, I would have ended it faster than you..]I just wish they would stop saying that to me!The other twin was the last one, and Hae Ack-chun told him.\u201cHuh! If you act like that damn brother of yours, you will be starved.\u201dThe guy was already bald, but now his eyes seemed to be falling out, so his face looked so troubled. Song Woo-hyun nodded and walked to the front.\u201cDo Kyung\u2026 Kang Chae-ji!\u201dDid he feel a sense of crisis with the ones that have gone before? Gu Sang-woong changed his plan.He sent out one swordsman and one fist-fighter.-From my point of view, what they were both trying to do with a sword and a fist was to take down the disciple of the old man effectively.It seemed like the commander didn\u2019t like giving the leader position to all three of us. Hae Ack-chum said he didn\u2019t like this but then snorted. Guess he trusted this guy.\u201cStart!\u201dThe confrontation began with Gu Sang-woong\u2019s shout. As soon as the match started, the one called Kang Chae-ji came with fists blazing and moved behind Song Woo-hyun. The one with the sword, Do Kyung, stood in front.It seemed like the main attacker would be the swordsman, and the other would be the diversion.Boom!Do Kyung swung the sword as if deliberately trying to threaten his opponent, though it was then\u2026Papak!Song Woo-hyun ran to the swordsman, making him aim the sword at his chest to widen the distance, but the twin didn\u2019t avoid it.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dSong Jwa-baek was shocked.Puak!The sword pierced the upper chest of Song Woo-hyun.But it wasn\u2019t a deep cut, and no one could tell if it was because the swordsman didn\u2019t wield it correctly, he was too anxious to do it, or if Song Woo-hyun\u2019s muscles were too thick.Pak!The younger twin grabbed Do Kyung\u2019s arm.\u201cYou!\u201dThe moment he was about to pull out the sword to escape, Song Woo-hyun hit him.Bang!\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Even Kang Chae-ji was captivated by this unexpected attack, then Song Woo-hyun released the grip.\u201cEuh!\u201dKang Chae-ji\u2019s face was pale. Do Kyung\u2019s face was caved in, and so much blood was dripping that it covered his face.Thud!The swordsman soon fell to the floor. This was an absurd situation to be in, and I heard at the same time.-\u2026 You shouldn\u2019t let him starve.Song Woo-hyun passed the test with just one headbutt.Kang Chae-ji, who was afraid of being headbutted, declared his surrender.-I wouldn\u2019t want it either.If the forehead was caved in, who would want to fight? Everyone looked at him with fearful eyes. Those who couldn\u2019t express that fear were at least wide-eyed.\u201cKuahahahaha!\u201dOnly Hae Ack-chun was happy with this. The test ended, but it resulted in confusion for everyone.As soon as the position test was completed, the leaders of each group who were watching from behind rushed toward us.\u201cElder. I congratulate you.\u201d\u201cYou have wonderfully taught your disciples.\u201dLooking at this, I could see how much of a role he had in the cult. Everyone did it for this old man, whether it be a greeting or praise.If he could do this without collecting power on his side, what would be his position if he had power or force behind him?\u201c\u2026 Congratulations, elder.\u201dThe Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, came over. She kept a neutral expression, and Hae Ack-chun smiled triumphantly.\u201cHehehe. You did well with your disciple too.\u201dThis crazy old man.Dam Yehwa was a disciple who failed to become a leader, and he was scratching on their wounds.\u201cThis is the first time I learned that an elder who is an expert in close combat is also skilled with swords.\u201dThis made him raise his eyebrow.It was because he knew where she was going with this.\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s your sword technique.\u2019Her eyes were saying that. No one questioned the sword technique, but she was sure that this wasn\u2019t a technique made by Hae Ack-chun.Did losing a bet make her do this?Even if she felt bad, there was nothing she could do to change the result, Hae Ack-chun then said.\u201cBloody Hand Witch, you seem to have poor eyes.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI mean, how could you not recognize the sword technique of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019It wasn\u2019t just her, but everyone else around him became shocked at this revelation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Selection Ceremony (1)I, too, was shocked by Hae Ack-chun\u2019s bold words. I never expected that the true origin of the sword technique would actually be revealed.To be honest, I thought that this man would hide it, considering how much the man prided in himself. So why would he reveal it?What was certain was this wasn\u2019t his usual course of action.\u201cSouth Heavenly Swordsman?\u201d\u201cThe South Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dWhispers and questions rose from around us.Seeing that the leaders and others were this shocked, the prestige of the swordsman\u2019s name was still there despite 15 years having passed.Everyone was also not just looking at Hae Ack-chun but was also looking at me!A woman in white, who seemed to be a disciple of the Bloody Hand Witch, kept looking at my sword and me.\u2018What is with her?\u2019However, with just her eyes exposed through the mask, I felt like I knew her. Her round eyes, long eyelashes, and a similar feeling to the red-eyed woman.\u2018No.\u2019-Who is it? Who is she?\u2018\u2026 Miss Ha Yeon. Seems like it\u2019s her. Or Baek Ryeon-ha, I should say.\u2019-What? She\u2019s that one?Even Short Sword seemed shocked. Well, the reason was simple, really.It was because the woman\u2019s body now looked slender.-Aren\u2019t you guessing it wrong?Short sword couldn\u2019t accept it. Well, she had been quite chubby in the past, after all.It felt like she had undergone a Body Reconstruction in just six months.-So she lost all that weight?Would she admit that she had lost the weight if it were really her? Well, the woman did avoid my eyes afterward.-Right.Seeing how embarrassed she was, I probably guessed correctly.She turned her head towards a distant mountain to avoid my gaze. I was left wondering what exactly happened.Did she lose weight from the plant I brought back? As I continued to muse, Han Baekha spoke.\u201cElder. That\u2026 What do you mean? South Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dHer voice was trembling slightly, betraying the fact that she was also shocked. I was also curious about how the old man would respond, considering everything was revealed like this.Would he try to say that he got a treasure after defeating the South Heavenly Swordsman?With his personality, that kind of statement would make sense.\u201cYou don\u2019t get it despite me telling you? Seriously, is there anyone else here who dealt with that man aside from me?\u201dAt his words, Han Baekha went silent. This meant that no one else could get close to the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201cHehe.\u201dShe looked at me after she was rendered silent.\u201c\u2026 regardless of whether I recognize it or not, why did the elder\u2019s disciple learn the sword technique of that man?\u201dShe was bringing him back to the original topic. She was asking for a clear answer.\u201cThe South Heavenly Swordsman wasn\u2019t just a normal man. He is a well-known and influential person. This is why the elder will have to explain.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t taking things lying down. Focusing on the fact that the South Heavenly Swordsman is a member of the Forces of Justice, she was cornering Hae Ack-chun. That was until he pulled something out of his sleeves.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019The book with that name on it. It was taken back from me, but I didn\u2019t think he would have it on him. Did he plan this?\u201cThe Xing Ming technique?\u201d\u201cThis is a martial arts book written by that man.\u201d\u201cWhy does the elder have it?\u201dHan Baekha couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the book. It was the same with others.In particular, those who used swords as their weapon would consider this book a treasure.A book of martial arts written by the South Heavenly Swordsman, who was famed for his sword techniques. Anyone would want it.\u201cThe South Heavenly Swordsman is dead.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Everyone was surprised to hear that such a man was already dead.The surprise was partly because a man of such stature\u2019s whereabouts had been unknown for 15 years.Hae Ack-chun seemed to be trying to imply that he defeated the man to get this.-This man!The South Heavenly Iron Sword was angry. He felt like his former owner\u2019s name, and honor were being tarnished, and I, too, felt bad for him.\u201cThat man is dead? Then did the elder?\u201dBloody Hand Witch looked at Hae Ack-chun with shocked eyes. But his reaction was different from what I expected.\u201cHuh! If that was the case, that long-awaited dream of mine would have come true, but no, someone else did it before I could.\u201dSurprisingly, Hae Ack-chun spoke the truth, he could have lied, but he chose to be honest.\u201cWho could do that?\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dEveryone was curious after hearing Hae Ack Chun\u2019s words. This was a natural reaction considering that someone managed to kill a famous swordsman who had been touted as one of the future members of the Eight Great Warriors of the land.Ignoring their reaction, he continued.\u201cThis is a book left behind by the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dThis was what he meant.He had already died, so it wouldn\u2019t count as stealing. The Bloody Hand Witch then asked.\u201cDid this mean you found this along with his remains?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow could you do such a thing!\u201d\u201cThis calls for congratulations, Elder!\u201dAt his honest response, the others began to speak out. Their words implied that the discovery of a book that can be deemed a treasure for any swordsman by a member of their cult was something to be celebrated.\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked.Everyone who cheered for him went silent at his first question. One of them tried to explain while the others all were silent.\u201cI-it isn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d\u201cNot being able to compete with him and him losing to someone else isn\u2019t something to be celebrated!\u201dSeeing that, those trying to speak all went silent, as expected of Hae Ack-chun.\u201cI couldn\u2019t fight him again after that. this isn\u2019t something you people can celebrate.\u201dHae Ack-chun spoke with an angry expression while holding the book.\u201cThis sword technique isn\u2019t completed.\u201dThis was true. Strictly speaking, thanks to him stealing it, I was able to complete the technique.\u201cI who fought the most with him know this better than anyone.\u201dHan Baekha frowned.\u201cDo you mean it?\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled.\u201cThis book was passed on to this guy through all the loopholes.\u201dTak!Hae Ack-chun placed his hand on my shoulders.\u201cThis guy can be called a common point between myself and the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201d\u2018Ha!\u2019I was shocked.The result was that Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t come across as the successor of the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s legacy. Instead, he became someone who supplemented and passed on his rival\u2019s techniques to me.-\u2026 Right. For real, he is amazing.Even Short Sword admired this. In a sense, the old man was amazing.As a result, no one could raise objections about it anymore. At least not within the cult.Hae Ack-chun was a clever old man.-\u2026 Still, this is goodEven Iron Sword, who should be angry, was fine. What was good about this?-Actually, if it wasn\u2019t for him, the life and knowledge of my former owner would have ended. Moreover, the man himself said that you would be considered as an heir to my former owner.When I heard his words, it felt right.Since Hae Ack-chun was in possession of the book, he could have professed it as his own technique. Instead, he left a mark that told the people that his rival\u2019s legacy continued to live on.Looking at this, I realized how much this old man valued his rival.-I am grateful for that.South Heavenly Iron Sword was happy that his former owner wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha, her followers, and the leaders of each group went to the main hall.It was because there was a selection ceremony that still needed to be done.Before leaving, that woman sent me a message.[The bet was won by the young master. Let\u2019s meet in the same vacant lot from last time at midnight tonight.]She surrendered. Well, strictly speaking, Dam Yehwa did get the position that she had made a bet for, but since my own achievements were higher, this made any spar between us meaningless.The difference between her and my skills was apparent.-What do you want to be taught?\u2018I don\u2019t have high expectations.\u2019I didn\u2019t think she would teach me anything useful. She, too, wouldn\u2019t have expected to lose the bet, so she would probably teach me some insignificant technique.I was more curious about Baek Ryeon-ha. She had a strange look when she looked at me earlier.-Maybe she didn\u2019t think you\u2019d notice?That could be the case.\u201cBut\u2026 teacher. Why are you going to the main hall?\u201dOn our way there, Song Jwa-baek asked a question, unable to hold his curiosity. But Hae Ack-chun smiled and said,\u201cNow is the time.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cTo bring in useful ones. Hehe.\u201dYeah, okay. I think I get why.He said he would raise us three. In the case of the current Blood Cult, there already were factions on each side, and each side needed talent.And this was a matter of how many talents were secured by which side.Whisper!When we arrived at the hall, it was noisy. In addition to the commander, the leaders and trainees were also there.Memories prior to my return came back to me.\u2018Ah!\u2019The list of trainees was attached to a wide wooden board in front of the yard. The names on the list were sorted by the classes they qualified for.Before my return to this time, I had been given a task already as a member of the Blood Wolf.While low-ranked warriors were evenly distributed, the middle-rank warriors and the others were given out through preference.I remembered how fiercely the people fought for better talent. At that time, I wasn\u2019t there, but I knew about one person who the factions fought extremely over.-Who?Cho Sung-won, the spy from the Beggars Union.He eventually went as a subordinate to the First Blood Star. Everyone thought he would go under one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, but his choice surprised everyone.-But it was the wrong choice.\u2018Right.\u2019Just half a year from now, an order was issued to eliminate him, which led to his death.-In the end, he is destined to die.\u2018Right.\u2019What if I changed his fate?The Six Blood Valley was uncovered thanks to Cho Sung-won and a few other spies. But I wondered how much it would change if I changed the place this man ended up going to?For example, what if I revealed his identity right away?\u201cThe selection ceremony will occur tomorrow.\u201dGu Sang-woong spoke in a loud voice. Ten other commanders from other locations stood in front of the board. They couldn\u2019t take their eyes off of it.Hae Ack-chun then stepped up to the selection board. When he went there, everyone became confused.\u201cElder?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dThey didn\u2019t seem to expect that Hae Ack-chun would participate in the selection. After all, he was someone who had never shown such an interest before.One of the commanders asked.\u201cIs the elder also participating in the selection?\u201d\u201cHuh! I have no commander below me, so I will choose for myself.\u201dTheir faces darkened.They didn\u2019t think this would happen. Even the Bloody Hand Witch seemed shocked.\u201cKuak.\u201dEveryone was puzzled at this unforeseen situation, as Hae Ack-chun said.\u201cDoes this start from the middle-ranked warriors or the upper-ranked warriors?\u201d\u201c\u2026 From the middle rank.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, that works. Any complaints for me?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, the commanders all bit their lips. They couldn\u2019t say no to this man.Who would have the guts to say no to such a monster?\u201cI can choose then?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHae Ack-chun pointed his finger at the place where the list was hanging from. It was a list of middle-rank warriors.A total of 37 names.The list was arranged from top to bottom in order of outstanding qualities.\u201c\u2026\u201dEach faction was holding their breath and waited for Hae Ack-chun to stop.They were worried that he might choose talented ones before them. His finger then continued to move down.\u201cPhew.\u201dAnd a couple sighed in relief, but\u2026\u201cI will take everyone from the top down to here.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Everyone became puzzled at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, but the old man clearly didn\u2019t care as he said.\u201cIn fairness, there are only ten other people left, so whether you talk it out or whatever you do, take them one by one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Selection Ceremony (2)Everyone there was at a loss for words.The implicit rule of the selection process was to distribute talent in equal numbers to each other.However, they were shocked at the sight of Hae Ack-hun trying to gulp down 27 people with just a few words by excluding the bottom ten.-Puahahaha! As expected of the old man.Short Sword laughed.\u2018Ha!\u2019Even if he wanted to take people in, I predicted it would only be four or five, but Hae Ack-chun walked up and chose 27 people. However, the problem was that while the people there were afraid to question him, there were people under the other elders and under the Seventh Blood Star behind him.\u201cElder.\u201dKeenly aware of this, Gu Sang-woong intervened.\u201cThe other commanders came as representatives of the Seventh Blood Star and other people. If the elder took all the top talents, it would not be fair for\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are speaking about equity?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked a question as if he could not understand it.Gu Sang-woong was a bit flustered despite his apparent desire to help the other parties there.Shh!Some of the people who had trusted in Gu Sang-woong\u2019s intervention came forward. They were commanders under the influence of other people of a similar stature as Hae Ack-chun.\u201cElder. I am commander Hak Jeong-gyeom under Elder Lee Jun.\u201dThe commander who served under Elder Lee Jun opened his mouth first. The reason why he mentioned his elder\u2019s name alongside his role was clearly to emphasize its effects.\u201cSo?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked as if he didn\u2019t really care.The commander hesitated before trying to regain his confidence again. He then said,\u201cElder, I will speak honestly. In the selection ceremony, all of us were sent to select talented people on behalf of our superiors. Until now, we have evenly organized the talents through fair consultations, but if the Elder monopolizes too many of such talented ones, my Elder as well as the other commander\u2019s superiors might not be happy about it.\u201d\u201cRight. Elder.\u201d\u201cPlease do consider.\u201dThe other commanders also stepped forward. In other words, they were attending as proxies for other high-ranking officials of the cult.It was an indirect warning that the people behind them would not take this lightly.-Oh. Look at them coming out strong.\u2018It is because their own performances are at stake.\u2019If they cannot secure talent, their own group will be broken. This was why they were coming out strong right now.They were making their case using the people behind them, so how would the old man respond?\u201cHuh! What do you mean?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cAre you saying I should feel sorry for you all and make concessions? Ha! If you want to act like this, then go ahead and tell them. Those who feel that this was unfair can come directly to me and talk. How does that sound?\u201dOf course, he didn\u2019t back down. On the contrary, as Hae Ack-chun replied in anger, everyone became more flustered.\u201cDo you really think I would be scared of those behind you? Funny bastards.\u201d\u201cWhat? Uh, Elder, how can you\u2026\u201d\u201cShut your mouths.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cHak Jeong-gyeom, was it? If you act out one more time, I\u2019ll rip your hair out of your head.\u201d\u2018..?!\u2019Hae Ack-chun pretended to pull on the hair with his hands. The commander who had been speaking until then fell silent.-Man, the old man knows how to shock people.I agree with Short Sword. Actually, I thought that Hae Ack-chun would take a step back, considering how many commanders were gathered here.But no, he was pressuring them to back out instead!If he was a rational being, he would have simply appeared strong. However, the fact that they called him the Ghastly Monster probably strengthened that perception more.Thankfully, no one said anything.-Only that crazy old man can do something like this.-\u2026 right.Instead, seeing this, I came to understand what having power felt like. How proud can one be of the strength they gained through their own effort?\u201cIs there anything more to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo one protested. They actually thought Hae Ack-chun would rip their hair out, so they stayed silent.\u201cThen you lot can discuss how to divide the remaining 10.\u201d\u201cElder.\u201dBut when everyone was forced to silence, one person came out. The person who crossed over the leaders and commanders was Han Baekha.Observing the situation, she said.\u201cYou are taking too many, Elder.\u201dThe commanders who felt suffocated by the old man\u2019s words were sighing in relief at her appearance. It was because she was the only one who could deal with this old man.\u201cYou will come out now?\u201d\u201cElder. It seems like there are many talented people under you.\u201d\u201cMany? What do you mean \u2018many\u2019?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Elder say it is cumbersome to have people during the Seven Stars Meeting? You declared that you would be independent, and if you suddenly take so many people, the distribution will not be fai\u2026\u201d\u201cYou talk well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI am trying to raise a group this time.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019At his words, everyone\u2019s eyes widened. Even Han Baekha couldn\u2019t control her expression.Her eyes were shaking as she, too, was surprised at this unexpected news.-Raising a group?\u2018Right.\u2019Even before my regression, Hae Ack-chun had always moved alone. He was the only one who didn\u2019t have his own group despite being in the position of an elder.He, who had been alone, declared that he would raise a group in front of the commanders of other factions.-Is it so shocking?\u2018\u2026 Because the power balance of the Blood Cult will be shaken up in the future.\u2019Until now, except for Hae Ack-chun, the ten other high-ranking officials were in balance. But now, this could change the balance of power.I turned my head to the front of the main hall.Baek Ryeong-ha was visibly surprised.Hae Ack-chun was called the Sleeping Dragon. So it must be shocking to her that this man was aiming for the position of the cult leader. In the future, she would probably try to persuade him even more.-It will be tiring.\u2018It will be.\u2019Instead, I saw this as an opportunity. If this made her more anxious, things would move quickly over on that side.-That side? That fox?\u2018Right.\u2019The powerless man decided to increase his power. This fact will become known to the heads of every faction. Once that was the case, even the red-eyed woman would move.-You mean to come and convince the old man?\u2018Yes.\u2019Neither Hae Ack-chun nor I know of the current balance of power.If the red-eyed woman moves, only then will the clear picture be revealed.-And by that\u2026 you mean?Right, you\u2019re a smart child, Short Sword.-Now you realized it?Iron Sword asked from his position at my back. It was better to weigh both sides than to stand on one side from the start. If you do it properly, you can get something from both sides. The standards and conditions for choosing a side would also become more advantageous.-I don\u2019t know what Wohwi and Short Sword are talking about.-Just stay still then.-Umm.Well, Iron Sword still could not defeat Short Sword when it came to words. Han Baekha, in her shock, then said.\u201cThe fact that the elder is raising a group\u2026 is quite shocking.\u201d\u201cWhat is so surprising? In any case, it is no longer fair to call what I claimed as too many, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnyway, there are no members under me, so I tried to select the good ones, and I even left kids for you people too,\u201dHe was saying that it was a kind of concession to them.I wondered what direction they would have to this. Han Baekha, who was staring at him, then bowed.\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dThe other people\u2019s expressions visibly darkened when she, their only hope, stepped back.But no one could argue it. As Hae Ack-chun declared, if he was to raise a group, he would need warriors under him.Ultimately, they had to hide their eyes and distribute the ten given to them.And the quality of the remaining 10 cannot be compared to the top ones on the list.\u201cJwa-baek.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d\u201cTake care of the kids.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s command, Song Jwa-baek became visibly excited and called for the selected trainees who were waiting.Well, he must be glad to do something.\u201cCome on, everyone, line up here!\u2019They were assigned positions as they stood in front of Song Jwa-baek with an expression that clearly said they lacked understanding of what just happened.The situation was quite funny. Only one person was staying behind.When the selection was completed, Hae Ack-chun looked at Gu Sang-woong.\u201cGet things done quickly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why Gu Sang-woong had such a dark expression. Those who should be disappointed were the other commanders.Maybe I didn\u2019t see the full picture?\u201cThen, we will proceed with the ceremony for the upper-rank candidates. The six who passed, come to the front.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt his order, six people came up. The way the commanders looked at them visibly changed. They were forced to let go of the middle-rank candidates so they couldn\u2019t let these ones slip away from their hands.As the kids stood, Gu Sang-woong said,\u201cThen please, before the application is concluded, could the representatives give a brief speech of benefits and other things to help inform the candidates when choosing their position.\u201dRight, this was just like the past.After hearing every speech, the candidates then got to choose which faction to join. It could be said that the final results depended on the individual commander\u2019s eloquence.[Come to the side.]Hae Ack-chun called me. This time it was a task he had to perform, so why was he calling me?But I went to where he called me to. As I approached, he looked down at me and said.[You need to bring them all to me.]\u2018\u2026!\u2019Bring all the upper-rank warriors?I knew he was greedy, but this was too much!And don\u2019t they get to choose? But the old man continued to speak.[I will leave this to you. Try to convince them with your sassy mouth.][\u2026 You mean?]I was asked to persuade all of them.No, even so, the most experienced people were speaking out there. How could I do anything?It felt like I would have to push myself this time too.It\u2019d probably be more appropriate to say that this was going to be something difficult to do.[Teacher. How can I\u2026][Huh! Is this guy saying someone in my position should go out and speak to lure them in?][\u2026]So.You just wanted to look high and mighty?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Selection Ceremony (3)I looked at Hae Ack-chun. Honestly, no matter how great his pride was, making an effort to look good was difficult.However, wasn\u2019t it more burdensome when someone else did it?\u2018And it isn\u2019t just one or two\u2026\u2019But to bring in 6 people. This was a tricky scenario.-Is it challenging?\u2018So you think it is easy?\u2019Giving them choices was the primary variable. Since I had to bring in 6 of them, especially with competition from commanders of the other factions, it was honestly too much.-It is like the first meeting between a man and woman who are excited.\u2026 Sometimes, Short Sword feels more human than a sword. Well, how do I convince them?-Paint the package in gold.\u2018What?\u2019-Pack it nicely. If you were in that position, wouldn\u2019t you come if you heard the words you wanted to hear?If I was them?As Short Sword said, approaching it that way might be better. If I was given a choice, then what would I hope for?While I was thinking about this, Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cThe selection of the upper-rank candidates will be left to this disciple of mine.\u201dAt those words, the faces of the commanders brightened. It seemed that they had been worried that he would speak directly.Then the eyes of the commanders looked at me.-They think you\u2019ll likely be sloppy.Right.They were those kinds of eyes.To them, I was nothing but a child who was just granted the position of leader. I could feel that kind of sentiment from them. That was probably why I wanted to slap back.\u201cThen who will start?\u201dAt Gu Sang-woong\u2019s question, one person stood up.\u201cAfter all, there are seniors and juniors. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to call this an experience?\u201dHe nodded, and the rest responded.\u201cYou are right.\u201d\u201cDo we have to argue to speak too?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cThen Commander Song can do it.\u201dLooking at this, there was no difference between them or Hae Ack-chun.They were adhering to a ranking based on position and experience, so I was last. It was clear they wouldn\u2019t give me a chance.[What are you doing?]Hae Ack-chun was yelling at me in my head. It was clear pressure to act, but my thoughts were different.Since there wasn\u2019t an immediate selection by the candidates, this order wouldn\u2019t mean much. Instead, I thought that I should listen to all of them first and then adapt my speech to them.Honestly, it wasn\u2019t really possible to say to the commanders, \u2018My teacher is waiting. I want to go first.\u2019[Last isn\u2019t bad. I will do my best.]Hae Ack-chun raised his eyebrows at my response.[Be prepared if you let go of even one.]\u2026Ahh.Trying to meet the standards of this old man was so difficult. In the meantime, a middle-aged man with short stature and a protruding chin walked up first.\u201cNice to meet you. You new talents who will lead the cult.\u201dA good start.Since the kids were given options, they needed to be buttered up to lure them to your side.\u201cI am called Song Pil-chung, a commander of the Five Poison group, which honors Gu Jae-yang, the Blood Killing King.\u201dThe Blood Killing King, Gu Jae-yang.He was also called the most powerful of the Four Venerable Dignitaries.As his hobby was raising thousands of poisonous snakes, people were reluctant to approach him. He was feared for his own name as much as Hae Ack-chun, who was called the Ghastly Monster.\u201cElder Gu Jae-yang\u2026\u201dCommander Song Pil-chung, began to speak about his leader. He listed various achievements, such as victories in the past against different prominent and famous warriors.I made sure to remember all of them as I had forgotten a couple of things when I returned back in time.I do not remember everything exactly, but I was confident I would remember things about people if I saw them. In any case, all the commanders seemed to have come prepared.\u201c\u2026 about that much. And our Elder also cares for the talented\u2026.\u201dThe man held out his hand while speaking before suddenly slamming the palm on the ground.Phat!The ground, mostly dirt, became stained black in the shape of a palm and looked burned.The candidates all watched this with shock and admiration.\u201cHe is doing this again.\u201dThe other commanders were clicking their tongues.They must be thinking about their own speeches. However, since they dared to say such a thing about another commander, then this wasn\u2019t something that\u2019s just happening now.What Song Pil-chung was demonstrating was Poison Arts.Upon the blackened ground, he sprinkled something that looked like white powder.The ground then returned back to normal. It was a form of detoxification.\u201cSee that? This is the Venom Hand technique that was handed down by our elder. The elder cares for his subordinates, so he passes down his own unique skills. I hope you consider this.\u201dThis man\u2019s method worked.Two of six seemed to show interest in what was being said. Before my second life, I didn\u2019t notice this, but being in front of them, I came to notice even the smallest changes in front of me.Song Pil-chung looked satisfied as he ended his speech.-Pretty good. He seemed to have prepared in advance.Obviously, he did. If not, he couldn\u2019t have said something like this.The second one was Hak Jeong-gyeom, who almost had his hair ripped out by Hae Ack-chun.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Hak Jeong-gyeom, a commander who serves Elder Lee Jun.\u201dAnd in the same process, he spoke about famous things his elder did and the benefits of joining their side.\u201cHap!\u201dPapapak!Unlike Song Pil-chung, he showed off martial arts skills and even promised to provide guidance, but only 1 of the 6 showed interest.The previous presentation seemed flashier as it involved both poison and detoxification.\u201cTch.\u201dRealizing this, Hak Jeong-gyeom returned to his seat with an annoyed face. He might be a skilled warrior, but his words didn\u2019t have the same power.In this way, nine of them finished their presentations.\u2018Hmm.\u2019However, what was unusual was that while they gave their speeches, the kids should have shown interest, but there was one who was expressionless throughout.It was Cho Sung-won, the spy.Perhaps, because of that, the commanders were also conscious of him.-Most popular too.\u2018Right.\u2019Cho Sung-won had a position different from the other 5 candidates. He was close to being a first-rate warrior already, and his talent was evident to anyone who had eyes.Naturally, all of the commanders were focused on him.Puak!Finally, the last one came out.\u2018Someone from the First Blood Star\u2019s group?\u2019The only person who didn\u2019t give a presentation yet was from that side. Surprisingly, the one with the lowest experience among the commanders was from the First Blood Star.Yet, when the commander of the First Blood Star came forward, Cho Sung-won\u2019s eyes showed interest when they hadn\u2019t before.\u2018Why?\u2019He didn\u2019t show too much, but he looked quite interested. The commander of the First Blood Star held a long sword at their waist and had long flowing hair. The atmosphere was markedly better than the other commanders who walked before.\u201cI am Na Shim-hyung, commander of the White Blood troops. I serve under the First Blood Star, Jang Ryong.\u201dThe slightly hoarse voice suited him. It felt like the words had weight when he spoke instead of just being annoying sounds.Even the 5 other candidates couldn\u2019t take their eyes off this man.\u201cI will not talk about sir Jang Ryong.\u201dHowever, unlike the others, Na Shim-hyung didn\u2019t use the usual method. He didn\u2019t speak about his lord.\u201cWell, as the other commanders mentioned earlier, the Four Dignitaries and the Seven Blood Stars are people who deserve respect. So I don\u2019t think it is necessary to showcase them.\u201d-It sucks.As Short Sword said, my ears were turning itchy. But it made this interesting.The man scanned all 6 of the candidates and said.\u201cI can only tell you this. We, including First Blood Star, have fought and will continue to do so in the forefront against the Beggars Union.\u201dCho Sung-won\u2019s eyes narrowed at the mention of the Beggars Union. He was clearly reacting.Why did he react? Well, it was obviously because he knew about it.-What?\u2018Kaifeng is the foundation of the Beggars Union.\u2019The Beggars Union was the one who developed Kaifeng as much as it had as a capital.There were a lot of sects like the Beggars Union, but they were the only ones in that city. Strictly speaking, the Beggars Union was spread throughout the Central Plains while their sect leader was in that city.\u2018Right.\u2019I could understand why he chose to go under the First Blood Star. As information was the center of the Beggars Union, joining the First Blood Star would make it easy to contact them directly. The more time he spent with the First Blood Star probably would give him more time to think about an opportunity to strike.Before my regression, Cho Sung-won was assassinated before he could do much, so I didn\u2019t think much about it now.\u201cIf you are a true warrior, it would be the most honorable thing to fight in the front lines. This is what I want to say.\u201dHe ended the speech with that.The shortest yet the most impressive.I spotted the eyes of 2 other candidates that trembled at his speech, probably because it stirred a desire to go to war in them.\u2018Just like that.\u2019If my memory was correct, three candidates actually chose to serve under the First Blood Star. Thinking about it now, they must have felt attracted to this speech.-It is too strong.Well, whatever happened now, I had to go out.When Na Shin-hyung was done, the other commanders looked at me. Finally, it\u2019s my turn!I moved to the front and walked to the candidates. In my head, I could hear Hae Ack-chun.[You cannot miss a single one. Do well.]Seeing as his voice was heavy, he seemed aware of the effect Na Shim-hyung\u2019s speech had, and he looked concerned.[Teacher. Can I ask for something?][What?]I made the request, causing the man to frown before he nodded in agreement.-Wouldn\u2019t it be counterproductive?Short Sword asked worriedly. I\u2019m not even sure if it would work either.Still, the only person they would look at was me when I was speaking, so why not use that to my advantage?-What will you do?\u2018I have to go with a strategy that hasn\u2019t been used before.\u2019Looking at the faces of the candidates, they looked like they were already sure about which group to join. To tempt them away will not be an easy feat.I needed to bring something unique to sway them. I licked my lips.\u201cNice to meet you. I am a candidate who came in at the same time as you, Seolhwi, who recently got the position of leader.\u201dWhen I said I came in at the same time as them, they looked around with interest. This seemed to have a better effect than showing things off.I was grabbing their attention.\u201cAs you all know, I am the disciple of the elder called the Ghastly Monster, Hae Ack-chun. In a way, I can say that I am luckier than you.\u201dInstead, the candidates in the back reacted more to it.It was jealousy and envy. I continued my speech to do what I had to do.\u201cI am lucky. Since we are all candidates here, I don\u2019t think anyone understands your heart as much as I did.\u201dIf I talked for too long, they would lose interest, so I took a short pause, looked at all 6 of them, and continued.\u201cAs commander Na Shim-hyung said, it is meaningless to speak about my teacher.\u201dActually, there was nothing I could say about him. From what I know, his deeds were already known around here. As I started to speak again, 2 people began to focus on me.\u201cNo. Rather, I think it has been proven.\u201d\u201cProven?\u201dEven Hae Ack-chun frowned. He didn\u2019t like how I didn\u2019t speak like the others. Ignoring that, I continued to talk.\u201cLook at those other two who came in at the same time as you.\u201dUpon hearing my words, everyone looked at the twins. As they were unaware of what I had planned, Song Jwa-baek clearly looked shocked.\u201cEven they became leaders in one year\u2019s time.\u201dWhisper!The kids began speaking in whispers as soon as my words were heard.-Looks good.Right. Show clear objectives. There was clear proof that they could become first-rate warriors within one year. However, one of the kids who stood in the back spoke clearly enough for the 6 candidates to hear.\u201cThat was because the elder taught them himself.\u201dHe must have felt a sense of crisis and tried to interfere, but it didn\u2019t matter as Hae Ack-chun glared at him.\u201cWell. I think it was because we are the disciples. But there is one thing which is important that I have yet to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dEveryone was attentive to me.\u201cThat is because it was just the four of us, me, the twins, and our teacher.\u201dAt that, the six looked puzzled. I could even hear a snort. Right. Perhaps it came out like I was proud of the close-knit group. Not giving a care to the reaction, I continue.\u201cRight now, we start with a few, but soon many members will come under the teacher. At that time, you can become part of a core group in founding a new power.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019The ridicule stopped. Everyone understood what I was saying.Their eyes showed obvious shock as they wondered if the 6 candidates were tilting towards me.And now is the time to throw out the bait.\u201cThe other groups are good, but wherever you go, you will, of course, start at the bottom.\u201dI heard loud breathing. Everyone wanted to intervene, but no one could as Hae Ack-chun would kill them.\u201cThat fact can not be denied. I want to ask you this instead. Will you start as the tail of the dragon or the head of the dragon?\u201d-Kuk!Short Sword groanedI said it, but it felt like a decent statement.The candidates, who had been looking at the other commanders now, couldn\u2019t take their eyes off me.As I sent him a signal, Hae Ack-chun and I said together,\u201cAs you can see, we have a very small number of people in our group, so it is like a family.\u201dAt those words, the candidates glanced over. Standing there, Hae Ack-chun was smiling with the twins, and the twins were doing their best, smiling hard. It was awkward, but it was fine.Short Sword groaned.-You scammers! It is nothing like a family!Just unsee that.Then do I tell them it was going to be hell that they were walking into?Now that all the speeches by the commanders and I were completed, it was time for the candidates to choose. I wondered if my speech would have a lasting effect, though it was clear the other commanders did not have good feelings for me now.What can I even do even if you look at me like that?If I don\u2019t bring them all, I die!Gu Sang-woong exclaimed.\u201cNow. If the candidates have decided, choose the place you will go to. Trainee Lee Gyu.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLee Gyu got up from his seat and walked to the front.All the commanders stood in a line, all with anticipation in their eyes. It was the same as everyone watching.Puk!Lee Gyu walked to the middle and headed to the left. The commanders on the right sighed in disappointment.A smile crept onto the ones on the left as Lee Gyu walked to their side.And with each step, more faces were turning dark.Lee Gyu walked up to Na Shim-hyung and hesitated. I could see the man\u2019s lips rising upwards.-I don\u2019t think it worked.Short Sword said it sadly but Lee Gyu suddenly stepped further left. He knelt down on one knee when he reached me, bowed, and shouted.\u201cLeader So. I would like to receive a position under the Elder!\u201dNa Shim-hyung\u2019s lips descended as slowly as they had risen.\u201cKuahahahah! Good!\u201dHae Ack-chun laughed out loud at this. A good start.I sighed in relief. How mad would that crazy old man be if I had lost the first candidate to another commander?When the first candidate was done, our commander called for the second.\u201cCandidate Ha Mun-chan!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHa Mun-chan got up and stepped to the front quickly before stopping suddenly.Getting a strange feeling, I glanced to the side, and the lips of a few commanders were trembling,-He\u2019s in a hurry!It seemed like they were all anxious. Ha Mun-chan, who stopped, moved again before stopping in front of me.\u201cLeader So. I also want to receive a position under the Elder!\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled at this.\u201cI like him! Hahaha!\u201dI, on the other hand, was stunned. I delivered the speech, but people\u2019s feelings were unknown variables, yet two of them came to me from the start.Something felt strange to meClench!I could hear the sound of teeth grinding beside me. I felt a bit sad for them. Then the commander called for the third.\u201cCandidate Cho Sung-won!\u201dNow everyone was focused on this child. Although called third, everyone wanted him in their own faction,-But doesn\u2019t he have a purpose?Short Sword was right.The other commanders didn\u2019t know he was a spy with a purpose.Prrr!Everyone clenched their hands. Even Na Shim-hyung, next to me, was doing the same.They all wanted to get this man to try for a reversal.[He cannot be missed!]Hae Ack-chun yelled in my head. He said he liked this guy a lot during the test and seemed eager to have him.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I just stared at him.What would his choice be?He took a step, and everyone focused on him.Soon the faces of commanders looked disappointed. He headed for one person alone, and it was Na Shim-hyung.-He is faithful to the purpose.There is no way a spy would fall for my words. As he approached the Na Shim-hyung, the commander\u2019s eyes were smiling like he was sure of the outcome.Three more steps, and it will be confirmed. Then I sent a message to Cho Sung-won.[Hey! Beggar]Flinch!At that moment, his steps, which were moving fluidly, stopped, and he looked at me with bewildered eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Cho Sung-won (1)Cho Sung-won flinched as he stopped near commander Na Shim-hyung and frowned.I spotted his trembling eyes and noted that he seemed like he was in a hurry. Cho Sung-won stopped walking and sent a Voice Transmission to me in reply.[What are you talking about?]The guy asked me. Well, if I reacted more here, he\u2019ll get caught, right?Even if it ended with him hating me, I need to bring him in first.[That\u2019s right.][What are you talking about\u2026][If the sect leader of the Beggars Union is on the side of Kaifeng, it would be dangerous to stick to that side.]The moment I sent that message, his eyes trembled like falling leaves. He was more shocked than when I called him a Beggar.He should understand now the fact that I knew his real identity.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dNa Shim-hyung was becoming frustrated and asked a question.But, as if Cho Sung-won couldn\u2019t hear the words, he kept staring at me instead.-He is staring.\u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019I am going to have him either way. As soon as I looked at him again, the reaction came.[\u2026 What do you want?]I didn\u2019t answer and just pointed in front of me. Cho Sung-won, staring at me, took a step to my side.\u201cHurry up- oh\u2026?\u201dHowever, contrary to the wishes of Na Shim-hyung, he stepped to my side. The guy then knelt down and said.\u201cLord So. I would like to receive a position under the elder.\u201dI did it!The guy changed his mind. And this changed his history from what I knew.\u201cKuahahaha!\u2019Hae Ack-chun spat out his laughter without hiding his feelings because he was getting whoever he wanted. On the other hand, the others haven\u2019t been able to get anyone.[Leader\u2026 So. What did you say?]Na Shim-hyung sent me a message without even turning his head. Perhaps it was because of Hae Ack-chun.When the candidate who should go to them suddenly walked over to me, he didn\u2019t seem to understand why.[I said nothing.][You said nothing?][I just said that I wanted him to be with me.]I said this because I wouldn\u2019t need to make more excuses. Na Shim-hyung frowned and didn\u2019t say anything more. He seemed to have given up because he didn\u2019t get the desired results.On the other hand, the other commanders were glaring at me.-I can see daggers in their eyes.Was everyone feeling like Na Shim-hyung? Maybe they were. As a spy, I realized there was nothing more difficult than controlling one\u2019s emotions.Even I had trouble with it, so what about them?At that time, Gu Sang-woong, the commander, started the process again.[Candidate 4.]It was cold.A dagger from someone\u2019s eyes flew and pierced my chest.Hae Ack-chun stared at me with angry eyes.-The old man has too much greed.Short Sword grumbled.Unfortunately, I failed to recruit all 6. I also had a good prediction that we wouldn\u2019t get one or two of them.One went over to Song Pil-chung and the other to Na Shim-hyung. Fortunately, the other two came over to our side.-I thought they would all come. It was weird.-There was nothing strange. The human mind is the most complicated thing\u2026-Right, right. My former owner would say the same.Iron Sword, too said the same thing.Since each person had their own line of thought, any number of things could happen. That is why it was said that there was no such thing as a perfect strategy for war.Hae Ack-chun bluntly spoke to me.\u201cI wanted to praise you, but you want to get cursed instead?\u201dIt would be okay to get praised, but he was chewing me out for the losses instead. Still, it doesn\u2019t change that I failed.As I bowed my head, Song Jwa-baek was smiling. It must have looked good for him because I was getting scolded quite a lot today.\u201cStill, young master\u2019s skills aren\u2019t normal.\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019I heard a voice speak to me for the first time. When I turned my head, a middle-aged man with a large scar on his nose was approaching.-Couldn\u2019t sense him?Iron Sword asked me. To be honest, I didn\u2019t notice the man until he spoke.\u2018An expert.\u2019He was skillful enough that it was difficult to recognize his presence. Perhaps even Song Jwa-baek didn\u2019t notice him either as he looked visibly shocked.Then the middle-aged man grinned.\u2018Did he do something?\u2019Killing one\u2019s qi presence to hide was something done by someone who was well known. My gaze turned to his hands.Judging by the lack of weapons, he seemed to be a close combat warrior. The calluses on his fist also gave that fact away.\u201cHehe, if you had come, you should have run here. Where were you?\u201dHae Ack-chun seemed to know him. It must be a face he knew.Chak!The middle-aged man bowed.\u201cI apologize, Elder. I was watching because it was too interesting.\u201d\u201cWhat is so funny? Tch.\u201d\u201cI think I understand why Elder accepted the young master as his disciple.\u201dThis goes beyond mere familiarity. This was the first time I\u2019d seen this old man act so warmly.\u201cStill, too far away. And you, you\u2019re acting like this? Well, just greet each other. Until ten years ago, he was the one who worked behind the scenes under me.\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s introduction, the middle-aged man opened his mouth and turned toward us.\u201cJang Mun-wong, commander of the Horn Bell group, greets the young master.\u201dA commander.I wasn\u2019t sure since we didn\u2019t fight but compared to the other ones I saw today, he felt exceptionally skilled.Tak!I, too, bowed with my hands clasped.\u201cSo Wonhwi greets the commander.\u201d\u201cSong Jwa-baek greets the commander.\u201d\u201cSong Woo-hyun greets the commander.\u201dCommander Jang Mun-wong lightly nodded back at our greetings and then turned to Hae Ack-chun.Why did I think that was weird?They did great, but it wasn\u2019t like they were recognized as a disciple of Hae Ack-chun.\u201cAs instructed, we have secured several people in the Great Evil Prefecture.\u201d\u201cAnd the results?\u201d\u201c22 low-rank, 12 middle-rank, and 2 upper-rank.\u201d\u201cI see. There is no difference between you and this one.\u201dHae Ack-chun expressed his dissatisfaction. Aside from trust, how far does this man\u2019s passion go?\u201cI apologize. I am not as witty as the young master here.\u201dFrom their conversation, I learned two things.Firstly, this commander was someone Hae Ack-chun trusted to do tasks for him, and he had been given the task 6 months ago.\u2018Great Evil prefecture\u2026\u2019I knew there were three more places to train new kids besides here. They were also distributed like a points system, so I didn\u2019t know of them.However, Commander Jang Mun-wong seemed to have secured a few from another place, following the commands of Hae Ack-chun.\u201cThe command you gave for a place\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201dAt those words, the commander went silent. It wasn\u2019t just about getting people; there seemed to be a base prepared too.-This crazy old man isn\u2019t normal.\u2018I know.\u2019He didn\u2019t tell us anything and kept getting things ready for his goal. As expected of him.His thoughts went higher and further than mine. I wondered how vast the forest he planned to create.\u201cHehe, the \u2018family\u2019 is increasing. It\u2019s time to finish living in that cave.\u201dThat was nice to hear.It was warm now, but living in caves during winter was brutal. Despite using internal qi to protect the body, staying in the cold all day with only rocks for company wasn\u2019t easy.Besides, there were too many bugs now.-Right. A lot. We slept together for just a few months, and maybe a dozen spiders must have already gone into your mouth.\u2018What?\u2019-You didn\u2019t know?Had I known, I would have spat them out!\u2018No, why did you tell me?\u2019-You said it was delicious and ate it, so I didn\u2019t bother.\u2018You!\u2019-Yah. Still, they are like medicine.\u2018What?\u2019-You still caught a few from entering, but the bald guy there would just chew on anything which went into his mouth. Those bugs would\u2026\u2018Stop!\u2019Just thinking about it gave me goosebumps all over my body. Song Woo-hyun didn\u2019t just eat spiders by mistake but also the ones who crawled in?I was relieved that none of us got sick from it. At the same time, Hae Ack-chun spoke to Song Jwa-baek.\u201cTake some kids and get the things from the cave.\u201dIt looked like the move would happen now. Only four people were living in that cave for a year, so the living expenses would increase from now.-The old man is thrifty, though.\u2018And the other ones?\u2019In addition, there were quite a few personal items of Hae Ack-chun in the cave.These were the things no one would want to touch.\u201cYah. How many would I have to take?\u201dSong Jwa-baek asked me. Assuming the luggage in the cave is carried down at once, I thought 7 should be enough alongside him and me.\u201c7. As I saw earlier, the kids are quite good.\u201d\u201cHmm. Well, of course.\u201d\u201cAre you going to call them?\u201d\u201cWait and see.\u201dSong Jwa-baek moved to the front and went to the candidates to count the number of people. It was convenient because they already knew how to move. Song Jwa-baek, this guy, liked to play the role of leader.-Those kids will keep taking advantage of him by praising him.-My former owner told me to always be careful of the people who praise me.-Right, your previous owner was unable to meet a woman because of that, right?-No, since he was devoted to the sword\u2026-So boring.Listening to these guys talk, I felt bored too.Meanwhile, Song Jwa-baek selected the candidates who were proficient in footwork to climb up the mountain. Among them were a few I knew.Cho Sung-won.-He has been staring at you since he came.I know.He had continued to stare since he took our side. He must be restless since he knew that I knew about him.Seeing that he applied to bring down the luggage, it seemed like he wanted alone time with me. Well, I, too, needed some time with him.\u201cNow! Let\u2019s start!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith Song Jwa-baek in the lead, we set off for the cave. We began to move from the main hall of the Six Blood Valley to the peak in the distance.As I was about to climb up, Cho Sung-won said,\u201cLeader.\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cI have something to talk about. Can you spare some time?\u201dBecause we were all stuck together, we rarely had some time, so he was trying to create a chance for us to be alone. I had to respond, so I looked at Song Jwa-baek, who shook their head and said,\u201cHurry up. Don\u2019t you know the teacher will yell at you for coming late?\u201d\u201cI get it.\u201d\u201cYou all follow me.\u201dTat!Song Jwa-baek climbed up the mountain.The others were amazed at his skillful movement. Having learned the method, Hae Ack-chun used, his ability to climb the mountain was the best among the ones here.Of course, now I can learn it too. Still, it was impossible to run on the incline like Hae Ack-chun, but now I was able to climb up the cliffside a bit better.Song Jwa-baek and the other 4 completely disappeared from the view, leaving Cho Sung-won to say to me.\u201cSo Wonhwi.\u201dWhat?He was calling my name?\u201cThe third son of the Ikyang So family of Yulang of Hunan province. \u201cLook at this.Information from his mouth was as expected from a Beggars Union Spy.\u201cYour mother was short-lived, and since you were young, the dantian was damaged, and you are called trash. This is the information I have on you.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dHe summed everything up. It was, after all, one of the three major information organizations.Or did he just know about the Ikyang So family as it was a known family in Hunan?\u201cNow, you don\u2019t seem to want to hide that you are a Beggar\u2026\u201dThen, he suddenly moved to me, and his palm came up to my stomach.\u2018An attack?\u2019Tatak!I quickly stepped back, but he followed me with his unique, staggering footsteps.Taktak!My judgment was wrong.He wasn\u2019t just close to a first-rate warrior, but already a first-rate warrior.Moreover, the footwork and martial arts he was using weren\u2019t ordinary.Papak!The guy\u2019s hand kept moving in front of me. It was like a dragon ascending to heaven.-The technique, avoid it! It is the Eighteen Dragon Palm!Iron Sword shouted.\u2018What?\u2019I was shocked at the mention of the Eighteen Dragon Palm. Wasn\u2019t that a technique only the Beggars Union\u2019s branch leaders could learn?Despite being a third-rate warrior before my death, I knew about the famous martial arts of the prominent sects.\u2018Tch!\u2019I had to draw my sword, but I didn\u2019t see an opening for it. This guy\u2019s movements were quick, and he came close to smashing my chin. I slammed both fists at him.Pat!\u201cHuh!?\u201dAlthough the method looked simple, Cho Sung-won\u2019s attack had a lot of force, making my body float a little high.At that moment, he reached out to me. A fierce battle unfolded as if a dragon had opened its mouth to kill me.-Ascending DragonIron Sword seemed to know most of the techniques.If I cannot avoid it, I have to hit back. I, too, raised my hand with internal qi raised and stretched out.Pat!The difference between a proper technique with a path of internal qi and an idea.Papapak!I launched my body out at him and pushed him back.His right palm trembled violently as if he had been struck with a strong, blunt force.It seemed like it was true that this was the technique of the Beggars Union.Cho Sung-won, who stood still, saw my hands trembling.\u201cI recommend staying still. The tension in your body will spread throughout as my qi is within you. You have to cultivate to release it out.\u201d\u201cYou hid your skills.\u201dAt my words, he smiled.\u201cIf you drew that sword, it might have been a little difficult for me.\u201dLook at this man. Full of confidence.And he said,\u201cYou know you\u2019re not my opponent, right? Now answer my question.\u201dHe was interrogating me. Seeing that, I lowered my trembling hands and sighed.\u201cPhew.\u201d\u201cIt is nice the tables are turned.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI drew out Iron Sword right away and hurled it at him.\u201cFoolish!\u201dCho Sung-won spread the distance at the same time while he defended himself against the sword. The guy tried to deflect the sword to the side with his elegant footwork.The moment his palm touched the sword, it bounced back.Pang!\u201cUh?\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes widened.In that state, I gently turned the sword and hit him in the abdomen with the sword. He hastily blocked it with his own sword.However, as if being hit by something strong, his body bounced backward.\u201cEuk!\u201dHe tried to relieve the pressure of the sword qi digging into the palm of his hand and tried to cultivate it.After a few bounces, his body fell to the floor.Thud!Cho Sung-won looked at me, his face showing that he did not expect this.\u201cYou\u2026 hid your skills too?\u201dI said to him, who was shocked\u201cToo late to figure that out now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Cho Sung-won (2)Unlike other warriors, I could utilize not only the dantian in my lower abdomen but also the one in the middle of my body.In terms of quantity, it would only be slightly above a first-rate warrior\u2019s internal qi, but since it was innate qi, there was a clear difference in quality.I only managed to fully understand the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s cultivation method just a month ago.Now I had managed to overcome the limits of an average first-rate warrior.Shh!Cho Sung-won was shocked and jumped back. His staggering and wildly moving gait displayed the skills of the Beggars Union, but I still quickly caught him.\u201cKuak!\u201dIt must have been embarrassing.Even if he was a skilled warrior, it still wasn\u2019t easy to fight someone who used a sword. Besides, the difference between him and me was glaringly obvious.Shhh!My swordsmanship, the Loach-shaped Sword, moved fluidly. Cho Sung-won countered using his sword technique which moved gently like a willow branch.Papapak!In order for his counter to change the battle, he needed to block my sword using a new technique, but his movement didn\u2019t have the same fierceness he showed at the start.He was clever enough to move his sword and strike the isolated areas of my sword to block it. He definitely was skilled.However, my sword was a lot faster than his sword and hands.\u201cKuak!\u201dHis palm must already be tingling with the sword energy that had entered it. Cho Sung-won\u2019s face was turning red as he gradually attempted to prevent the energy from further entering the body.\u2018A gap.\u2019As it became harder for him to withstand the pain, I spotted a small gap and pierced my sword through it. As the tip of my sword was about to dig into his right shoulder, he panicked and tried to use his sword.\u201cI thought you would do that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt that moment, I made a change. I turned the direction of my sword upwards with the intent of splitting his head.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Cho Sung-won, who sensed his death nearing, flinched and closed his eyes. Instead of cutting him, I instead slammed the side of my sword to his head.\u201cOuch!\u201dThe guy screamed in pain, but his head wasn\u2019t split. If I didn\u2019t hit him with the flat side of my sword, he would have died instead of just screaming in pain.\u201cKuak!\u201dWith all that pain, he must have thought his head had been wounded and covered it with his hand. Cho Sung-won, who confirmed that his head was fine, looked puzzled instead.\u201c\u2026 Why?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t aiming for it.\u201dPuck!\u201cKuak!\u201dI kicked him in the stomach. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a warrior or an average person. Being hit in the stomach without expecting it was painful.It would be a pain that you would never forget all your life. His face became red as if it would explode, and his body was crouched in pain. I then sealed his blood points.Tatatak!Now he would not be able to use internal qi. He was in shock but still tried to speak.\u201cW-wait\u2026 let\u2019s talk\u2026\u201d\u201cI was trying to talk, but who was the one who attacked first?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026\u201dI grabbed Cho Sung-won\u2019s hair as he tried to make an excuse.Clench!\u201cW-what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI accumulated a lot of things over the past year because of the old man. You can thank him for this, I guess.\u201dI\u2019m giving him such a great chance. I could see a reflection of myself with clenched fists reflected in his shining eyes. I immediately slammed my fist into his face without mercy.\u201cKuak!\u201dA sound similar to the snort of a pig could be heard. I gained a bit of understanding as to why Hae Ack-chun enjoyed beating others so much.When I released all my anger onto him, it felt like pent-up indigestion was going down. I felt very cooled down.-You made porridge out of a human.Short Sword clicked her tongue. Cho Sung-won, who was beaten pretty severely, collapsed. Still, I looked at him.I didn\u2019t use any internal qi and only struck with pure strength.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I looked at the crumpled-up person. There were only a couple things I needed to ask.A person trained as a spy had something in common with me, who also did the same. That was the self-determination to kill themselves to prevent information from being leaked. However, it was unknown how often those threats were used to try to escape being beaten.-It might be because he doesn\u2019t want to die.Well, it had to be that.If there was anything I regretted in life, it was the spies who begged for their life after leaking information. Even so, it was too easy.At least such things tended to only happen when they were tortured, such as pulling their nails out. Moreover, it was pretty clumsy for a spy to threaten me just because their identity was discovered.\u2018Strange.\u2019-What is strange?\u2018The Ascending Dragon Eighteen Palms.\u2019It was a widely known martial art that was known throughout all of Murim. Only those in the immediate family of the sect leader of the Beggars Union could learn it.-So, is this guy the next heir?That was a possibility that couldn\u2019t be ruled out. But is there any reason to use the heir as a spy? Common sense was that spies were humans who could be disposed of at any time.So to send the heir as a spy? Made no sense.-Yah. But if you know the future. Don\u2019t you know who the heir is?I knew.Which is why it was even stranger. Before my return to the past, the successor to the Beggars Union was Hong Geol-gae. I\u2019ve even seen that man\u2019s face.\u2018Hmm.\u2019What was the true identity of this man?-What are you so worried about? Just ask him.\u2018I will.\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure he would speak the truth if he had so many regrets about his life that he was begging for it.And if he didn\u2019t speak, there was another way.\u201cYah, Beggar.\u201d\u201cEik!\u201dSince what I said was true, he flinched back.\u201cI am not going to hit you.\u201dHe still seemed suspicious of me. I leaned over to make eye contact and tapped on his head to make him nervous.The boy spoke with a trembling voice.\u201cWha\u2026 What is your true identity? How can you know me\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t speak up, but I knew it already.His true identity was out, so it was natural to ask such questions. The information he had about me, on the other hand, was just my family name and other common stuff.I snorted.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dHearing my words, he clenched his teeth. I was in control of the situation, so why did I have to explain things to him?\u201cI ask the questions here. You only answer what I ask.\u201dThe boy shut his mouth.Keeping his mouth closed would do him no good. I had already thought about what I wanted to ask, so I asked anyway.\u201cThe Ascending Dragon technique, that should only be taught to the direct descendant of the head\u2026 what is your identity?\u201dAs long as I knew the name of the martial arts he used, he was bound to feel some fear.But that wasn\u2019t much for me. Even if not for Iron Sword, I could have easily recognized the technique.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, you should start telling me.\u201dHe bit his lips at my words. The fact that information shouldn\u2019t be leaked must be ingrained in his mind.\u201cPhew.\u201dThud!I grabbed his hair and hit his head on the ground, making him groan in pain.\u201cKuaaak\u201d\u201cThe heavier your mouth, the more pain your body will feel.\u201dHe grunted as he clenched his teeth. He was actually bearing this?Then, I just have to change the question.\u201cNice. So, what do you have to do with Hong Geol-gae?\u201dIf he had learned the technique only the sect leader\u2019s family could learn, then the relationship had to be like a sahyung, a sajae, or something like that.But my words changed his expression. Until a second ago, he seemed determined to hold on to his secrets, but now it felt like he wouldn\u2019t, so he asked.\u201cWhat is your relationship with Hong Geol-gae, the successor\u2026\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019His eyes were slowly turning red. Rather than being sad, it looked like the emotions he was trying to hold back had broken through.-What is with this kid?How should I know?\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201dAt my question, the guy asked with a trembling mouth.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cFor real\u2026 is he the successor?\u201dI frowned at his words. There was anger in his voice.I thought it was a simple sahyung to sajae relationship, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.-Then?\u2018Somehow, he\u2026\u2019-A competition?\u2018Has to be.\u2019It felt like I unintentionally hit the wrong spot, which had made him open his mouth. But I wasn\u2019t that sure yet.-But, is that man really the successor?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019-Uh? Then you are lying?Could this be called a lie?I wasn\u2019t sure when it would happen, but Hong Geol-gae would be around 30, so I just said it because that was someone whose future I was sure of. I just thought that the position would have been officially declared 10 years in the past, but I guess it wasn\u2019t.\u201cWhat is wrong with Hong Geol-gae being the successor?\u201d\u201cThat fucking old man!\u201dCho Sung-won cursed out loud. The way he spoke sounded so natural that it felt like his actual way of speaking.Well, the way beggars talk was always known to be vulgar to the ear.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t fucking stand it for a year\u2026\u201dTears were welling up in the eyes of Cho Sung-won. It looked like he was angry.Tuk!I loosened my grip on his hair, patted him on the back, and tried to comfort him with a soft voice.\u201cLooks like you didn\u2019t know. Who the next leader would be.\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201dThe boy burst into tears and cursed. With this kind of emotion, I thought touching him would be fine.\u201cYou were fighting for succession with him?\u201dHe got angry at my question.\u201cWho is fighting with whom? It makes no fucking sense to take the damned bastard as the successor who doesn\u2019t even know to do martial arts just because of the grandchild\u2026\u201dSlap!Before he could finish, I slapped him and put a finger on his lips.\u201cSpeak slowly and quietly. You are being loud.\u201dI took a deep breath, and so did he to calm his nerves. Then he spoke in a quiet voice.\u201cHe\u2026 he is a successor with nothing. What kind of person is he who studied for over 5 years but could barely master the sect\u2019s martial arts!\u201d\u201cAnd you learned all of it?\u201dHearing my words, he went silent. Seeing his expression, he didn\u2019t learn it all either.\u201c\u2026 that damned old man, for the sake of his own grandchildren, didn\u2019t teach me, so I didn\u2019t get to learn. If only I was given the attention, I would have long since completed learning it.\u201dI scratched my head at his words. He really wanted to be the next successor.-He does look like it, right?-It is human nature to want to be above all.Iron Sword said the right words.Even if there were just three people, they would want to decide on a leader. Since he was being taught martial arts by the leader, this guy, too, aimed to be the leader.After listening to this, I could understand the whole picture. And to him, I said.\u201cAnd you said you would do a good job as a spy?\u201d\u2018..!!\u2019His expression went stiff right away. It looked like I touched the right nerve.I brought out what I guessed, and he was already biting the bait.\u201cUnable to bear being pushed away by the blood, you must have thought of infiltrating the Blood Cult and exposing their base or to dig out some huge information, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Murim Alliance, too, is wary about the revival of the Blood Cult. This is the only way you would get recognition.\u201dThe guy kept becoming stiffer with each word. What would change if you kept staring at me? Huh?\u201cBut what do we do? A successor is already appointed. How will you be recognized for your work and be in line for the next leader position?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd would the sect leader or the successor leave you alone?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?\u201dThe boy, who didn\u2019t speak till then, asked me with wide eyes, and I just replied with a timid smile.\u201cThe sect leader said he was anxious to hand over the sect to his grandchild, right? So if you build up merit and become recognized by the other people, what if they don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThe boy\u2019s eyes were trembling. He understood where I was going with this.\u201cWhat if, for example, the successor didn\u2019t like the idea of you doing this and leaked the information of you being a spy here?\u201dWith those words, I pretended to cut my neck with a thumb, making his face turn dark.\u201cThey can get rid of you without even getting the blood on their hands, right? If that happens, everything you came to do will be in vain? Ah, no, not in vain. You would be remembered as a spy that spied on other sect leaders. And that will be the end of merit you get from people.\u201dHis eyes widened at my words. It must have been confusing for him.-Wow\u2026 you are amazing. Like the old man but with a finer brain!Short Sword clicked her tongue.-How did you think of this? Look at his eyes shake!\u2018No. It could happen in the future.\u2019-What could happen?Thinking about it, in the past, this child was killed too easily.And considering that Beggars Union had influence all over the world, did it make sense for them to leave their spy to die?Besides, he was someone who learned the martial arts of the sect leader\u2019s family.-They deliberately left him to die?\u2018If my guess is right, yes.\u2019This guy was abandoned. If a definite successor was decided, the others in line would be a hindrance.Cruel, but that was the world we lived in, thin as ice.Thud!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe guy slammed his fist to the ground. It felt like he realized the words I said were reality.-So what do we do? Are you going to get some good information from him and give him to the old man and get merit?\u2018No.\u2019-Uh?Did I have to do that?I did want to do it before knowing his story. If he was a card discarded by the Beggars Union, it would be a waste to just leave him here.Did they have to let him come into the Blood Cult?-Then?Cho Sung-won was in disbelief as he thought of many things.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a shame to end like this?\u201dAt my words, he looked at me with a puzzled expression.\u201cFor that guy Hong Geol-gae to become the next leader and you to die here.\u201dCho Sung-won\u2019s face was turning darker. He looked like he was giving into despair, and I said,\u201cI will give you a chance.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean?\u201d\u201cA chance. A tip. A cleanup. Make up your mind.\u201d\u201cClean up? That\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you swear to follow me, we will no longer have to continue with these talks.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Cho Sung-won\u2019s eyes widened. I was giving him a choice.And to shake him down further, I said.\u201cAre you going to die as a nameless spy of the Beggars Union? Or will you take revenge alongside me?\u201dA ripple of life could be seen in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Cho Sung-won (3)We both were climbing up the cliffside of the mountain. Compared to the basic footwork method learned in the Blood Cult, the technique used by the Beggars Union was amazing.Though it was a technique that made the user look like a primate that utilized their hands and feet. That\u2026-He climbs the cliff like a dog\u2026Well, when someone walked on their four limbs, it tended to look like that. Still, the speed was shocking.But do dogs climb cliffs?-He isn\u2019t an idiot. How do you plan to solve that?The reason Short Sword asked this was because of our conversation half an hour ago.Cho Sung-won, burning with desire to get his revenge, almost fell for my words until he asked a question.[Leader So, according to your words, that old man would reveal that I am a spy of the Beggars Union embedded here?]Even if he was a clumsy spy, he wasn\u2019t as stupid as Short Sword said. He was someone who used his head.It was clear, as he said, a situation where the Beggars Union could release the information cannot be ruled out.He said he would swear to be under me if I could solve that possibility. He handed down that burden to me.-If you don\u2019t want to, then spit him out. No one likes a thorn in the mouth. You\u2019ll get hurt if you try to bite down on a thorn without a plan.Short Sword was speaking the truth. I shook my head since I, too, had the same thoughts as her.I sent a message to Cho Sung-won, who was climbing up like a dog.[I have one thing to ask.][Yes?][Did you come in as a spy on your own? Or did someone in your sect know about this?]The boy didn\u2019t answer right away. It looked like someone knew.[Did you not come alone?][No. I came alone.][You came alone? If you aren\u2019t being honest, it wouldn\u2019t be good for your life.]He paused for a moment at my words and said.[\u2026I asked the beggar in charge of the Huan branch for information about the Six Blood Valley to collect the records of the villages and missing people in the last decade.]Ahh.Was this because he wasn\u2019t aware of the power struggle? He didn\u2019t report to people directly but left his marks.-They might know.\u2018Probably.\u2019Even if Cho Sung-won didn\u2019t report it directly to a superior, this must have already gone into the ears of the sect leader sooner or later.He had been missing for a year, so their doubts would have been answered. However, as they have been silent till now, my predictions were correct.-He was abandoned?\u2018Right.\u2019He was in a position to fight for the succession. But the man himself disappeared.It was now possible to process and release the information at the right time to get rid of Cho Sung-won.-Sounds bad.The head of the Beggars Union dealt with large amounts of information. Of course, it was inevitable that their head moved faster than other sects. It was really just that they planned things out.-Why not just give up? We don\u2019t have to get involved in this.Short Sword warned me. She was speaking the truth.If I took him in, I needed to prepare for the blow.-Giving up?I asked her.\u2018If we have a thorn, we should blunt it down before eating.\u2019-Uh?Short Sword seemed puzzled as we managed to arrive at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s cave. The candidates were already moving the luggage out.Song Jwa-baek inside looked at me and walked up angrily.\u201cYah! I told you to come up quickly\u2026?!\u201dThe guy frowned as he looked at Cho Sung-won\u2019s puffy eyes and swollen face.Cho Sung-won gently raised both hands and looked at him as if he meant to explain it.Then Song Jwa-baek came to me and asked.\u201cIf you were going to discipline him, you should have told me in advance.\u201dHe was saying, \u2018Look. You should have done it in moderation.\u2019 However, his following words were weird.\u201cYou jerk. Still, he is a newcomer.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCho Sung-won asked.Even the other candidates, surprised at Cho Sung-won\u2019s bruised face, became shocked at those words.Honestly, they didn\u2019t know, but if that crazy old man hits you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see for a few days. On severe days we would be forced to crawl, so this looked cute in comparison.\u201cDisciplining?\u201d\u201cSo like family.\u201dI could hear the whispers of the candidates.Right. This was a family-like atmosphere, now and in the future too.We came down with the luggage in our hands, and the other candidates moved them.I took Cho Sung-won to the place where Hae Ack-chun was staying. Before entering the room, I said.[When we go inside, don\u2019t show any reaction, and most of the time, just accept what I say and answer what I ask.][Uh?][If you want this to be resolved well, do what you are told.][\u2026 okay.]He said with a worried face because he didn\u2019t know what he would be put through. Either way, I knocked on the door.Knock!\u201cCome in.\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s voice could be heard. He must have recognized us because he didn\u2019t even ask who we were.Druk!I opened the door, and Hae Ack-chun was with Jang Mun-wong. They seemed to be having a serious conversation.\u201cWhat? Why is his face like that?\u201dAs soon as we entered, Hae Ack-chun looked at Cho Sung-won\u2019s face and asked, to which I casually answered.\u201cIt took a little bit of work to figure out if he was hiding something.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Hearing those words, Cho Sung-won\u2019s eyes were like they would explode. He believed that the problem would be solved and followed me, but I was pushing him into it instead.\u201cHiding? What do you mean he is hiding something?\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t from the Lower District.\u201dHae Ack-chun and Jang Mun-woong frowned at the same time.\u201cWhere is he from if not from the Lower District Sect?\u201d\u201cBeggars Union.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe name Beggars Union changed the expression on both their faces.It was the momentum to move. Cho Sung-won looked at me, not knowing what to do.He didn\u2019t have to say anything, and his eyes were doing the speaking practically screaming, \u2018What are you doing!\u2019He probably didn\u2019t know that I would reveal this.Pak!\u201cUh-huh!\u201dHae Ack-chun rose up and grabbed Cho Sung-won by the neck. Cho Sung-won could do nothing but hold on to Hae Ack-chun\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat did you plan? You must be a spy\u2026\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHae Ack-chun looked at me, not being able to understand.\u201cIt is true that he came to commit himself to us.\u201dAt my words, Hae Ack-chun asked.\u201cHow can you be sure of that?\u201d\u201cYoung master. What the elder is saying is right.\u201dJang Mun-wong was siding with the old man, and I said,\u201cTo be precise, he came from the Beggars Union but not part of them.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dTo the two who were puzzled, I explained Cho Sung-won\u2019s situation. I explained that he had joined the fight for the successor position of the Beggar\u2019s Union and was pushed away by the leader\u2019s bloodline and desired to get revenge on them.Hae Ack-chun glared at Cho Sung-won with a suspicious look.Of course, I didn\u2019t think it would work by itself, then Jang Mun-wong asked.\u201cBut how did the young master know that he is from Beggars Union?\u201dThis is the crucial part. Without changing my expression, I said.\u201cI saw him in Yulang County a few years back.\u201d\u201cYou saw him?\u201d\u201cHe came to the Ikyang So family for work.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Ikyang So.\u201dJudging from his reaction, he seemed to know about my origin.\u201cAt that time, I didn\u2019t recognize him, as he was younger and seemed a lot messier than now, but I could recognize him during the selection process.\u201dAt my words, Cho Sung-won, dangling by the neck, looked at me with confusion. Well, that was natural. We both never met.A pure lie.\u201cSo you remembered?\u201d\u201cRemember? Cho Sung-won tried to apply for a higher position with the help of the family head of Ikyang So.\u201dAnyone could see that he tried to join Na Shim-hyung\u2019s side and suddenly changed his direction.\u201cBecause I recognized him, I sent him a message, and he was shocked.\u201dCho Sung-won nodded his head in fear. Hae Ack-chun looked at him and asked.\u201cSo, how did he come out then?\u201d\u201cIt was quite interesting.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAt first, he was afraid that his origin would be figured out, and he would be kicked out, so he begged me not to tell. Tch tch.\u201dHearing my words, Cho Sung-won looked confused. It seemed absurd that I was telling them stuff that never happened.-As expected, you are a scammer.Short Sword clicked her tongue.Now she was appreciating me when I lied, then I continued.\u201cWhat would the teacher or commander have done?\u201d\u201cUm?\u201d\u201cStill, I couldn\u2019t believe him. I thought he was a spy, so as you can see, I ended up using my hands.\u201dI pointed to his bruised face. It seemed like the commander understood it. However, they still seemed suspicious of him.\u201cYoung master did say that you used your hands, but it feels like we need to confirm further if or not he is a spy.\u201dHere, I threw in what I prepared.\u201cHe has been in the valley with us for a year. But he gave me some interesting information.\u201d\u201cInteresting information?\u201dAnd I told them,\u201cHe said the relationship between the Murim Alliance and Warriors is likely to break.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJang Mun-wong got up from his seat. Hae Ack-chun, too, looked shocked, and Cho Sung-won just nodded as he looked at me.Because I was saying things that he didn\u2019t know.-What? Is that real?It was real.About half a year from now, the alliance between the Murim Alliance and the Warriors would break down.As the relationship between the two forces broke down, the Blood Cult, which had been hidden, would begin to rise up.Before I died, it was just something that happened, but now it could be important information for the Blood Cult. At least they would get to prepare.Hae Ack-chun looked at Cho Sung-won in confusion.It looked like he wanted to kill the guy a moment ago, but it all changed in a second.Hae Ack-chun looked happy as he received this new information, and all this was done by me.As we moved away, I sent a message to Cho Sung-won.[Good? No problems, right?]Cho Sung-won nodded. He didn\u2019t have to worry about his sect trying to throw him away.\u2018Uh?\u2019But suddenly I realized something.Obviously, even if the information was released that he was a spy of the Beggars Union, usually the Blood Cult wouldn\u2019t protect him, but I changed the situation.\u2018And if this guy releases information about me inside the Blood Cult to his side, I will not only become an aide to this guy according to the Beggars Union but will be given an achievement too.\u2019Suddenly, I would be a traitor who sold information about the Blood Cult.Cho Sung-won recognized what happened.\u2018Ha!\u2019Even if he changed his mind, he could not back out anymore. It is absurd, but So Wonwhi looked at him and smiled.A genuinely clever and terrifying person.\u2018\u2026 what is his identity?\u2019Cho Sung-won thought, but he could never know.Depending on the information, So Wonhwi was a person who didn\u2019t hesitate to move ahead.It wasn\u2019t known why this person was called his family\u2019s trash. But one thing was sure.No, Cho Sung-won\u2019s instinct told him that this man was too dangerous to be made an enemy.Cho Sung-won, who looked at So Wonhwi for a long time, lowered his head slightly and said.[I swear my allegiance to Leader So.]At midnight that night.I got out of my room and headed for the vacant lot near the main hall.It\u2019s time to receive my reward for the bet with the Bloody Hand Witch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - The Bloody Hand Witch\u2019s Ability(1)When I managed to arrive at the vacant lot, I could hear the buzzing of insects around me. The Bloody Hand Witch hadn\u2019t yet come.She could be a little late, or maybe she was trying to hide her presence before suddenly popping up.Or maybe she was staying in the main hall instead of the guest hall.-Why?\u2018What do you mean why?\u2019It must be to protect the descendant of the sect leaders. Baek Ryeon-ha will be staying in the main hall, so the Bloody Hand Witch and her followers would have to be there\u2013or maybe they were still in talks?-Because of the information you gave away?I don\u2019t know. It should have been more appealing because the name of Beggars Union was attached.In order to convince the suspicious Hae Ack-chun and Jang Mun-wong, who were only recently active outside, I had to give out three pieces of information I knew.Both of these things were good, but the information about the alliance between the Murim Alliance and the warriors was something that could shake the future.As the sun went down, I watched Hae Ack-chun and Jang Mun-wong enter the main hall.It was speculated that this information wasn\u2019t held solely by Hae Ack-chun, which meant things needed to be discussed with each major person in the Blood Sect, so I assumed that was what they were heading in there to do.Something which had to happen in about half a year, but what effect would come from the small ripple I had just created now?This could not be a simple ripple that will be ignored. Strangely, my heart was pounding.-What is making you do that?Before coming back to life again, I was only a simple pawn.A third-rate spy who was being swept back and forth by the tides, but I now am different. Knowing the flow, able to affect the calm waters.-That could be considered real strength.\u2018Right.\u2019It may be even more terrifying than the strength of the experts out there.While I was having a conversation like this, I suddenly felt a presence approaching. Judging from the fact that they didn\u2019t seem to be bothering to hide their presence, it could only be the Bloody Hand Witch or her followers.-Three.Small Short Sword said that it was three people who came from the vacant lot. It was Han Baek-ha and two other women with their noses and mouths covered by a cotton cloth.The cotton cloth left their eyes revealed, and it felt like I partially recognized them.\u2018Dam Yehwa? Baek Ryeon-ha?\u2019The two who followed Bloody Hand Witch were those two.But why did she bring them?No.To be precise, it has to be just Dan Yehwa she brought along. Since Baek Ryeon-ha was higher than the Bloody Hand Witch, she could do whatever she wanted.-But why wear that cotton cloth? Didn\u2019t she lose the bet?At Short Sword\u2019s words, I clicked my tongue. Was every person around me like that crack old man?Tak!I clasped my fist into my palm and bowed,\u201cI greet the Sixth Blood Star.\u201dShe nodded and approached me,\u201cI am a little late.\u201d\u201cNo, I had just arrived.\u201dI waited for over half an hour, but that wouldn\u2019t be the right thing to say. Suddenly, Han Baek-ha complimented me.\u201cIt seems like the young master is filled with quite a lot of talents; the sect appreciates you.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026.\u2019-What is with her?\u2018The old man must have talked.\u2019It did seem like Hae Ack-chun had shared some information. I wonder if he talked about Cho Sang-won as well.It will become messy if someone else tries to covet him. He is someone I still have use for.-You did expect that the old man would move, right? Didn\u2019t you say that yourself?\u2018I did.\u2019While I was talking with the short sword, Baek Ryeon-ha looked at me. The way she was staring felt strange.I didn\u2019t know what she was thinking, but it seemed like maybe this was in my favor.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I was still puzzled when Bloody Hand Witch simply stated,\u201cI need to keep my promise.\u201dIt was good to hear her say it so directly. I couldn\u2019t ask her to teach me with my own mouth. But then she continued,\u201cI thought about what I should teach you, Young Master. However, most of my skills are related to my group, so it would be difficult to teach them without taking one in as a disciple.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2019About the same as what I expected. Perhaps she would pass down the most useless talent. Still, it would be good to learn something, right?\u201cBut as the Sixth Blood Star, if I teach useless tricks, I don\u2019t think I will have a face to show people.\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019What? So she would teach me something good?-She has to be playing with her words. Do you really believe her?Short Sword yelled at me. But her words were right.No matter how useless it was, wrapping words in plausible meaning would make the other person feel less bad.\u201cThis talent I acquired over 20 years ago at the shrine of an unnamed ancestor. It could be more useful for someone as clever as Young Master than for someone like me.\u201dWhat was she planning to teach that she was dragging this out? And if she got this 20 years ago, what would her age be?Right now, she only looked to be around her mid to late thirties.\u201cIt was because of this talent that the title Witch was added to me.\u201dShe suddenly pointed her finger to her face.\u2018\u2026?\u2019\u201cYoung Master, look me straight in the eyes.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dWhat did she mean by saying look her in the eyes?Despite the question, I was already looking into her eyes. Her black pupils. And the pupil was moving like a whirlwind.For a moment, my mind seemed to go hazy, and it felt like my consciousness was drifting. It was then.Ba-dump!In the middle of this showing, warm energy surged through my chest, and my mind came back to life. It was all too spontaneous.\u2018What just happened now?\u2019-Did you lose consciousness?\u2018Consciousness?\u2019-It was just for a second.It was a strange phenomenon. The moment I felt her look into my eyes, I could feel myself being sucked in.But I had experienced this before. When I first met this woman and looked into her eyes, I felt the exact same thing!And her reaction was just too similar. Han Baek-ha looked quite shocked,\u201cIt was no coincidence.\u201d\u201c\u2026what was that?\u201d\u201cTo endure my Illusion Eye twice. Young Lord has strong mental power.\u201dIllusion Eye?Did she notice that?She did say I survived due to my mental power, but that wasn\u2019t right; it was the innate qi that soared high and protected me.\u201cPuah.\u201dIt was a very small sound, but there was no way we couldn\u2019t have heard it. Dam Yehwa, who was behind Han Baek-ha, covered her mouth with her hand. I felt like she had fun watching me stumble.\u201cI-I am sorry, teacher.\u201dWhen everyone looked at her, she felt embarrassed, and to her, Han Baek-ha said,\u201cCome forward.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dNot knowing why she came and stood in front of Han Baek-ha. Han Baek-ha made eye contact with her, and Dan Yehwa, who flinched, then collapsed.Tak!I, who was behind her, quickly grabbed her shoulders. And when I grabbed her shoulders, her legs which seemed to be out of strength, suddenly moved, and she waved her hand away.\u201cW-what happened to me?\u201dDam Yehwa asked, shocked.\u201cYou almost fell.\u201d\u201cI almost fell?\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to believe me.-\u2026 so strange?I was quite surprised too.She seemed completely unaware of what had just happened. Even if the light touch had brought her senses back, the skill the Bloody Hand Witch possessed was quite bizarre.Seeing me shocked, Bloody Hand Witch said,\u201cIt is a kind of suggestion.\u201dSuggestion?What was that supposed to mean? Well, she was kind enough to explain,\u201cPeople who are in a state of confusion or forgetfulness are supposed to respond subconsciously to special stimuli.\u201dDid that mean she was forcing someone into a corner and defeating the opponent? In a way, it was terrifying.In Murim, where the blink of an eye was enough for death to come, this was scary.\u201cHuhuhu. I know what you are thinking.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t as easy as Young Lord thinks.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cBasically, Illusion Eye doesn\u2019t do well on people who have strong mental strength. It will only be for a minute second, like what the young master did. And to do this, the caster will have to use a lot of concentration.\u201dIt seems like the condition for using it was more difficult than expected. Han Baek-ha continued,\u201cAnd a light touch\u2026\u201dTak!She clapped her hands.\u201cIf an external shock like this or any other form is applied, one will wake up. In the end, it is difficult to use it in a chaotic situation or battles where life and death could be decided.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIf one would wake up from the slightest stimuli, then this was a huge mess.However, it sure seemed like a good skill to use when the opponent was being careless. If it was overused, though, the others would become wary of it.-So, that was why the old man was blocking your path.When I first saw her, he was trying to protect me. That meant he knew about Illusion Eye.It was a technique that was exposed around him, so he was able to respond quickly, and I thought learning this technique would be quite good.\u201cSo? Would you like to learn?\u201dTak!\u201cI would!\u201dI bowed and thanked her. As soon as I accepted it, she told me about the Illusion Eye and how it worked.Unlike martial arts, it was kind of like a mental trick, and according to her, this needed a lot of concentration.Obviously, the conditions were difficult. She taught me the procedure and method to use it and also told me its secret.[The book I previously mentioned told me that this technique could be divided into four stages. The first step is to steal of consciousness of the target. It is said that if that can be done, the opponent will feel confused or lose their thoughts.][Then, will there be other effects if it can be mastered?][Right. But that is impossible.][What?][Unfortunately, the book didn\u2019t include a way to make the Illusion Eye stronger. It was torn in half.]Ah\u2026That was sad.But even if she knew, I doubt she would teach that to me. This was a talent that could only be used only occasionally when making eye contact or if the other conditions were met.Besides, I knew part of it. Still, I tried my luck and asked,[Then what would the effect of the other 4 steps be?][It was written that the second step is to make the target do what we intend to. Of course, that isn\u2019t as effective as the previous one.]Interesting. If the suggestion was strong enough, it seemed possible.[Even hurt themselves?][That might not be possible.][Why?][As I said in the description, it is a technique to make the other person unconscious and act. People protect their own bodies even when they are unconscious.]In other words, they could not harm themselves. Actually, if that was possible, the Bloody Hand Witch would have had a more notorious name.[They say that hallucinations can be shown in the third form][Hallucinations?][Some poisons cause hallucinations. In the same way, reaching the third stage will show the target such things; it will make them see things.]The more I got to know about this technique, the more frightening it felt. Be it an effect for a long or short period, it was something that would terrify the enemy.If the three stages are like this, then what about the last one?[Last one?][Unfortunately, the book didn\u2019t speak of it; the book was torn starting from the last stage. The previous verse says that the illusions happen by influencing the five senses, but I have no idea what it means.]Influencing the five senses?It seemed like an abstract expression, so I didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to say. Well, the Illusion Eye was a scary technique.As a result, I regretted it a lot.-Do you still want to learn it? With just one stage?I agreed with the short sword\u2019s words.\u201cNow. I passed on everything I knew. Would you like to try?\u201dI nodded at Han Baek-ha\u2019s words. I had to check right away if it would work.\u201cYehwa.\u201d\u201cUh. Yes?\u201dWhen she was called, she looked startled. Short Sword added,-I was wondering why she brought her, but she brought her for this purpose.I agreed with her. The other disciples of Baek-ha were skilled, so she brought the weakest one for me to use.This was so pitiful.One loss, and this girl was pushed through all sorts of hardships. Dam Yehwa looked at me with a half-crying face.\u201cDo it.\u201dHan Baek-ha pointed at her with her hand. I felt sorry about it, but what could I do?I looked into her eyes.And I memorized all she had told me and focused only on the eyes. It took me a while since I wasn\u2019t familiar with such techniques.\u201cPhew.\u201dIt was a lot harder than I thought.Dam Yehwa laughed at the thought of me struggling with this. Seeing this, I suddenly had a thought.Even if Illusion Eye\u2019s first stage was the only part that could be used, it seems like it had to be\u2026It was then!Shh!Dan Yehwa suddenly looked blank and took her veil off.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019The Bloody Hand Witch and Baek Ryeon-ha were also puzzled by her actions. But that wasn\u2019t the end.Shh!She unwrapped her top and tried to take it off.Shocked, I hit her on the forehead in a hurry.\u201cAhh!\u201dDan Yehwa\u2019s dazed eyes returned to their normal state.As she blinked, her face turned red, and she tried to scream, being aware of what he had just done.\u201cKuaaa\u2026.up!\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha shut her mouth and looked at me.-What did you do?Short Sword asked me.How could I know?When I opened my eyes wide, intent on making it work, I only wanted her to faint.Confused about what happened, I looked to the Bloody Hand Witch, who too seemed to be in disbelief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - The Bloody Hand Witch\u2019s Ability (2)The Bloody Hand Witch looked at me with wide eyes, and mouth opened as she blinked.It was my first time seeing her this shocked. It was only then I understood what had just happened.\u2018No\u2026 it was the second stage?\u2019Han Baek-ha had told me.The second step was to influence the other person and have them act as we intended. If I had heard correctly, this was exactly that.-Brat. You are a man, after all!What are you saying? I strongly denied the words of Short Sword.-Why deny it now? I understand now. Any man would want to see a woman naked, right?Don\u2019t put it like that! Isn\u2019t it strange to do this here?It would look like I am ridiculing her in front of everyone.-But you did cause that, right?I just thought it would be funny if she took off her mask and danced. But it was just a fleeting thought.-Yes, yes, right.This is insane!Not only this idiot, but even Baek Ryeon-ha was looking at me with cold eyes.Eyes close to disappointment. Even if she didn\u2019t know about the second stage of Illusion Eye, she must be angry at me for making Dam Yehwa take off her clothes.\u201cYoung master,\u201dHan Baek-ha called out.This situation was so terrifying that I didn\u2019t want to know what she would say, but she didn\u2019t seem to care about Dam Yehwa\u2019s condition and spoke approvingly,\u201cWhat did you do just now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you? It was clearly the Young Master who did\u2026\u2019She went silent and continued in Voice Transmission.[That was the second stage of the Illusion Eye. How did you do that?]Han Baek-ha was obviously curious; it seemed like she wanted a clue as to how this happened.But I didn\u2019t know.[I don\u2019t know.][Don\u2019t mess with me. It happened right in front of my eyes. Are you trying to deceive me, the teacher who taught you?]Her eyes narrowed.It seemed like she didn\u2019t want to listen to my words. Actually, if she had known this, she would have done a lot more things.-What does that mean?Short Sword asked because she didn\u2019t get it.\u2018She wants to know how to reach the second stage.\u2019-How? Hmm\u2026I think it would be better not to tell.I agreed with her. But she saw it with her eyes. How can I lie now?Besides, she looks like she would do anything to get it out. In the end, I let her know what I could think of.[I just thought it would be nice if she had done something weird when doing the Illusion Eye.][\u2026 and you wanted Yehwa to take her clothes off?][It isn\u2019t like that\u2026]She called Dam Yehwa without listening to me.\u201cYehwa.\u201dShe hurriedly tied her clothes and answered with a red face,\u201cT-teacher.\u201d\u201cLook into my eyes.\u201dDam Yehwa didn\u2019t ask twice why and looked into the eyes of her teacher, who couldn\u2019t be disobeyed. I wondered what would happen. The two stood watching each other.\u201c\u2026\u201dFor a while, nothing happened, making Han Baek-ha frown. It didn\u2019t seem like the second stage was happening.\u201cYoung master.\u201dShe called me.\u201cYes. Sixth Blood Star.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, do it.\u201dHan Baek-ha pointed to Dam Yehwa with her hand. The woman wrapped her arms around her body with a grim expression.She seemed convinced that I was up to something.\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that\u2026\u201d\u201cBut my clothes were\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dHan Baek-ha stopped her from arguing. It seemed that she only wanted to know about the second stage.\u201cLook into Young Master\u2019s eye.\u201d\u201cB-but teacher\u2026\u201d\u201cDo it!\u2019Dam Yehwa had no choice but to step back at those words. Her orders were strict in such groups. And she looked at me with a dissatisfied face.-She really hates it.\u2018\u2026 right.\u2019What can I do about what already happened? There was no way I could relieve her worries now.[Let Dam Yehwa sit and stand.]Han Baek-ha told me.\u201cPhew.\u201dAt this, I looked into the eyes of Dam Yehwa. And then memorized all I was told and looked into her.Han Baek-ha didn\u2019t take her eyes off him and looked at both me and the target. As before, I thought of Dam Yehwa sitting and standing.\u2018\u2026\u2019But even as time went on, there was no response. Rather, my eyes were hurting from the effort of focusing too long.\u201cSixth Blood Star\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem to work.\u201d\u201cYoung master. Are you doing this on purpose?\u201dHan Baek-ha seemed suspicious of me. She didn\u2019t seem to believe me. So I looked at her. Dam Yehwa also seemed to be getting pain in her eyes for looking at me for too long.Suspicious, Short Sword whispered,-Oh. Did you cheat? You didn\u2019t\u2026.\u2018No.\u2019-You aren\u2019t cheating?If I lied, would my eyes be stinging like this? I really memorized the technique.I also wanted to make sure Dam Yehwa was fine this time, but I wasn\u2019t cheating.\u201cHmm.\u201dHan Baek-ha looked at Dam Yehwa for a while, and then as they looked at each other, Dam Yehwa flinched and staggered.\u201cUh!\u201dTak!But this time, she was up without anyone holding her.\u2018Ah.\u2019Looking at this, it seems like the first stage. It was good. On the other hand, it was like she was trying to check if I was actually performing the technique properly.\u201c\u2026looks true.\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201dShe nodded, looking at me.\u201cI understand. I will believe the words of a young maser. I kept my promise to help, so let\u2019s stop and go\u2026 ah.\u201dHan Baek-ha, who was about to leave, turned to Baek Ryeon-ha like she remembered something. And then Baek Ryeon-ha looked at me and shook her head.Looking at that, it seemed like she also wanted to do something with me.-I think this was planned.That was weird. Would this small bet make anyone change their mind?And she was the candidate for the sect leader.However, I had to stop at the words I had just heard,[Sexual offender]\u2026 damn it.Thanks to the mistake, Baek Ryeon-ha and Dam Yehwa got it right.The anger of Dam Yehwa could be avoided, but what do I do about the next candidate for the sect leader? I didn\u2019t want to be looked down on.Short Sword tried to comfort me.-You just have to clear up the misunderstanding later. Cheer up!The problem was that I didn\u2019t when I got the chance to. I had to tell them I wasn\u2019t a horny person.But there was nothing more foolish than trying to regret what happened.-Then why did they walk up in a hurry?Short Sword asked me.She saw Han Baek-ha, who was returning to the main hall. Even though it was really late, she was heading back to the main hall.\u2018Because she has a clue.\u2019-Clue? Do you mean about the Illusion Eye?\u2018Yes.\u2019It could be a coincidence, but the second stage had been executed.She would have the desire to implement it in her head, so she must be heading back to practice now.Drr!When I quietly opened the door and walked through it, Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun were lying on the floor.Since the number of rooms for people was limited, three of us had decided to share one room. Sleeping on the floor of the cave was something we had gotten used to, so the twins decided to sleep on the floor, and the bed was given to me.-Here? Wonhwi.The South Heavenly Iron Sword asked me. I left him in the room because I didn\u2019t think I would like listening to the two fight.-Are you done?\u2018Right.\u2019Afraid the two would wake up, I was slowly walking in. Sitting on the bed across from the ones lying on the floor, I loosened the sword from my waist and placed it on the edge of the bed.It was then.Shh!Song Jwa-baek, who was half asleep, got up and looked around,\u201cWhere did you go?\u201dIt seemed like he was wondering where I had gone, as I had disappeared in the middle of the night. I told him while shaking my head,\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026if it really was nothing, would you go out and come back this late?\u201dThis guy was so annoying. Why is he talking like this?He looked at me like I had to listen\u2026 ah!Suddenly, I wanted to test the Illusion Eye against him.-Illusion Eye?Right.It didn\u2019t work on Dam Yehwa the second time, but we never know.I didn\u2019t know if I could do it, but I figured testing it out couldn\u2019t hurt. So I decided to try it and focused on his eyes.\u201cWhat are you doing? I asked where you have been! Why are you staring at me like that?\u201dThe guy asked with an annoyed voice.He felt annoyed that I was staring at him but not answering. I definitely had to train more. It took a while as I wasn\u2019t used to it.\u201cYah!\u201dHe was angry and tried to get up. That moment.As he tried to get up, he suddenly went blank, and he sat down and looked at the twin who was sleeping.Song Jwa-baek who looked at his twin, slammed his twin\u2019s smooth head with his palm!Slap!Song Woo-hyun opened his eyes in shock at the sound. Song Woo-hyun looked at his brother in anger.At that time, Song Jwa-baek hurriedly pulled back his hand and said,\u201cW-why am I hitting\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Song Woo-hyun jumped up and hit Song Jwa-baek on the forehead.Thud!\u201cKuak!\u201dSong Jwa-baek collapsed with that hit. He passed out too, the only sound which could be heard was his breathing.Song Woo-hyun, who put his twin to sleep, lay down and closed his eyes.-Puahahaha!Seeing the scene, the Short Sword burst into laughter. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t. I knew it.\u2018Is this it?\u2019The second stage of Illusion Eye, which I thought was a coincidence, succeeded again.In just three days, I learned a lot about the technique. It was because I tried it out on several people.The first step was the same as what Bloody Hand Witch had told me. But the second stage was completely different.And here was what I found:First. When caught by Illusion Eye, there were some differences between people. Five counts was as long as most people would act under my will. Dam Yehwa must have stopped taking her clothes off for the same reason.Second. A target who had been caught once couldn\u2019t get caught in the Illusion Eye in quick succession. I got caught as a result of doing it again against Song Jwa-baek. When I tried again, he got mad at me, saying the twins had been fighting since last night.I tried it on others but got the same result. Looking at it, it felt like there had to be a different situation to make it happen.Third, It was possible to move the target as I wanted with Illusion Eye, but it was impossible to bring out the information the target knew.I did what I intended but couldn\u2019t come up with anything more spontaneously. That was the disappointing part.Fourth. It didn\u2019t work on those who had strong mental strength or those stronger than me. I tried it on commander Jang Mun-wong, just in case, but the effect didn\u2019t work on him.Thanks to this, I stopped trying it on him.And the last and the most important, fifth.Unlike the first stage of Illusion Eye, the second stage consumed innate qi. I didn\u2019t notice the first two times I used it, but as I continued to use it, I began to feel a significant drop in my innate qi.-Is this why she could only do the first stage?\u2018Yes.\u2019As Short Sword said, Bloody Hand Witch had been using this for over 20 years but had no effect. But I could use it as soon as I had learned it.This managed to convince me.The method for making the suggestion of Illusion Eye stronger was innate qi.-Oh. Then if the innate qi is strong will the third stage be possible?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019I tried to see if the third stage illusion was possible just in case, but it didn\u2019t work.It could be because of a lack of innate qi. If this was right, as Short Sword said, the third stage would be possible.-Kyak! Still, we learned something useful. If that witch found out, it would make her stomach hurt.The Bloody Hand Witch thought I wouldn\u2019t move higher so she taught me this. But what now?She had given me a technique that even she couldn\u2019t fully master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - The Guest To Six Blood Valley (1)A rift was forming between the Murim Alliance and the warriors.The stone thrown by So Wonhwi was causing a bigger ripple than he had predicted. Within just one month, the news had spread to all the groups in the Blood Sect, all of which were scattered around. The earliest place to receive the news was the Jiangxi Province, which was adjacent to the northern part of Guangdong, where the Six Blood Valley was located.When the news arrived there.This was a place deep in the middle of the mountains.A hermitage that looked normal from the outside, but inside there were numerous cavities connected like the tunnels of an ant hill, and the base was hidden there.There was a place that was decorated with an old feeling. Numerous shapes of bright colors were on the wall.Below it was the names of the people who had died while gaining fame in the Central Plains. This was a commonplace of the land.An old man with grayish hair curled behind him was reading a book.The old man who seemed involved in the book exuded a weird dignity that would make others a bit wary of approaching him.This old man was one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, Seo KalmaThere was a person waiting with a respectful attitude in front of Seo Kalma; it was commander Hak Jung-gyeom.After reading the book in hand, Seo Kalma smiled. As soon the book was clenched, it was torn to shreds, showing just how strong he was.\u201cThings seem to be getting interesting.\u201dSeo Kalma got up, and he looked at the numerous paintings hanging on the wall with eyes misted with emotion. And he said,\u201cThis was faster than expected.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dHak Jung-gyeom, who hadn\u2019t read the contents of the book, didn\u2019t know what he meant by that. Without taking his eyes off the paintings, Seo Kalma responded,\u201cThe time has come for our sect to rise again.\u201d\u201cYou mean!\u201dHak Jung-gyeom\u2019s eyes trembled.If one was a member of the Blood Sect, wouldn\u2019t they dream of this moment? Seo Kalma also couldn\u2019t hide his excitement.\u201cThe time has come, but our sect is still scattered and not as one, so this must be fixed.\u201d\u2018Ah!\u2019Hak Jung-gyeom understood what he meant by this.Seo Kalma was preparing for the revival, but no one had supported it until now. However, he said to make sure that this gets processed now.\u201cHak Jung-gyeom.\u201d\u201cPlease command me.\u201d\u201cCall Geum Won and Eunjae. And get ready to head to the Six Blood Valley.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?Geum Won and Eunjae.They were the disciples of Seo Kalma. The fact that he even called his disciples to head to the Six Blood Valley\u2026 Did it mean that Seo Kalma was running for Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s side?Hak Jung-gyeom was puzzled.Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be Baek Hye-hyang? Whatever his thoughts were, he had to follow his master, Seo Kalma.At the entrance of the northeastern part of the Henan province located in the middle of the country.Kaifeng was a place that boasted a large populace, especially for being outside the capital.Many murim sects were taking root in Kaifeng.Like the proverb, \u201cjust below the lamp is the darkest,\u201d there was a force moving in the shadows of this place. It was Jang Ryong, the First Blood Star\u2019s Thunder Blood Sword.The main place is at the top of Kaifeng.Behind the Place of Flame, the Flower Merchant Group was stationed in a mansion that boasted its wealth.The mansion was full of gardens and had flowers all around the year.There was a woman with red hair in a light dress who was reading a booklet in the flower garden. The woman who was reading opened her mouth.\u201cHave you read this?\u201dBehind her stood a middle-aged man who was 6 foot tall and had a sharp look. He was actually the Flame Flower Merchant Group\u2019s head, and Jang Ryong, the Thunder Blood Sword of First Blood Star, ranked first among the Seven Blood Stars of Sect.\u201cI read it as it arrived before my lady came.\u201d\u201cIt would have taken quite a while if we got this from the Six Blood Valley.\u201d\u201cIt probably took around twenty days or so.\u201dIt would have taken longer if it was a public route that was being used. The man who called her my lady smiled.\u201cAnd Elder found this information?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cElder seems to be doing good. It seemed like he wasn\u2019t that interested in the working of our sect.\u201d\u201cNot anymore, I guess.\u201dHae Ack-chun\u2019s promise to raise his own group and compete had reached the ears of all the people in the sect because of the commanders who participated in the selection ceremony.The red-haired woman folded the booklet and put it down.The blood-red eyes which were hidden behind the book were now shown. And with her cherry lips forming a smile, she said,\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI am only here to follow my lady\u2019s orders.\u201d\u201cOrders. Put that nonsense aside; you said you were going to be someone with an advisor position; give me some insight you have.\u201dDespite the harsh tone, Kang Ryong spoke with a smile,\u201cThe First Elder and myself, as well as the Fourth Blood Star and Seventh Blood Star, are currently serving the lady, and recently the second elder has been showing a favorable interest too.\u201dIt meant that she was getting the support of equivalent numbers.\u201cOn the other hand, \u2018she\u2019 only has the Third Blood Star and the Sixth Blood Star.\u201d\u201cHuh. They should be dealt with once the sect has risen.\u201d\u201cYou are right. But do you remember what we have told you?\u201d\u201cA chance.\u201d\u201cYou remember. She was also someone who had inherited his blood. Small actions will cause big consequences.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give even a small room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou mean to bring in the Fourth Elder, Hae Ack-chun to our side and destroy her hope?\u201d\u201cYes. That was clever.\u201d\u201cBut will that old man come here?\u201dShe had met the man several times in the past 5 years. But all that came back was cold refusal.After all, he was a loner who had great pride and would never back down. With a fishy smile, Jang Ryong said,\u201cThat is when the Third Elder has nothing to lose.\u201d20 days had passed since I had learned the technique Bloody Hand Witch had shown me.Contrary to the expectations that there would be a change in the daily routine I had, only the location was changed to the main hall of the Sixth Blood Valley.We were all still honing our martial arts with Hae Ack-chun.As the commander, Jang Mun-wong was entrusted with the middle and upper-rank trainees, and there was no concern for me, Song Jwa-baek, and Song Woo-hyun.According to Hae Ack-chun, after completing the basic training for our group, they would move to the new base. Meanwhile, we were given another mission.To go above our leader and become a commander.\u2018Did you think that the disciples of mine will end with being just leaders?\u2019That was true. Even the disciple of Bloody Hand Witch was a commander. If this man\u2019s disciple was just a leader, it would hurt his pride.But becoming a commander from a leader was just too tough!The most basic qualification that a commander should have was to go beyond a first-rate warrior and to the master level.Of course, my skills did surpass the first-rate warrior level. But they were all hidden skills, and the skills that were public hadn\u2019t all been shown to be first-rate skills yet.So, now I am struggling.\u201cKua!\u2019It looked like I would puke up what I ate in the morning. One kick from Hae Ack-chun and I was already feeling like I would die.\u201cYou cannot even stand 3 attacks!\u201dHae Ack-chun roared like the crazy old man he was. It would be nice if the level was set right, but he was really showing off his power here.\u201cHuh!\u201dAt that time, someone was aiming for Hae Ack-chun from behind. It was Song Jwa-baek, whose upper body muscles and body-stained copper were being shown as he took off his shirt. His body had become stained copper due to falling to the ground repeatedly and the usage of the True Blood Diamond Body.It was good to aim for the back while he was focused on me\u2026Pak!Hae Ack-chun turned around at the speed of light and grabbed him by the neck, only to throw him down.Bang!\u201cKuak!\u201dSong Jwa-baek, who had his head stuck to the floor, went limp as he fainted. Seeing that, Hae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.\u201cAn idiot. If you are going to attack from behind, don\u2019t scream!\u201dI wanted to say the same.He should have just moved, but that wasn\u2019t the end yet.Phat! Swish!There was the sound of someone running in. Hae Ack-chun frowned and turned his head,Bald Song Woo-hyun came flying in like a squirrel. The momentum was too much as Hae Ack-chun reached for him.Pakt!Hae Ack-chun blocked the headbutt with his bare hand despite being pushed back around 4 steps.Papapak!That was the end. Hae Ack-chun, who was pushed back a little, hit him on the head.Papak!At that moment, Song Woo-hyun\u2019s body bounced back. Truly the man was a monster.He used Song Jwa-baek and me as bait and ended this. And he had only been pushed back four steps throughout all of this.\u201cTch, the three of you working together only to move me four steps. So embarrassing.\u201dI was angry.I wanted to challenge my own skills. Because even if I did my best, it would change nothing. Hae Ack-chun was a monster that I could never surpass with these meager skills.In order to fight on equal footing with him, it would be possible to do when I reached a little closer to him or when I was able to use the 6th\u00a0level of internal energy.-I am not sure of that.\u2018Uh?\u2019-Hae Ack-chun. He has become too strong. It seems like he achieved a development equal to or beyond that of my former owner.South Heavenly Iron Sword thought highly of this man. The last time his former owner fought with the old man was 15 years ago.There was no way Hae Ack-chun was sitting idle all the while till now.If so, could I defeat him by being able to reach the 7th\u00a0level of perfecting the Xing Ming technique?It was said that even the South Heavenly Swordsman couldn\u2019t do that. As I thought of it, Hae Ack-chun shouted at us.\u201cContinue! Keep coming!\u2019\u201cPhew.\u201dCatching my breath, I got up. Relieved the qi, which was hit into my stomach, and I began to feel more comfortable.As I adjusted my form to run in, Hae Ack-chun looked somewhere and signaled a stop.\u2018Ah.\u2019On the hill stood a woman with a white cloth covering her face.-Uh? Her.Short Sword recognized her.Baek Ryeon-ha, the woman who I passed by a month back in the plot near the main hall. I was right, but why did she come here alone?The two seemed to be talking with Voice Transmission\u2026\u201cWonhwi.\u201d\u201cYes. Teacher.\u201d\u201c\u2026 follow along.\u201dHer purpose wasn\u2019t Hae Ack-chun but me.I followed her without a word.I wanted to go to the main hall, but we went to a place away from there. It seemed like they didn\u2019t want anyone noticing us.When the warriors of the Blood Sect were nowhere to be seen, she opened her mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s talk here.\u201dHa Yeon\u2019s voice could be heard. Although she lost weight, this Miss Ha Yeon was Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cYoung master. Do you know who I am?\u201dWithout taking the veil off, she asked. An ambiguous question, so I couldn\u2019t tell if she was asking me whether I knew if he was Ha Yeon or the possible head of the sect.But it didn\u2019t matter, since I knew this voice for sure, so I pretended to be surprised.\u201cThis voice? Aren\u2019t you miss Ha Yeon?\u201dSeeing me like that, she shook her head and said,\u201cYou know I am not asking about that.\u201dAh\u2026It was the other one.She looked at me with clear eyes.\u201cYoung master seemed to be smarter than the other people I met. But I think it is weird if you don\u2019t know who I am.\u201dShe seemed convinced that I knew her true identity. Well, I do know.There were a lot of things I could guess from what she had shown me. And all she did was cover her face a little.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201dShe asked, looking at me.Was the right answer saying I knew? After thinking, I tried to be honest. But then\u2013Swish!She and I turned our heads at the same time. There was a presence of qi. With the rustling sound, someone appeared.A young man with thick eyelids, wearing a grey robe around and a long sword.-He looked like a goblin.Well. That was accurate.The face did remind me of a goblin.It was the face I was seeing for the first time, but the fact that he was able to act like this meant that he was a member of the sect.\u201cHaa. I finally found you.\u201dThe young man\u2019s face brightened as if he found something, and mumbling, he looked at us.\u201cYou are from the Six Blood Valley?\u201dKnowing this place must mean that he was a member of the sect. Baek Ryeon-ha didn\u2019t seem to answer, so I moved and said,\u201cYou are right.\u201dTo be precise, we are staying in the Six Blood Valley for now.\u201cThank god. I was lost on the mountain road because it was my first trip to the Blood Six Valley.\u201dWhat?He was speaking like getting lost was a natural thing. Was it because I looked younger than I really was? Or is it because he had a higher status than me? This man looked so much like a goblin sucking other people\u2019s blood.\u2018Go Eunjae?\u2019My eyes widened as I slightly recognized the name.\u201cI am Go Eunjae, the second disciple of Second Elder, Seo Kalma of. I wanted to ask for directions.\u201dAs he revealed his name and said he was the second disciple of the second Elder, I thought of something.100 years later, he would be a human who would gain a name for himself, being called the Toad Blood SwordsmanHe hated the title because it made fun of his appearance, his eyelids which looked thick, and he was villainized for killing everyone who called him that.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering?\u2019Perhaps because of his status, he seemed to have a pretty good attitude. If he was going to come to the Six Blood Valley, then he would come to know me, so saying it now would be better.\u201cIt is an honor to meet young master Go Eunjae. I am So Wonhwi, the first disciple of Third Elder.\u201dHe looked shocked.Was I a famous enough person for him to act like this?The man who was staring at me suddenly smiled.\u201cAhhh. You are So Wonhwi!\u201dThere was something off about the way he talked. It felt far from nice.\u201cTeacher did something useless.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cStill, let\u2019s see your skills!\u201dClang!Go Eunjae pulled out his long blade and flew to me, ready to fight. If I didn\u2019t stop him, he would take me down.-Wonhwi. Pick me up!I know!I pulled out the South Heavenly Iron Sword. And to not let Baek Ryeon-ha get hurt, I moved ahead of her and blocked his blade.Chang!The blade and sword collided, making my stomach hurt. Well, I did expect this much from the disciples of Second Elder, but this guy surpassed the wall of first-rate warriors. The strength around the blade was nothing short of amazing.He wasn\u2019t someone who I could handle with only my internal qi.\u201cThis is the Fourth Elder\u2019s disciple? Tchtch.\u201dHe giggled, looking at me. I didn\u2019t like him. Right away, I wanted to splash his body.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha\u2019s hands were dyed in red.If she didn\u2019t decide to do it, it felt like he would come further ahead.\u201cOh. A disciple of the Sixth Blood Star. I knew from the face being covered, so what is your name? There seem to be so many beauties around here.\u201dWith that, he wiped his mouth like he liked this. It was disgusting.This bastard was hiding his skills and messing around. It was the very moment I was ready to attack.Thud!Someone appeared behind Go Eunjae.Flustered by the large shadow which fell on him, he swung the blade to the back.Pak!But the blade was blocked by a thick palm.Being shocked, he asked,\u201cW-who are you?\u201dIt was Hae Ack-chun. He was the only one who could stop the blade with his bare hands here.\u201cUh\u2026Elder?\u201dThe man, noticing that, asked in a trembling voice. Hae Ack-chun opened his mouth,\u201cYou are the Third Elder\u2019s disciple huh? Such interesting words you said.\u201d\u201cI-it wasn\u2019t like that\u2026\u201dThe guy was too shocked and tried to explain.But the opponent was the Ghastly Monster.\u201cOh. Let\u2019s look at your skills then.\u201dPak!Hae Ack-chun grabbed his head, and then without caring about what the guy was saying, he hit his head on the ground.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe body hit down so hard that he bounced back up. In that state, Hae Ack-chun clenched his fist.Clench!Startled, the guy tried to use internal qi to protect the body, but the fist collapsed into him, and he bounced off like a cannon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - The Guest Of Six Blood Valley (2)\u201cKuak!\u201dAs the guy collapsed, he bounced back a few meters.\u2018Ah!\u2019It looked quite painful, I was lucky to have the old man near me.But he was still pretty far from us, so how did he come up at such an opportune time?Just as I was puzzling over this.Papay!A black shadow came out of the bushes. The guy rushed straight for Go Eunjae, who was thrown away.\u201cHuh.\u201dI thought he would attack, but he was just relieved to see Go Eunjae\u2019s body was fine. I could tell just by looking at the man who stopped in the middle of Go Eunjae and us.\u201cU-Uh! Thank you, teacher!\u201d\u2018Teacher?\u2019Go Eunjae addressed the person as \u2018teacher\u2019. Did that mean that he was the Second Elder, the Guardian Demon Blade Emperor Seo Kalma?Unlike Hae Ack-chun, he had neatly combed hair and looked very regal.Psss!Suddenly, more people appeared from the same bush as the previous man. In total, there were four of them. Surprisingly, one had a long blade on their waist, and the others had three red belts.Why was I shocked?\u2018\u2026 all are commander level.\u2019Blue belts were for leaders and red for commanders. Even if the number of people was smaller, the power was huge. I couldn\u2019t figure out what this all meant.Shhh!Guardian Demon Blade Emperor Seo Kalma bowed to Hae Ack-chun.\u201cHae hyung. Long time no see.\u201dIt was a meeting of old friends. To this, Hae Ack-chun responded in a deep voice,\u201cSeo hyung.\u201dHe was more polite than when dealing with the Sixth Blood Star. Of course, it was only for a while.\u201cIt has only been four years; it hasn\u2019t been that long. What did you come here for? Is it because of the booklet you were sent?\u201dAh, where will his character go? No matter whom he dealt with, he would always have this harsh tone.\u201cHehehe. Right. But there seems to be some misunderstanding here.\u201dSeo Kalma said, looking at Go Eunjae, who was looking a bit weak. He touched his disciple as he cared for him.-Why touch him? Looking fucking terrible to see.Empathy.Just when I wanted to speak, Hae Ack-chun spoke,\u201cHuh! What misunderstanding! Seo hyung\u2019s disciple attacked my disciple. If I hadn\u2019t come, he would have been seriously injured.\u201dIn his words, Seo Kalma spoke like there was nothing wrong with that.\u201cIsn\u2019t that how young warriors talk? Seems like this disciple of mine was constantly stuck in caves, so he was curious about how good Hae hyung\u2019s disciple is.\u201dSince they were all of the same elder level, they had the same level of force. And this man was accepting what Hae Ack-chun said head-on.But, Hae Ack-chun wasn\u2019t the kind to just back down,\u201cOh. That is why the young one decided to insult me.\u201d\u201cHe insulted Hae hyung?\u201dSeo Kalma looked at Go Eunja with sharp eyes, and the guy made excuses by waving his hand.\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t that. How would I ever insult the Fourth Elder? I just said that the disciple was insulting the name of\u2026\u201dTrying to drag it. He was a guy who spits those words whether he denies them or not.And he didn\u2019t know what kind of person Hae Ack-chun was.\u201cYou aren\u2019t speaking right.\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dHae Ack-chun tried to approach where Go Eunjae was. But something unexpected happened.Pak!Among the crowd who appeared with the old man was one with a long blade, who grabbed the head of Go Eunjae and smashed it to the floor.-Oh! His nose!Even though they were of the same group, they didn\u2019t seem to have much sympathy. And the young man spoke out for everyone to listen,\u201cTeacher is speaking. How dare you try to give out lame excuses?\u201dThe young man pushed him down and got up as he bowed to Hae Ack-chun.\u201cElder. Please forgive my sajae\u2019s rudeness.\u201d\u201cSajae?\u2019Hearing Hae Ack-chun\u2019s question, the young man spoke,\u201cI am Ho Geum-won, the teacher\u2019s first disciple.\u201d\u2018Ho Geum-won?\u2019-Why? Was he famous too?\u2018\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2019-You don\u2019t know?From what I knew, Seo Kalma had just one disciple. And that was the frog-eyed one. But this guy was calling himself the first disciple.-So? A hidden disciple?If it was hidden, would he say it out right here?Rather, it seems that something happened to the guy, like losing his life.-Why?\u2018Look at that expression.\u2019Go Eunjae, who was hit to the floor, looked up at Ho Geum-won with bloodshot eyes.Just looking at them, they didn\u2019t seem to be that friendly with each other. In a nation where even the orthodox sects kill each other over conflicts of succession, would the Blood Sect be an exception?It would be way worse here, way, way worse. And Seo Kalma said,\u201cHae hyung. I apologize for my rude disciple. You have taught them well, and why not end this right now?\u201dThe man took a step back. Unlike his disciples, Seo Kalma seemed like a calm man. It seemed like he had no intention of fighting Hae Ack-chun, using this as an excuse.[Huh. If you had beat that cheeky bastard, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.]Hae Ack-chun was cursing me in my own head.It was an unexpected fight, but he seemed to hate that I was pushed back by the disciple of another elder.It wasn\u2019t like I wasn\u2019t hating it either.Officially, it was just my first year here, and those disciples of Seo Kalma must have been trained for several years!-Why didn\u2019t you show your skills?At Short Sword\u2019s words, I denied her,\u2018\u2026it was too early.\u2019It was serious. And if I had shown my skills before knowing how to deal with the opponent, it would push me into a corner.Even if the wall to becoming a first-rate warrior was touched, the Blood Sect had so many people in similar situations. But standing up against an opponent was only done when one was certain of their strength.[I am sorry to disappoint you.]\u201cTch.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue and looked at me with a dissatisfied look and turned back to Seo Kalma.\u201cThat is fine, but why did Seo hyung have to bring his disciples here? If it was an urgent matter, you could have sent someone or come alone.\u201dAs far as coming alone was said, I could understand. Even I was curious why this man, who was the Second Elder, came to this place.He had a purpose, and the man smiled,\u201cThe old man came here to be a matchmaker.\u201dHae Ack-chun frowned at these unexpected words. He couldn\u2019t understand the words of Seo Kalma.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cAs I said.\u201d\u201cYou are acting too vague; it\u2019s frustrating me. Who are you going to match make?\u201dAs Hae Ack-chun asked, irritated, Seo Kalma glanced at his disciples and pointed in the direction of the main hall.\u201cI am here to make something for the lady.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019I was hoping this would come, but Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t seem to understand. This man was here with his disciple to talk with Baek Ryong-ha.I glanced at her, and even she seemed to be shocked.-Her eyes are so wide.There was a meeting inside the main hall of Six Blood Valley. In front of the long table, Hae Ack-chun and his disciples, Song Jaw-baek and Song Woo-hyun were given seats, and Seo Kalma, with his two disciples, were also seated across.And on the top side of the table, a bamboo sheet was placed, and a slender-bodied woman sat behind it. In front of it stood Han Baek-ha and her five disciples, who had all covered their faces. One of these disciples was Baek Ryeon-ha.\u2018Phew.\u2019The atmosphere inside was bad. Even Song Jwa-baek couldn\u2019t do anything other than look around.Bang!Hae Ack-chun slammed the table with clenched hands.\u201cAre you really saying that now!\u201dThe reason he was angry was because of what Seo Kalma said. He had asked Baek Ryeon-ha to give up her run for the position of the sect leader, all for the sake of the cause.Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only thing.\u201cWhat was that? Say it again!\u201d\u201cAs I said. Hae hyung. For the sake of the unity of the sect, let there not be chaos, and let the young lady prepare a next heir.\u201dSeo Kalma was spitting these words without blinking an eye. Man, he was amazing.He was formal with Hae Ack-chun, but he wasn\u2019t backing down. Because of that, everyone inside couldn\u2019t even speak out. They just looked exhausted as they couldn\u2019t counter.But not Hae Ack-chun.\u201cI know that the lady has more right for this, so what nonsense is coming from your mouth, Seo Kalma?\u201d\u201cHold back your excitement.\u201d\u201cExcitement? Does it look like I am excited? If the noise coming from your mouth is to be believed, you\u2019d have your disciple marry her for the sake of producing an heir and protecting her; who would believe you! Ha! You must be anxious to die.\u201dIn an instant, the air in the room turned heavy. When Hae Ack-chun released qi, it even took my breath away.The table was turned in an instant, and his fist went for Seo Kalma, who was sitting there.\u201cHae hyung\u2026 I didn\u2019t come here to fight you.\u201d\u201cShut it.\u201d\u201cThink about it.\u201dHan Baek-ha, who was silent till then, asked,\u201cWhat do you mean think, Second Elder?\u201dHer voice was as cold as ice. Seo Kalma didn\u2019t take his eyes off Hae Ack-chun, not caring about her.\u201cI will tell you all something you all know. The Elders and the Blood Stars\u2026 most of them have made the decision to put lady Hye-hyang as the sect leader. And she has the majority on her side. Although no official statement had been made, Third Elder also seems to be tilting.\u201dThird Elder refers to the Bloody King, Gu Jae-yangIf two of the four elders and four of the seven Blood Stars had taken her side, then the decision was titled.\u201cDidn\u2019t Hae hyung say it before that you haven\u2019t decided on who of the two to support?\u201dHae Ack-chun just looked at him; this meant he agreed.\u201cSixth Blood Star. I will ask you now, has anyone shown clear intention to support lady Baek Ryeon-ha?\u201dThe Bloody Hand Witch didn\u2019t answer. Anyone could tell what this meant.Probably two or three decided to help. It had to be two of the Seven Blood Stars but no elder.\u201cIn this situation, what would happen if Miss Baek Ryeon-ha was even supported?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to intimidate our lady?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026\u00a0sigh,\u201dSeo Kalma sighed.He stuck his blade on the chair.Srng!He pulled half the long blade out, which had a unique pattern on it.It was clear that he wouldn\u2019t stand back. Seo Kalma said with sharp eyes,\u201cI am Guardian Demon Blade Emperor Seo Kalma. Do I look like the kind who would harm the daughter of our leader! Hae Ack-chun!\u201dHe, too, was ready to wield his sword.\u201cYou brat pulled your sword! Fine. Come at me!\u201dHae Ack-chun was ready, but Han Baek-ha tried to dissuade them,\u201cWhat are you two doing in front of the lady!\u2019The two men who were ready to fight stopped at her cry.It was a strange situation for these reckless people to consider her words. But was this the loyalty they had to the former sect leader?\u201cPhew.\u201dWhen I glanced at the sighs which came, Song Jwa-baek was controlling his breath as he was sweating. My hands were sweaty enough to understand him.The force from the two men\u2019s bodies was something that even the first-rate warriors would have a hard time bearing.At that time, the five disciples of Han Baek-ha turned to the other side. Everyone was puzzled.And the voice echoed.[Second Elder and Fourth Elder. No, Seo Uncle and Hae Uncle.]Pat!When called, both of them moved to the side of the bamboo sheet and knelt down on their knees.-The voice was resounding in the room.-Six Direction Voice.A more difficult technique to use and a technique made to echo the voices of the user, allowing them to speak without revealing their location.The reason the five disciples of Han Baek-ha turned around at the same time was probably to prevent the throat movement from being seen.[Is it fine if I call the two of you as I did in the past?]Baek Ryeon-ha asked,\u201cWhy would we complain?\u201d\u201cCall me what you feel comfortable with.\u2019[Then to Seo Uncle.]\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cUncle Seo, when Uncle Seo made the decision to put my unnie as the sect leader, then why bother telling me to marry your disciple?\u201dAt her question, he raised his head and said,[It is to protect the lady.][Protect?]\u201cAnd for the future.\u201d[What is that supposed to mean?]\u201cI, too, would like for the young lady to take the position with legitimacy. The current sect is being resurrected, and it needs a strong presence.\u201dThis was undeniable. This was the reason Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t get angry right away.[\u2026it means that only because she is older than me now.]\u201cI apologize. But this is to protect the Young Lady and preserve the legitimacy of our sect if anything happens.\u201d[Have an heir for the sake of legitimacy?]\u201cRight. If, for that reason, the other elders didn\u2019t give their clear intentions. If the lady can give up her position for the purpose of unifying the sect and concentrate on giving us an heir, you will have the cause to push out lady Hye-hyang.\u201dSeo Kalma spat out his true intentions. He was saying that this was truly to protect Baek Ryeon-ha.In a way, this wasn\u2019t the wrong approach. If she did, then the Blood Sect, which was split between two candidates, could be stopped for now, and the First Elder could be pushed out.ClenchHae Ack-chun gritted his teeth,\u201cShut your disgusting mouth.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I did that till now.\u201d\u201cHa! Right. Let\u2019s assume that you are right. But why should she marry your disciple? Isn\u2019t it for the sake of putting influence to your side!\u201dHae Ack-chun pointed it out, making everyone turn to Seo Kalma.Seo Kalma shook his head and said,\u201cThen who is right?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf we were to pick one who is qualified for the young lady here among the ones who remained neutral, of course, it would have to come from one of the elders. But the other ones are supporting lady Baek Hye-hyang. We won\u2019t get an answer that way.\u201dSeo Kalma turned his head and smiled while looking at the twins. It was an obvious smirk.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019Now I knew.Why did Go Eunjae attack me? He was only doing the role his teacher gave him.It was to confirm that the disciples of this crazy man weren\u2019t skilled. Now he was trying to slow things down, and not act too hastily.-So annoying!Go Eunjae was looking at me with lips curling up. Just by looking at his face, everything fell into line.-Aren\u2019t you angry?Short Sword asked me.I am a human; obviously, I feel bad. At first, I thought of Baek Ryeon-ha, who must be feeling horrible at this. But\u2026 I had to judge the situation soberly.A situation that couldn\u2019t be rushed\u2026\u201cKuahahahah!\u201dSuddenly, Hae Ack-chun burst into laughter. And seeing this, Seo Kalma frowned. As he was done laughing, he said,\u201cIs there an answer? Do you think that guy of yours is a good match for the lady?\u201dHe pointed to Go Eunjae\u2019s face, the guy who had his head smashed down and face bruised.\u201cAre you asking because he was rude to you before?\u201d\u201cRude my ass! You made your disciple do that.\u201d\u201cHuh Hae hyung! You are crossing the line\u2026\u2019\u201cA person who made fun of the disciple of the Bloody Hand Witch would be suitable for the lady? Anyone would laugh,\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Go Eunjae face went stiff.\u2018Ha!\u2019I wonder when the old man heard it; well, I did hear him disrespect Baek Ryeon-ha.Go Eunjae was shocked and couldn\u2019t even look Seo Kalma in the eyes.-One guy out.Said Short Sword.As I said, it was unlikely that a person who had been disgraced would be pushed to be a candidate for Baek Ryeon-ha.Seo Kama looked at the bamboo sheet and said,\u201cForgive my second disciple who is still immature. I will punish him in the right manner later. But the great disciple, Geum-won is a bit lacking al\u2026\u201dThen Hae Ack-chun intervened,\u201cUh. Seo Kalma.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy is it that your disciples are the only ones being pushed for the candidate of the lady?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Not just Seo Kalma but the twins and I were shocked by his words.What was this old man even saying?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Who Is The Winner (1)There was only one person who didn\u2019t react like us at the bomb Hae Ack-chun threw.The twin, Song Woo-hyun, didn\u2019t understand or didn\u2019t bother, he just looked ahead with wide eyes.Seo Kalma, who looked at Hae Ack-chun with surprise asked,\u201c\u2026 what is that supposed to mean, Hae hyung?\u201d\u201cAs I said. Compared to your poorly behaved disciples, who we can call bastards at a glance, aren\u2019t the disciples of mine better, right?\u201dAh\u2026Please don\u2019t make it what I am thinking.But then again, this crazy old man was someone who didn\u2019t care about things. Could there have been another man who would suit the Ghastly Monster?\u201c\u2026 are you saying that Hae hyung\u2019s disciples are better than mine?\u201d\u201cThose are obvious words.\u201d\u201cI have a lot of confidence in my disciples.\u201dSeo Kalma\u2019s words came out cold. The atmosphere was odd. It looked like he didn\u2019t want to continue this anymore.\u201cHuh! Aren\u2019t you being overconfident?\u201dI couldn\u2019t figure out why this old man was coming out this strong.If the fight wasn\u2019t too sudden, then the twins and I would be first-rate warriors.On the other hand, the disciples of Seo Kalma had been studying martial arts for a long time and were way ahead.-Look at their faces.Even Go Eunjae, who was looking down, and Ho Geum-won the sahyung smiled faintly at us.If it wasn\u2019t for Hae Ack-chun, they would have laughed out loud. Seo Kalma turned his head and looked at Hae Ack-chun and he said,\u201cThen I think this would be solved easily.\u201dTak!Seo Kalma moved to the bamboo sheet.\u201cPlease let this happen in the Six Blood Valley. I think it would be a good idea to compete with my disciples at this meeting and see who would be a good match for Hae hyung\u2019s disciples.\u201dIt seemed like the atmosphere was happening like this. In the end, the way this is how any murim people would get the results they want.\u201cSince you are so confident with your disciples, you wouldn\u2019t oppose, right, Hae hyung?\u201dasked Seo Kalma. If Hae Ack-chun refused, then it would signal a retreat.\u201cGood! Is there anything I wouldn\u2019t do?\u201dAs expected, he didn\u2019t refuse. Seriously, is there any way that the man would refuse?\u201cLet\u2019s proceed.\u201d\u201cEven if it is a one-on-one confrontation, shouldn\u2019t it be fair?\u201d\u201cFair?\u2019Hae Ack-chun pointed at us and said,\u201cNo matter how excellent the disciples of mine are, it is only a year since they began to learn martial arts.\u201d\u201cSo, what do you mean? If you were going to take all those things into consideration, you shouldn\u2019t have bothered bringing the topic up\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a simpler way?\u201d\u201cSimpler way?\u201d\u201cTo close down the internal qi flow and use just their techniques. Hehe.\u201dHae Ack-chun was using his head, but there was a problem this time too. Even if the flow of internal qi was stopped, there was no doubt that they would still be more experienced than us.What distinguishes them from us wasn\u2019t just internal qi, but the presence and absence of enlightenment.\u201cClose the flow of qi? Hahahah!\u201dThis time Seo Kalma burst into laughter.He was looking at Hae Ack-chun with sneering eyes. He was thinking the same as me.He was this confident looking because he knew the disciples of his had been honing their skills for a longer period of time and had an overall advantage.\u201cWhy? Not confident?\u201dHae Ack-chun continued provoking him. To this, Seo Kalma said,\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it, right? Hae hyung would know better than others that the difference in internal qi and external strength is meaningless, right?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cYou are so arrogant.\u201dWith that, Seo Kalma turned and looked at me,\u201cIf you think you have the chance of winning just because your disciple inherited the sword technique of the South Heavenly Swordsman, I will tell you, you are wrong. The more strong a technique, the more powerful the internal qi flow should be.\u201dAt his words, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s eyes twitched. Maybe he felt cornered? But soon, he smiled, crossing his arms,\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same for your disciples?\u201d\u201cHuhu. Think so?\u201dLooking at Seo Kalma\u2019s attitude, it seemed like he didn\u2019t believe he would lose.If so, then the probability of winning with a sword technique that they learned a long time ago would be stronger than ours. But I didn\u2019t know the reason for using such a long blade, though.\u201cFine. I will take up the offer of Hae hyung. Then can I make a suggestion too?\u201d\u201cSuggestion?\u201d\u201cI am trying to amplify the entertainment of the fight.\u201dSeo Kalma wasn\u2019t the one to suffer, so he said he would accept and put forth a condition.\u201cFine.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make it a true match of sword techniques.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not talking about a simple fight.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a pact between the two sides that we won\u2019t care even if a leg or arm is lost in the fight.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Seo Kalma was talking about life and death.-Asshole.There was not an inch of retreat. Seo Kalma had two targets with this.One was to make Hae Ack-chun give up the confrontation due to the threat to his disciples\u2019 lives.-And the second one?\u2018\u2026 they are going to make us limp or dead.\u2019It was the same as removing any source of power struggle right away, as they were sure of me being a strength to Hae Ack-chun. Following the progress of the sword technique I had learned, I would be nothing but a thorn in their eyes.\u201cAhem.\u201dHae Ack-chun hesitated for a moment, realizing what their intentions were. It was natural to think when the opponent was coming out this strong.This had to be a real dilemma, and at that moment, I heard Hae Ack-chun,[Huh. Seo Kalma is really using his head.]Unless one was an idiot, they would obviously say this. Now it all depends on the choice of Hae Ack-chun. Will he send his disciples to die?Anyone could see that this would be a disadvantage for Hae Ack-chun.[Unleash your hidden skills.]\u2018\u2026!!\u2019As soon as I heard it, my heart pounded.Hae Ack-chun knew that I was hiding my skills.If that was the case, he could have prepared a better way for this fight to happen.[\u2026 teacher. What do you\u2026][Huh. Don\u2019t lie around me. Did you think that you can deceive the eyes of mine?][Uh?][You have already reached the Master level.]No.Did this old man really notice this? But his next words could only confirm this.[Even if your internal qi isn\u2019t up to par. You have broken through the wall of the first-rate warrior. How can I not know after fighting with you every day?][\u2026][I can tell by looking at the movement of your sword.]I felt glad but surprised too.This man was still unaware of the innate qi I used. But he was convinced that I had overcome the first-rate warrior level with the numerous training matches we had done.He was looking into me, and I didn\u2019t even notice at all. This old man was different!Was he pretending not to know?[\u2026 I apologize.][Look at you. I don\u2019t need an apology. If I hadn\u2019t been trying to train you, even I wouldn\u2019t have noticed.]It did sound honest.Well, hiding my skills wasn\u2019t an easy thing. I thought he would yell or something, but this was an unexpected outcome.[Go with the determination to win unconditionally. But\u2026 if you cannot handle it, feel free to step out.][Yes?][It is fine to admit defeat.]I was surprised by the sound of Hae Ack-chun. This old man, who hates losing, was saying I could admit defeat.That meant he didn\u2019t want me to get hurt.\u2018This old man\u2026\u2019Just looking at his rough attitude, I thought he was the kind to abandon people at any moment. but now, looking at this, he truly cared for this disciple.This was unexpected.[Huh! don\u2019t misunderstand. It is because I don\u2019t think you will be able to beat a guy who was learning for a much longer time than you.]\u2018\u2026\u2019It felt strange. This crazy old man was worried for me.This was unexpected.Shh!I got up from my seat and took a bow at Hae Ack-chun.\u201cI will live up to your expectations.\u201dAt those words, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s eyes shone. On the other hand, Seo Kalma was glaring at me,\u201cTch tch, to make your disciples give up their limbs.\u201d\u201cHuh! you are the only one who hopes for that from people.\u201dHae Ackc-hun yelled at him and grabbed the edge of the table.Kiiik!The table was pushed to the end of the room. Thanks to that, there was space to fight.\u201cWhy delay it when we can do it now?\u201dAt that time, Han Baek-ha, who was watching, came out.\u201cStop it. The Lady did not express her intentions to accept the second elder\u2019s conditions. She only\u2026\u201dBefore she could say\u2026[I like it.]Baek Ryeon-ha behind the bamboo sheet said.I wasn\u2019t sure if she was accepting the condition or the spar, but I didn\u2019t expect that she would say this.\u201cMy lady!\u201dHan Baek-ha frowned. On the other hand, Seo Kalma was worried that she would change her mind, so he said,\u201cI appreciate your decision for\u2026\u201d[But I have a condition too.]Seo Kalma, who was delighted, became confused. Again, it was impossible for a smart woman like Baek Ryeon-ha to give up her freedom.\u201cWhat condition?\u201d[You said that the person who wins would be called the one I marry, so shouldn\u2019t they meet my conditions too?]At her words, Seo Kalma looked at bamboo feet. He seemed concerned that she was making reckless conditions. But then accepted,\u201cPlease say it.\u201d[If it is my spouse, of course, shouldn\u2019t the skills be better than mine? I will also compete with similar conditions.]\u201cUh? The Young Lady will?\u201dHer declaration to fight.Seo Kalma\u2019s expression changed as he hadn\u2019t expected this. It was probably because her skills were good, but I didn\u2019t know of her skills.\u201cKuahahaha. That is indeed right. If you want to be a match for the Young Lady, of course, we have to see her level of competence also.\u201dHae Ack-chun helped her. Seo Kalma hesitated and nodded,\u201cAll right. That is a sensible thing to say.\u201dHe was worried, but he was confident about the skills and abilities of his disciples. But her words didn\u2019t end there,[But what if they don\u2019t meet my conditions?]\u201cUh? What is that\u2026\u201d[I am asking what do we do if they cannot defeat me. You told me to make sacrifices regardless of my will. Then if I win, will Uncle make sure to follow my choice?]\u201cYou mean\u2026 if you win, you want me to hear your choice?\u201d[Right.]Seo Kalma\u2019s expression hardened. Because he guessed what she was thinking.And the thoughts were right.[If I win, Uncle Hae and Seo must wear an oath of allegiance to me and support me.]Even Hae Ack-chun seemed shocked now. What started out as a fight for pride had grown way too huge.A lot was being put at stake now.-She is smart.I agreed with the words of Short Sword. In the meantime, watching her take care of her words and status to say this wasn\u2019t an easy thing.If two people were dragging her out, then she could not be someone who fights for the sect leader\u2019s position. Like a woman who dreams of becoming the sect leader, she is strong-willed.-How will the crazy man come out?\u2018The answer has been decided.\u2019-Huh?In the first place, it was the fact that Hae Ack-chun\u2019s heart was focused on Baek Ryeon-ha. If not, he wouldn\u2019t care for all this.Shhh!Again, as expected. Hae Ack-chun bowed to the bamboo sheet,\u201cKulkul, I will obey the words of the lady.\u201dAnd if he made up his mind, there was no reason to refuse this.If he wins, he gets his disciple put on her side, and if he loses, the two of them will have to support her. There will be no unfavorable outcome here.[Will Uncle Seo not accept it?]Seo Kalma, who was flustered by this, sighed. It was because he realized that if he backed down, he would lose the cause for trying to save Baek Ryeon-ha by coming here. He, too, had no choice but to join in.Shhh!Seo Kalma took a bow and said,\u201cI will follow the will of the Young Lady.\u201dThe face of Han Baek-ha, who was anxiously watching, turned brighter. A confrontation was finalized, with so much depending on its outcome.And what had to be done was decided. I walked in front of Seo Kalma.Everyone, including the old man, was shocked by this.Shh!I took a bow to the man and said,\u201cFor a fair fight, Second Elder, please stop the flow of my internal qi.\u201dThe expression of Seo Kalma looking at me turned strange.Even though this was a life-threatening battle, it felt like he didn\u2019t understand this dignified action. He gently placed his palm on my dantian. Warm qi flowed into the body from his hand.-What is he doing?\u2018Checking me out.\u2019It was to check if I had something hidden. And his lips smiled as he checked me.He was convinced that I was just a first-rate warrior.\u201cHae hyung\u2019s disciple has his flow stopped. For the sake of fairness, I will entrust my disciple to Hae hyung.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dHae Ack-chun accepted it, and Ho Geum-won moved ahead. This made it impossible for both sides to use their internal qi. And this was fair.\u201cEveryone move back to the wall.\u201dHan Baek-ha, who decided to be the notary, took charge. Song Jwa-baek moved back with a worried expression.Normally he would have come out and said something, but he was worried now. He seemed concerned that life would be at stake here.[Yah! If you cannot, give up. Don\u2019t die like a fool.]That idiot told me. Did I even hear this from this guy for the whole year we stayed together? Hearing this from him now\u2026[He might be a skilled one, and this old man will kill you if you lose.]I smiled at him to reassure him, but he only clicked his tongue.\u201cThe two of you who will compete keep distance.\u201dAt the instructions of Han Baek-ha, Ho Geum-won widened the distance. And he said,\u201cIf you give up now, your body will survive. You still have a bright future.\u201dAdvice to give up. Looking at the confident expression, it seemed like he was convinced.He was saying it out loud for Baek Ryeon-ha to notice this. The truth was, of course, that it would make him look good.Shhh!I said to him,\u201cIt is fine. I want to compete with no regrets.\u201dAt my words, Ho Geum-won shook his head.And then he spoke,\u201cI will not take your life. But be prepared to lose your arm.\u201dSeo Kalma must have ordered him to do that. Perhaps what he was aiming for was my life as a swordsman, meaning the target would be my right arm.\u201cI won\u2019t take your life either.\u201dAt my words, his face twitched. It must have felt offensive for such a guy like me to be warning him. But he pretended to be calm,\u201cYou truly are the disciple of the Fourth Elder.\u201dAnd then he grabbed the long blade. I also caught the South Heavenly Iron Sword.With that, the Bloody Hand Witch signaled the start of the bout.I stared into his eyes. Perhaps the glare touched his heart, the man\u2019s eyes were filled with a dark look, and Han Baek-ha raised her hand,\u201cStart!\u201dHan Baek-ha shouted to start. It was then.Ho Geum-won\u2019s eyes widened suddenly and made him stagger. And in one fluid motion, I drew out the sword with the speed of lightning.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dShocked, Seo Kalma shouted during the fight. And thanks to that, Ho Geum-won came to his senses, but it was already too late.Chak!The elbow holding the long blade got sliced.Seeing his arm fall to the ground, he fell down, grabbed the cut section, and screamed in pain.\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dShhh!I pointed the sword at his neck. His eyes were in pain,\u201cI said I will not take your life.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019As if no one expected the result, the room was filled with silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Who Is The Winner (2)The silence didn\u2019t last for long.\u201cKuahahahah!\u201dIt was because of Hae Ack-chun. He was so happy that his laughter echoed around. In the worst case, we had assumed defeat, but it seemed like his expectations were broken rather easily.-Wow! How did you come up with the idea to use that?-I didn\u2019t expect it at all.Short Sword and Iron Sword were surprised too. I was a bit skeptical. It was a gamble to use Illusion Eye, which took innate qi, but this gamble was still successful even with my dantian sealed.It was fortunate that Ho Geum-won\u2019s mental strength wasn\u2019t as strong as I had thought.-I thought you would end in moderation, but you cut off his arm.\u2018Because he aimed for my arm too.\u2019Actually, I was quite worried. Even if the two sides agreed on a battle that led to death, I was pretty sure that Seo Kalma would be aiming to get me killed.Cutting off the arm wasn\u2019t a preferred method, but it was the only way to bring the opponent down with a single blow.-Wouldn\u2019t it be more effective if you aimed for his dantian?\u2018\u2026 that would be the same as death.\u2019I knew better than anyone the pain of losing your dantian. That meant death to a warrior.Moreover, it was Seo Kalma who had taught him martial arts; if Ho Geum-won\u2019s dantian was taken down, the man would abandon his disciple and even insult him.Unless he was an enemy, it was better to avoid doing so.-Well. Those words are right.-Wonhwi\u2019s judgment is right.Either way, the fight was won. If the arm hadn\u2019t been cut off, there would have been no chance of winning.In the first place, if he had moved on me, I would have had my neck slashed. Ho Geum-won\u2019s face was pale. The bleeding was too severe.Shhh!I pushed the tip of the sword close to the neck.\u201cWill you acknowledge your defeat?\u201dHo Geum-won had a pained expression. It seemed like he still didn\u2019t understand how he had lost.At that time, Seo Kalma was about to come to where I was.Tat!Hae Ack-chun blocked him.\u201cYour disciple hasn\u2019t declared defeat yet.\u201dSeo Kalma\u2019s expression was distorted,\u201cHae Ack-chun!\u201d\u201cIf you plan to intervene in the match, you will have to fight me.\u201dHae Ack-chun could use his hands anytime. I had never seen the old man lose, but if these two fought, it would be a tough fight.Seo Kalma raised his voice in anger,\u201cHow is this a match? Didn\u2019t your disciple use a trick!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t being formal any longer. As soon as this had happened, he immediately lost his cool.\u201cAn unorthodox sect uses tricks. Are you going to use that as an excuse?\u201dHae Ack-chun never gets pushed by bullying words.However, that really touched a nerve.\u201cExcuse? Ha!\u201dAs soon as he said that, Seo Kalma moved. And Hae Ack-chun followed.Crack!The moment the two collided with each other, the wooden boards on the floor split open.These people were the owners of such terrifying power. The wooden floor that was down was cracking up.\u201cKuahahaha! Feels good! Let\u2019s fight; it has been so long.\u201dHae Ack-chun was ready to jump into the fight. Seo Kalma shouted,\u201cHuh! fine! Let\u2019s see which side brings in the end! Eunjae!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dPak!At the cry from him, Go Eunjae moved to the side and threw a sword. And Seo Kalma, who caught the sword in its sheath, was about to pull it out until someone stood between the two.\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cThe Bloody Hand Witch!\u201dIt was Han Baek-ha who was the notary for this.\u201cEnough. You both should stop.\u201dSeo Kalma spoke to her, who was intervening in anger,\u201cSixth Blood Star. This match is void. He didn\u2019t compete fairly.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dSeo Kalma turned to her. Those eyes were looking bitter as they looked back at her. The innate qi in her body stopped her from trembling. And Seo Kalma narrowed his eyes,\u201cI see! My sajae has done his best. I should have known from the time that you asked for a match with no internal qi.\u201d\u201cHuh! It is absurd that a guy who has the title of Venerable Dignitary cannot understand defeat. Who is the one making tricks here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he did, but your disciple is able to use internal qi!\u201dSeo Kalma was convinced that I had used internal qi. At his words, Bloody Hand Witch said,\u201cDidn\u2019t the Second Elder personally seal his blood points?\u201d\u201cSo I am telling you that he used some trick. If not, how could that cowardly bastard use some trick!\u201dI thought he would have noticed my innate qi, but he hadn\u2019t. He kept guessing that I used internal qi. And Han Baek-ha shook her head,\u201cIf you want to blame the young master, you will have to blame me.\u201d\u201cNo. What is that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cThe trick that Young Master Seo used is what I had taught him.\u201dUnexpectedly, this woman was defending me. I was going to talk, but then I decided to leave it alone. And Seo Kalma said,\u201cYour skill, no, your ability is something I have seen a lot. Are you talking about the Illusion Eye?\u201dAs expected, most people in the Blood Sect knew about her ability. Not just Hae Ack-chun but even Seo Kalma knew.So, it can be called an ability that was considered a trick.\u201cThen he used internal qi\u2026\u201d\u201cIllusion Eye isn\u2019t a technique which uses internal qi.\u201dSeo Kalma frowned at her words.\u201cThe Illusion Eye is derived from the innate qi and the mental power of the user, regardless of the presence or absence of the internal qi.\u201dHan Baekha explained on my behalf, but some of her words were wrong. Since the first stage of Illusion Eye is basic, it requires very little innate qi, so it is something anyone can naturally use.Well, thanks to her, a couple of things were clarified.\u201cI am sorry that my teaching has affected the match, Second Elder.\u201dShe apologized.Grunt.Seo Kalma gritted his teeth and looked at me. Thanks to her explanation, the justification to argue with me was now void.If he kept insisting I did something, he would be demeaning the talent of the Bloody Hand Witch.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dUnable to overcome the resentment which had built into him, he just gritted his teeth.\u201cMy disciple lost the battle.\u201dAfter saying that, Seo Kalma hurriedly approached Ho Geum-won and stopped his bleeding. In addition, he touched his blood points to make sure the pain was relieved a bit, and his distorted face changed.Seo Kalma stopped the bleeding and looked at the severed arm on the floor.-Feeling bad?\u2018I am not.\u2019If I hadn\u2019t cut his arm, mine would have been cut off. That hadn\u2019t been taken into account.But I could understand the feelings of Seo Kalma. It would probably become complicated. It would be even more so because he himself said that the disciples shouldn\u2019t be blamed for whatever happened.\u201cI am amazed at the wisdom of the lady. You had foreseen this from the beginning.\u201dEveryone was stunned by these words. But then I realized why he said it.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you have such wits to gain my support after Hae hyung. You did inherit the blood of that great man.\u201d-That old man. He misunderstood. Right?It seemed that way. It seemed like he thought Hae Ack-chun was already on her side, and that is why I was taught the Illusion Eye.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019I looked at Han Baek-ha. There was a faint smile on her lip.\u2018Ha!\u2019-What is it?I understand now. Somehow I thought it was strange for her to come and defend me. Of course, it could be for the sake of a fair fight, but this was her plan all along.By letting them know that I, the disciple of Hae Ack-chun, learned her ability and was trying to create an atmosphere to support Baek Ryeon-ha.In the meantime, she was taking advantage of this situation.-Such a bad one!Hae Ack-chun, Seo Kalma, Baek Ryeong-ha.I thought that it was a fight between those 3 people. But unexpectedly, Han Baek-ha had her own plan. And this said she would do anything for Baek Ryeon-ha.-The crazy old man is so quiet.Hearing Short Sword\u2019s words, I looked at Hae Ack-chun. He was looking at Han Baek-ha with a frown.Normally he should have spoken up, but he had kept his mouth shut.-What is he doing?\u2018He is letting this go.\u2019-Uh?Hae Ack-chun had made up his mind. He was going to support Baek Ryeon-ha.So, he had noticed Han Baek-ha\u2019s plan and pretended not to notice. It wasn\u2019t over yet, but if Seo Kalma succumbs here and decides to support Baek Ryeon-ha, there will be no need for the next fight.\u201cAhem.\u201dTatatak!And I was right.Hae Ack-chun also thought that there would be no more fights, so he approached me and released the seal on the dantian placed on me.The woman behind the bamboo sheet turned. And then took the veil covering the face.-Wow\u2026 is she the same fatty?Short Sword was shocked. It was the same for everyone in the room.I knew she would be pretty if she lost weight, but this was too much. The long eyelashes around her round eyes, her slender body, and small face.Her pink lips reminded me of cherry blossoms.Gulp!When I heard the sound, it was Song Jwa-baek gulping. Even Go Eunjae was doing the same. His eyes gleamed with lust, just like his personality.I was also shocked at her appearance, but it was only for a brief moment, and it felt like looking at the blood red hair woman.\u2018So similar.\u2019After losing weight, they definitely looked more alike.So Kalma, who lost his thoughts, bowed down on one knee and said,\u201cAhh. I did hear the rumors, but you are simply amazing. My lady.\u201dHe knew who she was.Looking at this, despite looking at the women behind the bamboo sheet, that man had already known that Baek Ryeon-ha was dressed as a disciple of the Bloody Hand Witch.\u201cAfter all, Uncle Seo recognizes me.\u201d\u201cHow can I not recognize you? You are the same as then.\u201d-Why bother lying when I can see that drool?Short Sword clicked her tongue. Maybe the girl wasn\u2019t fat when she was a child. She smiled at Seo Kalma and then walked a little ahead.\u201cMy lady?\u201dIt was Ho Geum-won\u2019s right arm she reached for. Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s hand was turning red and white steam was being released from her hand, and then something like frost appeared from the severed arm.She picked it up and gave it to Seo Kalma.\u201cThis is?\u201dSurprisingly, she had frozen his arm. She seemed to be having the same ice qi as I had.\u201cThis is a plaque the Great Doctor had given me when he came here the other day.\u201d\u201cHow can I take such a precious thing?\u201d\u201cI hope the young master\u2019s hand gets healed.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dSeo Kalma exclaimed. Even I was shocked.I didn\u2019t know how she managed to get a plaque, but I didn\u2019t think she would just hand it over. Was she saving it for the moment when another person\u2019s disciple arm has to be attached?Pak!This greatly moved Seo Kalma.\u201cI am deeply moved by the grace The Lady has shown. How can I ever repay this favor? I cannot.\u201dHo Geum-won, whose arm was cut down, knelt down and tried to bow, but she resisted this.\u201cIt is fine. It would be a waste if Uncle\u2019s disciple would lose his spirit like this.\u201dHer favor managed to work. Even if it was intentional, she was willing to give out something precious.Seo Kalma, who received this grace, would have to feel a bit moved.Thud!And the man bowed, making his forehead thud on the ground.\u201cSecond Elder, Seo Kalma. I would like to have the Young Lady Baek Ryeon-ha, who inherited the former sect leader\u2019s blood, as the new sect leader. Please accept me with a generous heart,\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha smiled at this.Thanks to the good usage of Han Baek-ha in the right situation, she gained the loyalty of this man.-The final winner is Baek Ryeon-ha, who had lost weight.\u2018Well.\u2019-Uh?Hae Ack-chun, who was looking at this with joy, went ahead and knelt. It seems like he was going to pledge his allegiance too. But I stopped him,\u201cPlease wait a minute, teacher.\u201dHae Ack-chun frowned as he looked at me,\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt my words, not just Hae Ack-chun, but Han Baek-ha and even Baek Ryeon-ha were puzzled. Hae Ack-chun tried to say something\u2013[Teacher. Please leave this to me.][\u2026]Hae Ack-chun was a bit taken aback, but he nodded. I approached Baek Ryeon-ha and bowed,\u201cLong live the Blood Sect! Fourth Elder\u2019s disciple, So Wonhwi asks the young lady for a spar.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Everyone looked shocked at this. Even Baek Ryeon-ha was looking quite shocked. Of course, she would be.Normally this would be gotten over, but then I heard her words.[What is this, Young Master?][Do you hate me as your partner?]For a moment, her face turned red, but then she spoke calmly.[Do you really wish to be with me?][Not exactly that.][What?]She looked at me. Looking at her face in the past and now, she was pretty. And as I smiled, she looked puzzled.[\u2026what are you planning?][I am just doing what the young lady said.][That\u2026]She was speechless. She did say a couple of things with her mouth, so there was no denying it now. If we decided to be loyal to her, it would happen naturally, but this is a loss for my teacher and me.[If you beat me, you will get what you want, so why hesitate so much?]Baek Ryeon-ha bit her lip. I knew why she wasn\u2019t jumping in.She just saw the result between Ho Geum-won and me. She wasn\u2019t sure of being able to get away from the Illusion Eye.But as an individual who has to attract the leaders in the sect, she will have to take responsibility for her words.And she said,\u201cFine. I accept this fight.\u201dAt the same time, other words were said to me.[\u2026 Please suggest what you want.]My lips were itching to smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Who Is The Winner (3)-I expected this. You\u2019re not the type to back off. These days I am starting to feel like you resemble Hae Ack-chun a little too much.Hm.What was this feeling of being praised yet not at the same time? Either way, it didn\u2019t matter.We were all prepared to be hated by the other faction and went under the weak Baek Ryeon-ha. Even if we don\u2019t get anything, we will accept what is given to us.-What? Do you want gold or silver? Or a position?As Short Sword asked, curious as to my intentions. I thought to myself,\u00a0what possible use would gold I could not use have?\u00a0Moreover, right now, this woman doesn\u2019t have a high position either.[We don\u2019t have time. Spill it.]Baek Ryeon-ha urged me on. If we closed the deal before entering the match, it would give me a chance to ask for more. I knew that it wouldn\u2019t look nice on me, so I said,[Please give pardon to our teacher and his disciples.][What?]Her eyes looked a bit shocked by this.She mustn\u2019t have thought of this happening. Any pardon is a pardon. It was the right to receive forgiveness for any sin committed within the sect.It might be of little use now, but if she turned into the sect leader, then she would not be able to hold us accountable.For example, if we wanted to sever ties with the Blood Sect.-You\u2026 are so well prepared.Right. I couldn\u2019t imagine what was going to happen next. Anyway, as long as it was the Blood Sect, escaping would not be easy, so I had to be prepared. And she responded.[You are making excessive demands after taking my plaque.]Did she read my intention? She seemed hesitant to accept my request. Giving this to one person was a lot, but asking it for four people was too high of a risk.And Han Baek-ha said,\u201c\u2026 the young lady accepted the confrontation, so I have nothing to do.\u201dTime was running out. Frowning, she said,[Giving it to everyone is too expensive.][Then?][You and Uncle Hae will be given a pardon each. Is that enough?]She cut down the number by half. Well, good for her. I glanced at the twins. During our time in the cave together, we developed a bond, and I tried to take care of them, but it seemed like it wouldn\u2019t work for now.I cannot be greedy.[I like it.][Good. Then in the battle\u2026][One more.]\u2018\u2026!?\u2019At my words, she exasperated.[Are you saying that taking pardon isn\u2019t enough?][Can I ask just one more?][Uh?][You had a plaque of the Great Doctor with you?]To my words, she didn\u2019t respond right away. She must have thought I would skip it.Did she think I would let it go?\u201cThe lady and young master will do the same as before.\u201dAnd the Bloody Hand Witch continued to speak. As Baek Ryeon-ha walked toward Hae Ack-chun she said,[Ha\u2026 that\u2026 it wasn\u2019t me, but teacher, ah Sixth Blood Star who had it, the herb was a little ungrown, but he gave\u2026]For a moment, she spoke and stopped. But I already understood. This was the plant those two idiots stole, and the Bloody Hand Witch had handed them to the Great Doctor.[Then, is that the plaque you were supposed to give me? Because I was the one who found it.]She frowned.The truth was spilled. If she hadn\u2019t handed the plaque to Seo Kalma I would have never known. She sighed,[\u2026 I gave my own plaque, so I unintentionally let it slip. I apologize to the Young Lord.]I thought I would have to force it, but she apologized to me. Clearly, she was different from normal people.[Fine. The plaque of the Great Doctor was already used. You will have to pay a price for what happened. But now it is time, so we can talk about this later.]It was time.Hac Ack-hun was sealing her blood points. Still, she agreed to pay the price after, so I didn\u2019t mind it.-What will you ask for?\u2018Something like a pill?\u2019I felt it, the fact that I still lacked internal qi. Even if I had innate qi, I needed enough internal qi to stably show skills.My body had absorbed all the qi which had been scattered in my veins, and that was my current limit.-Will she listen to you?\u2018Maybe?\u2019She will.At least she will agree to something similar.Tatatk!Meanwhile, Seo Kalma was blocking my dantian and the flow of internal qi within me. He was pushing a lot harder than before.Each time he touched me, it hurt. At that moment, Seo Kalma said to me,[If you use tricks against the lady, no, Illusion Eye technique, even if your teacher comes to stop it, I will shatter your head.]\u2018\u2026.\u2019I was intending to use Illusion Eye. But looking back, this man had a unique personality too.Aside from putting me down, neither he nor Han Baek-ha nor did my teacher think me taking up this fight was wrong.This was because these are one of many unique people in the Blood Sect. Normally, most people in the unorthodox sects wouldn\u2019t care about such things, but Seo Kalma seemed different.-It is like seeing my former owner.\u2018South Heavenly Swordsman?\u2019-My former owner was proud of his martial arts, so he despised abilities like Illusion Eye.When Iron Sword said it, it seemed plausible.If one had too much pride in their own martial arts, they would hate it. Anyone would hate it. In a way, I also seem to have changed my mindset in this new life.I didn\u2019t know much because I lived for ten years here and another year running from here.\u201cWhat are you doing? Go ahead,\u201dTak!Seo Kalma pushed me to the middle. After cutting off his disciple\u2019s arm right in front of him, he had many reasons to hate me.I will have to be careful not to run into him, and then I heard Hae Ack-chun.[Do you like the Lady for real?]For a moment, I coughed a laugh at the question. No matter how beautiful that woman was, her position was a dangerous thorn.And there is nothing more vulnerable than to be her partner.[I don\u2019t know why I decided to ask that, but I don\u2019t know a clever guy like you will not understand the intention I have.]Of course, I knew.I noticed it long before he decided to support her.He kept talking about legitimacy and worth for a while, but I was curious as to what the real reason was for him to choose the weaker of the two factions.[Well, I entrust this to you, so I trust your judgment.]He nodded like he wouldn\u2019t speak again. And I hoped he would be surprised to know we got a pardon guaranteed for the future.\u201cPhew.\u201dI cleared my breath and looked at Baek Ryeon-ha, who was standing opposite of me.It was our first time facing each other. To be honest, I cannot even imagine what level she has reached. Even when she was fat, she was cornering the two leaders and me, so she had to be higher now.-Even if you lose, it would be better not to be careless. If she is the granddaughter of a sect leader, she will have not just the blood of the man but even the martial arts of the Blood Demon within her.Iron Sword pointed this out to me. He was right.The Blood Demon was once called one of the Five Great Evils with great martial arts. If this woman was learning that, I should be careful.\u2018Uh?\u2019However, the fight hadn\u2019t even started, but Baek Ryeon-ha bowed her head, not wanting to look me in the eye.I made a promise not to use it, but it felt like she was being careful.\u201cNow that, let\u2019s begin!\u201dThe initiation came from Han Baek-ha again. Instantly, she ran at me.It looked like it would be a fight before I had the chance to pull out Iron Sword.Tat!Still, it was a good attempt, so I spread the distance by moving back. My footwork worked without using anything.The movement was dull due to my internal qi being sealed.Srng!I spread the distance, and without putting the sword, I used my sword with its sheath on. And with a very subtle difference, she bent her head back to avoid being hit.Paak!The sword glided in an elegant manner, it was a movement that would be difficult for any warrior. Her balance was near her stomach.As soon as I felt like she was handling this well, I couldn\u2019t take it.Pak!I raised my left arm to stop her movements. Because of my internal qi flow being halted, my arm turned numb at the jab she threw.\u2018What power!\u2019It did look like she had lost weight, but the strength in her hands was too much! I would have to dodge sideways so as not to get hit and pressure her\u2026Pak!\u201cHuh!\u201dShe suddenly grabbed the wrist with her hand pulled in, my body did move a bit ahead, and she threw her left fist at my face.Puak!At that moment, I used Iron Sword to support my body, rotated it, and then kicked her on the shoulder.Tak!She hurriedly moved to block it; however, the weight of my body was higher than hers, so the force behind the kick was bound to have an impact, and as expected, she got pushed back by 5 steps.There was a gleam in her eye.\u201cYou have great instincts.\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201dAfter praising me, she took a strange form and opened her palm and opened her index finger on both hands.\u2018A finger technique?\u2019If it was a martial art that used the fingers, it was a finger technique. I didn\u2019t realize it, but her index fingers were filled with calluses. I heard that finger techniques were hard to learn.This was because the ones learning these arts needed to be prepared to have their fingers broken.\u2018\u2026 martial arts of the Blood Demon?\u2019Finger Technique wasn\u2019t a martial art of the Bloody Hand Witch. The thought of this being Blood Demon\u2019s martial arts tormented my mind.Even if my dantian was blocked, for now, she wasn\u2019t someone I could carelessly handle. This was the martial arts which had once dominated the entire land.Papapak!At that moment, her finger technique moved dazzlingly and reached for me. It was surprising even though it wasn\u2019t a technique used with internal qi.I could see no gaps.\u2018Loach-Shaped sword technique.\u2019Against it, I used the third form, Loach-shaped sword techniques.Although there was no internal qi and the sword was covered with its sheath, I thought it would work. The sword, like a bending willow branch, dug between her movements.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you drawing your sword?\u201dNo matter how much she wanted to fight, she seemed to want to know why the sword wasn\u2019t drawn. I didn\u2019t say anything as I was too absorbed in the movement.In fact, her finger technique was so fierce that it was difficult to do two things at once.-It had to be the Blood Demon\u2019s technique. This is my first time seeing such a good finger technique.Iron Sword was a bit surprised, and so was I.If she could use the same thing with internal qi, then it would be terrifying.Pak!And then her finger technique was digging into the gaps in my sword techniques. It was dangerous, so I pulled out my other sword with my left only to block with it.Paj!Her eyes were wide. It looked like she wanted to end the fight now.\u201cYou practice with your left hand too?\u201dShe seemed surprised that I could wield the dagger with my left hand. This was recommended by both my swords and I had learned it but had never thought I would use it.\u201cPretty good.\u201dI could hear the mumbling from Seo Kalma. He seemed to have appreciated my move. Although he despised me for the trick I used, he was honest when it came to my skills.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to draw your sword?\u201d\u201cI only wanted to properly block the finger technique of Young Lady.\u201dAt my words, her expression darkened. She seemed to know my intentions. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t draw the sword for fairness of battle since this was a battle I was supposed to lose.I just wanted to face the true martial arts of the Blood Demon.\u201cYoung master is a confusing person.\u201dShe said with a smile.Sh!And took a different position. The atmosphere changed with her taking large strides. It was surprising that such an intimidating feeling could be felt from such simple movements.-That movement isn\u2019t normal. Be prepared.Iron Sword warned me. I also put Short Sword back at my waist and corrected my form. It would be something used only at the moment of crisis. And I extended my sword to her.Pak!At that moment, she dodged it from underneath it.The moment I was about to slam the sword that had been stretched out, she kicked the sheath from below and backflipped!Chang!It was all so quick that I missed her swift movements.-Above!Iron Sword told me where she was.If I drew my sword up, that attack of hers would be canceled. But the time had come to end this, and I shouldn\u2019t be doing that.\u2018Phew.\u2019It will hurt, right? And then I heard her voice.\u201cIt will hurt.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2019With warning, her finger technique hit my head.No matter how much it was a technique without internal qi, a hit to the head was bound to hurt as the head was the most vulnerable part.Papapak!As soon as her attack touched me, I lost consciousness.When I opened my eyes, everything was dark around me. Maybe it was night.I looked around to see beds around and someone lying next to me.When I narrowed my eyes for a better look, I could see the face clearly.\u2018Ho Geum-won?\u2019This guy was the one whose arm I cut down, and he was asleep with bandages on his hand. Seeing the smell of herbs and medicine around it felt like his arm had been joined.Thrub!My head hurt badly. The head was a dangerous part to get hit on. Besides, it was surprising that she hadn\u2019t done her best when hitting me.-Wonhwi!-Are you up?The voices of Short Sword and Iron Sword could be heard. Where were they?-Under the bed!I got down and looked down, and both of them were placed together, and next to them were my shoes. Putting on my shoes, I asked,\u2018How long was I out?\u2019-You\u2019ve been down for 6 hours. You didn\u2019t wake up, and we thought you had died.As if I could die.But I was out for too long. Even when my sealed dantian was released, my body didn\u2019t feel right. Well, as expected from the martial arts of the Blood Demon.Throb!But it continued to hurt!She could have done it in moderation, but it looked like she hit me this hard on purpose. Well, it wasn\u2019t a bad deal since I would get my end of it all.\u2018I passed out, and what happened?\u2019-Well, as expected.-Hae Ack-chun pledged his allegiance to her.A natural outcome since I had lost the fight.-After that, I don\u2019t know. You were moved into the room right away. Yah, the physician had put his arms around you, and it was really creepy. While touching each and every\u2026No need to say it, please. My head already hurts from the medicine smell in the room.I left the room quietly, not wanting to wake up Ho Geum-won.\u2018The parish.\u2019No wonder the structure looked different. Most of the lights were turned off, and it was quiet.Well, if I was down for 6 hours, it was past the normal time, so it could be either late night or early morning.\u2018I need to go to my room.\u2019It was late, and I was trying to move. However, in one of the rooms in the building, I saw someone walking out.-He is Go Eunjae?I see that too.The second disciple of Seo Kalma. But why is he coming out at this time?\u2018Hmm.\u2019Something felt suspicious. I was about to head back, but now I was feeling too curious, so I followed him.As I mastered the art of stealth, I could avoid being noticed and followed silently behind. He headed into the forest not far from the main hall of Six Blood Valley.-Suspicious.I didn\u2019t know where he was headed. But he didn\u2019t go too far. He stopped and looked around and suddenly took off the shoes he was wearing.-What is he doing? Why take off the shoes here?He took something from the shoe and suddenly sprayed it. and the white powder was spread around.\u2018Ha!\u2019I thought I knew what he was spraying. The guy did that, and tried to put his shoes back on.Srng!I pulled out Iron Sword and went for him. This guy who felt my presence pulled out his long blade instead of putting on his shoes.Sring!\u201cWho are you?\u201dI asked the flustered guy,\u201cWhat is your identity?\u201dThe guy who recognized me frowned.\u201cSo Wonhwi?\u201dSwish!I pointed the sword at him and asked again,\u201cAnswer me\u201d\u201c\u2026 why care what I do?\u201dThe guy was too much! Did he think I didn\u2019t see what he did?I pointed to the shoes and said,\u201cThousand Miles Chasing Fragrance?\u201dAt those words, his eyes flashed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Escape (1)Thousand Miles Chasing Fragrance.If one was a spy, they would know what this was. It was literally as described by its name.A fragrance that spreads over a thousand miles. By spraying this aromatic dust, the location can be used to track items or train dogs to track.It hasn\u2019t been long since it was sprayed so I could smell it, but why did the second disciple of Second Elder of the Blood Sect have to sneak out at night and do this?-Spy?\u2018It cannot be.\u2019I wanted to know what it was by taking him down. The guy who was holding onto his life wanted to attack me.Shh!And he pointed his longer blade at me.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear that the more curious you are the shorter your life turns?\u201d\u201cWell. I think I heard the less careful you are, the shorter your life will be.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe guy was speechless. He was someone who got caught, so what more could he say?The guy staring at me turned and looked around and smiled,\u201cYou idiot. Did you really think you could handle me alone?\u201dHe seemed convinced that there were no people around. Having mastered lying, I said to him without changing my expression.\u201cDid you think I would come alone?\u2019\u201cHuh. If it were so, they would have blocked me or blocked my escape route already.\u201d-He isn\u2019t fooled by your lie. I guess he isn\u2019t a dumb frog.If it was that simple, I wouldn\u2019t have been a good spy. And this man seemed amazingly trained too.Then\u2026Pat!I struck my fist at him and swung my sword. Despite the surprise attack, Go Eunjae moved to avoid the attack. As expected of someone who was well trained.\u201cDid you think a surprise attack would work? You and I are different. You must have felt me during the day.\u201d\u201cWear your shoes straight. You toad.\u201dWhen I suddenly appeared, the guy failed to put on his shoes and just stepped on them.\u201cToad? You fucking bastard!\u201dRather than stepping back to call him a toad, he stomped at me with an angry face.And the long blade is slashed to my neck. I lean back and thrust my sword into his chest.Papak!He jumped up to avoid it, and in that state, he slammed his long blade at my head with all his might, making me raise my sword to block it.Srng!As if he raised his internal qi to the maximum, the sword trembled, and my body was pushed back four steps.Go Eunjae showed the grace of having the upper hand.\u201cStupid bastard. If you were lucky enough to defeat Ho Geum-won with that trick, you are mistaken to think that you can deal with me.\u2019Seeing how he was calling his sahyung by name, I was right about having bad blood between them.But it was still unknown if this guy was a spy or not.\u201cKek, that trick only applies to those with lesser skill than you, right? What a pity! My body and limbs are solely focused on\u2026\u201d\u201cYou talk so much.\u201dI stabbed my sword like lightning at the mouth of the man who couldn\u2019t shut his damn mouth! Perhaps he was too confident in his skills, and he lazily lifted his blade.Chang!\u201cHuh?\u201dAt that moment, his body got pushed back.\u201cYou?\u201dThe guy\u2019s eyes were wide open. I didn\u2019t miss the chance and moved around him using the Xing Ming God Art.And then used the Tiger Tooth Sword.A fierce attacking technique. The guy, who was shaken by the sudden change in my movement, hurriedly took his stance and leaped forward.Chachachang!His blade and my sword clashed constantly. The destructive force of the blade techniques seemed horribly bloody, just like the name of Seo Kalma.Even in this shaky situation, he could excellently handle my technique. Phat!The guy who stopped my technique spread back.\u201cYou hid your skills.\u201dHe seemed surprised by the power of mine having surpassed that of a first-rate warrior. It was natural for him to react like this as he assumed that I was always weaker than him.Did he not know about warriors always hiding their skills?-But you came back to live another time.\u201cKuak.\u201dIt looked like that guy was thinking. Probably thinking if he can kill me or if he should run. And then he turned around.\u201cThinking of running away?\u201dHe worked hard to move, but I caught him with just a few movements, and he suddenly stopped as he dragged his blade on the floor.Blue flames flew up as he scratched the blade.Papak!\u2018What are you doing?\u2019At that moment, the dirt and dust swept up, and I hurriedly used Iron Sword to block the flying sand particles.Papapk!At that time, Short Sword and Iron Sword shouted at me.-Dagger!-Avoid!Without even thinking about it, I spun my body and sprinted high.Sish!I felt something sharp move right below me, and Short Sword yelled.-Throw me ahead!Before I could even land, I drew Short Sword and threw it through the dust.\u201cHuk!\u201dChang!Blue sparks flew among the dust. As soon as I landed, I swung my sword. It was the chasing technique.This technique makes Short Sword move ahead with the precise rotation to cut down the gaps in the techniques of an opponent. This was a simple stabbing technique.There was no chance, but the force of it was outstanding.\u201cDamn it!\u2019I could hear a voice from the dust.Chachahcang!As the daggers seemed to have clashed and shone ahead. Twelve daggers he threw seemed to come, but I was unable to defend and move back.As I passed through the dust, he was holding the left side of his chest, and it was stained red.-I am here.Short Sword shouted at me. When I looked at it, it was stuck on the ground, but for now, the man first.Go Eunjae looked at me and said,\u201cYou\u2026 What are you? How did you avoid my daggers through all that dust?\u201dIn the dark night, with dust in front of us, he was shocked at how I was unhurt.\u201cI have a third eye.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dI raised my sword. Even if he was injured, he was someone who was using daggers, meaning I couldn\u2019t be careless. The guy also seemed ready to fight, but his movements stopped.He seemed a bit hesitant, though, as he wasn\u2019t sure he could win with his skills.-Because he can run, you attack first.Short Sword said.\u2018No\u2019As a spy, I could guess what he was thinking. There are only two options the spy takes here.Either run or commit suicide. And he didn\u2019t look like the spy who would die. I wasn\u2019t worried about the latter, not even for a second.\u2018It needs a preparation of the heart.\u2019I stared at his intention and thought back. This guy, drenched in sweat and concern, didn\u2019t know anything.\u2018Maybe?\u2019Raise my innate qi to the extreme. I didn\u2019t know since it was in the middle of the fight, but now I had a good chance.At that time, he shouted as he moved for the sword I was pointing at his neck like he had made up his mind.\u201cAs if I would give up to someone like yo\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at my eyes!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe unconsciously looked into my eyes, and that was the moment.The guy holding a blade to slice his throat threw it away with all his might.And he had his mouth wide open and shocked eyes.Pat!I moved to him right away and sealed his blood points. And his eyes turned back to normal.\u201cAh?\u2019He couldn\u2019t hide his shock as his whole body felt stiff. He probably didn\u2019t understand what had happened and was too shocked, but nothing changed.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dI put my finger in his mouth and opened it wide, he looked at me angrily, but it was too late. Isn\u2019t this going to be his next attempt?\u2018Found it!\u2019-What did you find?I carefully grabbed what was attached to the molars of the teeth and pulled it.A very thin thread was tied around the left molar. And I gently had to pull it as he groaned at it.Swish!And through the throat came something tied. A tiny black capsule.-What is that?She could see it well despite being stuck to the ground.\u2018Poison pill.\u2019-Poison pill? That is poison?\u2018Right.\u2019Usually, this was a must-have thing. As expected, this guy was a spy.There are two ways for spies to kill themselves.One was to use their weapon to cut their throat, which was always prepared for, and then there was this poison which burned the body from the inside out, which was too painful.-How can those who couldn\u2019t die even once try it?\u2018Maybe based on the situation? It is to be expected that one doesn\u2019t die even if we eat the poison right away.\u2019-Ah, right. Then is instant death better?So the throat would be the first choice. It was a lot better than taking poison.But what? This one had failed at both. Go Eunjae screamed as if he was about to cough and looked at me and the pill, and I smiled.\u201cYou fell into my hands.\u201dWith those words, I slammed my fist into his face.Tang! Tang! Tang!As we approached the main hall, a bell was ringing. An ominous sound.As expected, the spread of fragrance was informed or known. Thanks to that, someone must have come close to Six Blood Valley.I glanced at Go Eunjae, who was draped over my shoulder.\u2018It is all different.\u2019The location of Six Blood Valley must be revealed. But this wasn\u2019t the right time. But considering that Seo Kalma shouldn\u2019t even be here at this time, this was bound to happen.\u2018Then the fate of Ho Geum-won changed.\u2019If my prediction is right, the guy must have died in the hands of Go Eunjae. However, fate changed since I caught him.Anyway, I had to hurry.Pat!I used footwork and ran for the gate, and upon entering, many warriors of the sect were moving around. They were all soaking oil over the buildings.-What are they doing?\u2018Burning it all.\u2019The location was discovered, and it was an urgent task to remove their traces. The Blood Sect, which was hiding for a long time, was revealed, so this was bound to happen.Hae Ack-chun, the twins, Baek Ryeon-ha and Seo Kalma, along with the commander of this place, were having serious talks.\u201cTeacher.\u201d\u201cNo. you?\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201dEveryone looked at me. Everyone had different expressions, and most were skeptical.It was a natural reaction as I wasn\u2019t there when the bell rang.\u201cKid. Where are you coming from?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked me.Tak!I put the idiot on the shoulders down.\u201cEunjae!\u2019Seo Kalma frowned and called for the disciple, and he looked at me.\u201cYou! What have you done?\u201d\u201cA spy.\u201d\u201cSpy what nonse\u2026 what?\u201dNot just Seo Kalma but, everyone else was shocked at the words and looked at the fainted Go Eunjae.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Escape (2)Everyone was shocked by my use of the word spy. Their reaction was natural as I said that the second disciple of the second elder, Seo Kalma, was a spy.And Seo Kalma was one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries. He looked at me with eyes filled with anger.\u201cDo you even know what you are saying? A spy?\u201dThe feeling of intimidation wasn\u2019t normal. My heart was beating fast making me anxious but I didn\u2019t lose my composure.\u201cWhy is the bell ringing now?\u201dIt was Baek Ryeon-ha who answered those words.\u201cHundreds of people appeared near the mountains, possibly warriors. And those who looked like scouts had entered the mountain region. They aren\u2019t far from the sect.\u201dThis was expected. The role of the scouts was to check around. Since Go Eunjae was a spy the scent that he threw around needed to be tracked. These scouts would surely find this location eventually.If they are near the mountain then the people will come here in less than 2 to 4 hours and report back too.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time. Tell me why he is a spy\u2026\u201dSrng!Tatatak!Five people surrounded me. They were the five leaders of the Six Blood Valley and Gu Sang-woong.They already took the weapons out and aimed them. They were suspicious of me too.Hae Ok-seon\u2019s leader was ready to swing her sword at any time.\u201cDon\u2019t move from the place and explain. Young master, where have you been?\u2019Bang!At that time, Hae Ack-chun slammed the ground below and shouted.\u201cAre you doubting my disciple right now?\u201dShocked by his rage, the five leaders weren\u2019t sure what to do. In the meantime, it looked like he trusted his disciple.-I see the old man in a new light.\u2018Right.\u2019However, there were people who could ignore him.\u201cHae hyung. Your disciple also went off when the bells rang. And going wasn\u2019t enough. He did this to my disciple. This is a situation where anyone will be suspicious of your disciple.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u2019\u201cWe aren\u2019t clear if Hae hyung\u2019s disciple had made my disciple like this to blame him for this all.\u201dLike Hae Ack-chun, this man trusted his disciple too.\u201cAre you accusing me? Ha! As I thought, talks don\u2019t\u2026\u201dAt that time, Han Baek-ha stopped him.\u201cBoth of you. We don\u2019t have time for this. We need to fix this quickly. So, Young Master, give us a proper explanation if you want to avoid suspicion. Otherwise, the Young Master will also be detained.\u201dWith her declaration, I pointed at Go Eunjae.\u201cTake the sole from the shoe of the second elder\u2019s disciple.\u201d\u201cSole?\u201dGu Sang-woong, the commander of this valley, looked cautiously at Seo Kalma. He was asking for permission.Seo Kalma nodded with an uncomfortable expression. Gu Sang-woong personally took off the shoe from this guy, and when he tore the sole off, a leather pouch of white power was exposed.\u2018\u2026!\u2019Seo Kalma, who saw this, was shocked. And Gu Sang-woong brought it closer to his mouth and smelled it. Then, looking at it, Baek Ryeon-ha and Han Baek-ha had stiff faces as they said,\u201cThousand Miles Chasing Strength.\u201d\u201cThousand Miles Chasing Strength!\u201dAmong them, there were those who didn\u2019t seem to know about it.-They don\u2019t seem to know.As Short Sword had said, the twins were only looking bewildered at this but there was no time to explain.\u201cHehe, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201dWhen evidence came out, Hae Ack-chun was alive. Without stopping here, I took out the poison pill in my hand.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dHan Baek-ha asked.\u201cIt was inside tied to his back molar. It has been tied up for a long time, so there have to be other traces.\u201dAt those words, Gu Sang-woong opened his mouth and confirmed it. With a sad expression, he nodded as he touched the molars with his finger.Seo Kalma was shocked,\u201cIt cannot be. How can my disciple\u2026\u201d\u201cElder\u2026 I am sorry, but Young Master So is right. If the pill is tied up for a long time it digs into a shape near the gum.\u201d\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d\u201cFor half a year I had infiltrated the Murim Alliance as a spy.\u201dI didn\u2019t know Gu Sang-woong worked as a spy. But thanks to his words the credibility of my words increased.\u201cHow can this\u2026\u201dSeo Kalma looked at his disciple with confused eyes. There was anger, disappointment, and despair.It wouldn\u2019t be a shock if this was someone else, but this guy was his disciple.\u201cIs there a need for more clarification?\u201d\u201c\u2026 leaders, pull back your weapons.\u201dAt Han Baek-ha\u2019s words, the leaders who surrounded me all pulled back their weapons and bowed to apologize to me.And Gu Sang-woong asked me,\u201cBut\u2026 how did you know this?\u201dNow again they all looked curious at me. And their eyes were all narrowed but I had prepared my answer.\u201cI woke up late and tried to head back to my place. Then I saw Go Eunjae leaving his room to go somewhere. Moving away from the main hall felt suspicious to me so he pursued him. He then suddenly stopped and sprayed this powder around.\u201cYou didn\u2019t use internal qi?\u201d\u201cIf I did, he would have run or I would have been killed.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dGu Sang-woong realized that his question was wrong.\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything else as it was such a situation. If it hadn\u2019t been for a surprise attack, I would have been killed.\u201dGo Eunjae crossed the wall of a first-rate warrior. I explained it like this because it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to defeat such a high level warrior in a head-on battle. I pointed to my right hand.I deliberately stabbed myself in the right side with a dagger to avoid suspicion.-Well, you are one huge deal man.Short Sword clicked her tongue.How long was I a spy? How could I make such a mistake? It wasn\u2019t uncommon to be prepared like this.\u201cI could have lost my life.\u201d\u201cYou did something dangerous.\u201dAs he said, Gu Sang-woong\u2019s expression softened. Any doubts were now gone.\u201cHehe, you should know this guy\u2019s guts!\u201dHae Ack-chun praised me. It was to praise the fact that I had managed to catch the spy alone. Thanks to this, the expression of the others changed toward meAnd Baek Ryeon-ha came as she said,\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the young master we would have never known who the spy was and we would have been caught off guard. Thank you very much.\u201dChak!Everyone around her bowed and showed their gratitude to me.It wasn\u2019t intended but I was being given merit for what I did. If I didn\u2019t find Go Eunjae by chance, I would have never been able to figure out what happened.Pak!At that time, Seo Kalma fell on his knees and pleaded to Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cThese things happened because I didn\u2019t have an eye to select people\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. We don\u2019t have time to talk about Uncle Seo\u2019s sins. It is time to make an escape route. We will talk about this later.\u201dSeo Kalma bitterly responded to her words,\u201cI understand.\u201dThe influence he had on the future was great, so she could not simply throw the guy out because of one mistake. And his guilt could be used.However, Seo Kalma seemed unable to let this go. He approached his fallen disciple and struck his former disciple\u2019s dantian with his palm.Crash!The body shook violently, causing convulsions.-What is he doing?\u2018\u2026 destroying his dantian.\u2019I didn\u2019t expect this extreme step to be taken right away. This action would be to show that this guy was no longer his disciple. That wasn\u2019t the end of Go Eunjae\u2019s misfortune,\u201cCut his limbs off too.\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha issued this cruel command. As expected of the Blood Demon\u2019s descendant. Last time, she let Han Baek-ha cut off her fingers without mercy.-That is good. You and Baek Ryeon-ha end up doing the same thing.It was true. I said it, but she ended up doing it.In any case, not just the dantian but the limbs would also be rendered useless. So even walking would be difficult. Since we had to find out who was behind this, one of the leaders brought by Han Baek-ha would handle him.Since it was shameful to have a spy with him, Seo Kalma just let everything happen. The issue of the spy got sorted and Baek Ryeon-ha changed the topic,\u201cLet\u2019s wrap up the story about it and go for the escape route.\u201dIt seems they were discussing this before I came here. And it seemed that they were trying to move by dividing three escape routes rather than going from one place.The reason was because of Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s identity. Although her identity wasn\u2019t known to the enemies, they were aiming to distract the attention of theirs.-Isn\u2019t it better to be together than to go separately?\u2018But we don\u2019t know the force of the enemies.\u2019If there were more warriors who were stronger than the elders on the enemy side it would be tough. For example, the Eight Great Warriors of the central plains\u2026Perhaps, they came with such a strategy in mind.\u201cAs I said before, the people of the Great Doctor will get escorted first\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cWe will leave soon.\u201dSecond leader Seo Kalma, who had five commanders, decided to let them take charge.Great Doctor\u2019s people didn\u2019t belong to this place, despite being a small number they couldn\u2019t get involved in such dangerous things. And the next problem was Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cFourth Elder, please escort our lady.\u201d\u201cYou want me to?\u201dHan Baek-ha asked Hae Ack-chun,\u201cThey might be after the lady. It could be dangerous for us to divide, so\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 okay.\u201dHae Ack-chun, who thought her words were true, accepted it. If Han Baek-ha decides to pretend to be the escort of the fake one, then the enemies would be confused.\u201cIt is decided. Then the commander of the Six Blood Valley will have to divide the people.\u201d\u201cI will do as directed.\u201dAnd so the forces in the Six Blood Valley were divided into two.Half to escort the fake one, and the other half for the real Baek Ryeon-ha. Even though it was fake, they could not let the enemy know.\u201cThere is so much burden. Tch tch.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.He was saying this because there were lower and middle rank warriors being put with them.\u201cFourth Elder will have it tough, but please. Now set the flame!\u201dAnd the order fell. One of the leaders with other warriors set fire to the oil-soaked buildings around.Wheik!The flames blazed and spread around. At this rate, in less than half an hour, everything would be turned to ashes.And Hae Ok-seon tried to throw something into the fire, it was the shoe of Go Eunjae.\u201cWait!\u201dGu Sang-woong, who was watching, stopped her.He looked at Baek Ryeon-ha and said,\u201cMy Lady. How about we do it like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Escape (3)Tatatk.With faces covered with masks, we were moving to the southwest. The Six Blood Valley was in a mountain range surrounded by peaks.This meant there were many mountain paths spread out in many directions, but some of them were safe to move on. The path we were taking now was something prepared over a long period of time.Since the path was steep and difficult to see, it could be described as the safest way out.-But wasn\u2019t the leader the one in the most danger?\u2018It has to be dangerous.\u2019It had to be the most dangerous because the powder was sprayed over the body. In order to divert the attention of the enemies, Gu Sang-woong made a leader who was skilled with stealth pour the powder over him.-A death mission.Right.If the person wasn\u2019t lucky, then it would be death for him. In the end, it was a mission that required sacrifice. By now, he has to be luring the enemies into a dangerous place. And if they find out\u2026-He commits suicide?Even if he doesn\u2019t want to, he will have to do it. It would be better than torture from the enemies.-I am afraid that this happens everywhere.\u2018Well.\u2019Even if it wasn\u2019t Blood Sect, any sect would sacrifice someone in this situation. Better to give one up to save many.It might be cruel, but this was Murim.-Well, I hope he doesn\u2019t get caught.Their mission should be going well since there have been no problems till now. Because Baek Ryeon-ha was moving with us, and there was no blockage on the other path. We had Gu Sang-woong with us, and he was a commander of the Six Blood Valley, so he had better knowledge of this place.Gu Sang-woong moved ahead of us and most of the sides were being guarded by Jang Mun-wong. In the middle of the procession were two more leaders of the Six Blood Valley including Hae Ack-chun, and the twins escorting Baek Ryeon-ha.-What was she eating again?\u2018Who?\u2019-Baek Ryeon-ha.As she asked, I looked toward the woman who was lifting her mask to eat beef jerky secretly.She seemed to have lost weight, but her craving for food hadn\u2019t died. For her to eat like this in such a situation, her condition mustn\u2019t have been cured.At that time, perhaps conscious of me seeing her, she lowered her mask and hid her jerky.I already saw it. Why bother hiding it now? Wait, did you start eating again?-She secretly munches whenever she has time.I narrowed my eyes. How many bags of jerky did she have?\u201cI want to eat it too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at her idiot.\u201dSeems like I wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed it. When Song Woo-hyun asked, Song Jwa-baek quietly scolded him in a whisper.After discovering who Baek Ryeon-ha was, he was being more cautious.\u201c\u2026\u201dPerhaps because of all this, Baek Ryeon-ha took out 3 pieces of jerky and without a word handed it to the twins and me.Did this mean take one and shut your mouths?\u2018Hmm.\u2019But I wasn\u2019t really hungry. But the taste felt good against the mouth.\u201cEat quietly. You people.\u201dHae Ack-chun who was ahead of him looked back with an annoyed voice. And Baek Ryeon-ha apologized,\u201cI am sorry, Uncle Hae.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFrom then on, Hae Ack-chun said nothing.We had been going down the mountain quickly for about half an hour.-\u2026Sounds rang in my ear. I frowned and looked for its origin point.Almost the same, no, faster than me, Hae Ack-chun looked in the same direction, and he hurried to the front.Pat!Soon, Gu Sang-woong, who stood ahead, raised his hand to stop us.\u201cWhat\u2026uh!\u201dSong Jwa-baek mumbled, not understanding what was happening. I covered his mouth and pointed to the direction the weird sound was coming from, and sent him a Voice Transmission.[An ambush on that side.]His eyes widened in surprise.[How do you know that?]It seemed like he was more shocked at me noticing it than the enemies being there. I, too, couldn\u2019t feel the presence due to the power difference, but it was the sound of the sword I heard.[Can\u2019t you see that teacher ran over there and made us stop?]I tried to make sense. The boy needed an excuse that worked.Anxiety rose in Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s eyes. Hae Ack-chun was the only one who had found their presence, and she must be worried about how many people were ready to ambush her. And I heard.[Come to the front with the two leaders there.]Me and two leaders were called forward. So I sent the same information to leaders Hae Ok-seon and Yang Kangil. They nodded. When I was going ahead, Baek Ryeon-ha asked,[Only three were called?][Yes. Just us three.]At those words, she looked a bit relieved.Maybe she thought that the ambush wasn\u2019t too huge. Listening to the sound of swords, I could hear five swords, but if there were enemies who used no weapons and just used hand-to-hand combat, then it would be tough.When we went ahead, Hae Ack-chun was talking with Gu Sang-woong.[Teacher]When I called him, he said,[Seven people are hiding behind the hill over there right now. It seems that one person is pretty skilled, and the others are first and second-rate warriors.]That said, two people were using different weapons from swords. Fortunately, the number of people ambushing was low. With this number, it had to be a scout team rather than a proper ambush.[We hit first. I will handle the skilled one so the rest of you can take care of the other guys. You cannot waste time. Remove them right away.]If we took too much time, they could inform others, so this made sense. Hae Ack-chun would handle two, and Gu Sang-woong would also handle two, giving the three of us one each to handle. And the signal was given as we headed for the hill.Shhh!\u2019Hae Ack-chun raised his hand gently, a sign to stop. It felt like they were trying to figure out the presence. As we waited for them to take the signal down, the two moved.Phat!As the two went over the hill, a huge crashing sound was heard, and the sound of weapons clashing could be heard. At the same time, I moved with the other two leaders.We went over the hill to see Hae Ack-chun fighting with those who wielded swords and Gu Sang-woong with those who used hand-to-hand combat.Phat!Me and the leaders aimed for the rest of the ones left.\u2018It is decided.\u2019A swordsman in a blue belt with sharp eyes. He seemed to be pretty fine. It would have been difficult to deal with this one guy in my previous life, but not now.Chang!\u201cKuak!\u201dI neutralized his movements in three hits. He was completely overwhelmed by my skills, and I went for the chest with the fourth step without even using any technique.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe threw himself back to avoid having a fatal wound, so he clenched his sword. I covered his mouth and knocked him down. And tried to slice his throat.-No!Until I heard a sound in my head. The sound of his sword. Scream not to kill its owner.\u2018Ah!\u2019All of a sudden, a good idea came to me..Tatatak!I picked up the sword after sealing the blood points of the man.\u2018You can hear me?\u2019Hearing my voice, the sword seemed shocked.-W-what? A human can talk to me?\u2018What do you mean by what? you can hear me talking.\u2019-It is true!The sword was reacting the same as any other. Well, no human could hear them normally. This was bound to shock them. But I didn\u2019t have time, so I asked.\u2018You don\u2019t want your owner to be hurt, right?\u2019He did beg me, so I asked.-Please don\u2019t kill my owner. If he dies, I will be abandoned.That was bad. I felt bad for him.\u2018Then tell me about your owner\u2019s identity and where his colleagues are hiding.\u2019-Ah, no. I cannot cheat!He refused, as if he knew where I was going with this. Even if the swords could be communicated with, I couldn\u2019t subdue their ego. Basically, each sword serves its own owner.-Are you from the Blood Sect?Rather he was questioning my identity.-He said that all the members of the Blood Sect have to be killed for the sake of peace in Kangho as they are cruel ones.With these words, I could roughly guess their identities.Seeing their cause, they had to be from orthodox sects.\u2018Really? Then I cannot do much.\u2019I lifted him up and aimed at the neck of the fallen man.-Yah, that is too cruel.Short Sword, who didn\u2019t speak till now, said, from their standpoint, this was like them stabbing their owner to death. I thought it would work.-No! I will tell you! Pl-Please don\u2019t do that!The sword stepped back.Seeing that he was openly ready, he must really not want to kill his owner. And he gave me all the information he knew.-As I said it all, you will save my owner\u2019s life, right?He asked, and I put him down.-Thank you. You seem to be a good person of the Blood Sect.\u2018I will not touch the neck.\u2019-What?Saying that I stabbed the guy in the heart with Iron Sword. The swordsman\u2019s body was wriggling, then turned stiff.-Yah! You fucking human trash! How\u2026The sword cursed at me.\u2018Sorry. The only consideration I can give you is not to let us kill him.\u2019But the sword continued to curse. Well, it couldn\u2019t help it.I used it and killed its owner. After all, its owner was here to kill me, and I doubt he would have shown me mercy.-Still, you could be considerate.Short Sword said with a bitter voice.I wasn\u2019t doing this because I wanted to either. As I was feeling bad, Hae Ack-chun came over.\u201cI told you to end this quickly. What are you doing?\u201dLooking around, everyone seemed dead. All of them seemed weaker than I thought, so they were dealt with quickly.\u201cSeeing how you hesitate to kill, you have a long way to go,\u201dAhh.I guess talking to the sword got misunderstood like that.\u201cUgh!\u201dI heard a small groan and looked at Gu Sang-woong bending over someone. Hae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.\u201cTch. A fail?\u201dGu Sang-woong nodded his head.\u201cHe bit his tongue.\u201dHearing what he said, he too aimed to know their identity, but the result was unsuccessful. Hae Ack-chun shook his head in disappointment.\u201cNothing can be done. Let\u2019s hide the bodies and cover them behind the bushes and head back\u201d\u201cAlright\u2019It was time for everyone to dispose of these corpses. I said to Hae Ack-chun,\u201cI figured it out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThese people are warriors of the Tianjin clan and Haeyeon Sect.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019At that, everyone, including Hae Ack-chun stopped and looked at me with shocked eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Escape (4)\u201cNo, how do you know that?\u201dHae Ack-chun asked despite being a bit shocked.\u201cI interrogated him. He seemed a bit hesitant to die, I guess. I questioned him using Voice Transmission as I didn\u2019t want the others around finding out.\u201dTo be precise, it was the sword I heard it from, and the sword was still cursing me. It resented me, but that didn\u2019t matter.The lives on our side were important too.\u201cI said we have hundred people with us, and if he wanted his colleagues to be saved, he should talk.\u201d-You can be called the master of lies at this point.Then do I say that I heard from a sword?\u201cYou did a wise thing, Young Master.\u201dGu Sang-woong, the leader of the valley, praised me. Since I had caught the spy, he seemed to like me.\u201cKuak, at least your head is working fine, so what did you find?\u201dI revealed what the sword had told me about.The dead swordsman came from the Haeyeon sect, and he didn\u2019t know much. But I had found out that seven sects were moved at the request of some other place, and there were a few more people waiting to ambush us, just like before.\u201cThis is one thing, but the other problem will be the sect leader of the Haeyeon sect who is searching for us with hundreds of masters.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dEveryone\u2019s expression went dark at my words. They could escape from this ambush, but the path ahead was a dead end.And we couldn\u2019t head back either.\u201cHuh! Then we will just have to break through them.\u201dHae Ack-chun spoke.Although there were low-rank and middle-rank warriors amongst the people we were moving with, they were all ones who had learned martial arts, and it would still be possible to break through.It was unclear how many sacrifices would be needed from our side, as the enemies would probably not back down.\u201cElder. That is dangerous. The whereabouts of the lady will be exposed.\u201dGu Sang-woong, who seemed to have the same thought as I, objected to this plan.\u201cThen what do you want to do? Head back like this?\u201d\u201cElder. How about this?\u201dAt that time, a leader called Yang Kangil opened his mouth. Gu Sang-woong asked, hoping for an idea,\u201cLeader Yang. Do you have any good ideas?\u201d\u201cHow about going down the cliff valley road next to this?\u201dAt that Hae Ack-chun seemed puzzled,\u201cThere is another mountain road here?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dSuddenly, Gu Sang-woong opposed it with a stiff face.\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cIt is a place of steep cliffs and valleys on either side. It is dangerous because the path is one way; there are no side extensions.\u201dA place where one could only move forward or head back. If he was right, then it wasn\u2019t the right for a retreat.In particular, when there is a large number of people being led that path wasn\u2019t the right option.\u201cThen why not jump down to the valley?\u201d\u201cThe cliffs are too high for that. Even if martial arts is used, it is still extremely dangerous. What is more is that there are fast-moving torrents in places, and if one gets pushed away by it, one\u2019s safety cannot be guaranteed.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dEven if they were all martial artists, they were still humans. Even warriors fall weak in front of mother nature.When Gu Sang-woong objected to this, Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t ask anything more.No one knew the path of Six Blood Valley better than him. However, leader Yang Kangil seemed to have other opinions,\u201cBecause it is such a dangerous road, doesn\u2019t that mean we can get ahead of our enemies?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEven the enemies might think we will not\u2026\u201d\u201cLeader Yang! Do you want to gamble on the safety of the young lady and all the others that are at stake!\u201dRather, everyone heard the shout of Gu Sang-woong. He thought that the method was too dangerous for the people here.Wasn\u2019t there a saying in the martial arts world about avoiding roads that only have one path to take? But now, we were too far down the path to just outright reject this proposal.In the end, he had to choose between making a breakthrough from the enemy encirclement or going down this valley, even if both were risky.\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was a moment when he seemed troubled I heard the sound of something moving in my ear.Phat!At the same time, Hae Ack-chun\u2019s body moved too fast.Kik!Everyone, including me, looked over. Hae Ack-chun was twisting the neck of a man holding a horn.There was one who hadn\u2019t died yet. The situation turned urgent as someone made the mistake of leaving an enemy alive.Although Hae Ack-chun did kill him, the guy had blown the horn for a short time.\u201cDamn it!\u201dAs long as the horn got rung, there was no way out. Enemies would come running down our path of retreat.\u201cElder?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head down that valley. Shit.\u201dHae Ack-chun spoke a bit nervously at this unexpected turn of events and then looked at the place the procession stopped.\u201cPhew.\u201dGu Sang-woong, the leader, took a deep breath and followed. And the rest of the leaders followed him.We, who joined the procession, turned around to the commander and went down the road.Shortly after we went down this place, a really deep cliff valley appeared. Looking at this, I knew why this path was described as dangerous.-Wow, it is so dark here.It was literally full of cliffs. There was a small wind moving down below, but even from here, I could feel that the wind was strong.It was no exaggeration to say anyone would die if they fell from here.But there was a problem.-\u2026The sound of people moving. I could hear it.It was the sound of swords. It was a number that was nothing like before.-There are many enemies.-What do we do? Wonhwi?I looked at Hae Ack-chun; there was no way he couldn\u2019t miss this. Hae Ack-chun\u2019s expression turned serious.He looked worried for a moment and spoke to Baek Ryeon-ha and us,\u201cLady. I think we should divide from here.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Uncle Hae?\u201d\u201cThe number of enemies chasing us is uncountable. I guess we will have to divide our power in half to stop them.\u201dSeeing how he said this, there must be a strong person intermixed with the enemies. Probably the sect leader of the Haeyeon sect.And she nodded without a word knowing that being stubborn would get all of them killed.\u201cYou must live!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will deal with them and follow you.\u201d\u201cTeacher!\u201dSong Jwa-baek called to him with a worried voice. And to this, Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cNo matter what happens, protect her. And don\u2019t forget where the meeting point is.\u201dThe meeting point.It was a place that Hae Ack-chun had informed me of in advance in case something happened. A base which was made by Jang Mun-wong.He had asked us all to gather there if we ever got scattered.\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dWhen Song Jaw-baek answered, Hae Ack-chun sent a message to me.[You are the smartest one of them, so I think you can help out Leader Jang.]Because of a few good things I did, he trusted me too much. Who would have thought that I would really build a proper relationship with this crazy old man?\u201cI wish you good luck.\u201dI took the initiative and said a prayer for his safe return.\u201cHuh! Worry about your own luck.\u201dHae Ack-chun smiled and then headed to the place where the enemies were coming from with half the troops.As half of them vanished, the power on this side had decreased. Now, on our side was just Leader Jang, Baek Ryeon-ha, and me.There were other leaders like Yang Kangil and the twins, but without Hae Ack-chun our power had decreased significantly.\u201cLet\u2019s do it like this.\u201dYang Kangil took the lead.Unlike the existing paths, this one had only a narrow path, with only one exit. This meant that Leader Jang Mun-wong would be escorting Baek Ryeon-ha. I, along with Leader Yang, would be the ones in the lead, with the twins watching the rear.The procession moved with the safety of Baek Ryeon-ha as the priority.\u201cWe need to hurry.\u201dYang Kangil took the lead, and we entered the path.Fortunately, we couldn\u2019t feel the enemy following us, which meant Hae Ack-chun was blocking the path pretty well.But he had to hurry up and get out\u2013But just for a moment,-\u2026Again, my ear heard it.The front side of the gorge we were heading to.The sound wasn\u2019t huge like the ones trying to chase us, but it was still the sound of swords.Shh!I raised my hand and stopped the profession. Yang Kangil, who was in the lead, looked puzzled.[Leader Yang.]I sent him a voice transmission that confused him even more.[What is it, Young Master?][There are enemies in the front.][Enemies? I don\u2019t feel any presence.]Of course, he didn\u2019t.As he was still a first-rate warrior, he couldn\u2019t. Because I had the ability to listen to the sound of the sword, I could almost hear the sound of it, similar in strength to Hae Ack-chun[I am sure. We need to call the leaders.]The protection of Baek Ryeon-ha was the priority to all, and if there were enemies ahead, it was more stable for the strong ones to lead into it. But, Yang Kangil shook his head.[Leader Hojong protects the young lady. I don\u2019t know if the young master is right, but even if he is, we will have to break through them.][\u2026]Hmm, I didn\u2019t expect to get turned down like this.Of course, even if Baek Ryeon-ha was the priority, if we encounter enemies on this narrow path, it would be better to break through them head on.[Then let\u2019s be careful.][We need to be careful. I know what Young Master means.]Yang Kangil nodded, saying there was nothing more that could be done.[I don\u2019t have a weapon, so the Young Lord will have to draw his sword to signal the procession.]Yang Kangil used his fists, so he had no weapon. I turned back and pulled out the South Heavenly Iron Sword and raised it so everyone in the back could see it.And when the sword was raised, the others who realized the meaning, drew their weapons.Srng!It was better to be prepared in advance.-Wonhwi.Iron Sword called for me.\u2018What is it?\u2019As I held him, he informed me what he had seen.\u2018What?\u2019I frowned, and Yang Kangil said to me.[Hurry, Young Master. Any further delay will be dangerous.][I understand.]To my response, Yang Kangil nodded his head.At this time, I tried to kill down the presence of my internal energy presence and moved as forward as I could, but I must have been too close.Yang Kangil tried to turn his head. At that moment, I stabbed him in the back at the speed of lightning.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dI hurriedly pointed the sword at his neck and said,[If you don\u2019t want to die, stay silent. What is your identity?]\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u2019[Speak only if you are sure.]I thrust the sword further towards his neck.Puak!One more inch, and this bastard would die in my hands. Looking shocked, Yang Kangil stared up at me.It was the same with the upper-rank warriors behind.[Young master, why are you being like this?]As a warrior asked, I said.[Is there something like a white powder on the back of the sheath?]At the words, the warriors frowned a little and then said in surprise.[Yes!]Just as Iron Sword had said,As I drew Iron Sword, he told me that Yang Kangil had tampered with my sheath from behind. That he had fiddled something onto it.And I touched the sheath and smelt it.Again, it was the Thousand Miles Chasing Fragrance.-Is he with that one?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2018What do we do?\u2019Not all the scents were the same.The scent that Yang Kangil put on my sheath was different from what Ko Eunjae did.Of course, it was possible for the same group of people to use different types.I push the tip of my sword to his throat.[Why did you put that powder onto me?]Kangil looked shocked. He didn\u2019t even have the time to think about what had just happened as he was caught too fast.And I felt annoyed,[Spill it!]Yang Kang-il said nothing, not being able to think of anything.[For the commander and Fourth Elder to follow\u2026]Clench![Huk!][Don\u2019t spew shit to me. Will you have to do it secretly if that was your purpose?]He was speaking nonsense right to my face. Come to think of it; this guy was the one who insisted we take this valley path.Ha! Now I knew.[\u2026 the one who didn\u2019t die before. That was your doing, right?]\u2018\u2026!!!\u2019Yang Kangil\u2019s eyes looked shocked at it, and he tried to scream.\u201cHere\u2026.\u201dPuak!\u201cKuak!\u201dI put the sword through the neck, and having it pierced; the bastard fell to the ground.It couldn\u2019t be figured out what his intentions were, but if he was going to scream out our location, I couldn\u2019t let him live.\u2018\u2026 this isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u2019Our escape was beyond these mountain ranges.I looked at the back of the procession. A trap in front.Unintentionally, it turned into a situation where I had to lead them all out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - The Trap (1)Everyone was puzzled as I turned to signal a retreat.I sent the senior warriors a message that there was an ambush ahead, and when I let them know what happened, they started to quickly turn back.Then, passing them, a few people came.It was Baek Ryeon-ha and leader Jang Mun-wong.\u201cYoung master.\u201dShe was about to say something in a whisper but I spoke to her before[There is an ambush ahead.]Of course, I sent the same message to Jang Mun-wong, and he tilted his head.-He doesn\u2019t seem to get it.Although he was an excellent performer at the level of commander, unless he was as skilled as Hae Ack-chun his perception wouldn\u2019t be good enough. Of course, he couldn\u2019t feel it.[An ambush? How can the enemies\u2026 ah!]Baek Ryeon-ha frowned as she noticed something. It was the body of the deceased leader Yang Kang-il.Jang Mun-wong, who discovered it thanks to her reaction, asked me what had happened.[This is a spy.]I sent the same message to the two. And the reaction was different.[A spy? How did you know?][\u2026 leader Yang was a spy?]Jang Mun-wong asked as if he had expected something like this, but Baek Ryeon-ha seemed shocked. And I told her what had happened.[He sprayed that powder onto my sheath.]I showed it to her, and she sniffed it up close.[The scent is slightly different.]She also noticed this difference right away.I was trained as a spy, so I realized the difference was fine, but how was she doing it?She seemed to be more sensitive to such things.[It was put onto the young master?]She asked in a puzzled voice.I didn\u2019t even expect someone to dare and do such a thing.\u201cThis is frustrating. Even if the enemies are right in front of us, ready to ambush, I cannot even hear the whispers of anything if we are this far away.Jang Mun-wong spoke in a low voice, probably because it was frustrating that the three of them had to speak through voice transmission.His words made sense.I was just trying to be a little more careful.\u201cDid you see it?\u201d\u201cYou must have thought that Leader Yang was a spy because he put the powder on you.\u201d\u201cI had no doubt about it.\u201dNow that I had shown it to them, I didn\u2019t have to convince them anymore. I threw down the sheath from the cliff right away too.-Ah\u2026When the sheath which had been around him for a long time was thrown out, Iron Sword felt sad.If I carry it, my location would be exposed.In any case, if the powder\u2019s scent is used to track us, they will have to enter the rapid currents of the cliff.Meanwhile, Baek Ryeon-ha and Jang Mun-wong looked at each other. Why were they doing this?\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to be like this. We need to retreat quickly.\u201dHearing only the sounds of swords to predict an ambush was something no one would understand. When confronting enemies on a narrow cliff path, it was better to help Hae Ack-chun than fight with a new group.Baek Ryeon-ha said,[Young master. Leader Yang isn\u2019t a spy, ahh\u2026 he is an informant.][Uh?]What did this mean? Not a spy but an informant?[It is hard to say, but he is my unnie\u2019s\u2026]\u2018Unnie?\u2019-\u2026\u2018\u2026!!\u2019I looked to the back before I could even ask her.[What is it?]The sound was getting louder and louder.-They are coming, Wonhwi.Iron Sword warned me. I had thought that the ambushers would wait, but it looked like they were rushing at us, at a fast pace too.\u201cThey are coming.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dAs the enemies got closer, I wondered if Jang Mun-wong sensed them now\u2013\u201cEveryone, retreat! Now!\u201dRumble!The procession, which was moving quietly, now accelerated, and people started to run with the twins in the lead.If we got caught on such a narrow road, it would be very dangerous.\u201cYoung Lady, get into the middle!\u201dAt the words of Jang Mun-wong, she nodded; she was the main person in this procession.The moment she gets caught, everything would have been in vain.\u201cThe upper-rank warriors, step back. Let Young Master and I handle the rear.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dThe best here was Jang Mun-wong and me. The situation had turned quickly.Now the twins were leading ahead, and I had to protect the rear.[Cho Sung-won!][Lord?]I called Cho Sung-won, who was the best of the trainees ranked recently, and I urged him to protect the center of the procession.He was the guy who knew the reliable martial arts of the Beggars Union and was probably the best of the first-rate warriors here.\u201cHurry!\u201dAt the cry of Jang Mun-wong, the procession speeded up. However, at this speed, it would be impossible to resist the pursuit of the enemies.At least we had to get out of this valley for now.-Too late.Short Sword said in a low voice. I knew it too.-\u2026The swords\u2019 sounds were getting close, and I could see black masked men approaching us from behind. They seemed to number around forty or so.\u2018Masks?\u2019That was strange. Why wear masks?Normally visitors would wear a mask so that others would not know they were coming into the Blood Sect. Yet, these people were out here to kill us\u2026 so why wear masks?\u201cKuak.\u201dA groan escaped from the mouth of Jang Mun-wong, who looked at them.The number of people was smaller than before, but each of them seemed to be skilled. In particular, the two people at the forefront looked intimidating.One person had a strangely massive ax, and looked horrendous. The other seemed to be a fist user and was tall.Smaller than Hae Ack-chun, but they were much bigger than normal people.\u2018What should I do?\u2019I think I will need to stay back with the upper-rank warriors and stop them. Based on our speed now, if we continued to run, we would get overrun.\u2018What!\u2019\u201cCommander!\u201dJang Mun-wong looked back at me,\u201cThis! The upper-ranked warriors, stop and protect the rear!\u201dThe masked men seemed like they would throw their spears. And it seemed like they could inflict enough damage to take us down.The giant person also grabbed a spear and was ready to throw it.Papak!The men were ready to throw the spear, but it seemed unreasonable for me even to try and block all of them.Maybe just two or three could be blocked by me.Pat!I held my sword in both hands and looked at the flying spear. The moment it reached me, I swung my sword to cut it downChang!A spear was cut down. Then two more spears were cut, and one barely bounced back.Chachachang!The sound of the others blocking spears could be heard. The spears came infused with internal energy, so not all of them could be blocked.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dThe two warriors with us were killed. One was hit in the stomach and the other on the thigh, but both of them would lose their mobility.But that wasn\u2019t the problem right now. The spear from the giant fist user was different.Swish!I could tell it was different from the sound it made slicing through the air. Even if I used all of my strength, I wasn\u2019t confident in stopping it.\u201cEveryone move!\u201dJang Mun-wong stepped forward as he was the only one who could stop this.Swish!Jang Mun-wong blocked the front of the spear which came, and as soon as the spear came, he grabbed it, but just as he was doing this\u2013Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe spear suddenly pushed through and pierced the right side of his chest. And it made the guy bounce back.Papapak!\u201cEuk!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201dThe warriors behind tried to hold him, but they also fell backward because of the massive force.It was such a terrifying technique that it was unbelievable. With a single throw, he had made sure that the first-rate warriors fell down.Thanks to that, the retreating people stopped.\u201cHaa\u2026 haaa\u2026\u201dPak!Jang Mun-wong pulled out the spear, which was lodged in his shoulder, and he then touched his blood points there.-Such a monster!I didn\u2019t need to be told that; I already knew it. This was the worst possible situation.If just one spear from that guy could do this, then what would happen if more people came over with such strength?Meanwhile, they had reached where we were. And I looked at the side of the cliff.\u2018Should I risk my life?\u2019The only way to survive in this situation was on this cliff.It was so far away that the odds of surviving were too low, but there was a glimmer of hope. Or maybe I should fight for my life?Could we break through even when they had the number advantage and still let Baek Ryeon-ha escape? Even when we used the others to fight and try and delay them?-Why don\u2019t you just run away? Why do you have to care about them?Ah\u2026.At Short Sword\u2019s words, I realized something. It was as if I had become one with the Blood Sect.If there was any difference, I should be giving my life priority. It was then that a masked man shouted with an ax in hand.\u201cDo you have a girl named Baek Ryeon-ha in here?\u201d\u2018Baek Ryeon-ha?\u2019Surprisingly, the one they were aiming for was Baek Ryeon-ha. The procession all went stiff at this loud question.The man with the mask continued,\u201cIf you don\u2019t have her here, I will kill you all. And if you do have her, then give her to me, and I will let you all live.\u201dAt those words, the eyes of the upper-rank warriors changed.Is there anyone who would stand out for someone who was supposed to be the next leader? But wasn\u2019t one now?\u201cOh. I guess my prediction was right. She is here.\u201dThe masked man was convinced that Baek Ryeon-ha was here.Looking at his attitude, it looked like his target was her, but I wasn\u2019t sure if he would stop after getting his target.\u201cIf the girl is here, give her to me!\u201dThe giant man who was next to the axed man yelled.Judging by the way he voiced it, he seemed to be a skilled man. Even the upper-rank warriors seemed to be pressured by it.However, no one here could walk away.Clench!Everyone clenched their hands.\u2018\u2026\u2019Looking at them, it seemed that they were ready to risk their lives to protect her, even if it meant dying here.It was meaningless to run away from such people, but man, they looked so loyal.Because of this, the Murim Alliance must be trying to put in their spies. I looked at Jang Mun-wong holding his wound.He, too, was ready to fight.\u2018\u2026\u2019I decided to talk to him.[Commander.]He looked at me with puzzled eyes.[\u2026 if I run out of time, Commander take the Young Lady and run.][Young master!]He looked wide-eyed at me.-Yah! What are you saying?Short Sword yelled at me.\u2018Enough. I will jump down the cliff.\u2019This was a dire situation. If only to complete the task that Hae Ack-chun entrusted to me, I would risk my life for this.Isn\u2019t the chance of survival greater for jumping off the cliff than fighting them?-PhewOne of the masked men said,\u201cSir. We don\u2019t have time. If that doesn\u2019t work, we were told to kill them all, so let\u2019s just kill them and get what\u2026\u201dSh!I stepped ahead right then.All eyes of both enemy and allies were focused on me.The friendly side was shocked, and the masked people were wary.Tak!I looked at them and said,\u201cThe seniors here don\u2019t belong to the Murim Alliance, so why are you trying to hurt us?\u201dAs I spoke, I heard a mumble from behind. Naturally, everyone must have thought that these people were on the side of the Alliance.But I had other thoughts. And the masked man with ax said,\u201cHuh. What nonsense is that? We are the people of the Murim Alliance.\u201dThe man denied my words.\u201cThen why do you say that we can get saved if we give up \u2018Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019?\u201dIt didn\u2019t make sense. The Purpose of the Alliance is to take down the Blood Sect.Their goal was to annihilate everyone within it, not just the possible leaders.\u201cYou must be the nonsense spewing kind!\u201dThe combat side man yelled at him. Fortunately, I had experience with Hae Ack-chun so I was used to this.\u201cThe people of the Murim Alliance are scattered all over the mountain, and it seems like you don\u2019t care.\u201dAs the masked man was reminded of the situation,I spoke,\u201cThen what do you mean? You must be fine with wasting time here like the other people of the alliance, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe masked man frowned at my question.I guess he didn\u2019t expect such a thing. Seeing their eyes become wary, they seemed to be clear of the danger they were in.Provoking them wouldn\u2019t be good, but I had no choice but to draw their attention.\u201cOne of the people on our side used the Thousand Miles Chasing Fragrance on us. But it seemed like the scent was different from the one which was used by the spy who sprinkled it in the mountain.\u201dHearing this, the masked man\u2019s eyes lit up. They must have been surprised that I could distinguish between the two scents.As a spy for 8 years, this wasn\u2019t a difficult task.\u201cThat alone doesn\u2019t convince us that we aren\u2019t from the alliance, you idiot.\u201dThe masked man with the ax laughed at me,\u201cAt first, I thought that the other man must also be a spy. But if you think about it like this, that doesn\u2019t seem to be true. Especially when he led us right into this valley.\u201dIf I hadn\u2019t met them here, I wouldn\u2019t have ever had this thought, but then leader Yang was in our team and directed us right into them.\u201cIs that person the one senior sent as a spy?\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dThe masked man didn\u2019t deny my words. He must have thought that there was no need to hide it.Because anyway, we were rats who fell into the trap, so the man shouted,\u201cNow that you know there are spies within you, do you know that we can find her if we want to?\u201dHe was trying to make our side suspicious of each other.\u201cThat\u2019s something to be thankful for.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThanks to you, we know that we no longer have a spy on our side. All because of your consideration.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf there were others, you would have found her right away. They would have told you.\u201dAt my words, the masked man\u2019s eyes shone.The more he talked, the more he must have realized he was falling into a mess. So he spoke with a voice that showed his killing intent.\u201cYou seem to be a master at using your mouth. I will kill you first.\u201dAs soon as the ax man said that, one of the masked men threw their spear at me. It wasn\u2019t difficult to avoid at this distance, but I shouted.\u201cDid Baek Hye-hyang or someone order you?\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The movement of the man throwing spar went still at my question. Of course, it did.I was already convinced that it was Baek Hye-hyang who ordered them. Otherwise, it was strange for the spy to be a leader of the Six Blood Valley, but what confirmed it was the fact that this location we were brought to didn\u2019t have a single member of the Murim Alliance here.All because the target was one person.\u201cFrom Young Lady Baek Hye-hyang?\u201dNoises rose behind.Perhaps because they didn\u2019t imagine that one from the Blood Sect would actually do such a thing.\u201cKill him!\u201dThe man shouted. I hurriedly stopped trying to talk and raised my innate qi.Shh! Pak!I caught the spear that was thrown at me, and the masked man\u2019s eyes widened.It was natural to be surprised to find a young boy they had met for the first time able to catch a spear of a first-rate warrior.\u201cI will give this back to you.\u201dPak!I threw the spear back to the masked man, and I cried.\u201cEveryone run!\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha would have fled also, so saving the others\u2019 lives was a good deal. At that moment, the masked man lightly held the spear I threw. And as if he wanted to kill me, he threw the spear back with his amazing strength.\u2018Shit!\u2019I wasn\u2019t here without knowing anything, and I knew I would be able to save my life.It was that moment.Pak! Rumble!The end of the spear point stopped right in front of my nose, and the blade vibrated.Why did the spear stop?\u201cYoung master. Thank you.\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019The voice from behind was Baek Ryeon-ha. I told her to run, so why!\u201cThis kid is pretty good.\u201d\u2018And what was this voice?\u2019I looked to the side with trembling eyes. A masked man was holding the spear right next to me.I would have lost my life if this masked man didn\u2019t stop it.Pak!He took off his mask as if it felt irritating, and to my surprise, he was the Second Elder, Seo Kalma.\u201cUh\u2026. Elder, how?\u201dHe should have been on the northeast side of the mountain, so why was he here?But that wasn\u2019t the end.\u201cThanks to the young master, we have been able to confirm there are no other ambushes happening.\u201dAnother person came and stood next to me.There was a man on, but I could tell who it was from the voice. It was Han Baekha.\u2018Ha!\u2019I was a bit too shocked.Didn\u2019t this mean that they had lied and hidden up to this point? The atmosphere changed in an instant when the second elder and Han Baekha appeared.The morale of the side that was ready to risk their lives had changed.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cWe were tricked!\u201dWith two skilled people of the sect coming here, the masked people grasped the situation.No matter how strong they were, they could not go against an elder and a Blood Star of the sect.The masked man with no weapons shouted,\u201cRetreat!\u201dHe decided that they were at a disadvantage and tried to retreat. But then\u2013Papat!A form. Walking upright from the top of the cliff, it was sliding down at a great speed and blocked the path of retreat for these masked men.Thud!A huge man who made these masked men look like kids.It was Hae Ack-chun.In one hand of Hae Ack-chun was a middle-aged man with his tongue hanging down.I could even hear the blood dripping from it.The masked man who was in the lead to run mumbled,\u201c\u2026Ghastly Monster.\u201d\u201cDo you think you can survive now?\u201dCheck!Hae Ack-chun ripped his shirt off, ready to fight. His body was dyed in a deep copper color.\u201cHuh! If you want to pass from me, you will have to give your lives.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - The Trap (2)The masked men felt so lost with Hae Ack-chun in front of them like a huge giant ready to stomp on them, and they all stopped.Of course, not everyone was terrified, and the courageous masked man swung his sword toward Hae Ack-chun.\u201cHuh!\u201dPat!At that moment, Hae Ack-chun grabbed the sword that the man had wielded.\u201cKuahaha! Feels so good!\u201d\u201cEik!\u2019The bewildered man who had his sword caught kicked at him, but Hae Ack-chun grabbed his body and threw it to the floor.Bang!\u201cKuak!\u201dAfter only being thrown down once, his face already looked so smashed up. I had already seen this so many times.As Hae Ack-chun pounded the poor guy back and forth, his body went limp.\u201cHuh? No fun!\u201dHae Ack-chun snorted and threw the masked man off the cliff.Even when their own colleague was killed like this, not a single person on his side walked forward. That was how great the presence of Hae Ack-chun was.-Oh man, he is like a beast.And it was right.Hae Ack-chun, who tore his top off, was like a beast out to hunt. A true beast.So even the enemies who wanted to run couldn\u2019t run due to his intimidation. He just looked invincible now.So how great does the South Heavenly Swordsman have to be to make such a man lose?-\u2026 I don\u2019t know. If my former master were alive, I doubt he wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same thing now.Iron Sword spoke honestly.Looking at Hae Ack-chun who had grown so much over the last 15 years, even Iron Sword had acknowledged it.And the heaviest man on the masked men\u2019s side stepped ahead.-The giant wants to go against another giant.This masked man had no weapon, which meant that he should be a close combat warrior. And he was tall enough to make an average man look small.But Hae Ack-chun was even bigger than him.\u201cGhastly Monster. You are as great as the name suggests.\u201d\u201cAre you my next opponent?\u201d\u201cI never liked being compared to you, but fine. I will try\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish his words, Hae Ack-chun moved in front of him with agile movements.\u201cToo rushed.\u201dSurprisingly, the masked man stepped back. Hae Ack-chun stepped forward, and his fist flew.Bang!The moment they both collided with fists, a huge sound ran. And there was a wind pushing us back.A groan escaped from the masked man, and his body was pushed back.\u201cKuak.\u201dThe masked man who was pushed back lifted his fist and hurriedly went for Hae Ack-chun and once again, their fists collided.\u201cKuahahaha!\u201dHae Ack-chun would occasionally laugh despite the fight and wasn\u2019t losing his balance at all.Papak!It looked like a simple movement, but there were so many movements within it.The fists which collided were constantly flying out.Pak!Hae Ack-chun blocked any other jabs which came and then kicked at his ribs.\u201cKua!\u2019Such a shocking blow that even I could hear the bones breaking.It was painful, but in that state, the masked man used his left fist to hit Hae Ack-chun.Puak!Hae Ack-chun wiped his face slightly with his hand. In the meantime, the masked man had managed to lengthen the distance between them\u2026\u2018Amazing.\u2019I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off this fight. Although he was one step behind Hae Ack-chun, the masked man also possessed great strength which couldn\u2019t be looked down on.Clench!There was a slight crack on the floor where the masked man had retreated to and where he currently stood. He was releasing the qi hit into him by Hae Ack-chun through his feet.\u201cHe seems to have gotten stronger in the time I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201dThe second elder, Seo Kalma, who was standing next to me, exclaimed in admiration.He, too, seems to be surprised by Hae Ack-chun\u2019s power.He was praising him, but why was I feeling proud? It was then someone stepped ahead,\u201cI would like to thank the seniors.\u201dIt was Baek Ryeon-ha.I thought she would be hiding behind, but she spoke with pride in her voice, and some masked people who were blocked by Hae Ack-chun turned.Baek Ryeon-ha shouted at them.\u201cIf you are the ones who were sent by my sister, who has nothing to do with us, then I don\u2019t mind accepting your surrender even now. And if you tell us who gave the order directly from your mouth, we guarantee your safety.\u201dI was a bit shocked and thought she wasn\u2019t smart. But it was probably she who let this plan happen.-She dug this trap?\u2018Yes.\u2019It is a trap that deceived even her allies.-It would have been nice if she let us know.\u2018It must have been an urgent situation, and they let only a few people know of this.\u2019Perhaps the people who knew this were Hae Ack-hun, Seo Kalma, Han Baekha\u2026 and commander Jang Mun-wong. Since there might be another person working for Baek Hye-hyang in the group, they didn\u2019t try giving the information to the other disciples.-Amazing sisters.Short Sword clicked her tongue.I had the same thoughts as her. Baek Hye-hyang plotted this using her powers. Baek Ryeon-ha, who had realized this, laid out her own trap.-That fox didn\u2019t look that smart from the start. It just seemed like she had the personality to suppress people by force.If that was the case, there would have been someone who played the role of her aide and laid the plan out for her.We need to know who that person was as they seemed to have a stronger intention to take Baek Ryeon-ha down from the race.-But do you know?\u2018What?\u2019-Even you, who guessed this based on the circumstances happening, aren\u2019t a dumb one.I wasn\u2019t that great. Anyone could guess what had happened. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201cThis will be my last advice to seniors. If you do not surrender, it ends with death.\u201dAt her words, the masked man with ax in hand yelled,\u201cJust because we are silent, you are making fun of us!\u201d\u201cEuk!\u201dHis roaring voice was like a wolf crying out, making my ears hurt. And shouting here means that the voice would echo around.When the situation turned unfavorable, this guy seemed to lose his mind.\u201cYou are as disgusting as you can get. If this is the case, it seems like we will have to deal with you quickly and capture just a few before we leave.\u201dSeo Kalma also had the same thoughts as me, and Baek Ryeon-ha nodded at it.\u201cCheeky things! Let\u2019s see who will die! Come at us!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAt the shout of the masked man with the ax, the masked men turned towards us.Things went bad, so it looked like they wanted to have a fight with us, leaving Hae Ack-chun with his fight; everyone now concentrated on Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cSixth Blood Star. Protect the lady!\u201dSeo Kalma asked Han Baekha to be with her just in case. She also accepted it without another thought.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI will take care of the guy with the ax. Someone give me a weapon.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201dA warrior turned his crescent blade to Seo Kalma. It didn\u2019t seem like they brought their weapons as they were hiding behind us, so any sword from the members would do.He swung the weapon a couple of times, and it began to sound like he was getting used to it.\u201cCommander Jang. Can you move?\u201d\u201cI am all fine, Elder.\u201dSeo Kalma, who confirmed the condition of Jang Mun-wong, aimed forward and took command.\u201cWarriors all follow me to cut down the enemy!\u2019Phat!Seo Kalma moved first.The middle and upper-rank warriors, all full of fighting spirit from the call, bravely followed behind the man.And despite being injured, Commander Jang Mun-wong was at the forefront, ready to take down the enemies.Papak!In an instant, the swords of both sides clashed.Interestingly, both sides had masks on, so it was a bit of a hassle. The masks were different, but with all the fast movements, it was difficult to know who was an ally and who was the enemy.\u2018Man.\u2019I decided to move to the middle.It seemed like it would be good to be there to show off the right skills. After all, the attention would be drawn from there.Chachachang!Seo Kalma and the masked man with the ax collided. And the masked man with the ax seemed like he could hold his ground.While swinging the big ax, he was able to block the path of Seo Kalma. And in this situation, it might not be good for us\u2026Puak!\u201cKuak!Now I had to deal with my own enemies.I stabbed one in the neck and then aimed for the other. It is good to do what I can after such a long time of inaction.Papapapk!I was the first to deal with the masked people and aimed for their vital points. My tactics all worked fine.As we kept removing one after another, the masked men on the enemy side began to get pushed back.\u201cThat guy! Kill that one with the rusty sword!\u201d\u201cTake him down!\u201dI got caught.I guess I extended my lead a bit too much and now got noticed by the enemy. Because of that, two to three people rushed to me.\u2018Returning Dragon Sword.\u2019I quickly decided to use this technique, the Returning Dragon Sword.Holding the sword at a different angle, I rotated my body which moved like the wind and deflected the swords of the masked men.Chachachang!\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThese masked men were unable to hide their shock, which had come from the sword technique they had just witnessed. But why would I care?Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dWhile they were too shocked by my sword technique, the warriors on our side aimed for their heads. During these close-range fights, if one loses focus, they lose their life.And gradually, the enemies began to dwindle in number, and of the 40 masked men, only three were extremely skilled.The rest were a mix of first-rate and second-rate warriors.Papak!Even though injured, Jang Mun-woong was actively performing in the lead. As I expected, he was amazingly strong.Among the masked men, there were those who appeared to be experts, but he was overpowering them with just one hand.\u2018The ones remaining\u2026\u2019There were only 10 enemies left now. Fortunately, they were first-rate warriors who had been through hell.At that moment, the violent sounds of clashing could be heard with two people fighting.It was Seo Kalma and the masked man with an ax. Chang!\u2018Amazing.\u2019Seo Kalma was also showing amazing resistance. His nickname was Guardian, and he managed to overwhelm the dominant strikes of the masked man.The masked man seemed too hurried to take after his safety.\u2018As expected from one of the venerable people.\u2019It wasn\u2019t for nothing that they were given the title of the Four Venerable Dignitaries.At that time, one of the masked men on the enemy side threw the spear at Seo Kalma, who was waiting in the air.I immediately moved and went up, managing to deflect the spear that the masked man had thrown.Clang!In the end, if Seo Kalma was at risk, I had to do something.And this idea of trying to interfere in the fight between two was very like any Unorthodox Sects.Since one was in the middle of a fight, we could take them down.\u201cYou! Over and over again!\u201dThe masked man who threw the spear grunted at me. And it was then\u2013Chachachang!A huge force.Two masters were fighting, and their weapons clashed violently, hoping for the other to die. If anyone made a mistake here, then their heads would be the next to fly.\u2018Ah!\u2019Little by little, the ax of the masked man started to show dull and irregular movements. Noticing this, Seo Kalma would not miss this chance, and he deflected the ax and pierced through it!Puak! Thud!Seo Kalma, who cut off the hand of the opponent first, didn\u2019t miss the chance.Slash!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe masked man with his wrist cut fell to the floor, and Seo Kalma landed down safely.\u201cIt is finished.\u201dNow was the time to slice the throat.Pak!The man who was kneeling threw something out.It was an assassin needle.When he, who was about to die, had decided to throw it with internal qi infused, it wasn\u2019t normal.\u201cYou!\u201dChachachang!Seo Kalma had to hurriedly wield his blade to block the needle, and without missing this gap, the masked man turned and ran somewhere.Pat!And that was to where Baek Ryeon-ha was.\u201cWho said you could go!\u201dAs he ran, Han Baekha blocked him by standing in front of Baek Ryeon-ha with her hands dyed red, already prepared for such moves.Being prepared in advance meant having an advantage.With his wrist cut off and injured, there was nothing he could defend himself with. But then an unexpected thing happened.Phat!The guy who was aiming for Baek Ryeon-ha suddenly changed his direction and came for me.\u201cTis!\u201dSeo Kalma ran to prevent this, but the distance between everyone was too wide.Thinking that I could not avoid him, I began to think about using the Xing Ming Sword technique\u2019s ultimate technique, the Chasing Slasher Sword.The sword technique, which rotated violently, moved forward.Even if the masked man was a first-rate warrior who managed to escape from so many people, he could not possibly block this technique with only his hands, especially with only one working hand.But again, he did something unexpected.\u201cKuak!\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019Iron Sword simply pierced his chest without a fight.\u2018Was it intentional?\u2019At that time, the masked man who grabbed the stabbing Iron Sword got closer and wrapped his severed arm around my neck.And said,\u201cA rusted sword. You are the disciple of Ghastly Monster, So Wonhwi.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019This guy knew my name.\u201cH-how do you know me?\u201dI pretended to look shocked and carefully went for Short Sword.But before I could reach it.\u201cYou will pay the price for disturbing our movement. Let\u2019s die together.\u201dPat!The masked man who grabbed me by the neck jumped off the cliff.\u201cNooooo!\u201d\u201cYoung Masterrrrr!\u201dThe shouts of Seo Kalma and Baek Ryeon-ha echoed in my ears at the same time as I was already falling down.Swish!Dying together made the guy speak as if he had won.\u201cKulkul. You should have never done that, little guy.\u201dClench!\u201cKuak!\u201dPerhaps he had no intention of letting me go; he kept clenching my neck, making me feel like I would die of strangulation before falling down.At that moment, I pulled out Short Sword and stabbed him in the side of the lungs.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe endured the stab to the chest, but the stab to the lungs was too much, making him loosen his grip.I immediately pushed him away.\u201cYouuuu!\u201dIn anger, he struggled and tried to catch me, but his hands were easy to avoid.I knew that this would have been a huge risk if he hadn\u2019t been this wounded.-Catch me!Iron Sword yelled, and I immediately pulled out the sword lodged in that man\u2019s chest.\u201cKukak!\u201d\u201cYou die!\u201dI stabbed him again in the head, and he tried to block with his arm, but Iron Sword still managed to pierce him.Puak!There wasn\u2019t even a scream. He was looking at me with a shocked face which soon turned into a dead one.At this moment\u2013Paaak! Thud!\u2018Kuak!\u2019I could feel that the guy\u2019s bones shattered as he fell. I didn\u2019t even know why I was focusing on him, but I watched as he fell down.Falling from this height must be something he would never recover from.Wooong!My body also began to speed up, and I soon hit the body of water, slipping below the surface. As I began to be swept away by the torrents, I began to float up.Perhaps due to the training I had, I was able to stay awake all the while, but due to the shock of falling from such a high height, my body wouldn\u2019t move.-Wonhwi! Get yourself together!-You cannot let us go!In the midst of this, Iron Sword and Short Sword told me not to let go of them in this harsh current.Fortunately, I didn\u2019t, as my body was too stiff to let go of them.I was worried that being dragged down by this current, I would probably die at some point.Puak!My body was sinking.I could feel the water pushing itself into my mouth and nose, making me sure that I should die when innate qi began to surge up.Pound!Once again, my heart began to pound, and the once stopped flow of innate qi began to happen again.My stiff body began to move little by little.I groaned in pain as I tried to make myself more stable. But that wasn\u2019t easy when being swept away by the water force.I reached out like a crazy person wanting to live, and it was this moment.Grab!Something was around my wrist.\u2018Uh?\u2019Swish! Ppat!At that moment, my body, which was being pulled into the currents, came out of the current.I looked at what was around my waist, but I could faintly only feel it.But I was certain some kind of force was pulling me up.Papak!Thanks to my body being pulled, my body had touched the currents a couple of times and then got dragged somewhere.It was a cave in the valley. And someone seemed to be pulling me into it.Pak!And my body entered the cave with force, making me roll on the floor.After a few rounds, the strength in my body went down, and someone grabbed me by the shoulder.Tak!Who could have saved me?\u201cHuk\u2026. Huk\u2026 cough!\u201dI was coughing up the water. Even in the midst of the frenzy, the moment I lifted my head up, I couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.\u2018\u2026.!?\u2019It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that there were only bones left of this being.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - The Monster Being In The Cave (1)For a moment, I was so surprised that I couldn\u2019t even say thank you.The horror that was this monster in front of me was so terrifying that it couldn\u2019t be described in words. The bare face looked so skeleton-like, so pale as if it had never seen the light, and veins clearly visible through their skin.Besides, there was no hair on the body at all.-\u2026 no one could be a match for this.Even Short Sword clicked her tongue out at this appearance. It was a face anyone would feel intimidated by.When such a person looked at me with his yellow teeth exposed and laughed, I could only get more scared.\u2018Ah!\u2019But there was something more surprising.I didn\u2019t know because of the face but this being didn\u2019t have legs. Even the right arm was just to the elbow. Does that mean that with such a crippled body and only left arm it brought me in?\u201cKuakak.\u201dThe monster let out an unusual laugh, its voice was hoarse like metal scraping together. And as I coughed up all the water inside me, I got up to greet him.\u201cThank you for helping me, Elder.\u201dFrom the forehead and cheeks which looked wrinkled, he seemed to be someone around 60 years old. And he looked similar to Hae Ack-chun.The monster raised his hand.-Look at its nails.Short Sword trembled as it was said. The nails on the hand were too long, like some kind of clawed weapon.It looked like the nails had been sharpened like that.Shh!With the fear of being stabbed with it, I tried to avoid them, but the monster traced my cheek and then he smiled as he said,\u201cYour flesh is fresh and plump.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019What did this being say? I was too shocked when Iron Sword told me.-Wonhwi don\u2019t be too shocked and look down.At that, I carefully looked down and at that moment I felt my heart die.Numerous bone fragments were scattered at the bottom of the cave, all human bones.In the middle, I could see some fish bones too, but they weren\u2019t many.-I think you need to get out. This is dangerous.-He might just eat you like this.I was thinking the same thing. Even if I wanted to think positively the situation all pointed to me being eaten.Otherwise, such a number of bones couldn\u2019t possibly be here. The monster looked at me and licked his lips.\u201cLooks delicious.\u201dShit.What I thought was coming true. Thinking that I might get eaten by it, I hurriedly swung my sword at the being.It was fortunate that I had Iron Sword in my hand.Pak!At that moment, I felt too shocked. It was a surprise attack, but the monster caught my sword with its bare hands.It wasn\u2019t the internal qi of the lower dantian but from the middle one.\u201cKuak!\u201dPapak!\u201cUgh!\u201dAt that time, the monster struck my wrist and took away the sword and threw it at the wall of the cave.-This!Puak!The sword penetrated almost halfway into the cave wall. It took amazing strength to do that.And it didn\u2019t end there, the monster grabbed my wrist and tried to break it.\u2018Kuak!\u2019I hurriedly aimed for its neck with Short Sword, who was in my left hand. But the monster tilted its head, avoided the sword, and pulled something with his right arm, which was only a stub after the elbow.Grasp!At that moment, Short Sword in my left hand got pulled into it.\u201cUh?\u201dThere was something wrapped around its wrist. Previously I was so shocked by the incident that I couldn\u2019t see it, but it was a fine thread.-Wonhwi, cut it off!At Short Sword\u2019s cry, I bent my wrist and tried to cut the thread.Chang!\u2018What?\u2019But it wasn\u2019t a normal thread. Even though there was no strength behind it, the sword should have sliced right through it. But, despite the fact that I tried to do it, the thread didn\u2019t get cut.\u201cKulkul.\u201dPak!And the monster grabbed my neck and pulled me in tightly. I tried to hold on, but the strength it had was far greater than mine.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe monster who pulled me in opened his mouth wide and shoved his teeth into my left shoulder.Crack!\u201cKuaak!\u201dAs the teeth dug into my flesh, it felt like my whole body went stiff. Frustrated at the thought of being eaten alive, I grabbed Short Sword with my left hand and tried to break away from him.However, the reaction of this monster was as fast as a ghost. The monster pulled out its teeth to avoid being hit and broke my right hand which was holding Short Sword.Crack!\u201cAck!\u201dMy wrist was clearly broken. It looked like it was a compound fracture, seeing how the bone bulged out.\u201cDo not resist, Meat.\u201dThis skinny monster smiled at me. Damn, this monster was using humans as his meal?The monster opened his mouth again and tried to bite me again, but then\u2014-\u2026 Wonhwi!A faint voice.It was heard through even the sound of the water splashing outside.-Such a crazy old man!Short Sword recognised the voice right away.-\u2026 that damned disciple!One after another, the shouts could be heard from outside and without even thinking, I decided to scream to announce my location.\u201cSh\u2026\u201dPak!The monster hit me on the head, and I felt my vision turn to black.-Wonhwi! Wonhwi!-Yah! Wake up! Wake up!Loud noises echoed in the mind. It was the voice of Iron Sword and Short Sword. Did I faint?-You are awake!As I was about to open my eyes, Short Sword suddenly shouted,-Do not open your eyes! Keep acting.I stopped opening my eyes. I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was told not to open them.Ah!I suddenly remembered my teacher. I should have told him I was alive but I was hit in the head and passed out.My head where I was hit still hurts. And I felt something sticky on the head which probably seemed like blood.My broken wrist felt painful.-We have to wait for the time when the monster is careless. Stay still.\u2018\u2026. Okay.\u2019For now, I followed what Short Sword told me.The sound of water resonated through the cave, so I couldn\u2019t tell where the monster was.Why was such a monster even in this place?-After you passed out, that monster acted all weird.\u2018What do you mean?\u2019-He dragged you as you passed out inside and he went to the corner of the cave and he held his breath like he was terrified.\u2018Even now?\u2019-Yes. He is still in the corner.\u2018Why is he doing this?\u2019I couldn\u2019t understand. Could it be that the location of the cave would be discovered?There was no reason for it to go to a corner.But even if its body wasn\u2019t strong, it had the most absurd strength, so why tremble in fear?-I don\u2019t know. He has been doing it for half a day already.Half a day? That is why the place felt dark.Even if one\u2019s eyelids were shut, one could know if it was bright or dark outside.\u2018And the old man?\u2019This was the most important thing.-\u2026 don\u2019t be disappointed; we heard the shouts for a long time but not for a while now.Iron Sword\u2019s words made me lose hope. In the end, I would have to get out of here all on my own.I wasn\u2019t even sober enough to handle what just happened before passing out. Now, all this felt too desperate.So let\u2019s summarize this.The monster has only a left arm, but it was good with it. It was difficult to judge, but if he was normal, like a human, he would be on the same level as Hae Ack-chun.However, looking at the situation, it seemed that he wasn\u2019t fine.His tone was slurred and he was hiding in the dark and shivering, so he didn\u2019t have a healthy mind.-Obviously the monster will eat you.-Aim for that time.They were thinking about the same thing as me. For now, that was the only way out.In the left hand was a thread still tied to my hand.\u2018Phew.\u2019Calm down. I carefully touched my innate qi.I tried to check if the monster sealed any blood points, but it didn\u2019t.Just made me faint? If he was reasonable, he should have done that to me first. Maybe he didn\u2019t know how to do this.\u2018One hit.\u2019I had to take him down with just one hit. To do that, I will have to aim for the main points.And the most effective would be the chest, thigh, or neck.The part will differ based on how he positions himself.-Wait. I will let you know when it moves.The time that passed as I waited made the blood near my head go dry.One, two, three hours\u2026I could feel my body begin to stiffen as I continued to wait for it in a tense state.-It is moving!Short Sword told me. Since it didn\u2019t have legs, I could hear scratching sounds as it dragged itself.It was getting closer and closer, and my heart beat faster. If I missed this chance, I would be eaten.-Almost there.The closer it got, the more obvious its movement felt.Tak!It groaned and crawled to my chest, and it was heavy because all its weight was bearing down on my body.I felt goosebumps rise.\u201cMeat\u2026 meat\u2026.\u201dThis was my first time experiencing such a horrifying thing, both in the past and now.His breathing was clearly audible to me.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201d-It opened its mouth. It might bite you.Short Sword exclaimed. If I aimed now, it would notice.At the moment, the teeth dug to the top of the right clavicle.It was painful, so I raised my innate qi and then aimed at the right rib. It seemed to have noticed and grabbed my right hand.\u2018Kuak.\u2019My broken wrist hurt much, but this was the time.As soon as it grabbed my right hand, I closed my left hand and smashed at the center of his forehead with all my might.\u201cKuaaaal!\u201dThe monster went mad and screamed.Damn it, what happened? I hit it in the right spot, so why didn\u2019t it die!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dThe screaming monster pushed me away with one hand and rolled to the ground. Now was the chance.\u2018Where are you?\u2019-Here!Iron Sword told me where he was, and I moved right there and pulled him out. And swung the sword at it, but it was then.Pak!\u2019Damn it!The monster suddenly moved to the other side, making my attack deviate. Realizing I couldn\u2019t hit him with the sword, I kicked him in the face, but then he grabbed my foot with his left hand.Pak!And he shoved me with the caught foot, making my body rise up and crash down!Bang!\u201cKuak!\u201dAs I bumped two times, I fell limp, and the monster came up on my back and grabbed me by the neck.Damn, I might fail this way. At this moment, a monster\u2019s voice could be heard in my ear.\u201cYou, what is this? How did you learn to use innate qi?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019These weren\u2019t the slurred words like before; it spoke with clear words.How did this thing even know about the innate qi?Innate qi wasn\u2019t something which could be detected by infusing internal energy.Grab!\u201cCough!It grabbed me by the neck more tightly.\u201cCan you not speak\u2026 now? That sword\u2026 isn\u2019t that the South Heavenly Iron Sword?\u201dWhat?Just who is this? He recognised the sword despite it being rusted?Maybe if he knew the South Heavenly Swordsman, then he would know it, but I didn\u2019t know who he was, so I stayed silent.Still, this could be my way out. He can even speak normally here.\u201cI\u2026 I am the successor for the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201d\u201cWhat? His successor?\u201d\u2018His?\u2019Could this guy be an enemy? From the way he spoke, it seemed like it.\u201cHuk!\u201dWhat?Is he crying?-H\u2026 he is crying.Short sword said, unable to understand him. I thought he was an enemy, but he was crying at the mention of this man?The monster continued to sob as if overcome by emotions.This is insane.How long do I have to be held by the nape of the neck?The monster who cried for a long time suppressed his emotions and said,\u201cWeird. So weird. Senior\u2026 this doesn\u2019t understand\u2026 what you are saying\u2026 I guess this is fate.\u201dTak!The monster took its hands away from my nape, and then it came down from the back.He didn\u2019t seem to want to fight anymore. Not being careless, I stood up.Even though the monster had no legs, it sat properly and looked at me.If he was a madman before, now he was a watcher. I felt so curious about him.\u201c\u2026 senior, isn\u2019t it disrespectful to not introduce yourself to junior?\u201dThe monster sighed at my question,\u201cI am Han Jisang.\u201d\u2018Han Jisang?\u2019I felt like I had heard the name before, but not at the same time.Who is this?I was puzzled when Iron Sword replied,-No! How is he still alive?\u2018What are you saying? You know him?\u2019Even the reaction seemed a bit serious. And he said to me like he was biting his teeth.-The Slaughtering King!\u2018\u2026 Slaughtering King?!\u2019I was shocked. This skinny monster was that Slaughtering King?-Why are you so shocked?Short Sword who didn\u2019t know about it wondered. She told me her former owner was a warrior, but she knew nothing.He was called the Slaughtering King.The King of Slayers.-There seems to be something. Was he so great?It was words. As far as I knew, he is a legendary man who killed many and excelled at killing techniques.-Exceeded the normal abilities of killing techniques?He was no ordinary man.His martial arts were widely known to be excellent, and that was what had made him famous. Unfortunately, he got called a murderer later in life.He targeted the Eight Great Warriors. And he wasn\u2019t referred to with that horrendous title for nothing.Naturally, he couldn\u2019t kill the Eight Great Warriors.However, the Slaughtering King was one who managed to live despite many attacks on his life.-Wonhwi. This guy\u2026 is a coward who likes hitting one in the back of the head. You can never believe him.At that time, Iron Sword warned me with anger.What the hell happened for Iron Sword to react like this?As I wondered, something happened.Tak!Han Jisang suddenly fell on his face. And spoke with a determined voice.\u201cSuccessor of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman. Please let me pay back my debt.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why he was saying it. But the warning of Iron Sword was still fresh in my mind, so I didn\u2019t answer.Still, wasn\u2019t he looking like this?\u201cSenior. Your younger one does not know what you are talking about. If you could tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left, so let me pay back my debt.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dAt that moment, Han Jinsang pulled his elbow back up.The thin thread around his body pulled my body. I was startled and tried to move, but then he held the top of my head.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019He was aiming for my head, the midpoint of my head. Was this revenge?\u201cKuak!\u201dI tried to shake him off with innate qi.\u201cEven if you refuse, I need to pay back the debt.\u201dPak!Qi entered my body.\u201cKuaaakl!\u201dAt that moment, hot qi from Han Jisang\u2019s hand flows into the midpoint of the head. But this wasn\u2019t internal qi.\u2018\u2026this.\u2019It was innate qi!Shockingly, this guy also knew how to use innate qi! As I sat there shocked, Han Jisang said,\u201cThe midpoint of the head. It is known to be the best point to accept innate qi. Concentrate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - The Monster Being In The Cave (2)I thought I was going to die like this because the head was what he aimed for. But what came instead of death was innate qi.As the Slaughtering King Han Jisang said, the midpoint of the head was the best for receiving innate qi.\u201cDo the Whole Body Cultivation technique.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019No, how did he know about this? I was curious as to how this guy knew, but now was the time to accept the innate qi into my body.There was no reason to risk my life for a question I could ask later.\u201cPhew.\u201dI started to cultivate by breathing and guided the innate qi, which entered my body, and into the mid-dantian.I wasn\u2019t sure if the innate qi will be accepted but it can be said that it is difficult to accept more than three to four percent as it wasn\u2019t something I built myself, and when accepting the qi of another it is normal to lose a lot.\u2018Ah!\u2019The rush of innate qi. And it felt different from what I had. However, its properties were similar.And this was fine.\u2018\u2026 The Whole Body Cultivation technique,\u2019The fact that the nature of the qi was similar meant that it was cultivated with the same technique.Everything was so confusing here, but one thing was certain, I could absorb more qi now.As my heart pounded fast, my natural instinct was pushed into the middle dantian. And in order to embody it, I began to cultivate it.Of course, the innate qi that Han Jisang had given me had exceeded what I had. My body swelled up like it was being torn.\u201cKuaaak!\u201d\u201c\u2026endure it.\u201dHan Jisang, who had passed the innate qi into my body was also roughly breathing. So time passed for both of us.If cultivation played the role of stabilizing the innate qi, the Xing Ming method would allow it to operate smoothly.First point and then the second.The rotation of the innate qi gradually increased along the path I was moving it, and Han Jisang\u2019s voice could be heard.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026 although it seems complicated, it has to work. But trying to handle it right away is meaningless.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The moment I heard those words, my mind went black.I was clinging to the technique, but in my head, I was already trying to make it work. So I followed what he said and half an hour passed when I opened my eyes with joy.It was because of the Xing Ming technique. I had managed to exceed my star level of innate qi, gaining another star, allowing me to store more innate qi.In addition, it felt like I had gained more than 60 years\u2019 worth of innate qi.-Amazing!I was stunned that I was able to integrate more than 60% of the innate qi he had pushed into me.I had enough clarity, and the foundation that was laid in the past was used to nurture my body with innate qi.-Congratulations, Wonhwi. You have grown.Iron Sword, who was wary of Han Jisang, congratulated me. Even so, I had achieved another goal, and it would help the future of Iron Sword too.And he felt different emotions running thanks to this. I feel like I had to thank the man.\u2018Was he constantly doing that?\u2019-Yes.Han Jisang was 10 steps away from me. The already exhausted-looking face was more horrible, and it was natural that his body didn\u2019t seem fine after he gave me so much innate qi.Srr!\u201cAh?\u201dThe thin thread wrapped around my arm was turning loose. This seemed good.Rr!The moment I decided to untie it, it felt like I was suddenly pulled in. Han Jisang couldn\u2019t even move, so it was strange to be sucked in.\u2018Is he awake?\u2019I approached him cautiously, and he hadn\u2019t opened his eyes yet.I was trying to see if he was done cultivating yet, but Han Jisang suddenly rushed at me\u201cKuaaaaah!\u201dLooking at this, it seemed like he had lost his mind. Surprised, I took a couple of steps back.Tatak!My movements were a lot faster than before because I hit the five-star level of innate qi.On the other hand, Han Jisang\u2019s movements turned sluggish. As he flew, he fell down and began to crawl toward me.\u201cMeat\u2026 meat\u2026\u201dHe seemed to be thinking of me as food again, just like when he first saw me, but because he had used up his innate qi, he moved like a normal person.\u201cI am hungry\u2026 starving\u2026\u201dWhen he was strong as a monster, he was so terrifying. Did he realize that he had lost his strength despite losing his mind?He was planning to bite his only other arm.\u2018This!\u2019I hurriedly walked close to him and tried to immobilize him. Looking back, it seemed like the only other thing he could eat was his arm.\u2018This is bad.\u2019Eating wasn\u2019t the problem anymore.\u201cMeat! Meat!\u201dI gave the only jerky that Baek Ryeon-ha had given me to him, and he gobbled it down.-Ha\u2026Iron Sword let out a sigh. I wondered what had just happened.-He deserves to die. But looking at him now, it seems like he has been punished enough.\u2018What happened?\u2019I asked him, but he stayed silent like he didn\u2019t want to recall what happened.-15 years back\u2026my former owner competed with the golden eyes man with me and was defeated. The injury was so serious that it was life-threatening too.I heard this before too. Even then, he didn\u2019t complete the story and ended it in the middle.It seems like he didn\u2019t want to talk about it in the past.-After the golden-eyed man left, this guy appeared in front of my dying owner.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Then, did this guy kill the South Heavenly Swordsman?No.If so, there was no way that the South Heavenly Swordsman would have died like that in the cave.-\u2026this guy was aiming to kill my master, who was the most famous person at that time. However, it wasn\u2019t easy for a guy like him to take down my master, who was perfect.The Slaughtering King was aiming for the life of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman. Well, he was the crazy one to go after the Eight Great Warriors, so this should be no surprise, but I wanted to know why.-I don\u2019t know why. But he seemed to wait until my master weakened.The opponent wasn\u2019t someone he could touch from upfront, so he had to aim for the time he was the weakest.-But then he made a proposal to my former master.\u2018Proposal?\u2019-After all, since my master would not live with that wound, he asked that his martial arts be passed down.To covet the martial arts in that situation. After all, everyone wanted to covet that man\u2019s martial arts. It must have been then that he learned the cultivation technique.-\u2026 former master was weak and smitten by his words, so he made a suggestion.\u2018What?\u2019-My former master always wanted a successor to him. So he said that he would teach his martial arts in the name of the South Heavenly Swordsman to Han Jisang only if he followed his way.Ah\u2026I didn\u2019t have to know more as to why the Iron Sword hated him. It was because this guy didn\u2019t live up to his former master\u2019s expectations.-Wonhwi, it must be as expected. The guy found out the cultivation technique and the other things, but once he learned them, his attitude changed completely.-Wow. He is the worst kind. To make a pact with a dying person.Short Sword was annoyed.-This guy broke both legs of my former master on the spot.\u2018It wasn\u2019t the golden eyes one then?\u2019Naturally, I thought it was the golden-eyed one who broke the legs of the South Heavenly Swordsman, but the real culprit was this guy?-It seemed that he broke the legs of my former master, fearing that he would survive. Well, this guy had no luck either.\u2018Uh?\u2019-The golden-eyed man appeared.Now, this was an amazing twist.It wasn\u2019t the outcome Han Jisang had wanted at all.-When the man with golden eyes saw that my former master\u2019s legs were broken, he cut off Han Jisang\u2019s legs right then and destroyed his dantian, and threw him down the valley.-Wow. So cool!Short Sword cheered like she liked this.Retribution is what this could be called.Han Jisang, who had experienced good and bad at the same time, must have thought that he was falling into hell.-Never thought that guy could live.Hearing this, I could understand why Iron Sword was so angry at Han Jisang.Hae Ack-chun was someone who had been a bad man in his own way, but not to this extreme, and Han Jisang was considered punished for his own wrongdoings.-But I didn\u2019t know. At that time, I thought he must have died, and I wanted him to die too.I think I understand what Iron Sword was saying. If it wasn\u2019t for this guy, I would have lost my life in the waters. Nor would I have gotten my innate qi increased.-Wonhwi. I really don\u2019t know what to think about him.I could understand Iron Sword\u2019s intentions.He was resentful that this guy hurt his former master but now turned into a benefactor who saved me, his current master.-Right, he was doing that to eat you, though.\u2018\u2026\u2019Well, this was one complicated relationship.I looked at Han Jisang. After eating the jerky, he began to twitch and then fainted.Looking at his condition, I seemed to understand why he was muttering about not having time.And then Han Jisang suddenly raised his head,\u201cHow long have I been like this?\u201dHe was the one who calmed down from before. These two faces seemed to come and go, and it seemed that he couldn\u2019t control his transformation.Still, I felt like I had to do something for what he did to me.Tak!I bowed.\u201cStop. I just paid off my debt.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dI understand why he said this was a debt. It seemed that many changes took place within his heart over the course of 15 years. And he said,\u201cLooking at your wounds, it seems like I was out for a long time.\u201d\u201cNo.\u2019And as I got too curious, I asked the question burning in the back of my mind,\u201cBut how did senior manage to come to this place?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - The Monster Being In The Cave (3)\u201cBut how did senior manage to come to this place?\u201dHan Jisang\u2019s expression darkened at the question.But now, even if he went crazy, I had nothing to worry about, so I wasn\u2019t too afraid to ask.Sighing a couple of times, he replied,\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It was a simple matter of vain greed.\u201dHe didn\u2019t speak of the full story. But he didn\u2019t seem ashamed of what he had done either.\u201c\u2026 rather, I want to ask you something.\u201dI frowned at his sudden words. Was he doing this favor because he wanted something from me?Still, he did help me.\u201cWhat kind of request is this?\u201d\u201cIf you are the descendant of the South Heavenly Swordsman, I think you will walk the right path. Surely there must have been some trust, right?\u201dUm.What do I answer now?I am the successor to the man, but I was closer to the Unorthodox Sect, so I was reluctant to respond.He asked in a bitter voice,\u201cIs it difficult?\u201d\u201c\u2026 it isn\u2019t that. but I am afraid that your junior might not be able to fulfill the request.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. It isn\u2019t a difficult request.\u201dNot difficult; that is why I was feeling anxious. Hesitating, I nodded.\u201cIf it is something within my power, I will listen.\u201dHan Jisang took a deep breath at my words,\u201cI cannot remember how long I have been here. But surviving in this cave without legs is a painful task.\u201dCome to think of it, Iron Sword said that the man with golden eyes only cut his legs and not his arm. Then, the arm was an accident? Continuing, he answered my silent question,\u201cI couldn\u2019t overcome the hunger and ended up cutting off my arm to eat it.\u201dHan Jisang pointed to his hand, making me frown.It wasn\u2019t an accident; he had just happened to do it.-He ate his own body? Eik!Even Short Sword couldn\u2019t understand this. That was what it felt like, not understanding why he had to sacrifice the arm he used so often.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the left arm but the right\u2026\u201d\u201cI am left-handed.\u201dAhh\u2026 so that is why he ate his right arm. If that was the case, I could understand it.It must have felt like a body part he could sacrifice. Han Jisang continued to speak,\u201cYou will not know how painful hunger and loneliness are.\u201dHis eyes shone, making me shudder.\u201cIt slowly gnaws at the hearts of people. That is a terrible thing.\u201dThe voice clearly made me feel his pain; he was desperate.\u201cIs that why you lost your mind?\u201dI didn\u2019t want to ask him directly if he had gone crazy, so I asked him in a polite manner.\u201cI struggled desperately to survive and live, but the more I did, the more my mind began to break down. At first, it was just brief moments, but then it turned into one, two, and at some point\u2026 it lasted for days, five days. Now I don\u2019t know if this is the true me or my crazy self.\u201dHe himself called himself crazy. He couldn\u2019t deny what he had been through.\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know when I will completely lose it.\u201dHe was afraid of losing himself.\u201c\u2026 before that happens, I want to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of request is it?\u201dI decided to listen to him first.I didn\u2019t like him due to what he did to my self-proclaimed teacher, the South Heavenly Swordsman, but didn\u2019t he help me?If not for the man, I would have died, so he pointed to his chest.\u201cTake the thing inside my arm.\u201dAs he said, I looked inside the arm and found a piece of leather with something on it.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019The moment I saw it, goosebumps rose on my skin.It looked like human skin no matter how I looked. Was it his own skin?At my shocked face, he said.\u201cI put everything in there. Can you pass it on to my son?\u201d-\u2026 Ha.Iron Sword sighed.This couldn\u2019t be more of a coincidence; he was doing the same thing he did to the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201cInstead, I don\u2019t mind if you learn it\u2026 and I will give it to you if you want. It is a treasure made with human skin. I think this much should work.\u201dHe blinked at the brown guard he had on the right elbow. It was the thing that looked thin and had the thread attached to it.Han Jisang\u2019s expression had too many emotions in it.-\u2026 doesn\u2019t it seem like he is testing you?\u2018Me?\u2019-You, the successor of South Heavenly Swordsman, to confirm if you will make the same choice or a different choice from him.It is a thought which came to me, but this Short Sword was really sharp.It isn\u2019t like she had a sharp blade, but more like her thoughts were different from humans.I looked into Han Jisang\u2019s eyes, and his eyes were shining with longing.Did he want to justify his greed in the past?-What are you so worried about? There is no reason to reject it.At Short Sword\u2019s words I sighed. Of course, the guy was right.There was no need to complicate it, pondering whether it was a test or not; if it was helpful to me, I should do it.I just didn\u2019t want to let him justify his past actions. I wanted to protect the honor of my teacher.Shhh!I told him.\u201cI have already received too much. I will take the item that the senior wants his son to have, like asked.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHan Jisang sighed at my words. Unlike before, this was a sigh of disappointment.Disappointment as I made a different choice than him?He chucked and laughed as he said.\u201cYou make me feel worthless till the end.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI have no children. I just wanted to check one last thing with you.\u201d-Uhuh. He isn\u2019t as great at lying as you.You don\u2019t have to compare me with everyone!I was yelling at Short Sword when Han Jisang smiled timidly and said,\u201cNow that there is no master, you can have all of them. It is up to you if you want to learn it. It would be karma if I get mine taken at this point.\u201dWith that, he shut his mouth, and I heard something chewing as he groaned.\u201cSenior!\u201dI hurriedly opened his mouth. He had chewed his tongue and swallowed it.\u2018This!\u2019His face, which turned white due to the tongue blocking his airway, turned red as if it would explode. He forcibly opened his eyes and moved them to the left and right.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019He didn\u2019t want me to interfere with his death.-\u2026 leave him alone. Wonhwi.Iron sword told me.But if left like this, he would die.-Let him rest now. He has already suffered way too much, so even my former master would want this.\u2018\u2026\u2019I turned sober at his words. He was forgiving this man.Taktak!After releasing his blood points, I placed him on the wall of the cave and bowed down to him.I wanted to convey my feelings of gratitude for what I received from him. When I lifted my head, his head was slightly tilted. But blood was dripping from his lips, and the corners of his lips were a bit raised.-He looks like a monster but dies like a human.Short Sword mumbled.The night passed, and morning came.All night long, I read what was written on the skin left by this man.It described in detail what martial arts he used and instructions on how to learn them, and the human skin thread he used.\u2018Shadow Flying Sword technique.\u2019His defense martial arts and the Shadow Flying sword technique, which used a silver thread, were more unique compared to the other martial arts I had learned, so it took me a while to comprehend them.There wasn\u2019t much time for me here.Shak!I put the silver thread on my right wrist. And the band holding the thread immediately shrunk and fit around my wrist.As I went to the entrance of the cave, the flowing rapids were shaking.\u2018Phew.\u2019I don\u2019t know if this would work or not, but I had to give it a try. I pulled Short Sword and tied the thread around it.-Do you have to do this?\u2018I should, and the thread only works on daggers or short swords.\u2019-Huh.Knowing what I was going to do, Short Sword was scared, and it seemed like she was scared of being lost if something happened.\u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019This thread was too strong to lose what was tied to it.Standing at the entrance of the cave, I aimed for the cliff. And threw her.Swis!-Waaaaak!Short Sword moved fast and stuck to the wall of the cliff.I wasn\u2019t sure how long this silver thread could extend, but it went quite far. And if I use innate qi\u2026Swish!My body got sucked to the other side.\u201cHaaa!\u201dWhen it worked out how I wanted, a smile burst onto my lips.The Shadow Flying sword technique could be used in so many different ways, and it could even use its elasticity to pull things closer too.\u2018Good.\u2019Tak!I grabbed the cliff where Short Sword was. If Han Jisang had strong arms and legs, then he would have gotten out of that cave long ago.-I am not sure about that.\u2018Why?\u2019-IF one is crazy, and hearing the voices from outside made him tremble and fear, then how would he even get out, even with a healthy body?Hmm.That made sense.Despite the suffering and hunger, he didn\u2019t once step past the entrance of the cave.I don\u2019t know if he was inside for a reason, but it was certain that he was afraid of going out.-Anyway, just climb up.\u2018Yes. Though it isn\u2019t necessary.\u2019-Uh?There is a good way to move.-\u2026No!I grinned as I pulled out Short Sword from the wall and threw her to the cliff on the other side.-Ackkkkkkkkkkk!I could even hear her swearing at me.She never screamed when I threw her at people, so why are you so scared now?Pat!I immediately fastened the thread and went closer to the sword. As soon as the weight moved, the thread began to get sucked in on its own.Pak!This was good.Cause this felt more like flying. I hadn\u2019t gotten used to it yet, but if I moved to the lower points of the valley and used it like riding rope, then I would eventually get used to it, and then I could get out of here.Instead, Short Sword would die of fear.-Leave me aloneee!Downstream, in the valley.A group had surrounded a handsome young man carrying a long sword sheathed on his back.Judging from the fact that they had flags with them, they were of the Murim Alliance.The man who had a beard and seemed to be the leader of this group shouted at the young man.\u201cWhat? You were heading into the mountains to join the Blood Sect? You must be insane! As expected, you must be of the Unorthodox Sect!\u201dAt his words, the young man slightly pouted and said,\u201cNo. What does it matter if a stranger joins the Blood Sect or not? And since I am not against you, does it make sense to corner me like this?\u201dAt the words of the young man, the man with a beard snorted,\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it matter? Do you not know that the Blood Sect and its people are the targets of the Murim due to their nature?\u201d\u201cWho decided that?\u201d\u201cThe Murim Alliance!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Murim Alliance just a gathering of sects? Is that the rule that the nation follows?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem even to be a novice in Murim. Stop playing with\u2026\u201d\u201cWe are meeting for the first time, but I don\u2019t think you have the liberty to act all ignorant.\u201dClench!The man with the beard was angry as he shouted at the young man,\u201cYou will come to your senses right now. Catch him!\u201d\u201cIt was bound to happen from the start.\u201dThe young man only grinned at this and grabbed the sword in the sheath.Even with such a group of 10 surrounding him, he was confident. And at the time, the swordsman of the group shouted,\u201cLeader! L-look there!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEveryone was startled and looked at the place being pointed to. It was the same with the young man.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Everyone was wide-eyed. On the side of the cliff where the mountain ranges spread.They saw a figure flying across the air.\u201cFlying!\u201d\u201cAh, no, maybe Void Movement.\u2019\u201cVoid Movement?\u201dThe method which only the legends found in stories were told to perform?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Sima Young (1)Woong!I didn\u2019t expect to be moving this fast when swinging around. This was a lot faster than using footwork techniques.I could already see the end of the valley. And as I descended downstream, the water currents looked calmer.Now, how to get out of this mountain range and move quickly; I still had to get out and catch up with the retreat procession.-But Wonhwi, if everyone thought you were dead, wouldn\u2019t you be able to get out of the sect?\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019I felt a bit shaken at the questioning of Iron Sword. Actually, this could be my chanceAs he said, if I vanished from here, I would be able to live a quiet life away from all the drama. But that was problematic too.-What problem could this cause?\u2018I already have too much attention on me.\u2019My impressions and everything were already well known to the Blood Sect. If Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s side was in power and Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s side was overthrown, then my position would be ambiguous.Even the masked men who came to attack us on the path guessed who I was just by my rusted sword.-The rust can be fixed at any time.\u2018But how will I fix my face?\u2019-Um? How about getting a human skin mask?Human skin mask.But I didn\u2019t know of a single person who was skilled in making them around here.As Iron Sword said, wearing a human skin mask was one way to escape from it all. But I didn\u2019t want to live an anxious life.-Then what will you do?\u2018\u2026 I will see this through to the end.\u2019Actually, even when I was in the Six Blood Valley, I had a great idea of just leaving. It was easy to escape from there.Although Hae Ack-chun chose Baek Ryeon-ha to side with, I was sure that he would change sides depending on his own interest, but things have changed now.-\u2026 now do you think they are after you too?\u2018Yes.\u2019At first, I thought the masked men only aimed for Baek Ryeon-ha. But something felt strange. The masked people knew me and were trying to take me down and not the elders or the Blood Star.In addition, leader Yang Kangil, the spy of Baek Hye-hyang, had smeared the powder on my sword specifically.-Maybe a coincidence?\u2018Coincidence? Well.\u2019If that was the case, even if it was a little risky, he should have done it on someone more important.He should have touched Baek Ryeon-ha or someone next to her if he didn\u2019t want to get noticed. This was aimed at me.Whether it was intentional or not, I must have brought in too much attention being the disciple of Ghastly Monster.-You have already made your decision.\u2018Yes.\u2019If people were aiming for me, then Baek Ryeon-ha had to become the sect leader. Only then will I be able to get out of the danger from Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s side.-\u2026 Well, if that is your opinion, Short Sword and I will follow you. The one way you know cannot be the only way through.\u2018Is there another way?\u2019-Overwhelming power could be one method.\u2018Overwhelming power?\u2019-Didn\u2019t I tell you before? Those who entered the realm of great beings like the Eight Great Warriors and the Four Great Evils are people who everyone is afraid of.\u2018\u2026 yes.\u2019I smiled. What he said was right.One needed overwhelming power to break out of this circle.Inheriting the swordsmanship of the South Heavenly Swordsman has been my goal. But it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do, so I will have to train hard for now.-Wonhwi. Look there.I frowned and looked over at the prodding of Iron Sword.As we began to descend downstream, the valley nearly ended, and a small river could be seen with a group of people next to it.\u2018Ah.\u2019Because we were quite far away, I couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of their swords. It was a shame that I could see them, but I couldn\u2019t do much as the cliffs would end where they were.Pak!I channeled my innate qi into the silver thread, pulling myself up the edge of the cliff, and clung to the side of it.-Tch. What do we do now?Short Sword asked me.\u2018Calm down.\u2019-Huh!\u2018Since we are out of the Six Blood Valley, I will find a nice blacksmith and get you all fixed up.\u2019-For real?Fortunately, she believed me. She must have been too concerned with the broken tip of the sword.Well, she seemed pissed.I notice those people, so they must have noticed me too.-Are they warriors who have surrounded the mountain?\u2018Probably.\u2019It was far, but no one had masks on, and since it had just been one day, I thought they would still be searching within the mountains, but they had already come down to the lower end.-What do we do now?I was worried about what to do too.Would it be better just to run? However, I was worried that if I ran away now, they would sound the horn.-I think we are still in trouble.Shit.I overlooked that.I decided to run, but then everything felt too silent that I should be hearing the horn.\u2018What?\u2019As I poked my face out of the cliff and looked down. Contrary to my thoughts, the group on the shore was fighting.I didn\u2019t know who it was due to them being too far from me, but it seemed like one person was fighting against ten people.\u2018Who is it?\u2019-Maybe a person from the Blood Sect?\u2018Blood Sect?\u2019-Right. Even the crazy old man came down the cliff and looked for you for two hours. And if he is here in this place, then it has to be someone left behind.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It made sense.If that is the case, I was impressed. Looking at Hae Ack-chun\u2019s behavior, I thought he must have left this guy.Even if he spoke harshly, he cared for his disciples a lot.-Then will you help him?I nodded my head at Iron Sword\u2019s words. The person fighting here must be someone sent by Hae Ack-chun.-Do you think it will hurt?From a distance, everything looked daunting.The group was even taking up a circle. Whatever it was, it was bad.Having made the decision, I pulled out Short Sword, which had been lodged into the cliff.\u2018I will throw you once more.\u2019-Ahh. I really hate this.Although she was annoyed, she didn\u2019t refuse it.Actually, it felt like she got used to being swung around at cliffs.Sh!I threw her out to the other side of the cliff. As a short sword pierced into the wall, it flew ahead and slowly stretched the thread.Once Short Sword landed on the opposite side of the cliff I followed along. Next, I threw her into the shallow rocky waters by the shore.As I got closer, I could hear the sound of swords now. As everyone used swords, my head felt noisy.With so many swords, my head felt messed up.-They are surrounding him.Iron Sword informed me.I also learned how to tackle all these things in the past, so I know how to deal with them. Even more so, this guy was alone and not with a group.-He fights pretty well.As Short Sword said, the guy who was surrounded was able to withstand all their movements with his elegant sword techniques.\u2018Swords?\u2019The one in the center was using a sword.Among the descendants of the Six Blood Valley, there were few who used swords. Besides, it was my first time meeting such a slender person with a handsome face.\u2018Maybe he isn\u2019t from the Blood Sect?\u2019This handsome young man didn\u2019t even have a mask on. I feel confused now.If he wasn\u2019t on Blood Sect, then why were these groups of people fighting?-Maybe he is related to a person of the Blood Sect.-The ones in relation to the sect need to be killed, right?The two told me.As I concentrated on the sound, I could hear the swords clearly. Occasionally I would hear words.\u2018Is he related to Blood Sect?\u2019-They seemed to have noticed you, Wonhwi.After being this close, not finding me out would be weirder.Then I have no other way but to deal with them first.\u201cEveryone back down!\u201dTatatak!But as I approached, the group against the man widened their distance and looked at me with tense faces.\u2018\u2026what is this?\u2019On the other hand, the young man was looking at me with twinkling eyes, and he shouted.\u201cGreat Guardian! Please help me!\u201dWhat is this now?I was wearing a mask which I had found in the cave. Was he doing this knowing who I am?-He is doing it because he doesn\u2019t know.At that time, the middle-aged man with a beard spoke to me with a nervous face.Tak!\u201c\u2026 are you one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries of the Blood Sect?\u201dHe was politely asking if I was one of the four; it seemed like some kind of misunderstanding.Since I didn\u2019t even use the middle dantian, they should have felt that I wasn\u2019t even a first-rate warrior, so why were they acting like this?At that time, these things rang in my mind.-This is insane. It wasn\u2019t even internal qi but some thin thread.-Oh, so frustrating.-What bullshit is this?All their swords were cursing at their masters, who were being stupid. Hearing that, I came to know that they were confusing my silver thread with void walking.That is why it seemed like they were regarding me as one of the Venerables of Blood Sect.\u2018Oh. I see.\u2019Hopefully, this situation could be utilized. I looked at the sword of the young man.It was a unique sword. There was a blue line drawn on the sword body, and it looked like some precious sword with a subtle feel to it.And this sword too,-I don\u2019t think he is a kind of leader in the Blood Sect. Why bother doing something worthless? Tch.But thanks to the sword speaking this, I came to know that this guy wasn\u2019t from the Blood Sect either.Then why did he have to find a leader of the sect? Well, dealing with this group came first.\u2018Phew\u2019I raised my innate qi and sent a message to the young man.[Attack them when I signal.]At my voice, the young man immediately answered.[Yes. Great Guardian.]Hearing a voice calling me Great Guardian, which I had never heard before, felt weird. I knew he was doing this on purpose, but it was really nice to hear.-You are also weak to praise.What are you talking about? It just felt nice to hear.In any case, having so many eyes focused on me, I began to check them.Among them, there seemed to be no outstanding warriors, except for a middle-aged man with a beard and two others in the back.I spoke with as much dignity as I could,\u201cAre the people who know who I am still holding weapons?\u201dShort Sword clicked her tongue at my voice. Did I sound too awkward?Not awkward enough for this group, it seemed. The middle-aged man with a beard opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026 around this area, the warriors of the alliance have come up. Even if you are one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, you cannot get out of here.\u201dEven though he was terrified, he didn\u2019t back down. Contrary to his expression, he had some courage.At that time, I heard the voice of the young guy.[It is a lie. There is no one around here except them. There is another group three miles away, but I broke the cone, so they cannot call. Heheh.]When I looked at him, he looked like a loyal dog wanting to be praised, and this was useful information.[Thank you.]The man smiled broadly, showing his teeth.-He is desperate to look good for you.I was thinking the same. There was no need to make him an enemy right now if he liked Blood Sect.It isn\u2019t too late to find out who he is after solving the problem. And I raised my voice.\u201cYou are lying.\u201d\u201c\u2026it isn\u2019t a lie. Surely the young man is violating\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re stubborn!\u201dThe young man seemed right. Seeing the man try to divert the attention, it felt like he was lying.The man with the beard immediately clenched his fist, and the rest of the group saw him. He couldn\u2019t attack first as he seemed too afraid, but he was convinced that a fight would come at any moment.And I said,\u201cDo you think there are no people planted here by me?\u201dThe middle-aged man with a beard frowned at my words.\u201cEven if you try to deceive me with such lies\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so? Some people might recognize me.\u201dWith that, I pointed my thumb. And this, some unconsciously looked into my eyes. At that moment, some of the innate qi was used, and the eyes of the three men were losing focus.The ones whose eyes lost focus attacked their own colleagues with the swords they were holding.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dChak!\u201cHik! W-what are you doing?\u201dOne managed to stab a guy in the throat because they were too careless. Unfortunately, the other two managed only to knick a hand and a leg, and the others escaped with their lives.\u2018Ha!\u2019For a moment, even I was shocked at this sight. It was the second stage of the Illusion Eye technique, and I managed to do it right. Especially impressive as it was on three people.\u2018I did it to several people!\u2019Somehow as if I had done some kind of technique, my innate qi was consumed in large quantities. I discovered this new thing by accident but then drained most of my innate qi as I had used it on several people.But thanks to this, the situation was good.\u201cFuck!\u201cThese guys were spies!\u201dThose who I controlled were now suspected of being spies.They immediately returned to normal due to the loud noises, but the situation had already begun to change.\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? What is this!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mess around!\u201dChachang!A riot broke down in an instant. Those who had no memory of what they did were stopping their companions from killing them.\u201cW-what is this\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man with a beard was shocked at all this.[Now!]I sent the message to the young man.As soon as the signal fell, this young man in yellow rushed for the people who were fighting amongst themselves.And I, too, swung my sword at the middle-aged man.\u2018Tiger Tooth Sword technique.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - Sima Young (2)The Tiger Tooth Sword technique was one of the forms within the Xing Ming Swordsmanship.It was a technique used to subdue the opponent by moving with the force of a fierce tiger.The middle-aged man with a beard, who was thrown into confusion thanks to my plan, responded quickly, as expected of the leader.Chang!\u201cUh?\u201dAs the swords collided, the eyes of the man changed. It was natural to be surprised.Now I am using that technique, one of the most coveted techniques. This version was not the incomplete one that the world knew the South Heavenly Swordsman used.Chang!The middle-aged man was shocked at this. There was no reason for me to hide this technique in the absence of Hae Ack-chun.\u2018Faster!\u2019The power of Tiger Tooth Sword lies in the speed it moves in and it constantly gets stronger. The middle-aged man might have been distracted by this nonstop technique and made a mistake.\u2018A gap!\u2019When he brushed the sword to the upper right corner, I found a gap.The middle-aged man couldn\u2019t even block it and got stabbed at the right clavicle.Puak!In a sword-to-sword battle, even the slightest bit of carelessness could lead to a fatal wound. The balance of the middle-aged man got interrupted, and he got stabbed above the collarbone.\u201cKuak.\u201dThe man tried to broaden the gap between us by moving back, and as I was about to catch up to him, I came up with a good idea.Holding Iron Sword, I reached out to the leg he was moving back with.Shh!Then, the silver thread in my hand was wrapped around the leg of the middle-aged man. And then I pulled.\u201cKuak!\u201dOne leg was pulled toward me, and the bearded man fell. When the innate qi was infused into the silver thread, his body was pulled into mine.\u201cY-You, coward!\u201dThe middle-aged man shouted at me. We weren\u2019t even fighting now. What was so cowardly about this?Tang!He swung the sword at the silver thread in the leg, but the sword bounced back easily.Even if it was rusted, the silver wire managed to bounce off an iron sword, which meant an ordinary sword couldn\u2019t cut it.\u201cEh!\u201dThe middle-aged man, with his anxiety rising, swung his sword to prevent me from getting close to him. However, there was no way a sword he was simply swinging could do anything.Chang!I slashed the sword and pierced his heart. The middle-aged man, who was groaning in pain, stopped as if he had died right away.-I think it\u2019s better to handle the silver thread with the left hand.\u2018Yes.\u2019I agreed with Iron Sword. If I had to use it from my right hand constantly, it would create gaps in my form.In the first place, any form of sword throwing was done with the left hand, and it seemed like the silver thread had to be done with the left hand.Now that the toughest person was dealt with, the other\u2026\u2018Huh!\u2019I tried to help the young man in yellow, but there were only two left.Although it was said that they fought amongst themselves in a short span of time, 6 out of 8 people were dealt with.If it wasn\u2019t for that, he looked like a competent person to handle them alone.Pat!Still, it is better to deal with them quickly, so I intervened.After moving to him, I aimed after one of those who was aiming for the guy.\u201cBe careful!\u201dOne of the enemy men shouted, but it was too late. Even if they competed head-on, the difference in skills was something that couldn\u2019t be overcome.I stabbed the swordsman, who had turned around in a hurry.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dWhen I killed one man, the young man in yellow didn\u2019t miss the chance and killed the other one. But his hands were crueler than I thought.After poking one of his opponent\u2019s eyes, he cut off the head.-\u2026this sword is cruel and vicious.Even Iron sword stuck his tongue.Even looking at the bodies of the people he killed till now, he was always aiming for the eyes, nose, or any other sensitive areas.-The person who made such a sword technique had to be killer minded.I thought so, too; in the first place, a technique is used to kill the opponent efficiently, but this was too far.\u201cGreat Guardian! Thank you for the help.\u201dThe young man bowed to me. How can someone with such cruel hands smile this innocently?It didn\u2019t fit with his face.Shhh!I aimed my sword at him. and now that one problem was solved, it was time to know about him.\u201cUh?\u201dThe guy seemed puzzled.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThis guy wasn\u2019t someone Hae Ack-chun had left behind, nor was he a member of the Blood Sect.Seeing the brutal skills and killing, he didn\u2019t seem to belong to the Murim Alliance either, so I was curious about his identity.Then the boy suddenly unexpectedly acted.Pak!Suddenly, he got down on his knees and bowed to me as he said,\u201cGreat Guardian. I have always envied your sect. I came here to commit myself to this because I thought there were traces of your sect here.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019I was speechless for a moment at the sudden words of the man.His sword asked for a leader in the Blood Sect, but I never expected that his purpose was to join the sect.But until recently, I wasn\u2019t very conscious of it as I was dealing with the enemies, but I really cared about this guy.His face looked like he was in his early 20s, but his voice felt too mature. Almost as if he had gone through Body Transformation. It seemed awkward and thick too.-And the body is weirdly lean.As Short Sword said, the body was too slim. It looked like one of the two things: a teenage guy who lied about his age or a woman dressed as a man.-What will you do?\u2018Well.\u2019It was impossible to walk away from such a mysterious person. And he prevented the Murim Alliance people from calling for their allies here, and he was trying to look good in front of me from the start. It was clear that he was trying to create a favor for him to join the sect.And looking at him, I said.\u201cWho are you to want to join the Blood Sect?\u201dI asked him to reveal his identity. I hoped his sword would speak it out, but the sword seemed to be thick-lipped.The young man hesitated for a moment, then said,\u201cIs my identity so important? I heard that all the leaders only care about talent.\u201d\u201cThat is a story which applies to the ones who can be trusted. I don\u2019t even know who you are, so how can I be careless\u2026\u201d-\u2026-Wonhwi!I heard it too. The sound that was ringing in my ears.A large number of people were approaching us. Judging from the sound of the swords alone, it seemed like there were ten of them.And we had to get out right away.\u2018Because this is the southwest direction of the mountain range.\u2019To get to the meeting point, I was informed I would have to go around the mountain range and head for Guizhou.\u201cWhat is it?\u2019\u201cA large crowd is coming here.\u201dThe young man looked puzzled at my words; I guess he wasn\u2019t able to detect their presence.\u201cLarge? Could it be, but as I looked around, no\u2026\u201d\u201cShhh.\u2019I silenced the guy. If he didn\u2019t feel it before, then there is no way he can feel it now.[The number of them seems to be more than 20 or 30, we need to get out of here now.]It is a rough guess, but it has to be around the number. The young man was unable to speak as he heard me.[I think you are a strong person, and if you are this skilled, you can handle them\u2026.]Handle what?Pat!With the man around, who still considered me to be one of the Four Venerable Dignitaries, I set out to the northwest.In the future, I must not show myself using the thread. It was easy to be misunderstood.Shhh!Then I heard a quick chasing sound behind me. I noticed the young man was following me too.\u2018He is fast.\u2019I did expect him to have strong performance and skills, but his ability to perform this was too good.At this level, the wall of the first-rate warrior was crossed. If he had these skills at this age, he had to be the child of a prestigious family or a skilled teacher, and this only made me more curious.[You are really amazing. I felt a presence only when they got closer, but you are amazing.]The young man praised me constantly.What? Has he already detected the signs?Of course, the enemies were getting closer, but at this distance, it would be difficult for even the skilled people to notice it.[It seems like one of the enemies is quite strong. If you deal with him, the other enemies can come, so I think Great Guardian\u2019s judgment is correct.]Even the level of the enemy\u2019s strength could be guessed. Could it be that he was hiding his martial arts like me?\u2018Ah!\u2019But I didn\u2019t have enough time to think about it. Someone was approaching us fast from behind. And the presence kept getting bigger and bigger.At this speed, it seemed like that person would catch up to us in no time.[Great Guardian! He is too fast.]The young man sent me a message, but then his original voice came out. As expected, this young man must have been a woman!How surprised must he be to forget his true voice?-\u2026hurts. It hurts.I could clearly hear the words, but something felt off.How was the voice of a sword saying stuff like it was hurting? This was like the time Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s sword groaned in pain.-Wonhwi, almost caught up!Short Sword shouted at me. And it felt unreasonable to run away any longer.I hurriedly sent the message to the young man[I am afraid running won\u2019t work. Let\u2019s work together now.][Yes!]The young man in yellow also nodded as he thought of the same thing. It felt like there was no use hiding the true voice.After stopping, both he and I hid behind the large tree and tried to hide our presence.It was to aim for the moment when the enemy appeared.And this person got closer. I signaled.[Three][Two][One!]As soon as \u2018one\u2019 was uttered, the young man and I moved, and, at the same time, we pulled out our swords and rushed for the ones coming from the bushes.The ones jumping out of the bushes also pulled out their swords and blocked our attacks.Chang!Only three hits were exchanged with this person, but I felt my palms hurting. The power of their sword was too much.But along the way, I had to stop attacking.PakI didn\u2019t use any technique and spread out my footwork and shouted to the young man.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dAt my cry, the man fell back suddenly. In the meantime, I quickly took off the mask which was covering my face.When I did that, the man who jumped out of the bushes opened his mouth with a surprised voice.\u201cKid?\u201d\u201cElder!\u201dThe man pursuing us was none other than Second Elder, Seo Kalma.I didn\u2019t recognize him right away because he was wearing a gray uniform, and his hair was neatly tied up!\u201cWhy is Elder here?\u201dHearing my words, Seo Kalma spoke with a bright face!\u201cHa! You are alive!\u201dI, too, smiled. How nice it was to meet someone I knew.On the other hand, the young man looked at me with shocked eyes.[Great guardian\u2026 no, you aren\u2019t one of the four?]At his disappointed voice, I gently raised my hands up and said,\u201cWhen did I ever tell you I was one?\u201dWhen I said that, the person seemed shocked.\u201cTo say that now\u2026\u201dShh!Then Seo Kalma pointed his sword to the young woman dressed as a man and said,\u201cYour face looks young, and your voice is that of a woman. It looks like you have a human skin mask on; who are you?\u201dWhen a warrior as great as Seo Kalma was here, even he seemed to step back.The slightest movement from Seo Kalma made the person feel scared, and she looked at me to explain something,To which I said,\u201cThis person helped me when enemies were around. This person wants to join the sect, but I don\u2019t have any idea where he/she is from.\u201dI briefly explained. I didn\u2019t know anything more than this.I informed the person, who looked shocked.[This person is the real deal.]The young person who realized what I meant knelt down and then bowed.\u201cRespected elder. I have always envied the sect. I came here because I thought there might be traces of the sect, so I came hoping the sect would accept me.\u201dSeo Kalma frowned at the young man\u2019s words. I had the same reaction.When someone we didn\u2019t know wanted to join the sect out of the blue, anyone is bound to be a bit shocked.But the response was different.Sh!Seo Kalma asked the person to get up.\u201cHow do I believe that this young person isn\u2019t a spy?\u201dIt meant that he would consider the request if the true identity was revealed. He pointed the sword at the person.The shocked person said,\u201c\u2026 my family name is Sima! And name on Young! I come from Sichuan Province.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Upon hearing those words, Seo Kalma and I both became stunned.-What is it?Short Sword asked me.-Talk to me! Waiting is frustrating!There were many people who used the name Sima in the lands, but only one family used that in Sichuan.\u2018\u2026 Sima Chak.\u2019Wicked Moon Sword, Sima Chak.One of the Four Great Evils.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Sima Young (3)Throughout Murim, there were 12 beings referred to as the Supreme Beings.The eight who sided with justice and the four who sided with evil.There were many tales associated with them that could give one fear, and it was no different for the Wicked Moon Sword, Sima Chak.One such tale involved a very small sect on the southeastern side of the Sichuan Province and over two hundred attackers who were killed in one night.The one responsible was Sima Chak, and the sects whose warriors were killed became angry and went to find Sima Chak and attack him.However, none of the 400 warriors or those who invaded the area came back alive.-Wow\u2026 then you mean he killed all those people by himself?Short Sword stuck out her tongue. None of the Four Great Evils abstained from killing because they thought killing people was easier than having rice.-This one is the child of that guy?Looks like it.The same name Sima was there, and Young the actual name.And if the place was the Moon Valley, and shared the name Sima, then it has to be true. The descendant of one of the Four Great Evils was applying to join the Blood Sect.It was quite surprising.\u2018Wait\u2026. Something doesn\u2019t seem right.\u2019-What doesn\u2019t seem right?Right.Now I remember what happened when I was sent to spy for the alliance before dying.At that time, a huge accident happened related to Sima Chak.-What happened?\u2018At that time, Sima Chak and Martial Twin master collided.\u2019-Martial Twin master? The one who enjoys the greatest fortress?It was such a huge event that even the Murim Alliance showed interest. Since the alliance was broken down, the Murim Alliance hoped that Martial Twin master would take a huge hit, but I don\u2019t know what happened.-Why?\u2018On the contrary, Sima Chak had gone under that man.\u2019-Uh? He subordinated himself?It was all unexpected.The Murim Alliance speculated that Sima Chak would head back to the Moon Valley, his base, and hide. However, it was later revealed that the reason he went under the other guy was due to a descendant of his.In the end, it was the same as following his child.-Uh? So you mean it was all the child?I am not too sure about it. However, if that is true, then this young person who called himself Sima Young was destined to die not in the Blood Sect but to the Martial Twin Master.In fact, it was horrible that he came right as we got attacked.\u2018Is it horrible?\u2019I could only guess so.A person who was supposed to go to another place came here. If we didn\u2019t take this person in, would time flow the way I had remembered it?Short Sword pointed something out.-But as you said, no one knows that the Moon Valley is the base of Sima Chak right now, right?Uh? She is right.Come to think of it; the massacre happens later from now. If the Moon Valley is still unknown to all, then why was Seo Kalma shocked?\u201cYou are from the Sima family?\u201dSima family?Ah.The Sima family was a prestigious martial family who held an important position in the Murim Alliance.Unlike me, who thought of Sima Chak, Seo Kalma thought that this person was from the Sima family. It was strange to know of Sima Chak at this point in time.\u201cA person from a prestigious family envies our sect?\u201dIf he thought that this person was from a prestigious sect, then the reaction of Seo Kalma made sense. And then the young person said,\u201cI have no alliance with the Sima family.\u201dSeo Kalma narrowed his eyes at those words.It must have been as if there was some resentment in the voice of the person.Seo Kalma asked,\u201cHow can you prove that?\u201d\u201cBecause the Sima family is my sworn enemy.\u201d\u201cSworn enemy?\u201dAt the question from Seo Kalma, the person spoke with a bitter voice,\u201c\u2026 my mother died because of them. I wanted to devote myself to the Blood Sect as I couldn\u2019t do anything to those from within the walls of the Murim Alliance.\u201dThe voice of the man was filled with sadness and eyes with tears. It reminded me of my childhood.When my mother died, I felt so resentful that my own father wanted me dead. Is that why?I felt a bit connected to this person, and maybe that is why Seo Kalma softened his expression.\u201cWhy did you cover your face with a human skin mask? If you want to enter the sect, you are not supposed to hide anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHesitating for a moment, the person touched the face. Fiddling with the ear and then the skin under the neck was slowly pulled back.When the human skin mask was pulled like rubber, the original face behind was revealed.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAt the same time, both Seo Kalma and I were shocked.I could tell it was a woman from her voice, but the face was too shocking. Two cheeks blushed red, and the rest of her skin was white like porcelain. There was no part of her that looked odd, and her eyes appeared so gentle.She looked like a true beauty.-Is she pretty?I nodded my head at Short Sword\u2019s question.She was so beautiful that it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to call her the greatest beauty of the world.-Even compared to Baek Ryeon-ha?\u2018\u2026 well.\u2019-Right, I get what you mean.No, I said nothing! Don\u2019t jump to your own conclusions!Anyway, Sima Young was pretty enough to be called one of the top three beautiful women in the world, according to the words which circulated before my death.Now I knew why she had to keep the mask. And she spoke to Seo Kalma.\u201cI wanted to be recognized for my skills and not my face or gender.\u201dAt her words, Short Sword said,-\u2026 she knows she is pretty, right?It was hard to deny. But apparently, there are too many prejudices that come from appearance.Skills always get buried within appearance.[Kid. What do you think?]Seo Kalma asked me. I didn\u2019t think he would ever ask me for my opinion, but he continued.[Did you not see the child before me? Can she be trusted?]At Seo Kalma\u2019s words, I looked at Sima Young. From the moment we met, she showed dedication to joining the sect.Maybe that is why I felt the need to side with her.-But Wonhwi. Wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous to be a daughter of one of the Four Great Evils?Iron Sword, who was silent till then, asked me. Unlike Short Sword, this guy must have heard about the Four Great Evils.He was concerned about taking unneeded risks.-Or if you just tell this old man, wouldn\u2019t he make the right decision?Do you want me to reveal her true identity? If that happened, he would never accept her.Any person with common sense would never take in the daughter of a Four Great Evil. They would reject it no matter what the future looked like.-They aren\u2019t the Four Great Evils for nothing. Even in the old days, there was no one who didn\u2019t pay the price for touching their things.Iron Sword spoke out. It was like he was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t fall off the horse.But this was different. The advice of not taking her in makes sense if I didn\u2019t know about her or the future, but I know both now.-Wonhwi, no!\u2018Where else can I find such a usable card?\u2019Hopefully, Baek Ryeon-ha gains power similar to Baek Hye-hyang.No, even if it isn\u2019t from Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s side, I can use this card as a favorable hand. I couldn\u2019t just let this opportunity go, but there was a need to make an arrangement before it.[Miss Sima.]I sent her a message. And she looked at me with anticipation, and I decided to try my luck.[If I could help Miss join the sect, what do I get in return?]\u2018\u2026?!\u2019At those words, the beautiful face frowned.Deep in the mountains, quite far from the mountains of Six Blood Valley.There was an old temple-like place.From the outside were buddha statues and monks bowing their heads, it looked like any ordinary temple, but there was a hidden secret in it.This temple was, for a long time, used as a temporary residence of the Blood Sect.There were people normally there due to their usual duties, and when the sect\u2019s people came, they mingled to avoid the attention of others.Inside the temple.Five people sat around the table.Baek Ryeon-ha, Hae Ack-chun, Han Baekha, Jang Mun-wong and Gu Sang-woong.They managed to help Baek Ryeon-ha escape from the valley, and Gu Sang-woong was the one who spoke first.\u201cElder. We only have another hour left to wait.\u201dAt that, Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 is leaving fine when the time runs out?\u201dAt the words of Gu Sang-woong, Hae Ack-chun frowned,\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it\u2019s fine?\u201dGu Sang-woong, who was about to say something, turned nervous, and Baek Ryeon-ha shook her head.It was because they felt how this man was feeling. Although he pretended not to care, he had been unable to rest for the past two days.And Baek Ryeon-ha said to him,\u201cUncle Hae. Uncle Seo is out looking for him, so we wait by trusting him.\u201d\u201cHehe. It is fine, Young Lady.\u201dHae Ack-chun tried to laugh, saying it was fine. He was looking fine now, but even yesterday, he made a fuss about finding out where So Wonhwi was.However, as this man was too huge and stood out, Seo Kalma said he would go and search for Wonhwi; the man was already feeling guilty that Wonhwi fell down due to helping him.\u2018That child. Is he really dead?\u2019As time passed, Hae Ack-chun was turning nervous. After he found the masked man\u2019s dead body, he hoped Wonhwi was alive, but there was a limit to waiting for someone.Staying in one place for more than 2 days was riskier now. And Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s safety was at risk.\u2018Uncle Hae.\u2019Baek Ryeon-ha looked at Hae Ack-chun with sad eyes.Without So Wonhwi, they would have been through many more obstacles. There in her heart, she wanted him to be alive.But there was no hope to look for. If Wonhwi fell from such a height, then his safety could not be guaranteed even if he was skilled.\u2018Young master\u2026\u2019It was unfortunate that they had lost a talented person. If he was alive, he would have done more great things.She only hoped that the pain in Hae Ack-chun\u2019s heart would die down a little and time passed.Everyone was watching while Hae Ack-chun got up,\u201c\u2026 it is time to depart. Young lady.\u201dEveryone felt sorrow in the voice he used to speak,Who would have known that the most eccentric man cared this much for his disciple?\u201cUncle Hae.\u201d\u201cWhat can we do about one\u2019s luck? If we delay any longer, we won\u2019t be safe anymore so\u2026\u201dBefore he even finished it, whispers could be heard from outside, making everyone open the door and go out.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The eyes of the five widened.In the front yard of the place, fifteen warriors in gray robes and Seo Kalma with a young person in a yellow robe and\u2026\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cYou, you jerk!\u201dThe face of Hae Ack-chun, which had looked lost, brightened up.So Wonhwi, who was presumed to be dead, had come back alive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Vice Commander (1)I honestly didn\u2019t expect this.When I was a spy before returning to the past, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for allies to abandon someone depending on the situation.So, of course, I thought everyone would simply give up. But it was different. One of the elders disguised himself as the Murim Alliance warrior and searched for me, and I didn\u2019t know the procession would be halted for two days.Throughout the time we walked here, Second elder Seo Kalma also acted unusually.-Is this how long it takes for him to accept you?I didn\u2019t know about that.Being a disciple of the Fourth Elder was a huge thing but not this much of a huge thing. Or maybe it was Hae Ack-chun or Baek Ryeon-ha who wanted to wait?-As my former master said, our actions depend on how we get treated.-Right, that man knew nothing.Short Sword countered him, but what Iron Sword said was right. It was up to one\u2019s self to create their own value.Whisper!As soon as we arrived at the temple, everyone came out, and the surroundings turned noisy.When I saw the reaction of the warriors, it felt like they were welcoming me. Even Song Jwa-baek,\u201cBrat. It was so boring here.\u201dHe said nothing else, but he seemed to be smiling. I didn\u2019t feel too bad either.At that time, the door to one of the temple rooms opened, and Hae Ack-chun, Baek Ryeon-ha, and Han Baekha, followed by two commanders, came out.\u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cYou, you jerk!\u201dThey couldn\u2019t hide their surprise when they saw me alive.After all, it was a natural reaction to show when they saw someone go down a steep cliff and into the raging currents.Hae Ack-chun\u2019s face was almost lit up with joy. I didn\u2019t know the old man would be like this.-His lips are smiling.But it was only for a while, and he changed his expression to a normal one as he yelled,\u201cYou stupid brat. Didn\u2019t yesterday\u2019s incident happen because of your carelessness?\u201dHe said that, but his eyes didn\u2019t seem to care. Still, I will have to match his plot, so I knelt down on my knee.\u201cI apologize. This disciple has been careless and lacking, causing this disciple to fall for the tricks of the enemy. This disciple is sorry to have caused this concern.\u201d\u201cLook at this guy. Tch tch. You are a long way off.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue and shook his head.Seeing him like that, Baek Ryeon-ha and others smiled softly. If left alone, it seemed like this would continue, so Han Baekha intervened,\u201cFourth elder. Why get angry now? He came back safely, right?\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dHae Ack-chun coughed and pointed to Baek Ryeon-ha,\u201cIf the young lady didn\u2019t order a search for you, then you\u2019d have lost your luck. Thank her.\u201dWith that said, I tried to bow down, but Baek Ryeon-ha shook her head,\u201cIt is nothing. what I did was nothing compared to what the young master did.\u201dHearing her voice, I felt grateful. Finding the spy and risking my life to save her must have been a huge deal for her.Both of them looked happy at me and smiled. Still, humility was the right choice,\u201cNo. it would have been difficult to get out of the valley if the Lady hadn\u2019t sent a search party for me.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be humble. I was just paying back my debt.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cNow isn\u2019t the right time for this, but I think it will be better to do this.\u201d\u2018What?\u2019I was shocked, and she motioned for me to approach her. Not knowing the reason, I just approached her, and as I came in closer, Han Baekha asked me to bow.As I knelt back on one knee, Baek Ryeon-ha opened her mouth,\u201cYoung Master So Won-hwi. In recognition of your work, with great gratitude, I promote you.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019I couldn\u2019t help but be amazed at the shocking decision she made. As soon as I came back, I didn\u2019t think I would get promoted.This was an uproar as the other people of the sect didn\u2019t see this coming. In particular, Song Jwa-baek had his mouth open wide.-He always puts up that crazy expression when you are doing well. Unlike his twin.That was quite a statement.Song Woo-hyun only shows his emotions when food enters his mouth. At that time, Hae Ack-chun said,\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAs I was hesitating about what happened, I quickly clasped my hand and bowed my head. And she touched my head gently and announced,\u201cI hope you continue to fulfill the responsibilities as the vice commander of the Blood Sect.\u201d\u2018Hm.\u2019At those words, I stopped my lips which were twitching, trying to smile.It was because I had just been elevated to a high position. I was pushed to the spot of a vice commander, meaning I was one step down from a commander.-Are you happy?\u2018Of course.\u2019If I become a vice commander, I can have the power to rule over a group of people and lead around three units at once.As long as Hae Ack-chun didn\u2019t want me to continue work according to him. I could have three leaders under me.\u201cI humbly accept.\u201dI stood up. When I got up, the warriors all cheered for me. But they soon stopped.Although this place was located deep in the mountains, this was like a hideout, so making a racket would make us get exposed.\u201cKuahaha!\u201dOf course, no one could stop that old man.\u2018Vice commander\u2026\u2019It all felt too much to me. Before I died, I was a mere spy who could be discarded at any time.At this rate, I wasn\u2019t too far from being a commander.-If three leaders can come under you, then two of them are fixed.I knew what Short Sword was talking about,I looked at Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun. And the man shook his head, not wanting it.Anyway, he was bound to come under me. Song Woo-hyun seemed too lost to even understand what had just happened.Well, I had thought of another one too.-Who?\u2018Cho Sung-won.\u2019He did possess great skills, and in addition, he had the qualities to overcome the wall of a first-rate warrior, so he was good. And another\u2026-No, you want to take her as a disciple?It was Sima Young who I recently discovered.It was no exaggeration to say that she was extremely skilled.This is why Seo Kalma accepted my word and allowed her into the sect.-Can you handle her?\u2018I cannot send her elsewhere.\u2019If I have her on my side, I could be able to plan things for the future. There was only one thing I was concerned about.I looked at Hae Ack-chun,\u201cHuh. I will pay this debt back someday.\u201dHe bluntly said that to Seo Kalma. He could have just said thank you, but no, he had to put it in this odd manner.-What about Hae Ack-chun?\u2018I don\u2019t know how he will respond.\u2019I was planning to reveal her identity to him; no one else could know about it but him. I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to handle her father, Sima Chak, on my own if something happened in the future.-How is it that you use Cho Sang-won and that old man as a shield so well?Short Sword clicked her tongue.At that moment, I heard Sima Young\u2019s words.[Young master, So. Do I have to keep doing this?]Sima Young was standing still, not knowing what to do, and I had forgotten about her as I was too focused on what had just happened to me.Should I do it now? Just when I was about to speak, Baek Ryeon-ha noticed her,\u201cWho is that little one you brought along?\u201d\u201cAh. Young lady.\u201dSeo Kalma, who was talking to Hae Ack-chun, explained it for me.From the fact that she helped me and the reason why she wanted to join the Blood Sect.However, Baek Ryeon-ha had a puzzled face when she heard Sima Young was a woman.\u201cA woman?\u201dWas it because she had the human skin mask on even now?Although she was slender, she had the face of a handsome man. Besides, she hadn\u2019t said a thing till now, so doubting made sense.Huh?But as soon as she heard that this new member was a woman, she looked at Sima Young and me.All she had to do was look at Sima Young, so why look at me?I quickly sent a message to Sima Young.[Miss Sima. She is the highest order among the people here.]After hearing my words, she nodded and knelt down to Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cThank you for allowing me to attend. My name is Sima Young.\u201dPuak!\u201cYou really are a woman.\u201d\u201cI was never a man.\u201dHer voice was bold. And Sima Young\u2019s voice was clear. Baek Ryeon-ha frowned and said,\u201cMiss Sima? Can you take off your mask?\u201d\u201cCan I ever refuse?\u201dShe once again fidgeted with her ears and pulled the mask off. When her face got exposed, everyone exclaimed.That was just how beautiful she was.Baek Ryeon-ha looked beautiful after she lost weight, but Sima Young looked mesmerizing.It wasn\u2019t for nothing that she constantly put the mask on. And Baek Ryeon-ha went back to looking between her and me.Why is she doing it again?!-That is jealousy, Wonhwi.\u2018Jealousy?\u2019-My former master said that women want to look good, and when a man looks at a prettier woman, their mood turns like ice.-Right, your previous master knew nothing more than theories.-Ahem.I had no idea what the two were talking about.Was Baek Ryeon-ha jealous?How can someone aiming to be the sect leader ever have feelings for me? It sounded odd.[Huk. We couldn\u2019t even find anything in that valley, and you go find yourself a girl like that?]It was Hae Ack-chun.He, too, seemed surprised with how Sima Young looked. I hated to deflate his excitement, but I would have to tell him the truth.That way, he would be aiming to take her into us.[Teacher. Can you bring Miss Sima to our side?]At my words, he smirked.[Kulkul. You seem to like her. If that is the case, then I will have to\u2026][I have something to tell you.][What?][\u2026 only teacher can come to know of this.][What are you talking about?]I revealed her secret to Hae Ack-chun who was puzzled.[Miss Sima\u2019s father is Sima Chak, the Wicked Moon Sword.][\u2026?]Hae Ack-chun\u2019s smiling face turned stiff in an instant.It must have been a shock to him. And he looked at Sima Young with a stiff face and then asked me,[\u2026 what the hell did you do?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Vice Commander (2)Since he put it like that, doesn\u2019t it sound like I made some major mistake?Either way, she was previously destined to enter some other faction. If it was possible to acquire her father Sima Chak through this, it was an amazing chance for us-Is it as easy as you say?Iron Sword, who was deeply concerned, questioned me, but the dice had already been cast.[I didn\u2019t do anything. Haven\u2019t you heard Teacher?][That woman came to me on her own two feet.][Right.]Hae Ack-chun looked at Sima Young and clicked his tongue.No matter how eccentric the guy was, he seemed to have a greater reputation for being more reasonable.Yet, his face stiffened as he continued to speak to me.[Seo Kalma doesn\u2019t know about this?][He doesn\u2019t know.][Ha\u2026! Then how did you know?][Some rumors in the eastern vicinity of Guizhou province had made their way to our family once.][What do you mean?][About a hundred dead bodies were found between Honam and Guiju and my family was asked to cooperate to find the cause.][And the cause was the Wicked Moon Sword?][Yes. As a result of finding traces of the battle, it led us to the valley he was staying in and the person we found was Sima Chak.][\u2026 his base.][Like the teacher said. My father and the people of various sects who found it invaded the place\u2026][Of course. But didn\u2019t they know that he is one of the Four Great Evils?][Yes. And everyone was annihilated. No, one person survived by luck.][Your father.][Right.]This much of an explanation seemed enough.Seeing this naturally spin around, it felt like my spying skills hadn\u2019t died yet.-Probably because you are a pathological liar.I cannot hear what you are saying so I will not respond.-You are one item dude.In any case, Hae Ack-chun fell for the lies.[Seeing how this information hasn\u2019t been spread, your father must be ashamed of what happened.]This! He was insulting the lord of the family!To Hae Ack-chun, my father was a person who concealed this fact so that the shame of being the lone survivor wouldn\u2019t be discovered by others-You don\u2019t seem that upset.Well, I was treated like trash in my own family and almost abandoned, why would I feel sorry?Hae Ack-chun narrowed his eyes,[And what are you planning now?]When I was asked for my inner thoughts, I felt half caught[This is gunpowder which we don\u2019t know when it will explode. Bringing something like that into us, you must have lost your mind.][Can\u2019t we think of this in another manner?][Another manner?][If we build a nice relationship with Miss Sima, we may be able to attract her father to us.][Ha! If it was that easy, don\u2019t you think someone would have tried?]Although Hae Ack-chun was quite eccentric, he had a calm mind.He must have judged that the risk was greater than taking her in. But after a year of spending time with him, I learned something[Teacher has spoken, so this matter is simple. If you want to, we can reveal her identity and ask her to go\u2026?]Hae Ack-chun frowned at my words.The second option was a more difficult scenario, if her true identity was revealed after she had just thanked us for allowing her entrance into the sect, that would make the ties that bound us more complicated.[That cannot happen]There was nothing good about pretending to be against the Four Great Evils.[This is troublesome. So, do we need to take the risk? I\u2019d rather let the Second Elder have her if Teacher is fine with that.][What? You mean him?]Hae Ack-chun looked at Seo Kalma. Seeing how Seo Kalma\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t leave Sima Young for even a second, it was almost as if he was already coveting her talent.From the moment she was accepted, I could feel Hae Ack-chun\u2019s expression turn dark.As I had thought, this provocation worked well.-What provocation?\u2018The old man doesn\u2019t like to lose.\u2019To Hae Ack-chun, Sima Young was a troublesome existence.If it was forced on him, that was fine, but he was not willing to hand her over to others as she was too precious.However, it was certain that if he could be convinced that she could attract her father Sima Chak to our side, the results of this could not simply be explained by words.Thinking he said,[Can you take responsibility for this?]Eventually, he let his trepidations go.Well, I did know I was going to be the one to bear the risks. Of course, the instant she became a subordinate of Hae Ack-chun, I would not be the only person responsible.I nodded and tried to answer when Hae Ok-seong took what appeared to be a wooden box to Sima Young.\u2018Uh?\u2019A wooden box with blood parasites in it. However, since she was a talented person close to the level of a vice commander I thought the usual rules wouldn\u2019t apply.But this was a natural process. But will they do it even if they know whose daughter she was?Baek Ryeon-ha soon explained,\u201cMiss Sima. As you might know, our sect is still hiding below the eyes of the greater Murim. No matter how much your allegiance is sworn, we cannot trust you right away.\u201d\u201cThis is natural.\u201dSima Young responded with a firm voice. It felt like she was also prepared to be punished to some extent.\u201cIt feels good to see your resolve. Leader Hae?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dHae Ok-seon opened the lip of the container and under it was a red bug which made Sima Young frown.Who would look happy when they realize they needed to eat that?\u201cOh. I can have it on behalf of her.\u201dI heard Song Jwa-baek mumble next to me. This brat is totally smitten by her appearance.Sima Young, who looked a bit troubled, asked Hae Ok-seon in a lowered voice,\u201cCan I take it down with water?\u201d-Ah, where did I hear this?At Short Sword\u2019s words, I had to choke a smile. This was like looking at me from a year back.Sima Young, who was frowning, closed her eyes and gulped it down.Looking at her blue face I could tell that it was painful, and Baek Ryeon-ha said,\u201cWe sincerely welcome you into our sect.\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha\u2019s voice was so blunt. It was different from when she spoke to me or the elders.\u201cUgh. T-thank you.\u201dSima Young responded, trying to hold back the nausea that was washing over her.Baek Ryeon-ha looked around and said,\u201cNow that this has passed, it is better to decide who will take Miss Sima before we leave.\u201dShe was moving ahead with her duties. And perhaps Second Elder would ask\u2013\u201cSince I recruited her into the sect, I will take responsibility for her till the end.\u201dWith those words, Seo Kalma looked at Han Baekha and Hae Ack-chun.It was a warning to not try to snatch her. It looked like he was fond of her.\u201cFor those who will receive Miss Sima is Uncle Seo\u2026\u201dSh!At that time, Han Baekha moved,\u201cIf Miss Sima is fine with it, I would like her too.\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha was shocked by this.Maybe she didn\u2019t expect that the Bloody Hand Witch would also want to covet this girl.Everyone was anxious to recruit those who were skilled, this was only natural.Muttering to me, Hae Ack-chun said,[I really hope that your judgment turns out to be correct.]Hae Ack-chun was now sure that everyone wanted her. Right. It was better to take her in than let others have her.\u201cMy lady. I would also like to accept her,\u201d said Hae Ack-chun who was also showing his interest.Seo Kalma, who was the first to step up, didn\u2019t like this.The warriors of the Blood Sect watched this with great interest. A rare sight that normally wouldn\u2019t happen during the selection process.In order to attain one talented person, the Blood Star and Venerable Dignitaries came out willing to fight.\u201cTch.\u201dIn the meantime, I could see Gu Sang-woong hating this.He also wanted to take in Sima Young, maybe it was due to the loss of his other subordinates or her appearance but unfortunately, he had too many strong competitors here.\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that all three would want her. I will give the chance to Miss Sima.\u201dEven if she didn\u2019t take the test, her strength was guaranteed by the Second Elder.-Would this happen if her identity was known?\u2018Nope.\u2019Even the Ghastly Monster Hae Ack-chun was hesitant to touch her, so why would the others be willing?\u201cCould the three elders briefly introduce themselves?\u201dThe rules of the selection process were being followed. Now they had to appeal to her.-As you predicted.Of course. This was a fixed procedure.If she chose Seo Kalma or Han Baekha we would lose her. Preparing for this, I had to say one thing.I have to tell her to choose Hae Ack-chun,[Sima\u2026.]Just as I was about to send her a message.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dUh?Sima Young raised her hand to speak to Baek Ryeon-ha who was looking at her with curiosity.\u201cIf I have the choice here, can I go under the person I want to?\u201d\u201cYes. Have you decided who it will be?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSima Young nodded her head making Seo Kalma believe that it would be him.He seemed convinced that he was the one who she would choose. But Sima Young turned her head to me with a smile.\u2018Uh?\u2019This was good, even if I didn\u2019t ask her, she was choosing Hae Ack-chun. Then I could ask her for another favor.Baek Ryeon-ha asked,\u201cWho do you want to go under?\u201dAt those words, everyone focused their attention on her. Everyone wanted to know who she was going to choose.\u201cYah. I have decided.\u201dSuddenly, Song Jwa-baek mumbled.What?With a happy face, he said,\u201cDid you see her looking at me just now? She will come to our side.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2019-\u2026 what is with this guy?That is what I wanted to say, as Iron Sword said,-My former master said that the more na\u00efve one is the more easily they fall in love.-Right! Right, your former master knew all this so why didn\u2019t he get married?-Ahem!He keeps saying former master this, former master that, so I wondered what kind of existence he was to Iron Sword.And in that instant, Sima Young said,\u201cI\u2026\u201dPerhaps it was because she smiled at me, both Seo Kalma and Hae Ack-chun looked at each other anxiously, and then came the unexpected words.\u201cI want to join as the subordinate of Vice Commander So Wonhwi.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019In an instant, everyone had turned to look at me.So embarrassing!Naturally, I was expecting everyone to look at Hae Ack-chun. But now, I could not even use the old man as my shield.\u201c\u2026 you want to join as the Young Master\u2019s subordinate?\u201dAsked Baek Ryeon-ha as she looked at me.Not just her, every other man here was looking at me with jealous eyes.Song Jwa-baek was no exception, mumbling to himself, \u201cWhy you?!\u201d\u2019\u2018This is insane.\u2019If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn\u2019t have requested her.I was going to die of embarrassment when Sima Young looked at me and asked \u2018Did I do well?\u2019 with her innocent face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - Ikyang So Family (1)[Hehe. So this is the outcome?]I covered my face with my palm at the sound of Hae Ack-chun\u2019s laughter in my head.This, didn\u2019t it seem like I had already planned for this since the start?I wanted to explain it to him, but then I began to hear Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s words,[Young Master seems quite skilled. A beautiful person wants to come under your umbrella just like that.]Unlike usual, she was speaking with a cold look on her face.She definitely seemed to have misunderstood this. This had confirmed the thoughts she held back when we were training the illusion technique\u2013I was being branded as a womanizer for sure now.I had to explain myself.-Too late. Just accept it.Late? What is late? I need to correct this.-What good would knowing the truth do? Understand that you are too late to perform any countermeasures.\u2018\u2026\u2019I was speechless.It seems like this bloody atmosphere was saying that everyone thought ill of me.Sima Young only expressed her intention to join me, but why did I feel like I had turned into a public enemy?It felt as if I would soon be struck with an iron plate. And Baek Ryeon-ha spoke in a dry voice,\u201cThe results have been decided. Miss Sima is going to move under Vice Commander So.\u201d-From Young Master So to Vice Commander So.\u2018\u2026\u2019It was chilly in the early summer.When such results were announced, Seo Kalma looked quite disappointed.I didn\u2019t dare make any eye contact, as I didn\u2019t want any more hate being directed at me.\u201cThen let\u2019s get ready and move.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith her orders falling, the warriors all moved in unison.My clothes were prepared by the procession before I came. And clearly, my rank was doing well.-They all have blood parasites right?Well, true.It was also semi-compulsory to follow the higher-ranked warrior. So it was no exaggeration to say that she needed to be taught as she hadn\u2019t received any training in the Six Blood Valley.\u201cYah!\u201dFuck!It was Son Jwa-baek, his eyes blazing,\u201cWhat have you done to Miss Sima to make her come under\u2026\u201d\u201cVice Commander!\u201dThe moment he wanted to relieve his anger, Sima Young called.And when I turned, she was running to my side.-Like a pet dog.Before she acted like a ferocious viper, but now she had on a bright face.Thanks to her innocent face, the position I had fixed myself over the years had been shaken.As she approached, Song Jwa-baek\u2019s angry face melted.-I guess he really liked her.\u201cM-Miss Sima.\u201d-Oh my, look at him stuttering.Right.Like any young man or woman.-Well she is pretty.Right.She was slim and beautiful. It wasn\u2019t for nothing that the warriors of the Blood Sect were jealous of me.But they had no idea about her-Wonhwi. You are the man\u2018\u2026!?\u2019I almost spat the water out of my mouth.-What? You are the real man?No, what nonsense is this?When I have someone I like, my heart will pound hard and my heart would not simply be swayed by the beauty of someone.-Huh?I have seen too many cases of beauties hiding the thorns on them. When I was a spy in the Murim Alliance, I had seen it all too clearly.-Been through some bad times?\u2018\u2026 no.\u2019-Only in the past?Let\u2019s skip over that part.And there were only a handful of women in Murim who were pure.I had realized early on that the more beautiful or higher the status, the more important it was to build a friendship with them.\u201cVice Commander, did I do well?\u201dSima Young spoke with twinkling eyes as if openly begging for me to praise her.Do I have to say she did good?-She is the daughter of one of the Four Great Evils, Wonhwi,Iron Sword warned me in a low voice. Right, she was the daughter of Sima Chak.I had to be patient with her. But since I had taken her in, I had to teach her a couple of things.\u201cMiss. At times like this\u2026\u201dSong Jaw-baek interrupted,\u201cMiss Sima. My name is Song Jwa-baek, companion of this guy, no, Vice Commander So.\u201dHe spoke while trying to hide the anger rising in his voice, as Short Sword said,-This idiot pretending to be something he isn\u2019t.Don\u2019t tease him too much.At this age, it was natural to want to look good for the person you liked. Well, it was a time when the world felt nice.But I was curious.This guy, who would become one of the Black and White Twins 10 years from now, acted like this.\u201cYou are a companion of Vice Commander So?\u201d She asked, tilting her head.I think I could understand her doubt.It was because Song Jwa-baek didn\u2019t seem like anything more than a first-rate warrior.She was puzzled.Wait. Come to think of it, it was strange how she chose me like this.I\u2019m also someone who gives out the feeling of a first-rate warrior. Surely, she didn\u2019t think I was some expert warrior just because I was flying through the air with the silver thread, right?\u201cHaha. I don\u2019t look like it, right? I look a little more manly than him.\u201dIn order to make himself look good, he clenched his forearm muscles.\u201cAh. Yes.\u201dShe nodded as if she wasn\u2019t interested in him\u201cVice Commander! Vice Commander!\u201d\u201cOnce is enough, Miss.\u201d\u201cI said that the only face I know is you, so I came under you. Did I do well?\u201dUh?Was that the only reason? That was it?I would be happy if you said you had some ulterior motive.Maybe she saw me gazing at Seo Kalma, but Sima Young fiddled with the hair under her ear and smiled,\u201cI am kind of scared of others. The only scary person I want to be with is my father.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Well, I could imagine that, since her father was one of the Four Great Evils. Still, I had to teach her the basic etiquette of the sect here.If she made some mistake, everyone would put the blame on me, and not her. But it was Song Jwa-baek who intervened.\u201cMiss Sima. Our teacher isn\u2019t that easy either, he is scary too.\u201dHe was joking around in a low voice, but she didn\u2019t respond to it, almost as if she was uninterested.Her eyes wouldn\u2019t leave me! And thanks to this, Song Jwa-baek was glaring at me.\u201cWhat are you people doing!? Stop messing around and get ready to move!\u201dHae Ack-chun who was talking with Baek Ryen-ha, Seo Kalma and Han Baekha yelled at us.Sima Young smiled as she whispered,\u201cI think it is like this.\u201dThis isn\u2019t what I said.After a fortnight.Kaifeng city with the merchant union.There was a manor full of flowers. In the middle of this manor was a woman with red hair sitting cross-legged in a luxurious and comfortable chair as she fanned her body.Her appearance looked so harmonious with the colorful flowers.However, a scene that didn\u2019t seem to suit her was happening just right in front of her.\u201cHuak that is it.\u201dA large man which his whole body tied up with rope spoke with difficulty. His clothes were stained with blood and his face was full of bruises.The middle-aged man spoke in a voice of regret,\u201cI carried out my mission despite losing my subordinates. But it\u2026\u201dPinch!\u201cAccck!\u201dSomeone poked a finger into the shoulder of the man. Behind him stood a six foot tall man.He was Jang Ryong, the First Blood Star.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to answer only the questions you are asked?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026you bastard!\u201d\u201cLooks like you have enough strength.\u201d\u201cUghh. I held up my end of the deal!\u201d\u201cYou are the one who failed your mission and ran away alone.\u201dPoke!Jang Ryong\u2019s finger dug deeper into the middle-aged man called Oh Gal.The pain was too much for his body to handle.\u201cAaaack! Stop it! Stop!\u201d\u201cStop what?\u201dJang Ryong smiled. He was the kind who enjoyed others\u2019 pain.\u201cUghh. Please\u2026 please have mercy on me. There was no mention of Elder Seo Kalma being there.\u201dJang Ryong ignored the request, almost as if he had no intention of letting the man live. In a panic, Oh Gal spoke as if he had remembered something.\u201cS-still just as Jang Ryong instructed, my Sajae killed So Wonhwi, the disciple of\u2026\u201dPoke!\u201cKuak!\u201dIt was before he finished speaking, that his neck was broken.The smile on the face of Jang Ryong vanished.And it was thenChak!\u2018Huh.\u2019Something passed by Jang Ryong\u2019s ear. It was a splendid sword that cracked the ground it had embedded itself into.Jang Ryong immediately knelt down on one knee toward the master of the sword.Tat!There was a woman with red hair, Baek Hye-hyang who looked at him with displeasure.\u201cMy lady.\u201d\u201cThe story changed a bit.\u201d\u201cThere seems to be some misunderstanding.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang fed up with the excuses, smiled,\u201cMisunderstand? Me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d\u201c\u2026 to bring the Fourth Elder down on his knees for you.\u201d\u201cAnd is that this?\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dJang Ryong bowed his head but his face was stained with irritation. Blood trickled down his ear which had been cut by the sword.\u2018All because of him?\u2019He could guess why.Baek Hye-hyang who come back from the Valley spoke about a guy called So Wonhwi and his clever tricks, and she was clearly interested in him.Come to think of it, a year back there was a time when she showed great interest in him.And she was the kind to turn possessive of what she liked.\u2018She cannot be curious about him, right?\u2019Surely if he was talented enough for her to want to covet him it was fine. But he, the First Blood Star, didn\u2019t like it.It was a warning to the people to show that she could steal even the elders if she wanted to. But he didn\u2019t think she would be hung up on this one.\u201cThis is no fun.\u201dHer cold laugh filled with killing intent.Jang Ryong\u2019s heart began to pound. If it was before half a year the situation would be different, but now she had surpassed him.Her growth was terrifying.\u2018Blood of the Blood Demon\u2026\u2019More than anyone else, she had the blood of the Blood Demon.That was why he supported her, ignoring everything else.Pak!Jang Ryong pulled out her sword which was lodged into the ground and grabbed the edge of her sword with the other hand and put it to his neck.\u201cIf you want something in return, I will give you my life.\u201d\u201cSuch a pity. He was a nice guy.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang shook her head. And then spoke to him in a cold voice,\u201cDon\u2019t act out and put your sword down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dJang Ryong, who hesitated for a moment, quietly lowered his sword. Of course, he too had no intention of dying here.He was only acting to calm her anger. As long as the composition of the power struggle was clear, she wouldn\u2019t give him up.It was then.Tak!A warrior jumped into the room, bowed to Baek Hye-hyang, and said,\u201cIt has just been announced by the United Warriors at the meeting with the Murim Alliance.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJang Ryong got up in surprise.The long-awaited event had come and Jang Ryong looked at Baek Hye-hyang.She mumbled with a smile,\u201cThe time has come.\u201dIt has been a month since the valley was abandoned.In Jiangkou County southeast of Guizhou province.In a spacious manor located on the outskirts of it, prepared by commander Jang Mun-wong.Normally, this was the place where Hae Ack-chun was preparing to raise us all, but since he decided to support Baek Ryeon-ha, this was being used to support the troops.The subordinates of the Second Elder and the Bloody Hand Witch would soon gather here too.According to Hae Ack-chun, Baek Ryeon-ha has been wandering around the Jianghu for ten years. And even if it wasn\u2019t the Murim Alliance, the people of Baek Hye-hyang had been targeting her.And now things have changedShe, too, has grown to some extent.She had two of the venerable dignitaries on her side and one Blood Star who decided to follow her.Baek Ryeon-ha now had the force on her side and she sent messengers with letters to the Second Blood Star.As the alliance of greater Murim broke down faster than expected, the conflict within the Blood Sect would accelerate too.I, who was in the outer training hall, entered the manor.-Why were you suddenly called?\u2018Well.\u2019This was an emergency summons.Executives such as Hae Ack-chun, Seo Kalma, and Han Baekha discussed most matters but seeing how they had called me, it seemed like something was happening.Thanks to this, I was hurriedly moving to the place I was called. However, on the way to the main hall, I ran into someone.\u2018Uh?\u2019It was Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun. And Song Jwa-baek spoke with a sad face,\u201cWhat? You were called too?\u201dThat is what I want to say!Seeing that these two were called too, I was even more confused now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - Ikyang So Family (2)I took the lead while Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun followed behind.Tak!\u201cDid you call for us?\u201d\u201cCome here all three of you.\u201dWhen we entered the main hall, we could see Baek Ryeon-ha and Hae Ack-chun along with Seo Kalma, Han Baek-ha, and Jang Mun-wong sitting around a long table.On the table, there was a map of Jianghu spread out with several other open books littering the sides.\u201c\u2026\u201dSong Jwa-baek\u2019s expression stiffened with the heavy atmosphere. What was happening here?\u201cCommander Jang.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dAt Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s call, the man finally spoke,\u201cYoung master, there is an assignment for you.\u201d\u201cAssignment\u2026 a mission?\u201dSong Jwa-baek seemed a bit excited at the word mission. Except for us, everyone else was focused on training.So they were looking forward to hearing what this mission was.\u2018Mission\u2026\u2019But I was different.Before \u2018the return\u2019, I was always worried when a mission was assigned to me.Will I be able to survive the mission? One of the many concerns I had. And I didn\u2019t even know what this mission was.-Worried?\u2018Of course.\u2019The duties of the Blood Sect varied in severity, but all of them were dangerous.I was curious.What was the mission that required them to hand it down to the most skilled disciples of one of the elders?At that time, Jang Mun-woong held out two letters and said,\u201cThese were sent by Third Elder.\u201d\u2018Third Elder?\u2019Third Elder, it had to be Gu Jae-yang the Blood King.It meant that they sent a letter and this was the reply.\u201cAnd this is the letter from the Second Blood Star.\u201dThe second Blood Star had to be Yu Baek.Along with Seo Kalma, he was one of the best ones in the Blood Sect. From what I heard, among the seven Blood Stars, his martial arts were known to be on a superior level.In order to secure an advantage, it was said that two people were needed.-Then the third elder wasn\u2019t abandoned?It was almost like giving up.Seo Kalma had said that he almost leaned toward Baek Hye-hyang. So he knew that this letter was just being sent with dulled anticipation.\u201cThe contents of the letters are different, but coincidentally they both have the same requirements.\u201dUh?The same?The fact that the requirements were written down meant that there was a possibility of tilting here.However, the requirements were similar.\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\u201cSecond Blood Star said that only those with the necessary qualifications would be followed, and Third Elder said that he would recognize the person who inherited the Blood Demon Sword of the sect leader.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Blood Demon Sword?That was crazy!I was speechless for a moment.Judging from what I had heard so far, did it mean that they would come over to our side if it was stolen back?-Why are you so surprised?\u2018If my prediction is correct, that is impossible.\u2019It could not be possibleBlood Demon Sword.The God of the Blood Sect and a sword that only the sect leader could hold. I had heard that it was made from rare materials, and it required the blood of the wielder to work.20 years back, the sword passed into the hands of the Murim Alliance after the death of the Blood Demon.-And they want it back?Even Short Sword looked surprised now.The Blood Demon Sword was located in the core of the Murim Alliance and not in any other place. Even before the return, the Blood Sect had sent many people to reclaim it back, but none of them had succeeded.All were dead.And not just any death, but they were tortured and had to beg to be killed.-No. What was the point of having one sword?\u2018What about the history? Isn\u2019t that important?\u2019-Ah\u2026Symbolism and purpose.The title \u2018Sacred things\u2019 wasn\u2019t given for nothing. The most known weapons in any sect weren\u2019t short of being honored as treasures.The Blood Sect, which had lost one of its sacred items to the Murim Alliance, had lost its symbol.So, even before returning, many were sacrificed and I knew the sword hadn\u2019t been reclaimed.\u201cThen, is it our job to find the Blood Demon Sword?\u201dSong Jwa-baek, who didn\u2019t know about it, showed his will to attempt the task. Jang Mun-woong shook his head and said,\u201cThe location of the Blood Demon Sword is well known. It is in the main base of the Murim Alliance.\u201d\u201cThen, are we to take it back?\u201dJwa-baek.This enthusiasm was too much. It wasn\u2019t so easy to do that.I couldn\u2019t even open my mouth at the bad feeling I was getting. Hae Ack-chun clicked his tongue and said,\u201cYah. If it could be done this easily, we would have gotten it back a long time ago.\u201dSong Jwa-baek went silent at this. Thanks to this, I learned a good thing.Fortunately, this wasn\u2019t a mission to reclaim the sword and Hae Ack-chun looked at me,\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cWhat do I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you think the two of them made such a request?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s questions, everyone turned to me. Looking at this it seemed like they wanted to know what was the hidden intention behind these letters.But there wasn\u2019t much to be inferred from this alone.\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 this disciple doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent, and it must be difficult to grasp the meaning behind the two, but there are three things I can guess.\u201d\u201cThree things?\u201dSong Jwa-baek asked. I didn\u2019t care and continued to talk,\u201cThe first that can be said is that they want to turn us down by putting us through an impossible request.\u201dA respectful manner to Bae Ryeon-ha who had the blood of the Blood Demon.Seo Kalma and Han Baekha nodded their heads at my words. Looking at this, they seemed to have the same thought.Baek Ryeon-ha said,\u201cSecond one?\u201d\u201c\u2026 giving The Lady a chance. This opens up a ton of possibilities.\u201dAt that, Song Jwa-baek nodded his head as he had the same thought.\u201cDo you really think so?\u201dI shook my head at Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s question.\u201cYes, in fact, this is the least likely. In the first place, Third Elder revealed his intentions to Second Elder. He could not easily change his mind with just one letter.\u201dAt my words, Hae Ack-chun leaned back on the chair and smiled.Does this mean this was close to the right answer?Baek Ryeon-ha asked,\u201cBoth of them make sense. Then the last one?\u201d\u201c\u2026 a trap.\u201dAt those words, Song Jwa-baek looked, me asking, \u2018What the fuck does that mean?\u2019That was a natural reaction as the two options I had said were fundamentally different.A few seemed interested when I said that it was a trap.\u201cWhy do you think it is a trap, Young Master?\u201dThis time, it was the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baekha who asked.The last one took a different approach.Before returning to this new life, when I was a spy in the Murim Alliance, there was a saying one damned man told me.\u2018Looking one move ahead is estimating how the opponent will come out from your point of view, and looking two moves ahead is estimating how the opponent will come to us from the opponent\u2019s point of view.\u2019He did backstab me, but his advice was quite helpful.-The back of the head? You mean\u2026-Right, it was that bastard who told you that. Baek Wei-hyang of the Murim Alliance.As one of the three heads of the alliance, he was great at tactics. I took a breath and opened my mouth.\u201cThat is because we cannot rule out the possibility that the two names have already been taken by Baek Hye-hyang\u2026\u201d\u201cTaken?\u201d\u201cIf I was on Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s side, I would use this as a trap. It could be a ruse to waste our resources in other useless places.\u201dThere was a possibility of this.If we try to retrieve the Blood Demon Sword somehow to gain an edge in the power struggle, the other side\u2019s power would definitely fall.Well, I am not entirely sure of this. Guessing would be a lot easier if I actually got to read from the letter, but I could only come to this conclusion after listening to what they had told me.A faint smile appeared on the face of Han Baekha,\u201cThe insight of the Young Master is remarkable.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dEveryone glanced at her. The others also nodded their heads when Jang Mun-wong asked,\u201cSuch a brilliant Young Master. I didn\u2019t think you could guess so much from the little information I had given you. The last option you gave is probably what we would have decided on if we had no further information.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThere is another letter.\u201dThis time, he handed me the letter.Song Jwa-baek put his head close to mine to read and Song Woo-hyun\u2026 he was too overwhelmed just listening to all of this.After reading this, both Song Jwa-baek and I couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cThis?\u201d\u201cThis is the letter that Gu hyung sent to the elder,\u201dSaid Seo Kalma.This could be seen from the addressed greeting of the letter.The letter was sent to Seo Kalma by Gu Jae-yang, the Blood King, and it was written that he would remain neutral until the Mid-Autumn Festival.And it was currently three months after the festival.It would have been difficult to trust it if this was the only content, but it was written that if Baek Hye-hyang took the sword first, then there would be no more neutral position.\u201cYou mean Baek Hye-hyang is aiming for the Blood Demon Sword?\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand this.Did she have the force to enter the base of the Murim Alliance?I was too puzzled when Han Baekha said,\u201cJust as lady Baek Hye-hyang put a spy on our side, we too put one on her side.\u201dI heard this and only then realized.Baek Hye-hang, who had known little of the power on our side, could easily insert a spy. However, our spy on her side, who was stronger, would drain the quality of the information.\u201cBut why are you so sure of this?\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha answered my question,\u201cThat is because my sister postponed the opening ceremony.\u201dThe opening ceremony was an event to announce the resurrection of the Blood Sect to greater Murim.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Come to think of it, even before the return, the Murim Alliance and the Warriors Alliance had broken their alliance and then the Blood Sect officially declared their revival.-Is this different from your memory?It had changed.From the point of view of the Blood Sect, they could not miss this chance.So I didn\u2019t understand why Baek Hye-hyang delayed the opening ceremony in order to get the sword.-Don\u2019t you have another thought as to why?\u2018Still\u2026 ah!\u2019-What is it?Why didn\u2019t I think of this?It wasn\u2019t just the timing of the break up of the alliance which had changed with my return.-What is it?\u2018The power within the Blood Sect.\u2019Before the return, it wasn\u2019t even known that Baek Ryeon-ha was alive. However, if my senses were serving me right, there was a high chance that Baek Ryeon-ha before the return had been rather cornered in the past.-Right. That was because you ended up turning into a disciple of that man.As Short Sword had said.After becoming I became his disciple, Hae Ack-chun sought all sorts of things to get my dantian healed, and I ended up connecting with Baek Ryeon-ha and he then began supporting her.As a result, Seo Kalma was also under Baek Ryeon-ha now.This made it tough for Baek Hye-hyang to touch her carelessly.-Can it not be solved with force?\u2018No. She will avoid that.\u2019No matter how reckless Baek Hye-hyang was, that was too unreasonable. An internal war wouldn\u2019t suit anyone other than the recently broken-up alliance within Murim.They will avoid killing their own men and aim to rise high in prestige for now.\u2018I see.\u2019And since Baek Ryeon-ha must have been killed in the past, there would have been no difficulty in uniting their force and taking the sword. And now, even if she had a low legitimacy she was still the blood of the Blood Demon\u2018In the end, it was me.\u2019Everything changed because of me.Baek Ryeon-ha looked at me with a serious face and said,\u201cMe and my sister have no choice but to bump into each other constantly. But there is one way to avoid this and unite our strength into one.\u201d\u201c\u2026the Blood Demon Sword.\u201d\u201cRight. As long as we have the sacred item of the sect, all the people will have to follow the one.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same for us?\u201dAt my question, Baek Ryeon-ha had a bitter expression.The same was true for the others around.If the Blood Demon Sword fell into her sister\u2019s hand, then everyone in the Blood Sect would have to follow her.A person with a sacred item would become like the new Blood Demon.\u201cThen, how do we get the sword?\u201d\u201cLook here.\u201dJang Mun-wong unfolded a large paper. On the right side of it, in large letters was written that a Murim Tournament was being held.Come to think of it, as the alliance fell down and some spies were revealed in the Blood Sect, the Murim Alliance held a tournament.\u201cWhat about this?\u201dSong Jwa-baek asked, a bit puzzled.The Murim Tournament was literally a tournament where all sects will come together. It was then I noticed that something was written on the announcement.\u201c\u2026 are you talking about this?\u201dI pointed my finger at something and Jang Mun-wong nodded and said,\u201cThe three of you must participate in this tournament and one of the three of you needs to win it at all costs.\u201dAhh\u2026The ominous feeling we had before.The winnings of the tournament were being put up by the Blue Dragon Leader, and a weapon of the Murim Alliance would be awarded to the winner of the tournament.-No. So you\u2019re saying that we need to win and bring back that sword?It seems like that. Pure insanity.-Was there a tournament like this before you returned?\u2018Of course there was.\u2019-\u2026 then there was a chance then, so why didn\u2019t the Blood Sect aim for it?Short Sword pointed this out. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know if the Blood Sect did retrieve it or not. Even if they had tried, then they must have failed-Why?Actually, it was likely this was a tournament where the winner had been decided.-Decided?In the alliance, a monster no one could defeat was sent to raise the morale of the people who felt scared after the alliance had broken up.-A monster?\u2018Monster. Because it was one of the Eight Great Masters.\u2019-A battle with one of the Eight Great Masters!Short Sword looked shocked.Even she seemed to understand the implicit problem; that only the main leadership of the Murim Alliance and I would know about this monster participating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Ikyang So Family (3)Obtain the Blood Demon Sword by winning this martial arts tournament.It sounded so simple when saying it, but nothing was that easy. Especially with the conditions for winning being so difficult.-Do they not know?Can they know? It was a monster that the Murim Alliance had kept secret.-Then he shouldn\u2019t be qualified as a late-stage martial artist right?The late-stage was one thing, the only problem was that the starting point for everyone was different.Moreover, it hadn\u2019t been long since the official notice of this poster had been distributed, so no one could know everyone who would participate in it.\u201cI think my sister will aim for this.\u201dThat meant that Baek Hye-hyang will be sending someone from her side.\u2018Hmm.\u2019That was worrying. This mission had too many loopholes and was extremely dangerous.Was it fine with so many variables? Baek Ryeon-ha looked at my contorted face and asked for my thoughts,\u201cYou seem to have something to say.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, after opening my mouth, I realized that just saying it was better.\u201c\u2026 are you sure that you have a defense prepared for this mission?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t her who answered my question but Jang Mun-wong,\u201cThere are so many things at stake with this mission, it is a life or death scenario. The operation will not be in vain. Do not worry about it.\u201dJang Mun-wong seemed very confident. Last time he was the scheming mind behind the escape from the Six Blood Valley.Hae Ack-chun had brought him, and Baek Ryeon-ha said,\u201cIf you have any problems, speak frankly. I would like to hear your insights.\u201dHae Ack-chun nodded like he was fine with me speaking.\u201cApart from winning it, would the Murim Alliance accept the sword being asked as a prize?\u2019This is one of my concerns.Not knowing about the others here, the sword is being asked as a reward. And it was doubtful if the Murim Alliance would just pass it on.-Wouldn\u2019t we be lucky if they don\u2019t doubt us?As Short Sword said, there is a high chance of the winner being extremely suspected of being related to the sect. At my words, Hae Ack-chun laughed,\u201cHehe. Would they give it to you just like that?\u201dHuh?So, did they think of this too?Jang Mun-wong got up and brought something.A box made of wood, long enough for a sword to fit in.Tak!When they opened the box, there were several swords in it. All the swords were of the same shape, length, and pattern.\u201cThis is?\u201dI was puzzled when he pulled out one sword and showed me something strange.Swish!The sword could be bent and folded making even Song Jwa-baek lose his voice.Jang Mun-wong smiled and said,\u201cIs this a good enough answer?\u201d\u2018Ha!\u2019So this is why they were leaving these days, to make this? Now I had an idea of what these people had planned.But I wanted to hear more,\u201cSo, what do we do with this?\u201dEven if I understood, Song Jwa-baek didn\u2019t.This guy was so close to being relegated to a muscle-headed fighter.He barely understood so Jang Mun-wong had to explain explicitly,\u201cOver the past decades, our sect has made countless attempts to somehow recapture the sword. As the failures accumulated, we were able to collect a lot of information about the base of the alliance. And this tournament is one of the times when the armory is opened.\u201dInformation and opportunity? Maybe we had a chance.\u201cIs there no problem then?\u201dAsked Song Jwa-baek.\u201cBut commander\u2026 isn\u2019t the tournament a place only those with a name or a suitable sect can participate?\u201d-Yah. Even Jwa-baek could use his head at times.Short Sword made fun of how simple his mind worked, but this was a natural question to be curious about.Because our status was only valid in the Blood Sect. Jang Mun-wong answered this question with a smile,\u201cFortunately, none of the sects out there know that the Young Masters are the loyal members of the sect. Even your family doesn\u2019t.\u201dAs expected.That was the reason why we were the ones getting assigned to this mission.The twins of the So family and I were from the famous Ikyang So family.Song Jwa-baek\u2019s face darkened.-He is beginning to understand.Neither of the twins nor I had ever had a good position in the family.It would be kind to call me the trash and the fool they abandoned, but the twins weren\u2019t well treated either.However, they must not have expected that their family would be reconnected like this.It was quite a strange situation. Becoming a member of the sect here and then returning to the family.-Come to think of it, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to end your family with your own hands?Short Sword recalled what I had said previously, but now things were tricky.\u201c\u2026 do we really have to represent our family and participate?\u201d\u201cYes. That is the basic qualification.\u201dRight.The first set of hurdles had been passed. Obtaining the qualifications to represent a faction was a major part of this plan.-So you\u2019re not ending your family\u2026 but representing them?I felt bad.Do I have to meet those people again?Hae Ack-chun looked at the twins and said,\u201cHuh! Wouldn\u2019t it be blasphemous if the disciples of mine were unable to have a good position in their family?\u201dHe was trying to encourage us. But, the Ikyang So family was a prestigious family sect that was said to have many warriors.And it is counted among the top places in Hunan province and was as great as one of the Five Great Families.Of course, from their point of view, our family had to be no less than a provincial family sect.\u2018\u2026 beat everyone and use the name of my family?\u2019I felt anger rise within me, but I calmed it down.\u2018Maybe this is a chance?\u2019A rather good one too.Bound by blood ties, so I did want to have a bond.And it happened too quickly. And I am different from who I was. The me then with my dantian destroyed and having been abandoned as valueless was not the me of now.\u201cTake this.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dHae Ack-chun threw a teacup at the table.Shh!He didn\u2019t throw it, more like made sure it came right into my hand, gently.If he had used his strength the teacup would have shattered.Wheik!Rotating the teacup in the hand I killed the internal qi he threw it with. And after rotating in my hand for a while, the teacup settled to a stop.Hae Ack-chun smiled,\u201cYour internal qi has grown.\u201dHan Baekha who was next to him smiled.\u201cHe must have absorbed the pill\u201d\u201cPill? Did the Sixth Blood Star give a pill?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTo be precise, it was Baek Ryeon-ha who had given it to me. After arriving here, she said she would accept the talks we had before.And I asked for a pill to make up for the lack of my internal qi and I had absorbed it last night.\u201cKulkul, if this is it, then not a single one of those bastards can touch your toes.\u201dHae Ack-chun spoke with a satisfied voice.As he said, considering that everyone would be around my age and first-rate warriors, I was at least above them.\u201cHow much time did you say?\u201dAt Hae Ack-chun\u2019s words, Jang Mun-wong looked at us and said,\u201cThe tournament will be held in about 2 months\u2019 time, so considering the length of time the Young Masters will have to go Hunan; the work should be finished in a fortnight.\u201d\u201cHear that? Don\u2019t let me down.\u201dUntil the next full moon.15 days, quite a tight schedule.We have to change locations and go to the place where I was called a fool.Tak!At the time, Song Jwa-baek bowed and spoke,\u201cWe will not disappoint you. As the representative of our sect, I will definitely win the competition and bring the Blood Demon Sword to the Lady.\u201dJang Mun-woong scratched his head at those words. And a bit hesitantly he said,\u201cUm\u2026 Young Master. Your role isn\u2019t to win.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIt is the job of the Young Master to eliminate as many candidates as possible and help Young Master So Wonhwi reclaim the sword.\u201dAt his words, Song Jwa-baek\u2019s expression distorted.He thought he was being entrusted with a heavy duty, but it was almost like an assistant and his pride seemed a bit deflated.Perhaps he was feeling a bit of resentment too, but to ease this Jang Mun-woong added,\u201cIt isn\u2019t because the Young Master is ineffective, but because this mission requires obtaining a sword, and the role of Young Master So as someone who has learned the swordsmanship of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman is important, so do not misunderstand\u2026\u201dListening to his soothing words, I could understand why he was always put in charge. I have a sword technique that the Orthodox sects could accept.And the twins on the other hand had learned their techniques from Hae Ack-chun, so they could not simply demonstrate them to the world.At that time, Song Woo-hyun who was blankly staring at them spoke,\u201c\u2026give us the chance to prove ourselves.\u201dHe spoke softly but his intentions were shown. Could it be he spoke on behalf of his brother?\u201cYou?\u201dSong Jwa-baek looks a bit surprised.\u201cIt isn\u2019t\u2026\u201dJang Mun-woong cut in and tried to clear it up, but Hae Ack-chun intervened,\u201cAre you confident?\u201d\u201cElder!\u201dJang Mun-wong tried to deter him but Song Jwa-baek who was back to his courageous form began to take a few steps back and display his technique of kicking.Papak!The destructive and soft technique that Hae Ack-chun had shown previously.They felt the need to learn more techniques, so they were recently learning some more from him.However, looking at the soft and unobstructed movement it felt like they were able to achieve it at a level I couldn\u2019t.-They were hiding this.Seeing that he didn\u2019t show it till now, this was his trump card.This guy was definitely gifted. Jang Mun-wong\u2019s expression had changed.With this level of skill, no one could think that this was an unorthodox technique.Hae Ack-chun chuckled and looked to the side,\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201dBaek Ryeon-ha who was looking at Song Jwa-baek smiled and mumbled,\u201cThe more the opponents lose the better.\u201dAfter 8 days.North of Yulang county in Hunan province.A vast manor thousands of square meters large was present and the signboard hanging on it read,Ikyang So FamilyThe pride of the county. Like noble warriors representing the Hunan, even the gatekeepers guarding it had proud appearances.They were just gatekeepers, but they were still second-rate warriors.And they took great pride in being members of this family. But, even they were losing to the sweltering heat.\u201cUgh. So hot.\u201d\u201cWe cannot even get a little shadow.\u201dIt was so hot that they were fanning with their hands. But that was never enough to cool the heat.The hot summer noon was heating up the ground and their gaze ahead was turning hazy.\u201cHow long until the next shift?\u201d\u201cSince it is noon\u2026 another hour is left\u2026 Uh?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cSomeone is coming?\u201dThe eyes of the gatekeepers turned ahead and they looked at three people in bamboo hats walking in the heat.The one in lead was wearing an iron sword wrapped in cloth on their back and one of the two men was dressed like a scholar with a wooden box behind him.The only man with bare hands didn\u2019t have a weapon, and the gatekeeper could tell that they were Murim people.\u201cMurim.\u201d\u201cStand upright.\u201dSh!Despite being in the heat, they stood tall.They didn\u2019t know because they weren\u2019t informed about the guests who were comingChak!The gatekeepers put their hands on the swords on their waists. As the unknown Murim people were coming, they were all ready to greet them\u201cThis is the manor of the Ikyang family, so please identify yourself\u201dThe man at the forefront said,\u201cShould I give my details to you?\u201dThe gatekeepers thought that this was absurd.What the hell was that guy trying to do, not even giving out his identity and trying to enter the manor?\u201cHa! I am only being normal and dignified. If you don\u2019t reveal your identity you will not go through it\u2026\u201d\u201cIkyang So family.\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019The bamboo hat man spoke while gently lifting the hat,\u201cThird son So Wonhwi wants to enter the family house.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The eyes of the gatekeepers widened at the face of the young man behind the hat.The unidentified Murim warrior was So Wonhwi, the third son of the family who had gone missing a year ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - The Return To Yulang County (1)There is a small lake in the North East of Yulang County.Called the Small Quiet Lake, it has a massive garden, and this place was a good place to enjoy a nice quiet drink and soak in the atmosphere of the lake.It was believed that there weren\u2019t many people who would drink alcohol in the middle of the day, with the sun still above their heads, but a group of young men were currently drinking there.A young man with a particularly prominent nose, sitting at the head position of the table, couldn\u2019t be bothered drinking from a glass and was gulping down straight from bottles.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe young man let down the bottle with a groan.Seeing his red cheeks, and the prominent smell of alcohol one could tell how much he had drunk. The young man draped in a blue silk robe next to him was trying to cheer up this very man,\u201cSo Hyung. Cheery up. This is our only chance.\u201d\u201cWhat the younger one, Jo Kang, said is right. What is the point of comparing you with your hyung? It was just to save the face of the eldest one, don\u2019t be too broken up about it,\u201dThey were all attempting to comfort the young man who was drinking from the bottle.At their words, the young man kept on drinking. The name of this large-nosed guy was So Jang-yoon.He was a son of the Ikyang So family, which ruled the city of Ikyang, Hunan.Thud!So Jang-yoon put the bottle down in a rough manner and mumbled,\u201cDamn it. Does it make sense to assume the role of the superior in the family is simply given to those who were born earlier, without even a chance to compete for it?\u201dIt was for this reason that So Jang-yoon started drinking so early in the morning.He was unable to make it to the Murim Tournament being held all because So Yong-hyun, his brother and So Yong-yong, his sister, were selected to represent their family.\u201cAnd a fucking girl got selected!\u201dClench!He clenched his hand. At these words, the young men smiled bitterly.No matter how much they understood his words, they didn\u2019t like how he was name-calling a woman.Still, even if they were half-siblings, didn\u2019t they share the same blood?[Young master So is being too much today][It seems like he cannot go to the tournament, so we should leave it be.]Two women were whispering to each other.They were all from different prestigious families within the Hunan province. Of course, so were the three young men beside themThey had a relationship born from training in the same place, so the six of them had been close since childhood.[I am afraid that the Young Master might cause a scene with all that he has been drinking][You think so too?][Phew, if it wasn\u2019t for my fianc\u00e9, I would want to leave him.]The name of the lady in the purple dress was Song Yang-hwa.She was the eldest daughter of the Song family known for their swordsmanship. Although it wasn\u2019t a family which represented an entire city, it had control of the region it was in and since they had a deep tradition, so she had been engaged to So Jang-yoon a long time ago.\u2018I do not want to marry such a guy unless there is something to gain. Even his half brothers are better than him.\u2019Although she had never voiced it, she didn\u2019t like So Jang-yoon, she was simply enduring this all for the sake of her family.\u2018I\u2019d rather enter the room of So Yong-hyun.\u2019Compared to this guy, the first son of the family, So Yong-hyun, did diligent work.Even her family had attempted to make sure she was engaged to him, but she was unable to create a bond with the guy and the second daughter of the Zhuge family was engaged to him.\u2018Phew. Right, let\u2019s think about it. Isn\u2019t it better than those who ran from home?\u2019It was better to empty the mind first. And the young man called Jo Kang spoke up,\u201cSo Hyung. By now, the guests of Mount Hyeong sect must have come.\u201d\u201cYah. Then we will be seeing you face the famous ones of this sect.\u201d\u201cSo embarrassing.\u201dThe Mount Hyeong sect was a martial arts sect located in the southern Hyeong mountains and was famous for its sword techniques.Along with the Ikyang So family, they produced many people who brought fame to Hunan.The reason they were coming here was to build rapport between the two sides. None of the people remaining at home were participating in the tournament so this was a chance to test their skills.\u201cWhat could be embarrassing?\u201dSo Jang-yoon was annoyed. He didn\u2019t like the Mount Hyeong sect.Since they took in So Yong-yong who was taken in as their disciple five years back, they decided that it was a sect that didn\u2019t know how to recognize the talent of people.\u2018Phew.\u2019So Yang-hwa looked at Jo Kang and shook her head. She couldn\u2019t understand why this guy was acting like this when one of their siblings was in the sect.\u2018This is why he wasn\u2019t chosen as the representative.\u2019Thinking like this, she thought she was no better than others when someone stepped up.\u201cUh?\u201dWhen she looked at the dress, she saw them wearing the uniform of the warrior of the Ikyang So family.So Jang-yoon, who was about to drink another bottle, stopped and asked,\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dChak!The warrior bowed to them and then approached So Jang-yoon as he reported,\u201cYoung Master, Young Master So Wonhwi has returned home.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen the name So Wonhwi was mentioned, the young ones who were all smiling became silent.Who among them didn\u2019t know of So Wonhwi?\u201cYulang\u2019s fool?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that So hyung\u2019s younger brother?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he got kicked out of the house?\u201dThe young ones all asked making Song Yang-hwa jump up,\u201cYoung master So Wonhwi came back?\u201dThere was a reason she was interested in this. A year and some odd months back, the fool of the family had vanished. Coincidentally, her twin siblings had also disappeared at the same time.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t that fool know?\u2019She thought of meeting them.\u201cYoung master So.\u201dThud!While she was talking, So Jang-yoon continued to drink the alcohol in the bottle and smiled,\u201cWell, I was feeling quite disgusted, this is good.\u201d\u201cSo hyung what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI am going to give them a nice beating today. Come to my home.\u201dWith that, he got up and began to stride out. The young men who were there, got up laughing and gasping knowing what would happen\u201cUnnie?\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dSong Yang-hwa sighed. The desire to break away from this engagement increased with each day.Ikyang So familyMy hometown and home. It had really been a long time.Hometown was a word that stimulated nostalgia for everyone, but for me, it was a place of hate.Without my mother here, only hatred remains.Short Sword spoke up,-You were kidnapped by the Blood Sect, so it must have been quite a time since you have returned.Even before getting a second chance at life, I returned back to my family before joining as a spy of the Murim Alliance, wanting to be a useful son.Probably around ten years or so, one day I was kicked out.-Wouldn\u2019t that happen this time too?It could be something like that but things will be different from back then.When I came back to the family in the past I was still as stuck as ever, and that was the reason I had been called trash and fool.-Still, you share the same blood, that was quite too much\u2018I must have been considered a shame in the family as I was the only child who couldn\u2019t learn martial arts.\u2019Of course, my mother played a part too. After my mother passed away, I began to drink from a young age.Thanks to that, I was tagged as the fool of the Yulang County\u2018I\u2019d rather be cursed to my face.\u2019That was what I thought when coming here but I was too immature then and my dantian being destroyed was too much.\u201cWow. The manor is huge.\u201dSima Young, who was following me said. She was making her voice feel thick to disguise her role as a man.She was taking the role of my sajae.\u201cIt is huge. Vice\u2026 no, So hyung.\u201dCho Sung-won couldn\u2019t help but admire it too. He was playing the role of a fellow warrior I had become acquainted with.Since it could not be discovered that he was from the Beggars Union, he wore a human skin mask.[But, Vice Commander. Why are they not being kind?]Sima Young asked meThe people she was talking about were the warriors of the family. The people were guiding us, but their attitude wasn\u2019t good.Unlike Cho Sung-won who knew about me through his Beggars Union, she didn\u2019t know all this[Do not worry about it.]At that, she pouted her lips.[Vice Commander is senior to me, how can you keep saying that?][This is convenient for me.]Sima Young was given the position of leader. And she could talk comfortably but I didn\u2019t want to. And I made sure she kept her distance.-She must have had a scary father.You could say that again.I wasn\u2019t sure how her father treated her, but I decided to play my role correctly.\u2018Um?\u2019As I followed the guards I began to frown.I thought they would take me to the annex my mother was kept in. Unlike the other kids, I was asked to stay with my mother in her annex.\u201cThe annex is on the other side.\u201dOne of the warriors at the forefront stopped and turned around. He was Ung Bu, a leader-like warrior who said,\u201cThe annex got demolished and a new one was built.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI was shockedEnshrined in the annex was my mother\u2019s last tablet before her death. What did it mean they demolished it and built a new one?\u201cYoung Master left the house. While you were away from home, the Lord had to do something as the other family members were asking for changes.\u201d-Ugh. This is bad!Short Sword clicked her tongue.Right.This was the treatment I got in my own house. Fortunately, I still had some blood of the So family mixed in so at least some people give me some respect-Is this fine?We need to stay low for now.Feeling a bit dazed, I stopped holding up Ung Bu.The reason these guys accepted me, who was kicked out of the family, back into the home was that the lord was outside or something.Maybe my status might change now that I had learned martial arts, so I need to start adjusting to this place.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d\u201cRight. That aside, I have two questions.\u201dPerhaps he felt my cold tone was unusual, he looked at me with a serious face.\u201cAsk me,\u201d\u201cI was going to ask irrespective of your words. Did Asong come here?\u201dAsong was my servant.Before I got caught by the Blood Sect, I threw that guy down an open toilet.Asong was one of the two people I was worried for. He was someone who followed me, but actually, he was the one looking after my mother here.\u201cAre you talking about the servant in the annex?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dPlease say he is alive. If he died, wouldn\u2019t it be horrible to throw him into the shit pit?\u201cHe came down a year back.\u201d\u201cHe came?\u201dI was a bit excited about this. The man managed to stay aliveI was worried he was killed, but he had managed to live.\u201cThen where is he?\u201dKnowing the man, he must have run back here and asked the family to search for me.If he was alive, I would take him back, but Ung Bu\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good.\u201c\u2026 he got kicked out.\u201d\u201cKicked out?\u201dI felt stunned when he continued,\u201cIn the midst of rage, coming home he argued with the lord\u2026\u201d\u201cHow was it done?\u201d\u201c\u2026he was beaten and kicked out.\u201dHaWhat a fucking dick. Did he beat a guy who came asking for his son to be helped?\u201c\u2026 he got kicked out for that?\u201d\u201cAt that time, he showed up with dirt on him and argued with the lord so he didn\u2019t seem like he would listen to anyone.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 so. You say he was begging the Lord to bring people to save me, but the Lord got angry and kicked him out after beating the poor man?\u201d\u201cT-that young master.\u201d\u201cHow was the guy hit?\u201dUng Bu was breaking into a cold sweat,\u201cAh\u2026 he was hit with a stick instead of the hand I think,\u201dUng Bu tried to say\u201cYoung Master, the situation at that time was\u2026\u201dPak!Someone grabbed Ung Bu by the neck and lifted him up.It was Sima Young.When she picked up the warrior with her small body the guy panicked trying to get her to release the grip.\u201cStay still.\u201dTatatak!Sima Young sealed his blood points.\u201cHuh!\u201d\u201cW-what is this?\u2019The warriors shouted at her. Sima Young looked at them with a cold face.\u201cWhere is the bathroom here?\u201dAt her question, the warriors looked to one side. Since the manor was so wide, there were some large ones around.\u201cSima\u2026\u201dBefore I could say anything. Sima Young grabbed the guy and hurriedly opened the door to the bathroom and threw him in\u201cEat shit!\u201dEup!At something that no one had expected, the warriors could only remain still and wide-eyed.Sima Young was roaring like a bull and came with a stick in her hand and asked,\u201cShould I do it? Or will sahyung do it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - The Return To Yulang County (2)[\u2026 she is an amazing woman.]Cho Sung-won told me. Even I didn\u2019t think she would actually throw the guy into shit.And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, she had brought a stick back with her, just like how they had treated Asong.It seems like she was angry.-Ahh. I like her!said Short Sword, looking excited.For the first time since I had met her, I felt that she was perhaps really the daughter of one of the Four Great Evils, with his spirit and nature with her. Oh, and that she was quite honest about her feelings too.But\u2026[Well. The mind was cold. Would it be fine?]It would be fine.The lord of the family hadn\u2019t been met yet, and doing this right now wouldn\u2019t bring any real attention to us.-Who wouldn\u2019t kill the guy for that stupid personality he has?Short Sword you are quite smart. I looked at the warriors and said,\u201cHe might not be able to come out of the hole, for now, so help him out.\u201dAt my words, their expressions became distorted.In order to get out of the shit hole, they would have to put their hands in it.\u201cAre you going to let him die in shit?!\u201dBy the end of my shout, they had run over.As soon as they went over, I looked at her,[Why are you acting out even when I haven\u2019t given you an order yet?]At my words, her expression turned dark. It seemed like she expected me to compliment her.I didn\u2019t know if it was normal for her, but acting without orders was something I didn\u2019t like.[\u2026 I didn\u2019t like the Vice Commander being ignored and I decided to set a good example for the servant of yours. I will not act out from now on.]She sent me the message in a gloomy voice-What are you doing? Don\u2019t scold her, praise her!Do not push me. Short Sword seemed to like Sima Young a lot.[That\u2026][But I didn\u2019t kill him!]Ahh!Right. Thank you.Every time I see her I get more afraid of her father.How can such a wild horse be tamed?-Isn\u2019t it too strange if she changed in just one month?There was some truth in what Iron Sword said.It was difficult to change her attitude just a month after joining the Blood Sect, especially as she was the daughter of one of the Four Great Evils.Besides, knowing her true identity I could not overly criticize her.\u2018I have to change her methods little by little.\u2019-How?After watching her for a month I learned something.Maybe not for everything, but she mostly tried to be on par with me. It could be because of her personality to do things for others.And I would like her to be constrained.[If this was the case in a more serious situation, you realize that you would be punished. Do you understand what I mean, Miss?]She bowed her head[\u2026 I am sorry.]Still, she made no excuses, and oddly enough she seemed to care about how I felt[In the future, before doing anything, at least ask me for permission, get it?][It is fine if I ask for permission?][Yes.][I understand. I will definitely ask for permission. Now, can my anger be vented?]I nodded at her words and she smiled bashfully.She had the human skin mask on, but I could imagine how she must be smiling. Quite a unique one she was.[Still\u2026 you are a bit cool.]Her face brightened when I said that, and Cho Sung-won looked at me with eyes screaming,\u2018Aren\u2019t you supposed to scold her?\u2019\u201cUhhh!\u201d\u201cAck!\u201dAt that time Ung Bu who had fallen into shit was being dragged back out.It seemed like the other warriors were covering their noses at the painful smell and were holding onto their clothes.Ugh, it smells awful.Even Sima Young was covering her nose. On the other hand, Cho Sung-won looked fine.Well, he did belong to the Beggars Union.-His immunity to shit is at its peak.It was a good thingI sent a message to Cho Sung-won to release the blood points sealed on Ung Bu. And he had a troubled expression like he didn\u2019t want to touch that piece of shitSuch a strange beggar.When I pointed again, he reluctantly walked over, when Sima Young suddenly told him,\u201cFrom now on, walk six steps away from me.\u201dCho Sung-won felt wronged, but covered his nose and approached Ung Bu.\u201cSorry. My sajae is intolerant of injustice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUng Bu couldn\u2019t speak. He had almost died in shit.What more could he say? The poor guy was scared.\u201cNice. So you kicked him out, where did Asong go then?\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThe village?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since then.\u201dRight.You kicked him out without even listening to him. I am just glad he is alive, but where could he go?-Will you look for him?\u2018I should.\u2019I need to at least make a request for him to be searched for. And the next question was,\u201cIf you demolished the annex, what happened to my mother\u2019s shrine?\u201dA memorial tablet was in the annex.I could endure Asong being hit, but my mother\u2019s tablet being destroyed was something that would make me destroy this family.Ung Bu felt a crisis now as he looked at the cold expression,\u201cLady Ha\u2019s memorial tablet was taken to the Mount Hyeong Sect by lady Yong-yong\u201d\u201cMount Hyeong?\u201dSo Yong-yong was my real sister.If she had taken it, it must mean that she was taking care of my mother\u2019s final rites in the sect. Fortunately, someone was looking after it.-Your sister?Right.Unlike me who had their dantian damaged at a young age, Yong-yong was fine.She even excelled in martial arts and became a disciple of the Mount Hyeong Sect.Actually, it had been So Jang-yoon who was chosen by them, but then she had also been accepted.-Must be good.Yes.A sister I hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.Maybe she wasn\u2019t the younger sister I remember her as. I hated my family which had treated me like trash just because my dantian had been damaged.\u201cWhen will The Lord return?\u201dI only heard that he was out. I needed to know when he would return.The Lord was someone who will not leave the house unless there was an important task.\u201c\u2026 he will be back in an hour or two.\u201dSo he didn\u2019t go too far.If so, he had to go greet some precious guestsIf The Lord was going so far, then they had to be some famous ones.-Isn\u2019t this good?It should be.It would be better if it was someone with a huge fame-\u2026It was then that I heard static.There were three people with swords coming over.They must have passed the gate of the manor and Sima Young had turned her head in the opposite direction sensing them.Six young men and women\u201cAh!\u201dThe warrior who found them rushed to them as if greeting their savior.\u201cYou have arrived? Young Master!\u201dIt was a sight I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. The people I had been close with when I was a child.These guys were the so-called skilled prodigy of the Hunan province and the kind who had tormented me.Jo Kang, Yu Jinack, Do Ilchan, Kang Hye-so, Song Yang-hwa and So Jang-yoonActually, there were two more.-No\u2026\u2018The twins\u2019The twins were also once a part of them.Who would have known that they were cruel to me along with them?Well, my sister was on my side.\u201cIs it them?\u201dSima Young asked me and I nodded as she licked her lips with a sad face.I should have warned her in advance that they would cause trouble for us.So Jang-yoon who led the group like a leader shouted,\u201cWho said that a scum like you could set foot in the home?\u201dMan, he was someone who never changes.Even in the past, he was always the one to make a fuss. And a guy with a peculiar habit of trying to show his strength only when he saw me.-Oh my. How did you stand him?Short Sword clicked her tongue. It felt like she was annoyed too.Sh!I bowed to him\u201cLong time no see, Hyung.\u201dAt my polite greeting, Jo Kang and Do Ilchan who were behind him clicked their tongues.\u201cOh my. The famous fool of Yulang has come back from the dead.\u201d\u201cThey said he was kicked out of the family, It seems like his mind has cleared a bit.\u201dThey were meaning every word they said. Sima Young\u2019s eyes turned cold.Her twitching fingers said she wanted to hit them any moment but I shook my head as it wasn\u2019t time yet.\u201cTch.\u201dHer face turned red, it must have been quite frustrating.Well, I told her to not touch them.\u201cIt seems like hyungs are all here. You must have enjoyed a drink today with my hyung. It is nice to see you all having a good time.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDo Ilchan was about to get angry when someone stopped him.\u201cYoung master Do. Be patient.\u201d\u201cMiss Song.\u201dIt was Song Yang-hwa who stopped him. I remember her being pretty mean back in the day so why was she being like this?\u201cYoung Master So. It has been a while. During this time\u2026\u201dBut her words were interrupted again as So Jang-yoon yelled,\u201cI cannot figure out how this trashy bastard has bought along two more men.\u201dHmm.I didn\u2019t feel it before, but looking at them was like watching the twins. In a normal voice, I said,\u201cYou are talking too much because you have been drinking. I think it would be good to see you again after you have sobered up a bit, Hyung.\u201dHe was startled by my words.\u201cHa!\u201dIn the past, I would shy away from any confrontation and not speak to him, but now that I was, he was getting angry.Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, he was already drunk enough that his emotions were rising up even more.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dHe let out a sigh.He hadn\u2019t changed at all. As he took a deep breath, he ran for me.He was about to hit me in the face with his fist.Pak!I just grabbed the fist which came, making So Jang-yoon\u2019s eyes widen. He must have never thought that I could grab his fist.\u201cYou? How?\u201d\u201cWe can talk later. I don\u2019t want to make things messy before seeing the lord, Hyung.\u201dAt my words, his expression distorted.\u201cWho the fuck said I am your hyung! I never had a sibling like you!\u201dAs soon as he said it, he was ready to slap me in the face so I let go of the hand and stepped back.As I also avoided this, his expression darkened. He was really confused now.\u201cSo hyung, do you still consider that you share the same blood with him? Why are you making such weak attempts on him?\u201d\u201cI thought you were going to show us a good time, but you are joking around.\u201dThankfully, Jo Kang and Do Il-chan were riling him up.And his expression began to crumble at the thought of being pushed to the corner by trash like me.Guess he\u2019ll blow up sometime soon.\u201cYou bastard\u2026 you are still living with a rag in the mouth.\u201dMy polite words were lost and so was my expression.\u201cWhat? This bastard what did he just\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou are right to say that you never had a younger sibling. Since I was born 3 months earlier than you, shouldn\u2019t I be called hyung?\u201dActually, despite being half brothers, I was born earlier than him.However, due to the pride of being pure blood, I had to call him hyung despite him being younger.Clench!So Jang-yoon grunted as he drew the sword with a furious expression.Srng!\u201cWant me to call you hyung? You fucking filthy bastard.\u201dHe drew his sword and aimed it at me, ready to stab me in the neck at a moment\u2019s notice. All of a sudden, even the warriors who were guarding the manor began to flock around.\u201cYoung master So. Stop it!\u201d\u201cUnnie is right. The Lord will be coming here any time now.\u201dSong Yang-hwa and Kang Hye-so stopped him and he did seem a bit anxious at the thought of the lord coming back.But you see, the human psyche is unique. When someone tells us not to do it, we want to do it even more.\u201cHuh, forget it. At this point, I need to clean this place from the filthy bastard who dishonors our family with my own hands. No one will regret it even if this happens.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSima Young spoke up. She was able to endure it for so long, but it felt like a string had finally snapped.So Jang-yoon looked at her as he scoffed,\u201cWhy is this slender-looking sissy boy trying to act out? If you do not want to get hurt, shut that trap and move back.\u201dThere was laughter breaking out.People wondered how Sima Young would react, well, I wanted to know how they would react if they knew her true identity.And I sent her a message[Be patient.][\u2026 I want to kill him.]It was good that I messaged her before she did anything.Hearing that she wants to kill him, if I didn\u2019t she would have already done something.\u201cSorry. It seems that I caused trouble to all of you with the problems within the family.\u201dSaying that I was ready to taunt him.\u201cIf you put down the sword now, I will forget this ever happened. Decide.\u201dHis expression distorted horribly as he jumped for me again,\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dPak! Song Yang-hwa who was shocked grabbed his arm, but nothing helped.So Jang-yoon resisted her touch and came to cut my throat,I simply dodged it by moving my neck.\u201cUh?\u201dIn that state, I grabbed his head.\u201cEUP!\u201dSima Young did it before, I did it to him now.As his body got lifted above the ground he swung the sword to cut off my arm holding him but before that, I grabbed his wrist.He raised his internal qi to get rid of my grasp but well?It didn\u2019t affect me\u2018\u2026!!\u2019His eyes widened as if he was too shocked to realize something only now.\u201cKuak!\u201dI broke his wrist. And bent it back making his sword drop to the ground.Tak!So Jang-yoon\u2019s gang who was watching this couldn\u2019t hide their surprise.\u201cH-How?\u201d\u201cDid he learn martial arts?\u201dThey must be stupid or something.They couldn\u2019t have thought that my defensive skills were better than theirs. Well, they all firmly knew and believed that my dantian was destroyed and I was just the trash everyone talked about.So this couldn\u2019t be accepted.\u201cYoung master So, stop it now.\u201dAs Song Yang-hwa was stopping me.I raised my innate qi and looked into the eyes of So Jang-yoon and his eyes began to lose focus.And I let go of the face I was holding onto and told him,\u201cFine. I will stop with this.\u201dAnd to me he said,\u201cI lost. I apologize for everything I said before and for trying to take your life.\u201dAt those words, all his friends were confused.It seemed like they didn\u2019t understand how this guy suddenly decided to admit defeat and apologize and even bow down to me.\u201cI will accept the apology and I am sorry for making you feel a bit uncomfortable.\u201dThe expressions of warriors around me turned strange at me acting all dignified.It must have come as a surprise to them.At that time, So Jang-yoon\u2019s eyes turned normal.Seeing me all high and might it felt like he didn\u2019t know what happened and the anger rose with the broken wrist being felt\u201cYou bastard! Die!\u201dTaking advantage of the time I was acting nice, he decided to attack me.At that moment, Sima Young appeared like a shadow and grabbed his wrist.\u201cUh?\u201dShe glanced at me and I nodded my head.Clench!When permission was granted, Sima Young smiled brightly and broke the other wrist.And this time the bones stuck out.\u201cAckkkk!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - So Young-hyun (1)At the entrance to the northern village of Yulang County.Hundreds of warriors of the Ikyang So family were marching in rows, and in the middle of this procession on horseback was a handsome man with a beard and a light green silk robe, So Ik-heon, the head of the family.The man and woman wearing indigo uniforms riding the horses on either side were the representatives of Mount Hyeong.One was the First Sword of Mount Hyeong, Cho Jong-un, and the other, a female warrior, was Cho Il-hye.So Ik-heon, the head, came to meet these two people who were also members of the Murim Alliance.Cho Jong-un expressed his hesitation at this procession,\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201dSeeing Cho Jong-un like that, So Ik-heon smiled,\u201cHahaha. If we treat guests to our hometown like this, Murim society would not let us live with our heads up. Do not feel too burdened.\u201d\u201cI am grateful, but ask for your understanding that I am not used to this kind of hospitality, we spend most of our time in the mountains,\u201d added Cho Il-hye.Even though it was late in the day, she was still able to speak in an energetic, confident voice.\u201cWhenever I look at you, it feels like you are a truly remarkable warrior. You seem to be a true model for us, I am grateful to you that my daughter has such a strong warrior to rely on.\u201d\u201cIt is nothing.\u201dThe expression of the girl who was watching this from behind wasn\u2019t good. The name of the girl who looked to be around 17 or 18 was So Yong-yong.She was the eldest daughter of the family and the only daughter of So Ik-heon.\u2018He is really putting out nasty words.\u2019She hated her father.In front of others, he spoke as if he cared for her all his life when the reality was quite the opposite. For him, his daughter was just an accessory.\u2018Such unfortunate timing.\u2019Now she didn\u2019t have much time left in Mount Hyeong.After this year she will have to come back to her home and in that case, they would decide who she will marry.\u2018That is the undeniable duty of a woman.\u2019Her father was someone who emphasized power.If it weren\u2019t for him, the family would have already sold her off to some old man through marriage.This was why she was determined to fight in this Murim Alliance tournament.\u2018I need to win.\u2019If she was the winner or maybe even one of the finalists, she would receive the position of a commander for a squad or some other form of leadership role, and then she could stay in the Murim Alliance.If she was lucky, she wouldn\u2019t be tied up to some man she hadn\u2019t ever met.\u201cBut despite the short while since we last met with Lord So, it seems like your achievements have increased a lot compared to before.\u201dAt Cho Il-hye\u2019s praises, the young man in a colorful silk robe riding the horse in the back row took the lead.Looking at the man\u2019s face he looked a lot like So Ik-heon. He was So Young-hyun, the eldest son of the family.\u201cI think he will be able to have a good confrontation with our sahyung\u201d\u201cThat is too much. How can my son ever be spoken in the same sentence as the First Sword of Mount Hyeong\u2019s disciple? I just want to see a good one.\u201d\u201cThat is too much My Lord.\u201dTo So Yong-yong\u2019s left was a tall, indigo uniform-wearing person.He was So Il-ju, the first disciple under Cho Jong-un sahyung.For two years, he built up his reputation as the disciple of Cho Jong-un and was now considered a likely winner of the Murim Alliance tournament.\u201cI am quite nervous as I haven\u2019t seen So hyung in a long time.\u201d\u201cHaha, a guy who saves my son\u2019s face. You are a truly smart disciple.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dCho Jong-un shyly touched his nose.There was a friendly atmosphere forming when someone came running for Ikyang So.They wore the attire of a normal guard in the family.Tak!\u201cI offer my greeting to the Lord, and to the disciples of Mount Hyeong.\u201dThe lord felt curious at this and asked,\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dAs the warrior hesitated, the lord said to the guests next to him,\u201cIt seems like this is a family matter, so I might be a bit different from now on.\u201d\u201cIt is fine, My Lord.\u201dNot paying attention to the two of them, he nodded to the warriorAnd the warrior sent the transmission message to So Ik-heon whose expression began to go stiff.So Ik-heon turned his head to So Young-hyun. As his throat trembled it was clear that he was sending him a message.After the instructions were given, So Ik-heon turned to the two guests.\u201cIf it is fine, it seems like something minute cropped up at the family house, I would like to send my children there first,\u201d\u201cPlease do so.\u201dSo Yong-yong was a bit shocked. What happened at home that she was being sent like this?And then a thought flashed,\u2018Perhaps?\u2019While she was thinking, So Young-hyun said,\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe would find out once she got there.When her brother took the lead, she simply followed and after a long distance had formed between them and the procession, So Yong-hyung, said,\u201cIf we don\u2019t hurry, everything will be a mess.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat trash is back home.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Trash meant her brother.So Yong-yong\u2019s eyes widened at this.So, did it mean that the man who went missing had come back? If this was right.\u2018Stupid So Wonhwi.\u2019She cursed under her breath.When she heard that he disappeared as she was in the sect, she thought that it would be better as long as he escaped from the family without being hurt.Then why did he have to come back now? She felt so helpless.\u2018It feels like I will be sick.\u2019She didn\u2019t want to see her one and only blood being beaten by those fools again. But it was going to happen and that made her feel nauseous.\u2018I need to hurry.\u2019As So Young-hyun said, if they don\u2019t hurry, those vicious humans could do anything.He might be a burden to them, but he was the only brother who shared the same blood as them.Not long after, they reached the mansionShe got off her horse and went straight to the mansion\u2018Please\u2026\u2019She hoped nothing would happen until she arrived.If that scumbag touches her only brother, it felt like she will not forgive himAnd as she was thinking she witnessed something. A cry which was from far.\u201cI lost. I apologize for everything I said and for trying to take your life.\u201dIt was the voice of So Jang-yoon.There, the warriors of the family were gathered too.So Young-hyun too couldn\u2019t hide his curiosity at this situation.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe two of them hurried to the place the warriors had gathered and when they arrived, they saw So Jang-yoon bowing his head to their brother but ready to slash him down.\u201cYou bastard! Dieee!\u201d\u2018No!\u2019At that moment, someone grabbed the wrist of So Jang-yoonA handsome man with a slender body. the young man who grabbed the wrist immediately\u2013Crack!\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dSo Young-hyun, who saw this, went stiff.Sima Young broke his wrist without even hesitating. She was smiling brightly at the fact that she managed to do what she wanted-A success!\u2018Right.\u2019All the warriors saw it.They saw him bow down and then attack me right away.The party involved, that was me, wasn\u2019t even aware that he was going to do it, and he crossed a line of dignity which shouldn\u2019t be crossed.As a result, he could not become a representative of anything now.All that was left was\u2026\u2018Huh?\u2019I sensed something weird, so I turned my head to see So Young-hyun watching from the side.They said he went out with the head of the family, and he was back already?\u2018Ah!\u2019Another person caught my eye. My sister So Yong-yong.\u2018Yong-yong is back?\u2019I could guess one thing from his.It seemed like the reason they had gone out was to guide the guests from Mount Hyeong. And Yong-yong looked at me like she couldn\u2019t understand this.\u201cStop!\u2019At that time, So Young-hyun shouted at Sima Young who had broken his wrist.Sima Young looked at me with an expression that said she wasn\u2019t done hurting him.It seemed like not all of her anger was relieved from this. When I told her to seal his blood points, she immediately did so and So Jang-yoon fell down.Thud!\u201cWhat do you think you are doing?\u201dUnlike the shocking scene he witnessed, So Young-hyun spoke with a confident voice.-He is a bit oddOf course, he was odd.Unlike this idiot who had his head between his ass cheeks, So Young-hyun was a rather smart one.He cared about the eyes that were observing him and knew how to manage his expressions.\u201cWho are you to do this on our home grounds?\u201dSima Young bowed and said,\u201cGreetings. I am Ma Young, an alumnus following So Wonhwi.\u201d\u201cAlumni?\u201dSima only removed one letter from her real name to make her fake name.So Young-hyun, who cared only about her till then, looked at me. And I bowed,\u201cLong time no see, hyung.\u201dI could see his eyes twitch as I called him hyung.Still, I was the rumored guy who was trash. And unlike my little stupid brother on the floor, I had some brain to use.And the guy who was conscious of people\u2019s eyes could never speak back now.\u201cTell me just what happened here.\u201dI replied back not caring about his expression,\u201cIt might be because I was back home after a long time, but the second hyung came up to me quite out of control as he was drunk.\u201d\u201cDrunk?\u2019So Young-hyun looked at the fallen one. The smell of alcohol was clearly strong on him.\u201c\u2026 what does him drinking alcohol have to do with the disrespect your sajae showed?\u201dThis guy kept going back to that one thing alone.It looked like he wanted to show that Sima Young\u2019s actions were wrong.And even if he arrived late and didn\u2019t see what happened I am sure he must have seen the sword in my brother\u2019s hand.Sima Young got angry and intervened,\u201cThat means I should let my sahyung get killed by the guy who doesn\u2019t follow the heavenly rules of warriors? It would do you better if you spoke clearly.\u201dSima Young\u2019s hand pointed to him.If I leave her, I am sure that the people here would be decapitated.Huhu, I wanted her to be a bit patient.[Hand!][\u2026 Yes.]Sima Young slowly put down her raised hand.Seeing her actions like that, So Young-hyung looked like this was absurd.And he sent me a message[You bastard. Did you do this trusting your sajae?]At his question, I responded,\u201cWhy are you using a voice transmission technique?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019\u201cWhat is it? Are you trying to say something the others shouldn\u2019t know of?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dSo Young-hyun\u2019s expression changed at my question.But he was a lot better than the little one who doesn\u2019t even know how to control his emotions.Or was it because the one on the floor was still young?Why was I scared of returning here?\u201cYou\u2026\u201dSo Young-hyun immediately looked to the left and right.He said this while holding back his anger, knowing that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t good.\u201cYes\u2026 the hand of your sajae is a bit too much, right? Even if So Jang-yoon was a bit excited being drunk there was no need to break his wrist.\u201dTrying to blame it on us.I glanced at him. The fact that he and Yong-yong were here means that the lord would be here too, right?Then that was good. The original plan could be accelerated.And so I said,\u201cAh, that is the problem. I think it was a bit of overkill as my sajae was a bit hasty to stop it.\u201dI deliberately left room for discussion.And he looked at me\u201cIt isn\u2019t just overkill. Who dares to break the wrist of a man in the family of the So!\u201dSo Young-hyun raised his voice, wanting everyone to listen to it.It seems that he wanted the warriors to move according to him but what?The others watched So Jang-yoon\u2019s stupid act.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Contrary to his wishes, the warriors and even the friends of So Jang-yoon didn\u2019t move.But I still thought that this place wasn\u2019t good enough for me.In the midst of this, there was no one who came ahead and pointed out the mistake So Jang-yoon had made.And then someone intervened,\u201cWait.\u201dThe person who intervened was So Yong-yong and she approached the side of Song Yang-hwa.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019The variableI was trying to fight verbally, but Song Yang-hwa could tell Yong-yong what happened.-Didn\u2019t I say I didn\u2019t like it?\u2018\u2026 right.\u2019It seemed like she was trying to help me out here. But didn\u2019t Song Yang-hwa hate me?I was a bit puzzled when Yong-yong spoke up.\u201cYang-hwa, unnie, please inform me of what happened till now. Second Brother was drunk and made a mistake as he tried to kill Third Brother.\u201dAt her words, So Young-hyun\u2019s expression turned cold.Contrary to what he had intended, Yong-yong was criticizing So Jang-yoon.And he said in a cold voice,\u201cThird Brother? Who is the third brother here?\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201d\u201cTo call a person who has been abandoned by the family as brother! That is a dirty bloodline\u2026\u201dSlap!Yong-yong couldn\u2019t stand hearing it and tried to slap him.Well, this idiot wasn\u2019t Jang-yoon so he managed to hold her hand lightly and Yong-yong spoke with tears in her eyes,\u201cLet go of my hand.\u201dShe didn\u2019t care about anything but she hated those who called me dirty blood and she hated the indirect words of insult at her mother.So Young-hyun looked shocked. But then he was already angry,\u201cHuh! even if I said something wrong\u2026.\u201d\u201cLet go of her hand.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe turned to me thinking it was ridiculous that I spoke. And said,\u201cHa! Are you talking to me?\u201dYong-yong shouted at me\u201cDo not do this!\u201dThe moment I heard it, a weird strange feeling welled up inside me.I used to think she hated me but no. She was treating me coldly with the fear that others wouldn\u2019t take the hate onto me.\u2018\u2026\u2019Something hot surged in the chest.An emotion different from anger surfaced when I smiled at her,\u201cNow I will protect you.\u201dAt my words, her face turned red as she burst into tears,\u201cHow dare this idiot try to talk to us! Do not meddle between me and my brother\u2026\u201d\u201cHow dare you act out!\u201dBefore Yong-yong could finish her words, So Young-hyun raised his head and tried to slap her.Pak!I moved like lightning and grabbed his wrist. As soon as I caught his wrist, the guy looked startled and tried to hit me with his elbow.Pak!But before his elbow could touch me, I shifted my grasp on his wrist and threw him to the floor.\u201cHuh?\u201dThud!\u201cEuk!\u201dYong-yong looked at me with wide eyes at this unexpected sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - So Young-hyun (2)\u201cBrother, you have internal qi?\u201dYong-yong looked a bit shocked and was clearly in disbelief. It seemed like Song Yang-hwa hadn\u2019t noticed.Yong-yong still thought that my dantian was broken and had tried to protect me.-AmazingRightI am ashamed to call myself her brother, I had never thought she would grow up this fast.\u201cUgh!\u201dPhat!At that time, Song Young-hyun who was on the ground got back up. I had restrained myself when I threw him down, so this was expected.I didn\u2019t want to end this easily either. He had almost made my sister cry, so he had to pay.-What about his skills?Short Sword was curious, since if one was paying careful attention he moved like a first-rate warrior.He was definitely better than So Jang-yoon. Considering that his skills were good enough to be a representative, it seemed that he was at least above average.So Young-hyun who thought he could take me down looked bewildered,\u201cNo, your dantian was healed?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dI didn\u2019t have to tell him that.After all, it was easier for me when they were mistaken and rushed blindly at me. But he seemed to be a bit careful now.-He seems to be putting up his guard.His self-esteem must have taken a blow, seeing as how he had been thrown on his ass in front of everyone, especially when things ran counter to his expectations.Rather, it seemed like he was back to his rational sense. It looked like he was trying to figure me out.He had to at least feel out how much internal qi I possessed, and then make sure his skills were enough to close the gap.-Try to lure him in a littleAt Short Sword\u2019s words, I decided to display only a little of my qi which any second-rate warrior would have.And he smiled.-It workedAs Short Sword said, his face was rather triumphant.He was convinced he was stronger than me, and without another word he drew his sword. He was confident that I was weaker than him.[Brother!]Yong-yong sent me a transmission,[He isn\u2019t an opponent that can be defeated even if your dantian has healed.]AhEven Yong-yong seemed to have also been fooled into thinking I was just a second-rate warrior. After all, who would think that a man who had just healed their dantian could rise to such a high position in just a year and a couple of months, compared to the kids who had been sheltered and fed pills their entire lives? Especially when they were kids nurtured by the So family.Still, it was nice that my only blood was worried about me.[It is fine, trust your brother.][What is fine? It will be horrible!]Yong-yong didn\u2019t believe me that easily. And it was then,So Young-hyun, who saw that I was looking at Yong-yong, rushed at me. He was aiming for a surprise attack.\u201cBe careful!\u201dYong-yong yelled at me and I pulled out my sword and moved to block his strike.My movements were faster.Sring! Chang!I pulled out Southern Heavenly Iron Sword from its cloth sheath and raised it, causing my brother\u2019s sword to simply bounce off mine.And then I quickly slapped him on the cheekSlap!The guy\u2019s eyes trembled as his head turned with the slap. It must feel horrible to be hit by someone lower than yourself.\u201cThat is the price for aiming at my sister\u2019s cheek.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dHe immediately spread out his feet and raised his sword within a distance of two steps.It was the So Hyeon Sword technique, one of the three techniques that this family was so proud of.I hadn\u2019t seen it for a long time, but I leisurely swung my sword and blocked his strike.Chachang!There was no need to use a sword technique to block this. It was a foolish decision for him to use a sword technique on me too.I couldn\u2019t care less if he had used a technique I didn\u2019t know, but this was a skill I had seen countless times.After blocking it in three movements, I slashed the stabbing movement of his sword and slapped him again.Slap!One on the left side again,\u201cThat is the price for insulting my sajae who saved my life.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you bastard!\u201dHe cursed as he started to lose his composure. After being slapped twice, it now felt like he didn\u2019t want to control himself anymore.Right. That is what I want you to look like.\u201cHa!\u201dOn the other hand, my sister was in shock. She was worried that I would be hurt but when I was bullying him, she seemed surprised.The same was true for the warriors of the family.\u201cIs this really the trash of Yulang County?\u201d\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dAfter So Jang-yoon, now even So Young-hyun was suffering humiliation at my hands so they were all shocked.Jang-yoon didn\u2019t get much spotlight as he was known to be weak, but I was holding my ground against this guy who was well known.-Wonhwi!Iron Sword called for me. At this moment, the sound of swords in rank rattled in my head.-\u2026\u2018Huk.\u2019With so many swords coming, this much sound was bound to follow.The headache from the sound went down after I used the innate qi for a bit.It was hard to notice these things in the Ikyang So family, surrounded by so many swords, but thanks to these many swords, I came to an understanding.-Wonhwi. They are?Right, Iron Sword.With this amount of people, the lord must have returned.-I felt three swords that were strong.-Very strongThree strong swords?There were standards for swords being evaluated as strong such as Short Sword and Iron Sword.The strong ones were those who grew with their masters. The second type could be either old treasures or even divine swords.No matter how carefully a new sword was crafted, it was still a newborn baby.\u2019Ah.I could guess with certainty who one was, but could only guess the titles of the others.One would be the lord, and the other two would have to be the First Sword and the Female Warrior of Mount Hyeong.It was worth the time and they had arrived at the right moment.Now it was time to harvest.\u201cYouu!!!\u201dSo Young-hyun who felt ashamed at being slapped rushed at me again.He had changed his grip on his sword. Once he realized that his previous technique wouldn\u2019t work on me, he changed the technique he used.Seeing that the sword technique appeared to be a bit heavy, and seemed to focus on pressuring the opponent down, it must be the Raging Sword Technique which only the successor could use.Unlike before, he was confident in winning.\u2018Let\u2019s check how good he is.\u2019I wondered.I mean, what level had he reached with this sword technique?Sring!I tried to block it.Whenever our swords collided, an abnormally heavy flow was felt.The secret to such a heavy sword technique was to use the sword properly and interrupt the flow of the opponent.Chachang!However, his grasp of the technique wasn\u2019t too great, it was only average.It may be effective on other people of his level, but not on me. I easily blocked all fourteen formations.And in the end, just by swinging my sword lightly, I made him bounce back three steps.Chang! Tak!As he landed he mumbled,\u201cNo way. How can you handle the Raging Sword\u2026\u201dAs expected, this was the Raging Sword technique. I, the supposed trash of the family, handled this technique so easily that he fell into shock.And to him, like showing mercy I said,\u201cIf you apologize to the two of them right now, and ask forgiveness for insulting my deceased mother, it will end here.\u201d\u201cForgiveness?\u201dOf course, he wasn\u2019t going to be that nice.Rather, it was to provoke him that I kept doing this.Clench!The sound of a hand clenching and teeth grinding.As expected, he couldn\u2019t hold his anger anymore,\u201cTo whom are you saying that forgiveness should be asked?\u201d\u201cYou will regret it.\u201dAt my words, he shouted as he remembered something,\u201cNow I know! How you learned your skills just fine! Even if your dantian was back due to some luck you should know that martial arts don\u2019t improve in just one year! You must have learned some evil martial art!\u201dHa.Was he really trying to use his head like this? So typical.In the first place, I was able to block his techniques with just plain skills and not internal qi or techniques. Meanwhile, the warriors of the house mumbled,\u201cRight?\u201d\u201cHow could he improve this much in just a year\u2019s time?\u201d\u201cThen you mean he learned Evil Arts?\u201dAmong martial arts, there were Demonic Arts and Evil Arts.They were literally what they were called, one of them came from the demonic sects, and the others came from the evil sects, the unorthodox ones whose evil arts were known to accelerate the growth of their user using insidious means.\u201cEven if you die, you must hate to accept that you are weak.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt is pathetic that the skills of a successor are of this level.\u201dSima Young was being sarcastic on purpose. This time, she was trying to stimulate his expression and emotion.Whatever the excuse was, he was the successor of this family, a skilled being who symbolizes the house. And losing to me was a great shame for him.\u201cSomeone like trash is pushing his luck. I tried to look after you considering the fact that you are blood to me but\u2026\u201dDid I hear it wrong? He was watching over me?-He is quite thick-skinnedShort Sword clicked her tongue.This guy always wanted the top position. Seeing his rising anger at the tip of his sword I knew that if I used Short Sword he would die.\u201cIf you are so confident then can you stop this?\u201dSo Young-hyun said to me as if he was provoking me.He was deliberately trying to make me use something but I shook my head,\u201cThat will not change anything.\u201d\u201cYou are too arrogant!\u201dPat!At my words, he moved at me in anger.He was ready to kill me, that was how he was moving with the heavy feeling sword which only wanted to kill his own blood.\u201cBe careful!\u201dYong-yong shouted again but I had no reason to hide my skills.Sring!His sword collided with mine and as the sword touched, he tried to link another technique when I slapped him again.Slap!This time I used internal qi to give a good impact.\u201cT-this bastar\u2026\u201dHe tried to force the technique to unfold but I stood still as I raised my sword.My hand went up seeing the gap again.Slap!This time it was on the other cheek. And blood came from his nose as I hit him a bit hard.Grunt!He was grinding his teeth and tried to strike me with the sword but before that, my fist collided with his chest.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dAs he got hit on the chest, he tried to move back.But I grabbed him by the neck and pulled him close as I kicked him in the shin.Crack!The shinbone broke and cracked.\u201cKuak! Y\u2026you! Bastard\u2026\u201dThe anger was greater than the pain so he tried to use the sword again and his blade was coming for my neck but it was already too late.I slashed down his sword using my internal qi.Chang!\u201cEuk!\u201dThe blade trembled first in its attempt to resist, but as it couldn\u2019t keep up, my qi kept digging into his palm, and soon the sword bounced back and twirled round and round.It was the moment when the guy felt confused[This is the price for insulting my mother you fucking dumbass.]\u201c\u2026?!\u201dPuak!\u201cAck!\u201dI hit him in the face with my fist.His face twisted sideways and the sound of his teeth shattering could be heard. And he fell down with his teeth falling out.His face was a mess now.\u2018Ha.\u2019This feels good.It felt like the ill feelings which I had accumulated over the past events got released. Just how much had these people tormented me and my siblings and insulted our mother?[Lord!]Cho Seong-won\u2019s voice rang in my ear and I knew why he had called.I could tell from the crowd around us going silent. When I turned my head, I looked to see a middle-aged man cloaked in a green robe, and a bitter face, along with two warriors on either side of him.The lord of this family, So Ik-heon.Beside him were two people, a man, and a woman in indigo uniforms.These were faces I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. But they don\u2019t know me.Before coming back to life I never came into close contact with anyone else due to the shame I had caused my family.As a spy, I saw them when I was in the Murim Alliance.\u201cW-what is this?\u201dCho Il-hye asked with a frown as she saw my siblings lying on the ground.And she looked at me and asked, \u201cWho is that man?\u201dShe certainly seemed to have noticed that I was the one who did this. The qi she was releasing to pressure me was so strong that it felt like she belonged to the strong warriors.\u2018Strong.\u2019But the guy next to her was even stronger than her. There was no intimidation like Hae Ack-chun but it was clear that the base levels of the peak had been crossed.On the other hand, So Ik-heon felt to be slightly on par with the woman.Of course, one shouldn\u2019t judge their strength by internal qi alone.So Ik-heon had a complicated expression.Cho Il-hye herself couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.-What is it?I was not sure either.Maybe because the child he threw away came back stronger than others? It was then\u2013\u201cAh, father! It is evil arts! He used evil martial arts!\u201d shouted So Young-hyun, who had noticed the lord and the other two people of Mount Hyeong.I thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to speak as I had broken his jaw but he was still struggling to stay on top?\u201cEvil arts?\u201dBut an unexpected person reacted.He was the First Sword of Mount Hyeong, Cho Un-jong.\u2018Ah!\u2019I remembered himThe person who was gentle and shy most of the time.But he was someone who didn\u2019t like injustice at all, especially the Forces of Evil.\u201cIt isn\u2019t Evil arts\u2026\u201dPat!But before I could even explain the man moved.In the blink of an eye, he reduced the distance to 15 steps.\u2018Ah?\u2019I knew that Mount Hyeong is known to have quick swords and footwork but I didn\u2019t think it would be this good.He stopped right in front of me and asked,\u201cDisciple. Have you mastered the evil arts?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why is the successor of the family saying that you did?\u201dBecause the evil arts adversely affects the human body most people hated those who used such things. And Cho Un-jong was one of them.\u201cHyung! That man in front of you is my brother!\u201d\u201cBrother? So Wonhwi?\u201dCho Un-jong frowned.Judging from his reaction it seemed like he heard about me from the Yong-yong. I thought this would go well, but,\u201cI heard your dantian was damaged, is that incorrect?\u201dSh!He grabbed onto my wrist.He seemed suspicious of me no matter how much he heard and he had to check it for himself.I quickly stepped back.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThe dantian which was damaged and in one year, yet you managed to get to this level.\u201dTak.Cho Un-jong was following my movement, well, he was known to be a genius.\u201cGive me a chance to explain.\u201dSrin!At my words, he pulled out his sword.\u201cI checked you what more can be explained through words?\u201d\u201cYou want to do this?\u201d\u201cIf we fight then it will be clear if you used evil arts or not. Pick your sword up.\u201dChachka!As soon as he said that, his sword began to come for me.It was the famous Clear Wind Sword. A technique that any warrior in their sect can learn, but what was unfolding now isn\u2019t such a simple one but a higher level of it\u2018Nothing could be done.\u2019If this was going to happen, then I had to prove it with my sword.The Pure Wind Sword of his began to change like the wind. To counter this, I did the same.\u2018Loach Shaped Sword technique!\u2019It was one of the three techniques I had learned.Like a soft willow branch, it was a technique that could handle anything.Chachahcang!And our swords collided.Mine like a willow branch and his like the wind met and our swords entangled. Each time the swords collided my palms hurt.\u2018This is different.\u2019He was different from the people I had faced till now.Cho Un-jong, who would become the master of this faction, made me wonder if I could win with just half my power.How could such a soft technique hold so much power?Then should I spread the distance\u2026 uh?Pat!Cho Un-jong, who was fighting me, widened the distance first and the others looked puzzled at his actions. But then he suddenly asked me with a trembling voice,\u201cYou, what is your relationship with Warrior Ho Jong-dae?\u201dAt his words, the quiet place turned noisy.\u201cHo Jong-dae?\u201d\u201cDid he just say that name?\u201dWarrior Ho Jong-dae.Even after 15 years, there was no one in the world of Murim who didn\u2019t know of that man.It was the name of the man of Yunnan province, the Heavenly Southern Swordsman.And he asked me again,\u201cTell me clearly. Do you know that man?\u201dAt his question, I bowed down and spoke confidently,\u201cHe is my teacher.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019As soon as I said those words, my insides felt twisted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Southern Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s Disciple (1)\u201cS-Southern Heavenly\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\u201cHis disciple?\u201dI felt a bit stunned at their intense reactions. I knew he had a larger-than-life reputation, but this reaction was too much, and to believe the man had vanished over 15 years ago.He was truly a swordsman who was worthy of being called a legend.-Uh. Is he this good?-Hmm. This is only a natural reaction.Iron sword made a coughing sound.This was something to be proud of.This was the first time I had ever seen my father, who was always angry and strict, open his mouth wide with shock.\u201cNo way. It cannot be.\u201dSo Young-hyun didn\u2019t like me claiming that I had a good master and began to deny it.He didn\u2019t want to believe it. I glanced at my sister. She had always worn a careful expression, but right now she was looking at me with shocked eyes.Now she looked her age, all innocent.\u201cR-really\u2026? You are the disciple of Ho Jong-dae?\u201d asked Cho Jung-un. His face, which had been full of doubt and suspicion, changed.The voice of Iron Sword resounded in my head,-This reminds me\u2018What?\u2019-Humans seem to age a lot which makes their faces hard to recognize the longer it has been.\u2018Have you met him?\u2019-Right. This warrior in front of you was helped by my former master in the north of Yunnan twenty years back\u2018Is it real?\u2019Oh. This was a piece of unexpected luck.I didn\u2019t think this man would have such a good relationship with Southern Heavenly Swordsman.Even if this man was called the founder of Mount Hyeong\u2019s sect, he couldn\u2019t have been anything like this 20 years back.Sh!I bowed to Cho Jong-un and said,\u201cI heard a lot of stories about the great warrior from my teacher. It is an honor to meet you like this!\u201d\u201cIs this true?\u201dWhat?Is this person really the one or not?The confused stiff unsure image of him vanished and now he was looking at me with twinkling eyes like he admired me.\u201cHe often mentioned that he established a good relationship with you in Yunnan on the north side 20 years back and he praised you to be a warrior who will brighten up the world in the future.\u201d\u201cHuh, that is\u2026\u201dAt my words, Cho Jong-un scratched his head feeling a bit shy. I didn\u2019t think he would like it this much.And he asked,\u201cDid such a great warrior speak of me?\u201dSo was he the type to feel weak to praise? No.This was because the Southern Heavenly Sword had spoken about him, and then someone came over.The woman in the white robe, Cho Il-hye, looked young and pretty.\u201cSahyung.\u201d\u201cSamae. He is alive.\u201dCho Jong-un said to her feeling thrilled. It felt strange to listen to it.I did hear that Southern Heavenly Swordsman was a role model for a lot of people but I didn\u2019t think that even young people would respect him so much.\u201cThis little disciple is his disciple.\u201dCho Il-hye looked quite shocked.\u201cSo Wonhwi greets the Mount Hyeong\u2019s Female Warrior.\u201dAt my words, she too greeted me back by knowing I was a bit flustered about all of this, and she actually was quite beautiful.\u201cWhat is this? Treat us comfortably.\u201d\u201cIf you are the disciple of that great man, we could be of the same level now, so there is no need to be this formal.\u201dUh? What did this mean? We are of the same level?-My former master had an acquaintance with their teacher, a member named Ho Shim-hang. So the disciple of their sect called my former master a mentor.Wait.Ho Shim-hang was the sect leader now!Ahh, I see.Actually, if that was true, at their time a lot of people must have been close to my teacher and are all probably elders and sect leaders by now.The sects were known to be more sensitive to such relationships than the Forces of Evils.Chak!Cho Jong-un, who was moved, also took a bow to me and apologized.\u201cI apologize. I got too excited for nothing and I said that you were using evil arts without even listening to you. I was horrible to you.\u201dHe looked like he was beating himself up inside. This man had more honest feelings than I thought.\u201cNo. Senior\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not call me senior.\u201d\u201cWe called your teacher mentor, our teachers called him their sahyung, so how can we be above you? Call me sahyung comfortably!\u201dAt Cho Jong-un\u2019s words, our surroundings turned noisy.One of the men, known to be one of the rising pillars of Mount Hyeong, was treating someone with this much friendliness?They envied this. Even I wanted to burst into a chuckle but I had to manage this situation properly.I spoke with a look of shock,\u201cHow can I do that to Senior\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you put it like that, then what about my position?\u201dHe winked at me and said,\u201cSo Sajae do not be too burdened with all that.\u201dEven Cho Il-hye called me sajae. And I carefully responded to their words,\u201cIs it really fine if I call you like that?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t we say it was fine?\u201dLooking at Cho Jong-un I smiled and said,\u201cI understand. Sahyung.\u201d\u201cHahahaha. What a happy day.\u201dHearing my words, he laughed out real happy-like.He was the kind to hide his true feelings a lot and shy away from meeting people, so I didn\u2019t think that he had such a side to him.He seemed to be really glad to be able to get into contact with the disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman.And how can this chance be missed?\u201cI am glad the misunderstanding got resolved with the help of sahyung. If not for you I would have been tagged as the villain who mastered evil arts.\u201d\u201cHow could such a stigma be placed onto the successor of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dAt his words, I turned my head and looked at So Young-hyun who was not sure what he had to do.Because of my words, now he turned into a man who tried to put dirt on the name of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman\u201cI-it isn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201dSomething stopped him.It was So Ik-heon. He came close. After it got revealed that I was the disciple of a strong person he seemed to have complicated thoughts running through his mind.And that was good enoughHe is the man who kicked me out of the house and family without even treating me like a human. In a way, the abandoned child was now back with gold around him, so would he like this?\u2018Uh.\u2019Seeing his face only made me angry.If only he had taken responsibility for the treatment of my mother, things would have been different.I don\u2019t know what his place in this world was, but he was surely disqualified to be the head of a family.Being angry wasn\u2019t a good thing, especially if I wanted to achieve my goals.Tak!I got down on my knees and bowed,\u201cI send my greetings to my father.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhen I bowed, no voice responded. The same thing happened in the past too.Even then I greeted him.-What did he say?\u2018I was kicked out because he said he never had a son like me.\u2019No hesitation.At that time those words came out as soon as I bowed. But now he didn\u2019t even say anything.Staying bowed wasn\u2019t right, so I got up slowly, and as I got up he said,\u201c\u2026 it has been so long. I am glad you are fine.\u201dI laughed inside.He was the one who greeted me because the people of the Mount Hyeong sect liked me.Still, there was no smile on his face.\u201cHm.\u201dRight then, Cho Il-hye intervened.She must have heard of the dynamic of the family from Yong-yong, so she must have known what kind of bonds my father and I shared.\u201cYou are quite blessed. Since the youngest son has become a disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman, isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201dShe deliberately said this to the lord.Of course, this was something she was doing to raise my worth. She was trying to make the atmosphere more pleasant.\u201cThank you for your words,\u201dLord So Ik-heon put his hand together and bowed.However, his expression stayed unchanged. He glanced at his fallen sons and said,\u201cI heard the story. But you have gone too far.\u201dIn the meantime, he seems to have known what happened. It must have been while I was talking to Cho Jong-un.I answered casually.\u201cI apologize. As my two hyungs became overly emotional, they acted much too intensely and tried to take my life. I had no choice but to slightly overdo things in the name of self-defense.\u201dWhat to do.I had a reason for doing all of this.Was there any other reason for doing this in a place with so many eyes watching?This was to prevent my father and the rest of the family from playing things from the shadows. And how did he act out then?\u201c\u2026 I see. We can think of blaming your brothers for their mistakes later. We have to serve our guests now. So let\u2019s talk later.\u201dThis was definitely different from my two brothers. No wonder, this man was old and too experienced in handling such matters.Naturally, he tried to let the moment pass by putting something else in the foreground.But how could I let such a chance slip me by?\u201cFather. You didn\u2019t even ask why I came back home.\u201dAt my words, his expression wrinkled, maybe he was going crazy trying to figure out what I was thinking.What business could the abandoned son have with him?Father was looking at me suspiciously so I clarified,\u201cFather. Please give me the seat of the next head to represent the martial arts tournament.\u2019\u2018\u2026!\u2019At my words, his eyes went wide.The main hall of the manor.An hour had passed and now everyone was having a late lunch.Nomnum and clack.I glanced at Cho Seong-won who was making all sorts of noises when eating and even Sima Young was disgusted by this.But this guy came from the Beggars Union and he was bound to make noise while eating. Like he was greedy for something.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t know how to eat, can you not make so much noise when eating?\u201dSima Young looked at him and said,\u201cBut isn\u2019t that too much? Isn\u2019t this making you happy?\u201d\u201cI am happy, so much so that I want to hit you.\u201dAt her words, he looked confused.Since he didn\u2019t know what her skills were, he was the one who had decided that they should treat each other like they were on the same level.Cho Seong-won mumbled,\u201cA beggar is always decent enough.\u201dOf course, one look from her, and he went back to eating. The habit was something she wanted to correct.Sima Young who looked at him smiled brightly at me,\u201cSahyung. You must be tired, do eat a lot.\u201dAs the attitude she held was different from him, Cho Seong-won imitated her tone of voice, teasing herAnd,Sring!\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d\u201c\u2026. Sorry.\u201dSeeing how quickly he stepped back, it seemed like he also held amazing skill.-I guess these are the traits of a beggar. Well.It was true. After leaving the Blood Sect, his true nature was slowly coming out of its shell.-What do you think?\u2018Well.\u2019I am not too sure either.So Ik-heon had declined to answer on the spot.I wanted to push it a bit more but it turned difficult as Il-hye had intervened.However, there was no choice but to hand over the position to me. Both of my brothers had either their wrists or shins broken.There was little time left, and their injuries weren\u2019t something that could heal fast, and the family would not put some injured weak person in.-Right.Perhaps maybe he would come to the same conclusion this evening.A small banquet was put on to welcome the people of Mount Hyeong, so when the time came I would know.-But, he really doesn\u2019t treat you like a son at all.The reason for Short Sword\u2019s grumbling was quite simple, the guards who were watching the dining hall were not just guards but those who had mastered their arts.They were watching us.This was why Sima Young kept calling me sahyung.-Isn\u2019t it better to just ask Sima Young to naturally head into a quarrel?Naturally, Sima Young didn\u2019t like this and there was no way she hadn\u2019t noticed that the men had learned martial arts.And putting such men near the door meant that we were all being openly monitored.\u2018No. I will leave them alone for now.\u2019Now was this kind of game.Regardless of whether I was the disciple of a great warrior or not, these people were placed here to tell us that this was the place of the Ikyang So family.-So cheap\u2018Wicked beggars.\u2019A warning from the head to me.That he was also watching and I shouldn\u2019t do anything hasty like before.He must be mad that I had turned two of his sons into temporary cripples. Well, Yong-yong was late.Originally we had decided to talk when having lunch but she didn\u2019t come so we ended up starting without her.-Could something have happened?That could not be. With Cho Il-hye here, who would touch her?\u2018Huh?\u2019Someone came to the door and I turned at the light footsteps which resembled a woman\u2019s.At the sight of her approaching, the eyes of all three of us turned to look.Knock!The voice spoke after a low knock,\u201cYoung Master. I am a servant of the Peony Pavilion, I am here to deliver the invitation of the Madame.\u201d\u201cPeony Pavilion?\u201d asked Sima Young, a bit puzzled.Hm\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that this would be the first place to move.-What is the Peony Pavilion?\u2018You heard it. It is the madame.\u2019Peony Pavilion.The residence of the wife of the lord, the actual wife.And if it weren\u2019t for the news of what I did, it would be a place that I had no relation to, and no urge to form one with.Because she had been through a lot.The mother of my two brothers was calling for me.The red peony flowers filled the garden. The flowers didn\u2019t bloom except for this time of the year and they were in full bloom now.Seeing these flowers made me feel disgusted.It was like seeing his wife and I wanted to burn them down. As long as the servants were keeping an eye on me I could do nothing.-Why are they doing this?\u2018The rumors must have spread.\u2019One hour was enough time for rumors to spread and in the Peony Pavilion where the wives were kept, skilled people were usually placed.Right, but they are all just second and third-rate warriors.\u201cThis way\u2026\u201dFollowing the servant she sent me, I entered the pavilionJust entering the pavilion made me feel disgusted. Why was I called?Drr!The main room of the pavilion opened and a middle-aged beautiful woman was sitting in front of an antique table.That thin-eyed woman was the madame.\u2018First-rate.\u2019I knew she had learned martial arts but when I felt her it felt a bit lacking.-Why is her face so white?Her nose looked too prominent as she smeared white power to hide her wrinkles.Shh!I bowed lightly.I could be called rude but I didn\u2019t want to be polite to her. I couldn\u2019t forget the humiliation that my mother suffered from her.\u201cYou are here. You people can leave.\u201d\u201cYes. Madame.\u201dAt the gentle words, the two women who had guided me retreated.What was the point of having them here?She walked up to me as if she had made a huge decision and I couldn\u2019t figure out why she was doing this.Thud!\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Then she suddenly knelt on the ground making me frown at the unexpected behavior.\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201dShe looked up at me at the question and said,\u201cI heard it. That you are following the teachings of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman. I congratulate you.\u201dHa!Was she kneeling to celebrate?I could already guess what her intentions were. And she said to me in a serious voice,\u201cI know we do not get along so well. I will not deny it\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cI will speak out then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you wish, I can get down on my knees and apologize a dozen times, maybe a hundred times too.\u201dThe proud woman was willing to apologize?I remember how much she hated me, and I remembered how she kept a cloth to wipe off the hands which touched me.And she said,\u201cSo, please do not covet the position of Young-hyun.\u201dAh\u2026She was so clich\u00e9.Right. Whether she was bad or not, all the mothers have the same heart.She called me to protect her son\u2019s position.\u201cIs that why I was called?\u201dTo my cold voice, she spoke in a pleading voice,\u201cIf you want to, I can give you the means so that you can eat and play with for the rest of your life. And we can even help the family you want. Just don\u2019t covet the position of my son.\u201dIt seems like she was determined to convince me in any way possible. It seemed like the position of a disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman was great. Seeing her go this low and beg told me that she was feeling a sense of crisis.\u201cSigh.\u201dA sigh came out.The attitude had changed so easily. It is a sight that I would have never even dreamed about.How can the one who kept breaking me down kneel down?But I drew the line,\u201cSorry. I will pretend like I didn\u2019t hear that.\u201dAnd I turned around to get out of her room.But then she got up and rushed to the door.\u201cDo not do this.\u2019\u201cI want to say the same to you.\u201dAt my words, she bit her lips and then said,\u201cTell me what you want. I will listen to anything.\u201dGive me anything I want. I stopped and told her,\u201cYou mean it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHer face brightened as if she found a string of hope and I said,\u201cThen, can you bring me my mother\u2019s memorial tablet and place it in the family and bow to her every three days for ten years?\u201dHer expression went stiff. Of course, she hated this.Trying to tell her to recognize my mother whom she desperately tried to ignore and asking her to bow for 10 years was something her pride would not allow.She frowned,\u201cReally\u2026 you will not covet my son\u2019s place if I do that?\u201dTruly expected from maternal love.Wouldn\u2019t it be great if she could give a little of this kindness to my mother?In the end, this only excited me so I smiled at her.And I quietly went close to her ear and said,\u201cWould you do it? You bitch.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Her face turned red,\u201cY-You! How dare you!\u201dAs she was getting angry I told her,\u201c12 years back, when I was here. Your servant gave me medicine,\u201dUpon hearing those words, her expression turned pale.Why? Did you think I didn\u2019t know?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Southern Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s Disciple (2)Twelve years agoThat memory was still vivid in my mind. The servant who had passed me the medicine.When I was just eight years old I didn\u2019t have a strong enough constitution to handle raw medicine. Even if the effects were reduced, in order for me to consume some, it had to be refined.But after taking the medication from the servant, I fell victim to medicinal poisoning.The Mistress had asked her servants to find the culprit, but the case ended without any results, all because this servant had somehow vanished into thin air.\u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d shocked, her face quickly paled.Who hadn\u2019t known that the servant was from the Peony Pavilion? Everyone knew who the culprit was, even her husband, the Lord.\u201cDid you think I would forget?\u201dShe was shocked at my cold voice and tried to make excuses.\u201cI think you misunderstood something, but that was\u2026\u201d\u201cThe servant was from the Peony Pavilion and used a medicine that was too raw on the third son of this family, do you think some ordinary person could do that?\u201d\u201cD-don\u2019t come near me!\u201dShe began to step back. Me expressing my anger must have given her a sense of intimidation.But it didn\u2019t matter\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\u201cI-I that. That wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\u201cYou are disgusting till the end.\u201dTrying to get out of what she did was horrible enough. She does all such kinds of things for the sake of her son, and now she acts like a sacrificing mother.I took a step forward.\u201cDo not come closer!\u201dShe began to wave her palms telling me to not approach and trying to block my advance.If she had reflected on what she did and apologized to me that day things would have been better.After all, one was only human.\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to covet your son\u2019s place? That is quite funny.\u201dIf I was weak or had nothing to do with the Southern Heavenly Swordsman, I wouldn\u2019t have been treated like this.She would have beaten me and kicked me out again like in the past.As she stepped back biting her lip she said,\u201cDo you think you can become the representative of the family if you threaten me?\u201dWas she finally revealing her true colors?Right, pretending to be afraid doesn\u2019t suit you. And I told her,\u201cDo whatever you want. Whether you tell the Lord or not.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cInstead I will also let everyone know.\u201d\u201cEveryone know?\u201d\u201cLet everyone know what kind of woman is hiding behind the name of the Ikyang So family. I wonder what the warriors and families of Murim would say if they found out a grown woman tried to hurt a kid who couldn\u2019t even defend himself.\u201dHer expression stiffened at my words.She must have thought that I would get angry and do something which she could use against me, but I was not that stupid.\u201cI am warning you. If you understand what I am saying, do not look for me for such useless reasons.\u201dFinally, I was about to leave the room when she grabbed my clothes.\u201cW-wait!\u201dPak!I coldly pushed her away and but then\u2013PssI glanced up as some powder fell down from the ceiling.\u2018Hiding.\u2019The servants were sent out, but a hidden presence was inside the room.Perhaps her own personal escort. The person who was hiding their presence until now must have felt disturbed and let their presence leak out.And I spoke to the one hiding above,\u201cI do not intend to harm your master, so you can come out.\u201dMadame looked shocked. She must have thought that I wouldn\u2019t have noticedWell, I was done so I could finally head back now.Thud!The floor shook when someone jumped down.The person had a slender form and a mask on, but looking at their chest it was clear she was a woman.\u201cEscort Jo.\u201dMadame was shocked at how I identified her with her appearance obscured.The masked woman who was called Escort Jo took off her mask and told me,\u201cEscort Jo Ga who serves Madame greets the disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dShe was older than I had thought. She looked to be in her 40s or 50s and from the expression on her face, she seemed to have a lot to say.Of course, I had nothing to hear.I was ignoring her and tried to open the door when she said,\u201cI was the servant who poisoned the Young Master on that day.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019My hand reaching for the door stopped and I turned to look back,\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Madame didn\u2019t know until later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 didn\u2019t know until later?\u201dI looked at Madame.Her expression was complicated and the escort knelt down and said,\u201cIt was all done by my own thoughts. I couldn\u2019t accept someone who wasn\u2019t of decent birth trying to push the other young masters.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThere was no surprise to this.So what had happened wasn\u2019t an order but done on the accord of a mere servant?I had to doubt this. Even if I didn\u2019t have a decent birth, I was still one of the children who carried the blood of the Lord. Was it possible for a servant to hate it that much?\u201cYou, are you from the Jo family?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe escort didn\u2019t answer which confirmed she was.The Jo family was the home of Madame, and that said, if the escort also had Jo in her name, she must have been an escort brought from Madame\u2019s family.\u201cThen can it be said that what had happened at that time was because of the Jo family?\u201dShe was shocked at this accusation,\u201cNo. As I said, it was all on my own accord.\u201dWas this woman trying to take the punishment on her alone? The lack of information made it tough to make a decision.Perhaps she had said this to protect her Madame,\u201cI have been with Madame since she was a child in her parent\u2019s house and I couldn\u2019t watch someone who I considered a true sister worry over someone like you. So I did what she wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cAnd you did that?\u201d\u201cI wanted you to know that this has nothing to do with my Madame. I am sorry and if you punish me, I will simply accept it.\u201dThud!She banged her head on the ground. Was she sacrificing herself?Well, this was quite the loyal cat.And Madame covered for her escort and said,\u201cNo! That was something I ordered! Escort Jo is lying to you out of loyalty, there is no need to listen to this nonsense.\u201d\u201cMadame!\u201dSurprisingly, both insisted on taking the blame, it seemed like Madame wanted to protect her escort.-Amazing. Simply amazing.Short Sword clicked her tongue.I shared a similar sentiment. She was a woman who was just so horrible to me. Yet, for the sake of her people, she was willing to sacrifice herself?\u201cHaa.\u201dI sighed.Judging from this, it seemed like her wickedness came from malice, and not some innate nature.She knew how to care for her people, and how to make sacrifices too, and she looked quite comfortable doing it.Now Madame was speaking with tears in her eyes.\u201cIt was something I did, leave my escort and children alone. If you want to be angry at someone, blame me!\u201d\u201cNo! This is something I did. Madame is lying to protect me!\u201d\u201cNo! Didn\u2019t I say it was me?\u201dLooking at them I shook my head. This made it look like I was the villain.I spoke to the two,\u201cI am the one who will turn into a villain if I do anything.\u201dAt my words, the two of them looked shocked.As if they could feel that the issue was being resolved, they looked at me with a bit of emotion.And I said to them with a smile,\u201c\u2026 is what you thought I would say?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Pak!\u201cHuh!\u201dAs soon as I finished it, I pushed them to the side and then kicked the escort in her chin\u201cKuak!\u201dShe fell to the ground as she got hit with my internal qi.Confused, she tried to get back up, but I quickly touched her blood points.Madame looked a bit shocked,\u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d\u201cThe friendship between you and the escort seems nice but it isn\u2019t something you should be bragging about in front of the victim.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cThe bottom line is that you knew about it right?\u201dMy words made her speechless.Such a funny woman.She knew who had done it but decided to close her eyes to the truth. How could such a beautiful friendship be grounded in such evil?I couldn\u2019t hear the escort move as I sealed her blood point,\u201cFine. I believe you. Then you need to pay for it.\u201dI put my hand on the escort\u2019s stomach making her eyes widen. Madame tried to pull me off but it was too late.Pang!\u201cEummmmm!\u201dI could see the blood vessels bulge up and her eyes shut in pain.I had just destroyed her dantian. Well, she was the one who had just admitted to the crimes committed against me, so she had to pay the right price.\u201cYou dirty trash!\u201dMadame couldn\u2019t hide her anger and her true colors were revealed.\u201cIt is good that you know to take care of your own people.\u201dThere were two guests from the Mount Hyeong Sect here, so everyone would want these private matters to go smoothly.I pulled something out of my pocket, they were two small beads.I forced open the mouth of the escort and placed a pill in, and then I covered her nose so that she was forced to swallow.\u201cYou! What have you done?\u201dI threw the other one at madame who accidentally caught it, and I said,\u201cHave this.\u201d\u201cWhat? Eat it?\u201d\u201cPoison pill.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019At my words, she panicked not knowing what to do. In the first place, there wasn\u2019t anyone who could take the role of representing warrior of the Ikyang So family.And when there is the best solution there is also the second best and the worst one too.\u201cY-you are crazy! Are you telling a person to eat poison pills?\u201d\u201cYou should eat it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf not, I am about to take this one to the Lord and say that I found the culprit to the past issue. That is nice. At the same time, there are a lot of guests right now.\u201dAt my words, she began to contemplate. If that were the case she knew what would happen.She hesitated as she held the pill to her lip.\u201cYou, don\u2019t you know what will happen? You are someone trying to take the top place in the world and plunge your own home into chaos?\u201dI smiled at her and said,\u201cThen I will be quite happy.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019At my words, she trembled as if a chill had run down her spine.I feel really happy now.For giving me a reason to use the worst thing I had prepared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Southern Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s Disciple (3)Walking down the hallway of the Peony Pavilion I felt refreshed.I had two papers in my hands, detailing what the two women had done to me, written by their own hands.This wasn\u2019t enough so I even made sure they used their seals.-I feel like you are becoming crazier and crazier like that old man?Muttered Short Sword.This was the right level of evil.Could I ever believe that vicious woman just because she knelt down? She could always go out and say that I had threatened her to write it down.Well, if they were prepared to die, they could still do that even now.-I don\u2019t think so.\u2018You don\u2019t you think so?\u2019Unexpectedly the Madame and her escort were supposed friends and their attachment to each other was surely strong enough that they would hide information for the sake of the other.If this wasn\u2019t true, the escort would be sacrificed so Madame could flip the stone saying that the escort was innocent, and that wouldn\u2019t work well for me.So, I told them that if either of them cheated they wouldn\u2019t be given an antidote for the poison they had taken, and if one of them cheated the escort would die for sure.-When I see things like this I feel like people are rather\u2026 surprising? Should I say more emotional than I thought? I don\u2019t think they are acting very rationally.-This is why humans are imperfect beings\u2026-Right, my former master had said that once-Hm, right.Iron Sword and Short Sword were right.If humans acted completely rationally then there would be no conflicts. But humans were more emotional than rational, and so they would always be considered imperfect.Of course, that applies to me too. There was a peaceful way, where they both were forgiven, yet I had not taken that path.Because seeing them suffer made me feel good.Is this called true revenge?\u2018Biting people like that is toxic.\u2019Coming down I laughed at how foolish those women were.Because of their pride, she kept all the low-level people away from the pavilion except for her escort.Now no one would know what had happened inside that room. And I walked out with calmness when I felt the servants notice me.-Hehe. They are all still here. Are you going to wait until the banquet?I was going to do that, but I changed my mind. After all, they touched me first so why do I need to wait?-Then what will you do?Everyone in the family was probably using their heads to the max trying to figure out a solution to who could represent them. Had it not been for the guests who had come, the head of the family would have already summoned an emergency meeting.No, everyone would have already come up with a solution too.\u2018This is good.\u2019-Uh?At this point, I need to make my move. So I headed to the hall.Sima Young and Cho Seong-won were following me as we headed to the inner hall of the manor.In the inner hall, there was a place for the heads to gather for meetings.[They are right behind.]Sima Young told me.When we suddenly moved out, the warriors, escorts, and servants quickly followed us. They asked us for a reason but we didn\u2019t bother responding.[Leave them alone.]No matter where we went in the manor we were already being watched.Whisper!In the garden of the inner hall, there were aides waiting for the head to arrive.There were just eight people but all eight of them belonged to the Ikyang So family. This meant that they were also waiting for the meeting inside to adjourn.Those who recognized me continued to stare.As I approached ignoring them, the eight aides stopped me.\u201cPlease stop, Young Master.\u201d\u201cWhy are you blocking my path?\u201dI actually know the reason.I could not be let in because the discussion inside was about who could represent the family in the tournament, other than me of course.But they looked a bit shocked as I questioned. In the past, they would have told me to get out but now they could not.And one of them told me,\u201cRight now, there is a meeting over a family-related issue, so no one can\u2026\u201d\u201cWho do you mean?\u201dHearing my question, the man went silent. The head of the family should be there. One of the two step-siblings I had was the only one who could say such things.\u201cIf the head of the family said it, then fine.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Young Master.\u201d\u201cI will keep it down.\u201dAt the sound of me stepping forward, they eventually moved to the side. Their attitude showed that they were helpless.If it was before like in the past, I would have been kicked out right then but now they were backing down.Well, I climbed onto the inner hall\u2019s floor and headed to the meeting room.Thud!When the door opened, I could see eight people sitting at the long table and they all looked at me as I bowed.\u201cLong time no see, Elders.\u201dAt my greetings, they all had the same expression on the outside\u2013a mixture of shock and embarrassment.No one thought I would come here.\u201cDespite being family, no one will greet me.\u201dAt my words, the five who were sitting at the lowest seats hurriedly bowed to me, and I to them.\u201cHead of the shrine, Mak San-yong greets the third young master.\u201dEven in the midst of this, the three sitting at the top didn\u2019t even bother greeting me.They were the head of the troops, Ha Jang-gyun; the head of the first hall, Jin Ki-hyung; and the head of the second hall, Yang Mun-seok.Ha Jang-gyun didn\u2019t bow to anyone other than the lord. It was understandable since he was second in command, only following the head\u2019s orders.On the other hand, Jin Ki-hyung and Yag Mun-seok who came from the same Jo family as the madame, were people who lived chaste lives and believed deeply in it.Ha Jang-gyun who was sitting at the top said,\u201cYou should have been blocked, told that we were having a meeting here, how did you manage to get in?\u201d\u201cYou are talking as if I came into a place I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cOnly the lord and the heads of halls can come here apart from the successor. You couldn\u2019t have not known that.\u201dAs expected of the head of troops.He spoke everything not caring whose disciple I was. As the oldest vassal of this family, he was someone who had amazing confidence in his every move.\u201cYou are right. No matter how much you get called young master this is a rude move. If you have something to say, take it up at a separate time.\u201dYang Mun-seok added in. They were desperate to get me out.Seeing him brought back bad memories, real bad ones.\u201cHead Yang Mun-seok.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIt has been a while so I am not used to these actions. Can you not yell and scream and tell me to leave as you did before?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what do you mean? I don\u2019t remember doing that.\u201dRight. No perpetrator remembers it.\u201cAhh. Then I will have to remind you. At that time didn\u2019t you personally kick me out of my home?\u201dI still remember it clearly.He personally brought the warriors of the family and forcibly pushed me out.Even at the time, I was thrown out of the family so does this mean I am not a member of this family?\u201cWhat did you say to me at that time? Ah, right. Don\u2019t ever think about coming around the home you scumbag\u2026?\u201dYang Mun-seok\u2019s face went stiff. How could I remember that? That was what he seemed to be thinking.I smiled and said,\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy getting used to being called a young master. Call me the same as you did back then.\u201dSome of the heads frowned at this.They were the ones who didn\u2019t cross a fine line with me. And Yang Mun-seok\u2019s eyes turned bitter.He wouldn\u2019t have expected that I would bring up such old things at such a place.\u201cPhew.\u201dAt that time, Yang Mun-seok said,\u201cAhh. Did I do that? After overcoming a lot I often forget about things that happened a year back, it is probably because I am getting old. If it is because of that, if the young master feels uncomfortable, I will make sure to apologize for it.\u201d-This man, I am so annoyed!Right.He was always like this.He is someone who came from the Jo family and he was never fond of me, so he used everything he could to cause pain to my mother and my siblings.But now he seemed to think I was the same as in the past.I smiled and said,\u201cAhh. I see. But is this fine?\u201d\u201cUh? What is?\u201d\u201cIf you cannot remember what happened a year back then it seems like it would be difficult for you to do your duties in the family. Shouldn\u2019t you step down?\u201dYang Mun-seok\u2019s eyes twitched at this.He didn\u2019t think he would get pushed by me. And how dare he try to sneak away instead of taking responsibility for what he did?\u201cA joke. A joke.\u201dI smiled waving my hand and his displeased expression turned a bit relaxed.At that time, he spoke as if his true colors were going to show.\u201cHowever, one of the heads of halls and a vassal to the family is trying to get away for the rude words he said to the third son of the lord with an apology?\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cApologize by being polite first.\u201dWith those words, I began to release my qi.When one reaches a certain point they could give a sense of intimidation by the pressure they exuded naturally when they released their qi.Yang Mun-seok\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cKuak.\u201dWill he keep his pride?At that time, Jin Ki-hyun got up.\u201cWhat do you want to do now? Does the disciple of the famous Southern Heavenly Swordsman want to take revenge for the past things?\u201dHe was using the name of my teacher to make me stop. And Yang Mun-seok mouthed his thanks.Sima Young who was behind me said,\u201cSince when is it an act of personal revenge to point out the rudeness and mistakes of a vassal of a family? The hierarchy of this family is seriously messed up.\u201dAt first glance, it seemed like she said it for me, but it was a voice she wanted everyone to know.And what she said was right, and this made Jin Ki-hyung angry,\u201cHow dare someone not of this family enter into the family affairs? How could Young Master bring in such a person into an important place where the matters of family are\u2026\u201dFlinch!He suddenly stopped what he was saying at the energy which rose from Sima Young. Her eyes screamed, \u2018I will kill you.\u2019\u2018Ah.\u2019Just as expected.She was already asking for my permission to kill them and I shook my head.Even now, she looked annoyed at my decision.-Oh, they kicked a beehive.Short Sword seemed to be very excited.To some extent, I could understand her being angry for my sake, but she could not act how she wanted here.So I pretended to stop her,\u201cSajae. Calm down.\u201d\u201cSajae?\u201dJin Ki-hyung looked shocked.If she was a sajae, then she had to be a disciple of that great man too. it felt all too flustering for him.\u201cIt seems like the head of a hall was displeased with me bringing in my sajae.\u201dJin Ki-hyung\u2019s expression changed at my words. Should we call it an attitude change?\u201cWhat are you saying, Young Master? You can bring them. Not knowing how valuable guests they were, I acted rudely. Please forgive me with a generous heart.\u201d-Oh. He is fast.Short Sword continued to hate everyone in my family and it seemed like Iron Sword joined in the lampooning.-It is just because they are scared.At that time, Ha Jang-gyun said,\u201cI think the meeting should be held when the Lord arrives. We can leave now and come back later..\u201dThey tried to leave in hurry but would I let them?I gave the order without even looking back,\u201cClose the door.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dCho Seong-won was the first to go and close it. Then they stayed near the door like a gatekeeper.At this, the face of the hall heads looked shocked.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Head of troops, Ha Jang-gyun said,\u201cWhat do you think you are doing?\u201dThe room was filled with tension, this was nice. Since the door was blocked they were feeling scared.\u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, it will seem like we were unable to have a proper conversation.\u201d\u201cThere seem to be other intentions from Young Master.\u201dShh!The man put his hand around the waist where his sword was. Maybe they noticed it, the others too were ready.The air turned heavy and it was then,\u201cI have a good suggestion.\u201d\u201cSuggestion?\u201dThey all frowned at my sudden words and I spoke to their puzzled faces with a smile.\u201cI will give you a chance to change sides.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Southern Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s Disciple (4)\u201cI will give you a chance to change sides.\u201dThe expression of the heads of the house changed at my words. Such an offer was such an unexpected out for them.Considering my relationship with my own family, the supposed grabbing of power wouldn\u2019t be smooth, but since I had offered my hand, their thoughts must have slightly changed.-Will they actually take it?Short Sword asked. It was hard to guess what I was thinking.Ha Jang-gyun, the head of the troops, who had his hands on the sword, opened his mouth.\u201cDoes the young master know what he is talking about?\u201d\u201cI am sure I said it right.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of behavior does the person who inherits the blood of the great family of Ikyang So do?\u201dIt was funny that he was talking about dignity now. I didn\u2019t really know that he cared about what I did.\u201cAhh. You made such a disrespectful remark that doesn\u2019t suit the status of a vassal of this family. But you did, was it alright for you to say that? How about just taking my side?\u201dSpeak out openly if you want.If I had to turn around and say there, there is no better word than the true expression of selfishness that men like Jin Ki-hyun or Yang Mun-seok hid.\u201cYou\u2026 I hope you do not mean that you want us to support your bid to be the representative of the family in the tournament.\u201dI nodded my head at the words of Ha Jin-gyun.\u201cIf it is the representative position, there is no reason to come to us. You can take this up with the lord.\u201dAs expected, the final decision-maker was the lord of the family. They could voice their opinions, but at the end of the day, everything was moved by the Lord\u2019s will.At that time, Yang Mun-seok spoke,\u201cNo, are you talking about the seat of the successor?\u201dI smiled at the question.Yang Mun-seok, Jin ki-hyuk, and Gam Woo-moon were unable to hold their expressions.Looking at this, it was clear that these men were definitely pushing the children of the official wife.On the other hand, the face of Mok San-young, was different,-They see youWasn\u2019t this on purpose?Of course, just because some of them were good to me, didn\u2019t mean that they could be trusted.They could be viewed as neutral. In their minds, they must already be thinking over the proposal I had made.Would the descendent of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman function well as the successor? Or was So Young-hyun more suitable?As the atmosphere turned strange Ha Jang-gyun said,\u201cThe successor has already been decided, so are you trying to mess with the workings of the family?\u201dA sharp man.He managed to realize my innermost feelings. The seat of a successor wasn\u2019t given but earned.\u201cIf the current successor\u2019s skills are insufficient, isn\u2019t it something we can reconsider?\u201dThe second hall head, Jin Ki-hyun rushed in,\u201cIt is a no. Didn\u2019t the lord already tell you? The eldest Young Master is known to be a mastermind\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that if more than half of the vassals raise an objection even the lord will have to reconsider his decision right?\u201dAt those words, Jin Ki-hyun went silent.I was a member of this family too and I understood how the family works.If five people, or more than half of the heads of house raise an objection, then the Lord would have to reconsider the topic of succession. Just then, Yang Mun-seok mentioned,\u201cThe Lord has to think about the relationship with the Jo family too.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t speak out to me, so he decided to appeal to the other vassals.How scared must he be to bring up the family of the Madame?\u201cHearing you say those words, it seems like the Jo family is taking the relationship with me too lightly.\u201dThe Jo family was definitely a prestigious sect. However, was that title higher than the Southern Heavenly Swordsman whose name resounded over the entirety of the central plains?Yang Mun-seok looked shocked,\u201cI-I did not mean it like that.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so? I was concerned that the heads of the two families were ignoring my teacher. Well, I am glad.\u201dYang Mun-seok\u2019s expression was distorted by my words.There were a lot of people who tried to use their heads to outthink people, to twist their words against them, even the Murim Alliance was no stranger to this either.And I was a spy for around eight years and even I had to use my head to take advantage of situations.Ha Jang-gyun, said to me,\u201c\u2026 what all happened to you in this one year\u2019s worth of time?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dHe looked puzzled at my appearance, which had once been slumped and subservient.Actually, my former self would probably have been equally amazed. Just a year ago, I couldn\u2019t even raise my head in front of them, but now I was leading them by the nose, I was outmaneuvering the experienced vassals of the family.\u201cIt was something to welcome as the Young Master has grown up to be a disciple of Southern Heavenly Swordsman. But I cannot understand why you are causing this riot\u2026 what are you planning?\u201dThe reason he reacted like this was simple.Because I was looking into their eyes and making them tremble, and this should be a first for them.In the past, they only spoke how they wanted to, and would ignore my whole experience; but not anymore, and I said,\u201cAhh. I apologize, I was rude in front of the head.\u201dAnd I looked behind and said,\u201cI thought a few minutes could be given, but let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019At my words, Ha Jang-gyun frowned and looked back.Not just him, everyone expressed their doubts. They were trying to find out who had sent me their support through Voice Transmission.Chak!And I bowed to them and said,\u201cI have fully expressed my intentions and achieved my purpose here, even if it is in a small way, so I will step back. I think you know where I am staying. We are always open to visits, so please do come.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe door was opened up by Cho Sung-won who was guarding it.We were leaving and the vassals were still looking at each other, confused.As I came out of the inner hall, Short Sword asked me,-Who is going to side with you?I smiled at her question.\u2018No one.\u2019-What?No single person had sent me a voice transmission in the room. It just seemed like I had trembled my throat to give them that impression.-Puahahaha. So you messed with them?Short Sword who didn\u2019t know people could be deceived like this was laughing.This was my own method to make people agitated, a skill I learned as a spy. When there were a large number of people with unknown allegiances, making your throat tremble like you were sending a message would cause the biggest ripple.A wave of doubt and suspicion like now.-So that was the purposeOf course.Did you think that I would try to covet the place of successor? How many humiliations have I suffered in the meantime, and do I want to be their successor?The purpose was simply to create a ripple, causing them to doubt each other.\u201cSahyung.\u201dSima Young called me.When I looked at the place where she was looking, there was someone who was running inside.It was So Ik-heon, who was the lord of the family.Since it was in the same direction as the hall, we were bound to meet each other. And I nodded my head,\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201dApparently, he came in a hurry after receiving information from the servants. I smiled,\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201dSoo Ik-heon, who had a frown on his face, went to the inner hall without a word. It looked like he was figuring out what to do.As he entered the inner hall Sima Young spoke like she didn\u2019t understand,\u201cIs that man really the father of sahyung?\u201d\u201cRight\u201d\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand why he is so cold.\u201d\u201cThat is what I want to know.\u201dActually, I wasn\u2019t too curious. I no longer considered him to be a blood relation.What kind of person will be considered a father after he acts this cold?Sima Young was about to say something comforting, but she went silent. That was how kind she was.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSima Young blinked at my words.Anyway, I had achieved my goal here so I could head back to the guest room and wait for Yong-yong.Since the lord was here, that child too\u2026 huh?\u201cIsn\u2019t that the sister of sahyung?\u201dAs Sima Young said, So Yong-yong was walking toward the hall with tumbling feet.And someone was following her. A young man with dark eyes wearing a sword around his waist and a stronger build than expected was walking in front of Yong-yong.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cMiss. Let us talk for a moment.\u201d\u201cI said I had nothing more to say\u201dJust listening to the conversation it was clear Yong-yong didn\u2019t like this.And I soon found out why.\u201cI have no intention of coming under the Young Lord as your woman. Isn\u2019t the conversation already over? The Lord too\u2026.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Lord say that we need to discuss this slowly?\u201d\u201cThis is a conversation between those who will be involved and I spoke. Sigh. I do not want to talk anymore.\u201dYong-yong tried to pass but a man with thick eyelids blocked her.The guy with thick eyelids looked bad, but the rest of this so-called \u2018Young Master\u2019 appearance was quite normal.\u201cBecause you are feisty I like you even more.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dYong-yong started to move.She didn\u2019t seem the kind to like this, and I had no reason to just simply watch, and so I moved\u2013\u201cUh?\u201dIt was Sima Young. She ran faster than me to Yong-yong\u2019s side.\u201cThe Miss said she doesn\u2019t like you, so why are you chasing her?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dYong-yong looked at Sima Young a bit puzzled. And then Sima Young said something with her eyes.The young man felt offended by this sight and said with a stiff face,\u201cI am the son of the Uipyong Jo family. With what right are you intervening between us?\u201d\u201cUs? Since when did it turn into us for you?\u201dYong-yong asked the guy who had just revealed his identity.-Do you know him?Of course I knew him.The Uipyong Jo family was known for their bladed combat skills.These three families, the Jo family of the Madame; the Akan Gu family, and my own, were known to be the warrior families representing the Gangseosong area.And I remember from the past that one of the children looked at Yong-yong at a feast and asked for her, and the marriage happened later.-Ugh. She marries him?No.I remember Yong-yong saying no to the marriage as she liked a leader of the Murim Alliance Phoenix Troops. And she didn\u2019t get married because she had an affair with him.Even though Yong-yong was angry, the guy, Jo Sang-nam spoke,\u201cHow is it that we don\u2019t have a relationship between us? We will be married. I do not know about you, but I don\u2019t\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan you stop?\u201dAt that time, Sima Young grabbed Yong-yong\u2019s hand and interlocked their hands.\u201cLike this.\u201dSima Young smiled. Was her good-looking man face because of the mask? Yong-yong smiled,At this, Jo Sang-nam looked shocked,\u201cAre you throwing away the position of being my wife for this one?\u201dThis one?He went from speaking about marriage to talking about throwing away the position of wife, this guy looked to be a lost cause.\u201cI was trying to accept you as a wife due to the request of the madame, but all because of that parasitic older \u2026\u201dSlap!Before he could even finish, Sima Young slapped him.\u201cHa! Did you just slap me?\u201d\u201cWhy? Upset that a parasite like me slapped you? I kind of lost control because of your cheap words.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dSlap!\u201cKuak!\u201dJo Sang-nam turned his head. Sima Young scorned him,\u201cYou are so slow.\u201d\u201cYou bastard, you must really want to die!\u201dAs if the anger was rising high, Jo Sang-nam tried to draw his blade but I shouted,\u201cIf you pull the blade out, I will consider you a threat to my sister and my sajae.\u201dThe guy turned his head and his thick eyelids looked at me. I think I understood why Sima Young slapped him.\u201cHa! You trash of Yulang county!\u201dJudging from his reaction he must have heard of me. Actually, as soon as the Lord arrived, he went to receive the other guests so he shouldn\u2019t have heard too, well, it didn\u2019t matter.Jo Sang-nam shook his head,\u201cYou and your parasitic sajae\u2026\u201dAnd he went silent.And I figured out the reason as I looked at So Ik-heon coming back.\u201cL-Lord So.\u201dThe guy got flustered and took his hand off his blade.He seemed terrified that the Lord was looking angry-He is staring so terrifyingly.As Short Sword said, the guy was actually staring at me. It looked like I had done something.As he came over, Jo Sang-nam was spoken to,\u201cYoung lord Jo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThere is going to be a feast, so please don\u2019t do this here and have ample rest.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dHe was a lucky guy who decided to walk away. If the Lord hadn\u2019t intervened he would have been humiliated here.When Jo Sang-nam left, So Ik-heon looked at me,\u201cFollow me.\u201dYong-yong, Sima Young, and Jo Sung-won looked worried but I told them to go and rest.This moment of time had come sooner than I thought.There was no need to wait until the feast.The place where the Lord brought me to was the training room dedicated for him alone and he sent all his guards out as he locked the door behind them.It was a situation where there were just the two of us. What was he going to do?But as soon as So Ik-heon locked the door, he pulled out his sword from its sheath.Srng!A sword with a blue pattern.It was the Blue Decree Sword that symbolized the family.I didn\u2019t think he would pull this.\u201cIs this what you want to say?\u201dIn response to my question, So Ik-heon pointed his sword,\u201cFrom now on, if you tell me a lie, the sword of mine will not forgive you.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you planned for this.\u201dThe sword over talks.Disappointing, but then came unexpected words,\u201cYou became a member of the Blood Sect?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Ursa Major (1)I was speechless at his unexpected question.Wasn\u2019t this like a thief being caught before they had a chance to steal? If I wasn\u2019t good at managing my expression, it would have betrayed me right then.-How does he know?Short Sword was also deathly curious.\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019So Ik-heon\u2019s voice was angry,Just by looking at how he had already drawn his sword, he must be convinced that I was a member of the Blood Sect.Letting him take the lead in the conversation was stupid, so I decided to act,\u201cAre you saying that I am a member of the Blood Sect? Quite a shocking accusation.\u201dI always had this cheat-like knack for controlling my emotions. However, So Ik-heon\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.Not only did he not reveal any doubt, but pushed me further,\u201cDon\u2019t mess around! A guy who was kidnapped by the Blood Sect suddenly appears to shake the family, and you want me to believe you?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Did he just say kidnapped by the Blood Sect?How did he know? This was confusing!-Couldn\u2019t Asong have told him?\u2018Asong?\u2019No.Asong wasn\u2019t even entered into the house and was kicked out, and in the first place, this guy didn\u2019t consider me his child. In other words, Asong wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell the Lord, and the Lord would not have cared enough to ask.\u2018\u2026 the twins got caught?\u2019That being said, it had only been one day, and it was doubtful that information could have passed hands so quickly.\u2018Baek Hye-hyang?\u2019That was odd too.From what I was told there was a high chance the woman didn\u2019t even know I had survived the fall. So it was impossible to notice this plan.\u2018What is this?\u2019It was difficult to piece together context with such simple thoughts. So, I had to ask directly,\u201cI do not understand what my father is saying. Who said I was kidnapped by the Blood Sect?\u201dBut again, an unexpected answer came,\u201cAsong.\u201dThe source of information was none other than Asong.How did he hear from Asong, who was chased out and had vanished?And so I asked,\u201cI heard Asong was kicked out of the house, how could he\u2026\u201d\u201cAsong is my man.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019What nonsense is this now?Asong, a servant of mine was his? There wasn\u2019t a single change in his eyes or the expression he had.\u2018\u2026no way\u2026\u2019Even as I thought about it, doubts crept up from the depth of my heart. Asong had been taking care of my mother for a long time, but he was still a man hired by the Lord.Yet, he cared so much for us. Even when I got kicked out of the main house, didn\u2019t he follow me?-As you said, if he truly followed you then good, but what about the other way around?\u2018The other way?\u2019-Right. It could be your father or maybe one of the vassals who ordered it.\u2018The lord put him?\u2019This didn\u2019t make sense. For what reason did he place a servant?I guess he didn\u2019t show it, but in fact, was it because he saw me as a child?\u2018Nonsense.\u2019If that was the case, shouldn\u2019t he be protecting me the right way? But didn\u2019t he let me be called all sorts of names before throwing me out?Did he think I would speak the truth if he brought up Asong? I spoke in a cold voice,\u201cWhere is Asong?\u201d\u201cAnswer what the Lord of the family asks! What happened during the months you vanished? Do you think it makes sense for a guy whose dantian was destroyed to restore it and overcome the wall of a first-rate warrior?\u201dThat was common sense.I too would have thought that.But, after returning, I realized that sitting still wouldn\u2019t be the answer. Another answer could surface.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean it is possible if I am here like this?\u201dAt my words, he shook his head and said,\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t do anything as a father, I have been watching you since you were a kid. Did you know that the guy who had been down since his mother died and people calling him names changes this much when he becomes the disciple of Southern Heavenly Swordsman? Do you think people can change in such a short time?\u201d\u201cIs that proof that I have become a part of the Blood Sect?\u201d\u201cPeople do not change easily. However, it isn\u2019t difficult by much if you borrow the power of the Blood Sect or the Forces of Evil and their evil means.\u201d\u201cYou are speaking the same thing as the first hyung did. And Mount Hyeong\u2019s swordsman had proven that to be false. But you still think I have fallen to them?\u201d\u201cIt has been 15 years since the Southern Heavenly Swordsman disappeared. Did you think I would believe it just because you showed a few techniques he had and spoke a few words with the man?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt felt like I underestimated this man.It seemed like he grew suspicious because I asked to be a member representing the family. And So Ik-heon continued,\u201cThere is another piece evidence for it\u201d\u201cEvidence?\u201d\u201cYou accidentally appeared right before the Murim Tournament and then ask to be taking the position of a representative of this family.\u201dAt that moment, I went speechless. Well, I never knew much about the person called Ik-heon.I had no idea that he was such an insightful person-I always thought you were smart because you were a spy. But I guess that isn\u2019t everything.\u2018What?\u2019-Ah. WellWhen I didn\u2019t like it, and Short Sword went silent.So Ik-heon began to release the energy.He was truly one of the three people representing Hunnam.\u201cDo you know why the Murim Tournament is held? Did you think it is simply because the alliance was being broken up?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dTo this, he continued,\u201cThe Blood Sect is about to revive again. They have been hiding in the shadows for a long time and building up their power. Do you think that would be allowed?\u201d\u2026. HaAmazing. In a way, he was the head of a family because of the insights he held.It seemed like the Murim Alliance had won such battles not simply because of luck.\u2018Miss. It will not be easy.\u2019In the midst of it, I thought of Baek Ryeon-ha.It wasn\u2019t conscious, but had I truly become a member of the Blood Sect?And So Ik-heon pointed to me,\u201cThe secret to you gaining power isn\u2019t tough to guess. They kidnap young ones like you and make them their own.\u201dRight.It was so accurate that I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cIf you are from Blood Sect, there is no better chance than this.\u201dI gulped not realizing. Then did he even guess about us stealing the Blood Demon sword?\u201cIf you kidnap someone from a prestigious sect like this and brainwash them into the sect, how great would it be to use them?\u201dBut I didn\u2019t think he could see so far. Even so, it was amazing he could guess this much.-Maybe it is because of Asong\u2018Asong?\u2019-You said it before. Every time you change something the future changes.Ah\u2026Short Sword\u2019s words were true. Asong was supposed to die, but I had saved him and that led to him telling the Lord I had been kidnapped.Maybe this had an impact.Before my return, I was just kicked out when I returned to the family.-What do we do now?Short Sword asked, seemingly worried. It seemed like the lord had already been convinced.Right. If other people were in this situation, they would be quite flustered and not know what to do.But as a spy, had he experienced such a suspicious situation?I shook my head,\u201cSo my father is saying that the Murim tournament is something I want to participate in so I came in like a spy of the Blood Sect? You want to drive me out like this.\u201dSeeing me speak like I was disappointed, So Ik-heon narrowed his eyes. It was like he was determined to know the truth.\u201cMy teacher will be disappointed with the Ikyang So family.\u201dI mentioned him on purpose.He said he wouldn\u2019t believe it but I still decided to use it. Shaking up my story now would only lead to more suspicion.So I held strong as he asked,\u201cDo you want to prove your innocence?\u201d\u201cHow am I going to prove when you are already acting like this?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t that difficult. To prove your innocence, undo everything you have done. And give up on being the representative.\u201dNot easy if he came out like this.\u201cIt\u2019s fun to give up on everything and stand stiff so my innocence can be proven.\u201dI was being sarcastic. If I kept quiet then all our plans would be ruined.\u201cSince I cannot do that, how about you just give me the role of representative? I can brighten up the name of the family more than the two older\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cEven if you don\u2019t give up, you will not be given the position you requested.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you do not see your child as a child at all.\u201d\u201cDo not get me wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t deserve it. What do you think it would mean if a person who goes to represent my family is a disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dNow I understood.At the feast, he was thinking of rejecting the position I had asked for. So Ik-heon took his stance.It was the technique of the Turbulence Sword that only the successors for the Lord position could learn.A massive force.What he was showing now couldn\u2019t be compared with So Young-hyun.\u201cThis is your last warning. If you have even the slightest pride in inheriting the blood of this family, stop now and surrender.\u201dHa!What? Pride in this family? Blood? What nonsense!Anger rose,\u201c\u2026 what if I surrender?\u201d\u201cI will look into your body and see if you have been brainwashed and if you are innocent there is no reason to not take you back.\u201dThat would only prove his concept of innocence.After all, he had no intention of putting me ahead.Srng!I pulled out Southern Iron Sword and his face hardened,\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou said you will not give me the position I want, but you keep saying you\u2019re my father who is willing to take me in if I surrender and let you check my dantian. I belong to another sect.\u201dAt my words, he frowned.For a warrior to know the origin of another\u2019s internal qi, they would need to use a certain technique. This was taboo even in the factions that practiced it unless the opponent was an enemy.\u201cI have no choice but to protect myself for the honor of my teacher\u201dAt my words, his eyes turned sharp,\u201cBe it trickery or not, do you think you can just defeat me?\u201dIt looked like his self-esteem was hurt.He is the one who judged that my skills have grown and he had seen my confrontation with the First Sword of Mount Hyeong too.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we compete to win?\u201dThud!So Ik-heon stepped on the floor and the training hall ground cracked.So Ik-heon was the family swordsman who had reached the level of a master.\u201cYou will regret this.\u201d\u201cI will not.\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201dAnd he began to narrow the distance. Since his sword was heavy, the techniques he used gave off a sense of weight, but when a skilled person used it, the flow would be that of a normal sword.\u2018Phew.\u2019I began to rouse my qi, and cover my sword with it.\u2018Loach-shaped Sword\u2019Soft willow branch-like, and netted to defend, any attack which made its way close got wrapped in it.Chachachang!When the swords collided, the sound of metal clashing echoed.He tried to subdue me, but it wasn\u2019t so easy, and the sword he used kept rebounding off my net.\u201cHah!\u201dChachang!As the sword moved, So Ik-heon didn\u2019t miss a gap and aimed for my chest.I quickly changed the path of my sword and blocked it.Takta!I did block it, but I ended up being pushed back far.And as he managed to gain the force he moved and he slashed the sword at my left shoulder.\u2018He won\u2019t even give me a break?\u2019Srng!I hurriedly swung my sword to block it. When the sword collided this time my body trembled as it bounced back.\u201cKuak!\u201dThis force was too much. If I was someone who had just touched the level of a master, my opponent was at the upper ends of the master level.The level difference itself was huge.Pak!I bounced back and smashed into the wall of the training room. And So Ik-heon attacked right away,\u201cIt is of no use.\u201dSo Ik-heon slammed his sword down.Chang!Was this the essence of heavy swords?My body holding the sword was pulled down.To kill this power I rotated my body.Rumble!The power of his heavy sword was dispersed and my body became light. But Ik-heon didn\u2019t miss this gap\u2013Chang!I blocked his attack with my sword, but once again I got smashed into the wall,\u201cKuak!\u201dThe wall cracked this time.If this wasn\u2019t an iron sword my sword would have already broken down. This man knew how to take advantage of the weapon he had.And he said,\u201cIt is a better sword than it looks. If it wasn\u2019t for that sword you would be down.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cThe gap between you and me is huge. Stop this and accept defeat.\u201d\u201cYou treat me like a sinner and not a son.\u201d\u201cDo not try to appeal to such sentiments.\u201dSo Ik-heon pushed me.\u201cSigh\u201dI sighed. Seeing this man looking down at me with arrogant eyes.\u201cThis is the last warning. If you swing your sword again, this time be prepared to have your bones broken,\u201d\u201cYou really deserve to be called the Ikyang Swordsman.\u201d\u201cWill you surrender?\u201d\u201cFather\u201dTikI dusted off the dust and said,\u201cYou are as strong an opponent as you seem.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt my words, his expression contorted.Because despite me being knocked around, I was speaking arrogantly.Shh!I pointed my sword at him and said,\u201cThe Xing Ming sword technique which my teacher had later perfected and evolved. From now on, I will be using the True Xing Ming Sword.\u201d\u201cWhat non\u2026\u201dPhat!In just a moment I moved right in front of him.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019As my speed suddenly increased he hurriedly moved back and swung his sword to block.Chang!The moment our swords collided he bounced back and looked shocked.Such an obvious reaction,He thought that the difference between us would be like the difference between heaven and earth.\u201cYou!\u201dSo Ik-heon pointed his sword at me.Seeing how the force of the heavy sword was raging differently from before, it seemed like he wanted to end this.Bang!I launched myself forward,With a stabbing motion, my hand which held the sword moved to the left.Like a harbinger of a storm, an intense force of qi was at the tip of my blade.\u2018True Chasing Yahui Sword\u2019True meant that it had been completed, and this sword technique was based on the Xing Ming sword technique, which used innate qi and not internal qi.And its power\u2026Chachachacha!The desperate effort of So Ik-heon was smashed.His defenses a complete wreck, he got swept away by my sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Ursa Major (2)The True Chasing Yahui Sword.Among the different swordsmanship techniques I knew, it was the most powerful one.It held explosive power, boosted by my rotational force.\u201cKuak!\u201dSo Ik-heon, swept away by my sword, tried to defend himself. However, So Ik-heon who couldn\u2019t stop the storm-like power from my sword crashed into the wall of the training room, while his sword embedded itself into the ceiling.Chang! Thud!He couldn\u2019t help but feel shocked. He should have noticed it while he blocked my sword.That I had surpassed a limit that he couldn\u2019t.\u201cHow did you\u2026?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t even finish his question. He had tried to deflect my sword as much as possible, but So Ik-heon\u2019s body had spun around like a windmill due to the rotational force of my sword, and like a screw, he had pierced into the training room wall.Kwang!\u201cKuak\u201dHe groaned, coughed out a handful of blood, and then looked at me with shell-shocked eyes.\u201cPhew.\u201dI took a deep breath as I stopped using the Xing Ming Cultivation.I knew that the walls of the training room were made of hardened stones. The walls of such a room were now a mess, traces of sword techniques carved into the walls.\u2018I didn\u2019t think it would be this powerful.\u2019If I had hit his sword at the right angle, my father would have probably died. If he hadn\u2019t been careful he probably wouldn\u2019t have survived for more than a few seconds.\u2018I could beat the Lord.\u2019It felt weird.Before getting this second chance at life, he was a barrier I couldn\u2019t even dream of approaching. I couldn\u2019t even dare to hold a sword in front of him.-You developed a lot. Wonhwi. At this rate, it seems that you have reached half of my former master\u2019s strength.Iron Sword was praising me.My skill was still just half of his former master\u2019s? That was such a huge difference!Then how strong was Hae Ack-chun who surpassed even the Southern Heavenly Swordsman?When I thought about it, my path looked long.-Do not be in a rush. You are getting stronger faster than anyone else!Thanks for saying that. Why do you two feel more like family to me?-Uhm.Iron Sword, who clearly enjoyed my comment coughed, and Short Sword said,-You beat the person whose coattails you were chasing, yet you don\u2019t look so happy.Short Sword could read me like a book. Because she was attached to me, she was amazingly aware of my feelings just by looking at my face.Right, I didn\u2019t feel good. I didn\u2019t expect much, but So Ik-heon didn\u2019t feel like blood to me.\u2018\u2026\u2019I wanted to ask him with an honest heart.Why do you hate me so much?If you were going to be this harsh, why let me live?\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI leaned my back against the wall and sighed. This wasn\u2019t like when I was in the Blood Sect.I really wanted to ruin this family. But if that happens the life of my little sister would surely turn worse.-You are holding back for your sister?\u2018Why, do you think I will hurt that father of mine?\u2019-Well, you look so angry that this is my first time seeing that expression on your face.\u2018If you get angry and get rid of everything, what will happen to the ones left behind?\u2019If I took the life of this man, swept up in my rage, my sister would suffer a lot. The title of being a traitor\u2019s sister.-Your sister is the key that holds you.Could be.If she wasn\u2019t here, I wouldn\u2019t even care what happened to this damned family.But with Yong-yong here, I would not, could not, cross that final line. Now my fate was bound to the Blood Sect.In a situation where I didn\u2019t know what would happen to me, I could not put her life in danger.\u2018What do I do?\u2019Everything was twisted now. First off this place was in the shits and we had fought so viciously.As I was pondering what to do Short Sword asked,-How about talking to him?\u2018Him?\u2019-The one stuck in the wall. Well, just try talking.Do you mean the Blue Decree Sword?It was so quiet that I didn\u2019t know. But each sword had its own voice.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I jumped up, and pulled his sword from the ceiling.The Blue Decree Sword was the treasured sword of the Ikyang So family, which only the family head could wield.As Short Sword said, he should know the truth that no one else had, including the truth behind Asong.\u2018Blue Decree Sword.\u2019-\u2026What?I didn\u2019t hear an answer, so I asked again,\u2018Blue Decree Sword.\u2019-\u2026\u2018Can it not hear me?\u2019-Right, you are rightWith the prodding from Short Sword, Blue Decree Sword was shocked,-Oh my, this!Now I\u2019m used to it.The swords mostly reacted to me the same way when I talked to them. The tone of it was very similar to that of an old scholar.Like relaxed and classy?-I didn\u2019t expect an opportunity to talk to you like this. Child,It even called me child.When I asked him why he said that he had been part of the family for so long that he considered all of us his grandchildren.-Elder. Elder then.Short Sword clicked her tongue and Blue Decree Sword said,-I have always been watching you with great sadness.\u2018Watching me sadly?\u2019-Right. There has never been a child of this family who had to slog through such tough timesI had such a strange feeling when I heard his words.How would I feel if I had a grandfather or mother alive?The sword now was speaking to me in the same manner-If Ik-heon had been kind and a bit open-minded, you wouldn\u2019t have been this hurt.Even this sword understood my situation well\u2026 but,I had given up on this life a long time back. If my father had truly been kind, I wouldn\u2019t have ever ended up in the Blood Sect.-Still, don\u2019t think too harshly of Ik-heon.\u2018That isn\u2019t something you can tell me now.\u2019-\u2026now, a few words will not change the emotions you have. But Ik-heon has his responsibilities.\u2018Responsibilities?\u2019Funny.Does a person with a sense of responsibility abandon their child?And at the moment when he suspects the child to be a member of the Blood Sect, would he force him away?-If Ik-heon was going to treat you as a Blood Cult member, why would he bring you to a training room where no one is around? Rather, he would put up a public discussion in the presence of the Mount Hyeong sect and others.\u2018For the sake of the family name.\u2019In front of the guests, would he really accuse the third son of his family of being a member of the Blood Sect?How would the province and people react?The man was someone who took the honor of the Ikyang So family very seriously.-I can see that it might look like this to you.\u2018Do you know the suffering of living here?\u2019When I was young I wanted to die every day. When my mother died, there were times I wanted to throw my life away, but Yong-yong was there.Of course, as I went through hard things my heart became stiff.\u2018I have no resentment against you, but I have to make you tell me what you know. If not, I don\u2019t know what to do with him.\u2019I pointed to So Ik-heon who was unconscious.Swords do not like their masters being harmed. It was a way of intimidating them.I thought it would work on an old sword like this one.However, the reaction of this sword was different,-\u2026 I think it would be better for you if you knew the truth.\u2018Truth?\u2019What was the truth?I was puzzled as he readily decided to speak-You are not the child of Ik-heon,\u2018\u2026?!\u2019My mind went blank.I even wondered if I had heard wrong, and I leaned my back against the wall looking at Ik-heon.I am not his child?-About 20 years ago, my master, Ik-gyeom, Ik-heon\u2019s father.So Ik-gyeom. The name of my grandfather who had died.A man who was known to have made remarkable contributions to the heavenly war, and he was killed in the final moments of the war.-From then on, I was with Ik-heon.So Ik-gyeom, who was the head of the house was killed, so it was naturally passed down to So Ik-heon.-Ik-heon was young and disappointed by his father\u2019s death. He was lost. He lived as if he was addicted to alcohol when his mother died,That cold-blooded idiot was depressed?-He would disappear outside every day and then come back home drunk. Then one day that guy brought back a wounded woman.Wounded woman? No\u2026-Right. It was your mother.I didn\u2019t know. Wasn\u2019t my mom actually a servant here?-Ik-heon took care of your mother with sincerity and I could tell by looking that this was the love that humans speak of.This man loved my mother?-Right. At least until then, his love seemed pure. Ik-heon had fallen into despair and soon began to regain his color and even took your mother as a servant to keep her by his side.\u2018He fell in love, but placed her as a servant\u2026\u2019-It couldn\u2019t be helped. Your mother wanted to hide her past, but he couldn\u2019t simply take a woman whose identity was unknown as his wife.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019-Actually, your mother wanted to leave right after her injury had healed. But your mother had a secret she couldn\u2019t hide anymore and it was out in the open.\u2018\u2026 Me.\u2019-Right. Your wounded mother was pregnant when she was found. She is a strong woman. Despite her wounds, she didn\u2019t lose you.My legs felt weak, I had sunk to the ground.Then, I was not an illegitimate child of the Ikyang So family head?-This is the truth-Wonhwi\u2026Short Sword looked at me with a worried face.Then Blue Decree Sword continued to talk,-Your mother tried to leave, but Ik-heon couldn\u2019t bear to see her leave and he persuaded her.\u2018\u2026 what?\u2019-He told your mother that you would live a hard life if your mother decided to move out, and you would be a baby without anyone to protect you. Perhaps because of maternal love, your mother accepted his request.\u2018\u2026.\u2019-But, strange rumors had begun to go around the family. As your mother\u2019s stomach began to swell up, it reached the ears of the madame.\u2018So?\u2019-Using that rumor as a pretext, Ik-heon accepted your mother as the Second Madame. When the head of the family said that the child in her stomach was his own, no one could even say anything.\u2018And mother accepted it?\u2019-Why wouldn\u2019t she? It was to protect you,To protect me, she turned into the wife of an unrelated man.My eyes stung as I thought of my mother. It was so hard to believe that she went through this for me.-I understand. Anyone would find it hard to believe.How can one believe things unless they witnessed them?-If I could, I would show you everything I saw,It was just then\u2013[The Sword Heart and Human Heart must work together, the Ursa Major has been opened.]A voice echoed in my head.And a blue flame flashed from my right hand!Chik!A change occurred and with a burning sound, dots were formed.\u2018Ahh!\u2019Three of seven stars formed the shape of the Big Dipper and turned blue, and as the dot at the position of Ursa Major turned blue, the flames subsided.\u2018Ursa Major has opened\u2019It had been a long time since I saw this.And when I opened my eyes, everything had changed.Scenes unfolded in front of my eyes as if I was looking through the eyes of someone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Ursa Major (3)[Please stay here, I will not ask you to like me. I hope you will think of yourself and the child you carry.][Lord So\u2026]The scene unfolding before me was So Ik-heon holding my mother\u2019s hand while attempting to convince her to stay.The voice of Blue Decree could also be heard,-I do not know what this is\u2026\u2018You are seeing this too?\u2019-Right. It is my memory of that time\u2018Your memory?\u2019My mother and the Lord appeared very different from how I had last remembered them. My mother appeared much younger and beautiful while the Lord looked young.Soon the scene continued and my mother asked,[Is it fine to entrust myself to you?]At her words, that man smiled brightly. His joy was evident from his face.-What you\u2019re seeing now is when your mother was declared the second madame.If what he was saying was true, then I was looking at a memory. Soon, the scene in front of me faded.Back to reality\u2026-I don\u2019t know what that was, but I think you saw my memoriesI glanced at the back of my hand, the third dot had faded back to its dull blue.When the second dot had formed, I was able to hear the sounds of swords from a distance, and now I had gained the ability to view their memories.I concentrated, seeing whether I could examine his memories again. However, the scene I wished to see never came.-What were you trying to do?\u2018I was trying to check his memory again\u2019-What memory are you talking about?\u2018The face of the Lord when I was born\u2026\u2019I wondered.He fell in love with my mother and even let her have a son, and accepted her as his second wife.I wondered what face he made when I was born.-You are speaking about this?Just then, my vision turned black and the scene I wished to see unfolded\u2026There was So Ik-heon who was holding a baby\u2026-\u2026His expression was a mess as if there was so much he wanted to say but with no words with which to speak.Right, knowing that the child wasn\u2019t his own, why would he smile?My mother was laying on a bed looking quite pale. So Ik-heon erased his complicated expression and spoke with a soft smile\u2026[I will treat this child as my own. So my Wife, please take care of your health and recover soon][\u2026 Lord]My mother looked sympathetic.When I had seen the first scene, she looked as if she didn\u2019t want to burden him, but now it appeared as if she was emotionally dependent on him.-Right. As you see.\u2018What?\u2019-Your mother opened up her heart to Ik-heon\u2019s devotion.My mother liked him\u2026.?But then Blue Decree Sword said,-And so your sister Yong-yong was born,Ah\u2026Right. Yong-yong.If my mother had truly only stayed to protect me then she wouldn\u2019t have had another child.Then I was the only one in this house who didn\u2019t share any blood with the master of the house.-\u2026 right.Said Blue Decree, and then the scene faded and we were brought back to reality.It seemed I could only see what the sword wanted to show.-When you were first born, Ik-heon tried to be nice to you, but it wasn\u2019t that easy.Right.It was tough to raise someone else\u2019s child as their own.-Besides, it wasn\u2019t too easy to bear the words of the first madame\u2018Fist madame!\u2019-If she saw him acting nice to you, she couldn\u2019t be calmed down. Thanks to this, Ik-heon was no longer kind to any of his children.Looking back, this man treated all his children harshly.But beyond this harshness, was an abject coldness that was directed only at me. It must have come from the frustration of raising a child who was not his own.\u2018Damn it.\u2019Even when my dantian was destroyed, I understand why things had turned out like this.He would send elixirs to my mother, but he didn\u2019t even bother sending a physician to check on his child who had lost their dantian, all because I wasn\u2019t his son.Tak!I began to walk toward So Ik-heon, I was angry and enraged.\u2018So Ik-heon!\u2019As my emotions rose Blue Decree Sword tried to dissuade me again,-Still, Ik-heon tried to take responsibility for you and your sister till the end!\u2018Responsibility? Is that so? Is that why he kicked me out of this place and tried to marry off Yong-yong like she was some livestock to be sold off to the highest bidder!\u2019He was acting cold because of the First Madame?If that was the case wouldn\u2019t it be better to not take my mother in!? Does he think that I would sit still if you spoke about him taking responsibility for us?-\u2026 it is because he thought that if you weren\u2019t sent away from home, you might die at the hands of the other children and his wife,\u2018Die at their hands?\u2019-After your mother\u2019s death, you began to drink a lot, child you were pretty much wasted all the time. Rumors spread. No one would be punished if they killed you off quietly, that was why Ik-heon was forced to send you away.\u2018\u2026\u2019-Same went for your sister. Why do you think she was sent to that mountain sect? Is it because she was extremely talented? No. It was to prevent his wife from trying to do anything to harm her. If Yong-yong came back she would experience what you went through, which is why he found her a fianc\u00e9\u2018Seriously, that man though?\u2019I remembered Jo Sang-nam and the fact that the man was related to Madame.-It was the Madame who had asked for the marriage proposal, but Ik-heon had no intention of giving his daughter to that man.Blue Decree said it to be. It was like it was trying to make us understand,\u2018\u2026 all for the sake of us?\u2019But how do I overcome my emotions? I don\u2019t think I will ever be able to understand So Ik-heon for the rest of my life.-Sigh. Right, as you said, that guy wasn\u2019t kind, he couldn\u2019t even do his role as a father right due to the secret of your birth. But at least he didn\u2019t turn his back on you\u2026And then I saw something againThe backyard of my mother\u2019s annex.[E-elder.]It was Asong.[Shhh. Be quiet.][I heard that you follow Wonhwi][Yes, yes.]Asong spoke very quietly.[Have this.]I saw the Lord hold out his hand and place a silver plaque in Asong\u2019s hand.In the middle of it was written Hye-hyun, which looked like it was a card my mother\u2019s sect had given to her.If I had it, maybe I could trace it back to the Harmony Sect; the plaque looked like it belonged to that sect.[This?][If something bad happens while you have this, use it]With those words, Ik-heon left, and I noticed two things.As said, apparently Asong wasn\u2019t my servant, and I had no idea he would be taking care of me for some other reason.Shh!Immediately the vision changed.It had been late at night, but now there was bright daylight, slightly obscured by greenery.In front of me was Asong with blood and bruises all over his body,[I\u2026 I didn\u2019t get to see the Young Master. Please, please save the Young Master!]To him, Ik-heon asked,[\u2026 Wonhwi actually said it was the Blood Sect?][Yes yes. He must have heard something.][Do you have the plaque I gave you?][Ah!]At So Ik-heon\u2019s question, Asong pulled it out from his sleeve and So Ik-heon nodded.[You should right now head to Mongok-ri valley and find a place that serves alcohol there. Talk to the old man with black clothes all over and when he says \u2018Fishing For\u2019 you say \u2018Sweeping away Worry\u2019. And after handing it over, tell him what you just said to me, and then ask to find where So Wonhwi is.]The code word.It was actually from a verse that said that those who believed that alcohol could sweep away the worry, so you should fish for it.I didn\u2019t think that So Ik-heon would reach out to the Lower District Sect for information, considering it usually sided with the unorthodox sects.Looking at this, he could have been keeping track of me,\u2018\u2026 and he found me?\u2019-NoShhh!Once again the scene changed.The place where the old man in black clothes was drinking alcohol. In the scene I had just seen before, Asong was given the order to come here.Then why did the Lord come here in person?So Ik-heon asked in a cold voice.[Why did you not accept the quest?]To this, the old man answered firmly.[Just give up.][Didn\u2019t I say I would pay any price?][If it is related to the Blood Sect, I will not accept any requests.][Why are you being like this?]So Ik-heon touched his sword and the old man in black smiled showing his yellow teeth,[It wouldn\u2019t be good for it to be known that the Ikyang So family lord had requested information from us, the bad people.][\u2026]So Ik-heon pulled back the hand and stood up irritated. And the old man in black told him,[I heard that he was abandoned on your orders, but it looks like you are biting your finger sore for him, Lord So.][Do not mess with me][Still, I received an advance payment, so I will give you some small advice][\u2026 what could that be?][As I said, if what happened there was done by Blood Sect, give up.][Give up?][They secretly kidnap kids to increase their numbers. So it would be easier to think that your son is no longer in this world.]Ha\u2026I think I know now.Because of this, he thought I had become a member of the Blood Sect. The scene changed once more, and we were back in the training room.Blue Decree Sword said to me,-I understand that you hate him. but, I hope that you can understand his feelings a little bit more now.At his words, I sat down. My mind felt complicated.Knowing so much I wasn\u2019t sure how to accept this.And the truth surrounding my birth was the most shocking.\u2018In the end, we were strangers.\u2019I pondered that.What the sword said about him doing his duties. But my thoughts were different from his.Be responsible for me?He wasn\u2019t.\u2018It was his actions for the sake of my mother.\u2019If he was being responsible for me, he would be watching over me and my sister and giving us support when we needed it.But he didn\u2019t.In the end, the man named So Ik-heon just did what was comfortable for him. He did it to such an extreme extent that he raised children who weren\u2019t his. It seemed impossible to understand his thinking.From the start, he should have never promised my mother that he would treat me like his own.\u2018Responsibility? It makes me laugh\u2019Blue Decree could see this, and it said,-From what I said earlier, you seem to want to represent the family during the tournament.\u2018\u2026 right\u2019That had to be obtained.Just because I was upset, I still had to do it.-I might be able to help.\u2018You will help me?\u2019How could it help?-Wouldn\u2019t it be a different situation if you gave Ik-heon what he wanted the most?\u2018What does he want the most?\u2019-Now, Ik-heon only learned the first half of the Sodong SwordMy eyes shone-This sword technique was passed down orally, but the former master wasn\u2019t able to fully teach him as he died in the war. What if I told you the rest?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Ursa Major (4)Ckaj! Chak!A blade sharply cut through the air.Numerous lines were drawn by the tip of the Turbulent Sword.I was now looking into the memories of Blue Decree Sword. But this memory was different from the other memories I had seen.Whenever I saw the sword move, the path and movement were engraved into my head.My wrist and arms twitched as if I had suddenly become too antsy to remain still.I was now watching the sword technique that So Ik-gyeom, the former head of the family who had perished in the war, was known for.Rather than seeing it, it felt more like I was recalling muscle memory.The five techniques which made up the second half of the technique, shown immediately after the five moves of the first half, were literally a feast containing the essence of a heavy sword.Shhh! Swop!The moment the sword slammed down hard, the energy wrapped around the sword continued downward even as the sword itself stopped, partially leaving an imprint in the form of a sword on the floor of the training hall; with such ferocity that the training hall felt like it would collapse.It was quite a good technique.Lord So Ik-heon added speed to his heavy sword technique to compensate for the missing second half, but there was no need for that level of speed originally.Soon the scene faded and,-Do you get it, Child?Blue Decree Sword asked me.It wasn\u2019t like I had learned it, instead it was more like it had been engraved into my mind.It felt like my body seemed to know for sure what the technique should look like, what it should feel like. Then Short Sword spoke to me,-Did you see all the techniques in such a short time?\u2018Short?\u2019No waySince the heavy sword was different from a normal sword, the process wasn\u2019t fast. I think it took me less than ten seconds to watch it.-What are you talking about? What do you mean? It all happened in the blink of an eye\u2026?\u2018\u2026 the blink of an eye?\u2019-Yes.At Short Sword\u2019s words, even Blue Decree Sword seemed puzzled.And that wasn\u2019t all-Same here, WonhuiEven Iron Sword agreed.\u2018Hmm. Strange.\u2019Is there really a way to check and learn things in the blink of an eye?I took a silver coin out of my pocket.\u2018Blue Decree Sword\u2019-Speak.\u2018If I flip the coin, can you show me the sword technique again?\u2019-Are there any difficulties? You just need to follow it.Asked Blue Decree Sword. As a test, I flicked the silver coin with my finger and floated it in the air.At that moment, my vision blurred, and I saw the hazy scene once again.I re-watched the technique, and when the vision was done, I returned back to reality.\u2018Uh?\u2019And what greeted my return was a marvelous sight.The coin I had flipped before rewatching the vision was still in the process of falling down.This wasn\u2019t in the blink of an eye, this was in an instant!Tak!I caught the coin.\u2018This is unbelievable.\u2019This was amazing.The perceived time when watching these visions was much different from real-time, this was just too shocking!Then Iron Sword said something.-Wonhui. This seems like a really innovative ability.\u2018Innovative?\u2019-Right. My former master said that when one\u2019s martial arts reach a certain level, imagery training is more helpful than physically repetitive training.These were the words Iron Sword first taught me when we were learning the Xing Ming Sword. He said that if the basic foundations of the body were laid through repeated physical training, then to ascend the movement of the sword, presence of mind was needed.-Think about it. Even as you are image training, as you better integrate the technique it then becomes muscle memory. What if you do that over and over again? Naturally, you will end up mastering the technique.Ah\u2026Does that affect my mind and body?Thanks to what the sword showed me, I was able to see the complete technique twice.For that reason, it remained more clearly in my mind-If you repeat it ten or a hundred times, you will be able to see the results.-Right!Short Sword agreed.It wasn\u2019t as easy as how they made it sound. However, as she said, if this succeeded I would be able to master the techniques of the best in a very small span of time. This didn\u2019t seem so bad.Even if I needed to have the technique repeated to me, it was just an instant.-I am fine, but you child?\u2018I am fine.\u2019-Good. If you tell me to stop, I will stop showing you.As soon as Blue Decree said that, the memories began to flow once again.Once, twice, thrice\u2026The more it repeated, the more it felt as if I was using the sword. However, a problem arose as the repetitions increased.I felt dizzy, my head hurt and even my innate qi was being consumed.\u2018A little more\u2026 a little more\u2026\u2019Just as we were on our twentieth iteration,\u201cEuk!\u201dI puked from the dizziness.-Are you fine, Child?The illusion disappeared and we returned to reality.-Yah, are you fine?-Wonhui!Short Sword and Iron Sword looked anxiously. It felt like they were spinning in front of me.Eight or nine iterations were fine, but going beyond ten was quite a burden.-You are sweating too much.At Short Sword\u2019s words, I touched my forehead with the back of my hand. Sweat was dripping down as if I had been training hard.\u2018Really?\u2019My fingers trembled. Strangely I looked at my hand and wrist, and I saw them convulsing.\u2018Ha!\u2019It was amazing.In reality, it had only been a couple of moments, yet the condition of my body seemed to contradict this. This was why I wasn\u2019t simply tired, my body was feeling completely exhausted.-Unbelievable. I had no idea imagery training could work this way!Iron Sword spoke, a bit shocked.I was too, this bizarre thing happened when I repeated those memories.Truly perhaps this was the power that came from Ursa Major.-But I don\u2019t think you should overdo it, WonhuiMy opinion exactly.Not a hundred, but maybe end it after a dozen times.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dI was tired.After repeating this twenty times, my mental and physical fatigue was immense, and I realized that doing it in succession had to be avoided.Or I should just do them little by little with a gap to recover.\u2018I need to cultivate.\u2019-Yes.After cultivating for a little time, my innate qi and internal qi which were consumed would be restored.If I hadn\u2019t stopped I would have collapsed.-WonhuiIron Sword calling out to me had retrieved me from my thoughts.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe lord, So Ik-heon, who had been half embedded into the wall of the training room, staggered down.He seemed to calm down as he looked at me with a confused face. I don\u2019t know if it was because of his defeat, but he looked quite shocked.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIt should be better if you cultivate\u201dEven though he managed to not be hit by my sword, he was still slammed with the full force behind it.The qi of an opponent was not something one should leave in their body, as it will corrupt the body and the internal organs.Sss!A haze rose from So Ik-heon\u2019s body.In front of me, he couldn\u2019t even cultivate, so he decided to forcibly push out the qi. And he frowned,\u201cWhy did your hand hold back?\u201dHe seemed puzzled that my technique was orthodox.\u201c\u2026 did you want me to kill you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 don\u2019t say useless stuff, you let me live for your own sake. Unless you prove that you aren\u2019t a Blood Sect\u2026\u201d\u201cStop provoking me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of this pretentious act we do.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cI do not want you to misunderstand, your life is in my hands, and you aren\u2019t even my father by blood; so you shouldn\u2019t push your luck.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019At those words, So Ik-heon looked shocked. He never would have thought I would know the truth.\u201cYou\u2026 how do you know that?\u201dJudging from this reaction, it seemed like my mother told him to never let me know the truth. Confused he asked,\u201c\u2026 did you know?\u201d\u201cTwo hyungs, the way you look at your children is clearly different, did you think I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201dSo Ik-heon gulped,\u201c\u2026 if your mother heard\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish his sentence, I threw back his Blue Decree Sword.Shh!The sword infused with my innate qi flew to him and lightly brushed by his clothes and embedded itself into the wall.\u201cDo not speak of my mother with that disgusting mouth.\u201dSo Ik-heon didn\u2019t speak further. From the start, we never had a good relationship.His desire to believe that his actions and attitudes toward me were done in the name of taking responsibility only made me more disgusted by him.And he quietly whispered,\u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to say you have done enough for me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that you were trying to protect me and Yong-yong from your wife and children.\u201dHis face contorted.He must be upset because he was being forcibly ripped out of the illusion, his false sense of duty, forced to see the truth now.\u201cFor the sake of my mother, you said you\u2019d treat me like your child. It was to keep that promise. And you justify your selfishness like that?\u201d\u201cHow do you!\u201d\u201cIf you really wanted to protect me or Yong-yong, wouldn\u2019t it be by defending us when your wife was going to come onto us? You think ignoring us is a fair attempt with the other kids?\u201d\u201cKuak!\u201dBlood gushed from his mouthHe was pushing my qi out by circulating his qi, but it seemed like my words had disturbed his concentration. It didn\u2019t matter to me.\u201cI don\u2019t care what you did behind us. If you think that it is your duty and obligation that you did those things, let me tell you that you are mistaken.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dHis face turned dark.Maybe it is because I told him that his reasons were shit.\u201cI\u2026 was protecting you\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs pushing me out protecting me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were running away from your responsibility. You did enough for a guy who wasn\u2019t even your child? From now on whatever happens isn\u2019t my fault? Is that your true intention?\u201d\u201cCough!\u201dHe coughed and didn\u2019t respond. He must be upset now that the mask he had put on was being pulled down.\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t thought that and sent me out, I wouldn\u2019t have been kidnapped by the Blood Sect\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019He looked quite shocked. Look at how he reacted when I talked about the Blood sect.\u201cIf my teacher hadn\u2019t come to save me at that moment, I would have been pulled into those people.\u201dI took something from the sleeve and threw it at himHe received that thing only to show a shocked face.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cThe plaque of the Great Doctor.\u201d\u201cThis?\u201d\u201cYou might like to think that my dantian got healed by the Blood Sect, but this is the truth.\u201dI never thought I\u2019d use the plaque of that man like this.Well, this was no lie. He did heal my dantian, or at least he tried to,\u201cTeacher had acquaintance with that man and he restored my dantian\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dHe sighed. It seemed like he was a bit shocked when it was the best physician that had helped me.But the important thing comes now.\u201cDid you think I don\u2019t qualify to be a representative?\u201dSrng!With that, I drew Iron Sword, puzzling So Ik-heon.Not caring, I took the stance.\u201cYou\u2026 no?\u201dHis eyes widened as he recognized the stance of the Sodong Ranged Sword.I moved my body following the memories I had seen, following the shadow of So Ik-gyeom.Chak!The movement of the heavy sword was being demonstrated and So Ik-heon became confused.\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026.\u201dIt was natural to show this reaction as this wasn\u2019t some simple imitation.Now, I was performing on the level of the former lord.So Ik-heon couldn\u2019t take his eyes off me even for a moment and the moment I finished, came a shout.\u201cNo!\u201dHis body shuddered as the first half ended and the second half was being unfolded.Even if he hadn\u2019t learned it, he was bound to recognize this. At least, he should have seen his father do it.Pak!The floor of the training room was being dug into a hole as I continued to move the slashing sword technique.I was able to perform it correctly, and as I finished he looked dumbfounded.\u201cDo you still think I don\u2019t deserve it?\u201dAt my question, he asked,\u201cH-How do you know that?\u201dI pulled out a paper that I had prepared in advance, on it was the latter part of the sword which I had written down with pen and ink in the training room.\u201cThe Great Doctor always takes something in exchange for healing someone. Even if it cannot be used, he decides to keep things for the sake of honor.\u201d\u201cThen father?\u201dSo Ik-heon connected the dots.Thanks to this, I made a plausible situation and the man couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the paper I held.Seeing the full technique made him become quite shocked.Now it was his turn to beg.I took the paper back and said,\u201cWho is in the position to make requests now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - Mangok-ri Heuk Hyun-jong (1)Before the feast, I had a long conversation with Yong-yong for the first time since childhood.Thanks to this, the relationship which had felt strained since my mother\u2019s death seemed to fade away into a distant and obscure memory.Yong-yong asked what had happened but I couldn\u2019t just tell her the truth, so I told her what I had told So Ik-heon.I didn\u2019t want to lie to her but no good would come from knowing about the Blood Sect.It felt like I was lying to her in the guise of doing it \u2018for her sake,\u2019 just like how So Ik-heon had kept similar things from me.But if the truth was ever leaked out, she would become linked with the Blood Sect. It wouldn\u2019t be right to hastily speak about something like this.-From your point of view, your sister wouldn\u2019t believe it either, right?\u2018Right\u2019I guess she would feel the same way.Was it because Short Sword was a woman too? She could sympathize.Yet Yong-yong seemed to be aware that I was hiding something.-She has good instincts.Right.She was a much more mature child than me.-What do you mean mature child?\u2018\u2026\u2019I didn\u2019t know how to tell her.In order for Yong-yong to not be caught up in the affairs of the Blood Sect, the path I needed to take was clear.In order to do that, Baek Ryeon-ha needs to rise up.-Even so, do not lose your focus, Wonhwi\u2018At the center..\u2019-Strength and power are addictive. If you get caught in the eddy, you will lose control over yourself and sink down. In the end, you need to ground yourself.I was grateful for Iron Sword\u2019s advice and as these were the ones that were the closest to me, I never lost focus in the hard times.-Hm-If you know that is good enough.It felt like they were complimenting me, but their reactions seemed very different.Slowly the feast hall was turning noisy and the guests seemed to be going in one after another.My hyungs couldn\u2019t join, since they had been severely injured. The feast would begin in earnest when the guests from Mount Hyeong arrived.As soon as Jo Sang-nam entered, he glanced over at me and Sima Young.I knew that the fight only hadn\u2019t happened because So Ik-heon had intervened, but I could tell that he didn\u2019t care for me much.-Seems a bit stupidTrue.Was there any older brother who would give their little sister to such a man?Ik-heon, who was seated at the top of the banquet hall, came forward and greeted the guests from the Jo family.\u201cHahaha. Come on in.\u201dHe greeted them with a smile, but in a way, I thought he was amazing. I thought he would rest since his injuries hadn\u2019t healedHow could I ever think of this man as my father? After making the deal with him, I asked Blue Decree Sword something before leaving the training room,\u2018Blue Decree Sword\u2019-Go on\u2018Before my mother passed away, did she tell the lord about my biological father?\u2019-\u2026This was the thing I was most curious about.This man surely took her in, but what was the real identity of my mother?And who was my real father? My mother never mentioned this, even on her deathbed.I was young at the time and she thought it could hurt my innocent heart. But shouldn\u2019t she have told So Ik-heon?-I am sorry.But he didn\u2019t know either.Despite meeting my mother before her death, even So Ik-heon wasn\u2019t told of their identity. Did it mean she left not wanting to cause any slight disturbance in my family?I didn\u2019t know my mother or father\u2019s identity and only knew half the truth.-It must be frustrating\u2018It is.\u2019Before and after my rebirth, the complexity of this life had never changed.Finally, the guests from Mount Hyeong arrived. It was Cho Jeong-un and Cho Il-hye.\u201cOh! Great warrior Cho! Lady Cho!\u201dAs soon as they arrived, Jo Sang-won, the head of the Uipung Jo family, greeted them. Cho Jeong-un, who was shy by nature, appeared rather stiff.\u201cSajae came here first.\u201d\u201cYou are here, sahyung.\u201d\u201cIf you are fine can we sit together?\u201dAt his question, I turned to the table.So Ik-heon and his wife were sitting at the head position of the table and couldn\u2019t hide their shock.Because the seats of Mount Hyeong were set at the top too, meaning that I would be sitting at the same table as the head of the family, but then Cho Il-hye stepped in to resolve the issue.\u201cSahyung. The fest has a set seating area. You can change places later, but for now, the right seats should be taken\u201d\u201cAhh.\u201dThe guy looked seriously sad. And this was a good atmosphere so I didn\u2019t want to say anything.I also didn\u2019t want to sit there. I wasn\u2019t sure of the answers I would have to give if he asked me anything, and as Iron Sword always said, even lies have rules.He said that lies should be based on the truth, and one should be the most careful when creating a lie based on no truth.Sh!I took the initiative,\u201cPlease do what Miss has said. The Lord will be disappointed.\u201d\u201cMan.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t we have other chances to sit together?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dCho Jeong-un said that he would drink alcohol with me later. When it came to alcohol, mistakes were often made so avoiding this issue ahead of time was the right move to make.-I thought you were just born to lie.\u2018If I have no truths to base it on, I will be exposed.\u2019-Interesting.I had to be careful because I wasn\u2019t sure what he would ask me. I would have to depend on Iron Sword to fill me in.\u2018Are you fine?\u2019-Well. It is fine as long as your intent isn\u2019t evil.That was all Iron Sword said about that. But I kind of felt bad for using his information like this.But I was also glad that he could understand my position. Soon, the seats at the feasts were soon filled in.A feast always starts with words from the host so I looked at the Lord who had just risen from his seat.Our eyes met and I nodded my head making him go stiff.Now that he got the signal he would have to announce itThe guy took a deep breath as his expression changed and he looked at the faces of each guest as he smiled,\u201cI will send my greetings to the distinguished guests who have visited my home.\u201dTak!When he said it, all the guests bowed their heads.Being humble to one another.As the guests sat straight, he continued,\u201cBefore the feast begins, I have something to say to the guests. If it isn\u2019t too rude please listen\u201dIn his words, Jo Song-won, the head of the Jo family reacted unexpectedly.\u201cHahaha. Lord So is so serious. You said you wanted to gradually talk about it, are you trying to make a public announcement here?\u201dAt those words, Jo Sang-nam smirkedIt seemed like they misunderstood what he was talking about.They thought it was about the Jo family\u2019s engagement to Yong-yong, and he even glanced at her.-This is a mess.It seemed so.\u201cSigh\u201dYong-yong, who was sitting at the same table sighed. She seemed worried about having her life tied down.At that time, lord So bowed his head and said,\u201cI have to apologize to you, the head of the Uipung Jo family.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI do not think that my child is suitable for your son. Thank you for holding on till now. But I hope he finds a better match than her.\u201d\u2018\u2026!\u2019Silence filled the hall.Although he did put it politely, it was still a firm refusal.The faces of the father and son who were expecting a different announcement were shocked and I looked at Yong-yong.Her lips were very slightly raised.-So rewardingAs Short Sword said, this was rewarding.And for the time being Lord So would not speak about marrying off Yong-yong. Unless his wife didn\u2019t use her hand again.The madam looked a bit uneasy. The marriage plan was actually set up by her.A tactic to get rid of my sister who she didn\u2019t want to be close to and build a relationship with the Jo family[Madame]She looked at me[I hope that your nonsense acts will never enter my ears in the future. If a foul plan or act reaches me, be prepared for what happens that day.]She trembled.I wasn\u2019t sure if it was from anger or fear, but I did my role and turned back to So Ik-heon.Now himEven before the guests could discuss the previous announcement, he continued,\u201cThe purpose of this speech here is to inform you all that Wonhwi, the third son of my family will represent my family in the Murim Tournament.\u201dYes.The first step to reclaiming the Blood Demon Sword was taken. I had returned to my home and without even spending a day here I had achieved success.While the feast was happening I quietly exited the hall.My work here was done.\u201cUhh.\u201dCho Sung-won felt like he was missing out on food and alcohol as he had to follow me.\u201cWhy are we leaving so quickly? It is too late to move now.\u201dWe got permission to participate under this name so we were done here. But this guy seemed to think that we had time on our hands.\u201cWe have work to do\u201d\u201cWe do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stop when sahyung is speaking.\u201dCho Sung-won went silent at Sima Young\u2019s words.It was because of that and another reason we stayed so long.Yong-yong.\u201cBrother. Are you leaving now?\u201d\u201cThere are things my teacher asked me to do and I have already informed the Lord.\u201d\u201cIf we are going to the tournament, how about we both go together?\u201dThis is why I wanted to leave in a hurry.I felt burdened at the thought of her, and the Mount Hyeong people coming with me.\u201cCan we not go together? I will inform my teacher and we can leave early.\u201dYong-yong glanced at Sima Young after saying that.What?The face of Sima Young looked red. And it wasn\u2019t because of the alcohol she drank.-She likes it, shamelesssaid Short sword.My heart throbbed.Yong-yong, that one is a woman!\u201cMiss. If you come to the Murim Tournament you can see sahyung there. Do not be too sad.\u201dSim Young comforted her and the eyes of Yong-yong were twinkling!\u201cRight?\u201dHer voice was full of excitement. While she was doing that, Sima Young smiled brightly without realizing it!That is it, we need to leave right now!\u201cYong, see you later\u201d\u201cBrother? Brother!\u201dI led the two of them out with a hasty greeting. I hurried because I didn\u2019t want her to follow me.Sima Young looked like she didn\u2019t understand. Man, this handsome man\u2019s face is a problem!-Do you really think it is because of the mask?Short sword mumbledWhat else could it be then?It was then.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019As I was about to leave, I felt a familiar sword.\u2018Blue Decree Sword\u2019I could feel it rapidly approaching, and when I looked back, So Ik-heon was coming from the hall.I told him in advance that I would leave so why was he following me?\u201cStay aside for a moment.\u201dAt my words, Sima Young and Cho Sung-won continued walking out and So Ik-heon got closer.\u201cWhy did you come? I said I would give the rest after the tournament.\u201dI gave him only two of the five techniques of the second half. I had to do it because he might change his mind.\u201cIt isn\u2019t because of that\u201dWhat did he mean then? If he isn\u2019t there for that, was he here to see me off? No shot.I might have thought it was possible in the start, but not anymore and So Ik-heon pulled something from his sleeve.A round jade.\u201cHave this\u201dSo Ik-heon handed it to me.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201c\u2026 the one thing your mom had when I first met her.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019The jade my mother had?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Mangok-ri Heuk Hyun-jong (2)A cave found deep within the forest.The flickering lights of a bonfire lit the cave walls.\u201cWow. I might finally live.\u201dCho Sung-won, who took off his human skin mask, put on a refreshed expression. The pimples on the face of this guy who hadn\u2019t been able to take off his mask were bulging.On the other hand, Sima Young had pure jade-like skin. According to her, depending on the skill of the person who made the mask, it was possible for the mask to not stick so tightly to the skin. Looking at it now, Cho Sung-wong must have had a shoddy mask.\u201cMy father made mine.\u201dShe was boasting.Oh.This was the first time I had heard something like this, but apparently one of the Four Great Evils had a deep knowledge of skin mask masking. He was notorious and I didn\u2019t think he was the type to walk around with a bare face. So it made sense that he had become skilled in mask masking.\u201cI want to ask that father of yours to make one for me.\u201dCho Sung-won spoke like he was envious.-I want to see how he would ask.Commented Short Sword.Right. I wondered if he would be able to make his request after learning who her father was. He would probably be too shocked to speak.While the two were talking about their masks, I carefully pulled something out of my sleeve and kept it out of sight of the two. The jade was about one-third of the size of my palm.\u2018Is this what my mother had when she met him?\u2019So Ik-heon handed this to me. When I asked him why he was giving it to me, he said that I needed to have this more than him-Do you not know what this is?\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019-You don\u2019t know?\u2019The pattern on the jade. It looked like a flying crane, but I wasn\u2019t sure it had a meaning. The edges of the jade were round and rough cut.I was a low-level spy for eight years and I had never seen such a pattern. It was difficult to tell if this was a plaque or an ornament.\u2018Hm. Flying crane\u2026\u2019\u2018Is there any place in Murim where there is a sect called the Flying Care?\u2019 I asked Iron Sword.\u2018Do you know of any such thing?\u2019-I do not know. My former master was based in Yunnan and moved around it so if I saw a pattern there I would remember it.Even Iron Sword who knew a lot yet didn\u2019t seem to know either. There were thousands of sects, clans, minor sects, and brotherhoods in Murim. Of course, there were only a hundred or fewer that had properly established themselves, but it was still difficult to know them all.\u2018And this means?\u2019Usually, the crane symbolizes three thingsA virtuous sign, because of its longevity, nobility, and spirituality. In fact, warriors didn\u2019t often use the crane as a symbol of their sects. Rather it was used for families. In order to show bravery, Murim sects often used wild animals like tigers and wolves.\u2018What could this be?\u2019Did it have anything to do with my mother\u2019s past? Or maybe my father\u2019s? As I began to unravel the secret of my birth, I became even more curious as to why my mother was wounded when So Ik-heon had found her.-Does that mean your mother was a member of a sect then?It was a possibility that couldn\u2019t be ignored. It would be nice if there were clues about my mother, but I didn\u2019t have any.Short Sword didn\u2019t know anything because my mother had taken her in passing.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dI felt someone watching and suddenly Sima Young turned to me and approached.It seemed difficult to control her, well, she had inherited the blood of a mad man so she must be pretty skilled.But why would she try to hide her presence to know what I am doing? I clenched the jade in my fist,\u201cMiss, do not come over here without permission.\u201d\u201cI did it only because I was curious about what you were looking at.\u201d\u201cDo you know what it means to hide and see?\u201dSometimes, she looked a bit too innocent. But it was probably due to her lack of interactions. As I tucked the jade into my sleeve, she came up and put her chin on my shoulder\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything though. Are you angry?\u201d\u201cDo not put your chin on my should\u2026\u201dI turned my head slightly and her face was too close. She was surely beautiful. Even the bonfire made her look nice. As her shallow breath touched my cheek, it felt even more strange.\u201cHmm.\u201dCho Sung-won coughed, making Sima Young get up from my shoulder and walk back to the bonfire. And then she struck Cho Sung-won in the back of his head.\u201cNo! Why are you hitting me?\u201d\u201cIt is a sign of friendliness.\u201d\u201cOh. For real\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Should we spar? It has been a long time.\u201dCho Sung-won scratched his head and smiled at Sima Young\u2019s voice.\u201cSuch things can happen between friends. Hahaha.\u201d-Sulking in the face of power.Short Sword clicked her tongue. Cho Sung-won, who was inferior in terms of skills, decided to hold onto his sanity.But with her beauty, she had almost made me lose my rationality for a second.-Wonhui. My former master said that a true warrior should always be careful around women with beauty as they always have motives.-Yes, I can see why your master was alone all his life. Tch.-\u2026 what is that supposed to mean?The clash between the two was echoing in my head and I looked at Sima Young with a puzzled expression.\u2018Temptation?\u2019When I looked back at her, I could only see an innocent face. The cruelty of raising her sword, the bright smile, the gentle gaze back at me.I wasn\u2019t sure which face of hers was the real one.Before moving from Hunan to Hubei, there were things that we needed to do.After completing our first mission, we needed to head to an internal sect.There, we were meant to join Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun, and then as a group, move on to Wuhan which was in the Hubei region.However, as we had managed to get our job faster than expected, we decided to first stop by Mangok-ri, which was on the way. It was less than half a day away from our pre-planned route, so we decided to stop by.\u201cPhew. We are here,\u201d mumbled Cho Sung-won as he looked at the people on the street.To the south of this city was Hunan, which was mostly made of Orthodox Sects, and to the North was where the Forces of Evil lived.In particular, at the border, there were notorious evil sects such as the Black Dragon Society and more, which was why it wasn\u2019t difficult to see such people in Mangok-ri.There were warriors who had vicious scars on them. It was easy to tell which people walking on the streets belonged to the Unorthodox Sects.\u201cAre you really going to stop here?\u201d\u201cThen you want to go to the Beggars Union?\u201dCho Sung-won went silent. He knew that it was too early to find the Beggars Union.The place we were headed to was Heuk Hyun-jong, the actual ruler of Mangok-ri. This was claimed to be nothing, but I actually knew it was one of the three bases of the Lower District sect.It might be strange to call it a base as the Lower District sect didn\u2019t have this concept of bases, the Lower District sect only dealt with information and operated these three bases only to facilitate this.And one of them was Heuk Hyun-jongBefore returning, of course, I was the one who was normally approached. As we approached the entrance to the village, which was just to the north of Mangok-ri, people with swords could be seen.Unlike ordinary places, this place was black all around and this had to be the Heuk Hyun-jong bar.Most of the people who were drinking at the table under the canopy were of the Evil Sects.\u2018And we have come to this place.\u2019I was relieved that I didn\u2019t have to come to such a place alone. There were two reasons that I had come to this place which was owned by the Lower District Sect. But now there were three.[There seem to be quite a few warriors. Will we be fine?]Cho Sung-won asked, a bit worried. As the guy said, there were quite a number of strong people inside this bar.As this was an open information place, it was natural for strong people to congregate there.[Scared?][S-scared who? I am fine.]Cho Sung-won pretended to be fine just because I provoked him a little. And I smiled,\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBlack tables were all around as we entered. As we entered, all eyes focused on us.This was because we did not look like the unorthodox kind, and we were unfamiliar faces. Upon entering, it was noisy with drunk people talking with one another.The building itself was large and it seemed that there were hundreds of customers on just the first floor.\u201cCome\u2026?\u201dA young server who greeted us looked puzzled. His visage was no different from the people outside, and I asked,\u201cAny vacancies?\u201dThe server, who was a bit shocked, smiled softly and asked us to follow.Apparently, the place we were guided to was the middle of the first floor. Thanks to this, we were surrounded by people.\u201cWeren\u2019t we given this table on purpose?\u201dSima Young asked with glaring eyes. In fact, it wasn\u2019t so uncommon. If they sensed you had martial arts, these things were common.Sima Young was trying to bring this up when the server returned, but then a woman in a red revealing dress came up to her.It looked like she was just one of the many prostitutes selling their bodies, but each of them looked to be second-rate warriors.\u201cWelcome, young ones. Would you like to order?\u201dHearing the phrase \u2018young ones\u2019 the people around turned to us. This was intentional. We had come into the den of the Unorthodox Sects and the Forces of Evil, so they were bound to be attracted to such words.I spoke directly to her,\u201cI want to head to the second floor.\u201d\u201cSecond floor?\u201d\u201cI heard brewed sake is known to be delicious.\u201dAt my words, she turned her head and looked somewhere. In addition, the women in red clothes and men in black robes near the wall glanced over. One of the men in black nodded.\u201cDid you know that only one person can taste the special sake?\u201dOnly the client could head up and knowing that I nodded,\u201cThese two will have the noodles.\u201dLeaving the two on the first floor, I followed the woman in red. And as I moved up the eyes of those around me turned to me.It was because they wanted to know the information I came here for. When we went up to the second floor, there seemed to be a meeting hall in the middle and small rooms to the sideIn the middle of the meeting hall was a table with an old man in a black hood and ruffled clothes chugging down alcohol.\u2018He is different\u2019-What?The face was different from the man I saw in the memory of the Blue Decree Sword. There were no scars on this old man\u2019s face.-Different?Short Sword asked, puzzled, but then the man said,\u201cSweep away sorrow and hatred\u201dA secret word to confirm the other\u201cWith alcohol.\u201dThe old man grinned at my words and pointed his hand to the seat opposite him. Sitting across from the table I noticed the old man put a glass in front of him.There were three glasses. On the inside of it were words, higher, middle, and lower. I picked up the bottle and poured it into the one marked lower.\u201cI have two things. I don\u2019t think that it will be that hard.\u201dWith those words, I took out ten silver coins from my pocket. It referred to the difficulty of the quest being handed out. I chose lower as it could not be difficult for this man.\u201cPlease talk.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t a customer come about a year and three months ago?\u201d\u201cCustomer?\u201d\u201cThey must have come to find the son of the Ikyang So family.\u201dAt those words, the expression of the old man stiffened.\u201cI cannot reveal the information of my client.\u201d\u201cYou seem to know.\u201dThey couldn\u2019t have not known. My \u201cfather\u201d had come here and asked them to find me.\u201cFind Asong.\u201dAt my words, the old man stroked his beard and asked,\u201cCan you give me the reason?\u201d\u201cHe is my servant.\u201dAt my words, he narrowed his eyes. He looked at my face clearly and I noticed his throat tremble.It was like sharing a message with someone, and then he said,\u201cYou are clever. After the servant, the father came looking for the young master, but the fact that the young master who disappeared appears like this looking for their servant is shocking.\u201dIndeed, this was a base of theirs. Within seconds he managed to find out who I was, and who came for me.This was intended though. One of the reasons I came here was to intentionally leak information to them. Because So Ik-heon stopped by here and was informed that I had been taken away by the Blood Sect, they might have had information that I was a true member of the sect.Before participating in the tournament, it was necessary to reduce the variables.\u201cAs the old man knows, the young master is\u2026\u201d\u201cI was lucky. Without the help of my teacher I wouldn\u2019t have been able to come here or make such a request.\u201dAt my words, he intently stared at me, and then pushed 10 silvers to me and said,\u201cHow about exchanging information about the whereabouts of the teacher of the young master?\u201dI bit my tongue at this old man\u2019s guts.Is the information actually being brought from me?-Will you tell him?I will have to since he already knows. I smiled and pushed the coins ahead,\u201cYou want to spend money on something you will find out anyway?\u201d\u201cYou will simply let me know?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThere are two orders.\u201dAnother order.It was about the jade in my hand. To find clues about my mother.Wouldn\u2019t they at least be able to recognize the patterns on the jade and maybe ask around?Smiling, the old man said,\u201cI will accept both your requests. Then can I hear about your teacher?\u201d\u201cHis surname is Ho, and he is of the Jong clan.\u201d\u201cHo\u2026 Jong? Southern Heavenly Swordsman!\u201dThe old man couldn\u2019t hold back his surprise.Judging from his reaction, what happened in the Ikyang So family hadn\u2019t spread here yet.The man holding the glass was trembling at the name he just said\u2013Pat!But then something unexpected happened. This guy suddenly grabbed my wrist.I hurriedly tried to shake off his hand and create distance right then.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dAt my words, the old man growled with an angry face,\u201cYou are a disciple of the Southern Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Mangok-ri Heuk Hyun-jong (3)Published onNov 7, 2022\u202212 min read\u20225669 views\u201cYou are the disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dAn old man with an angry face, quite the unknown variable.This was such an unexpected situation, so I distanced myself from the table and carefully glanced around. The moment the old man grabbed me, the men in black standing guard at the stairs and in the private rooms, all drew their weapons and narrowed the distance between us.There were twelve of them, and they began to encircle me little by little. All of them appeared to be quite skilled.\u2018Iron sword. Do you know him?\u2019At the sudden hostile attitude, I immediately asked him.-I don\u2019t know. I have been with my master for a long time but this is the first time seeing this faceWith that said, I look at close look at the clear face with no wound,\u2018A mask?\u2019I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I knew that I had just created a mess.Apparently, looking at the reaction of this old man, it seemed like he had some connection with the South Heavenly Swordsman.But I couldn\u2019t figure out why such hostility was being directed at me.\u201cIs it alright to threaten your clients in a place that sells information?\u201dAt my words, the man shook his head.\u201cIt has been more than fifteen to sixteen years since he went missing. And you say you are the disciple of a disappeared man?\u201dA strong sense of anger in his voice.I couldn\u2019t tell if it was because he thought I was fake and liked the Southern Heavenly Swordsman, or if he was hostile because he hated the man.Meanwhile, the siege began to narrow.-Weird.Iron Sword also seemed quite puzzled too.-The Lower District sect is close to being a neutral intelligence group, even if it is normally grouped with the Forces of Evil or the unorthodox sects. This is the first time I am seeing such outright hostility.Same here.As far as I knew, one wouldn\u2019t act hostile unless the other person acted out aggressively.That was why I revealed who my teacher was. But what do I do now? No matter how strong I was, I could not rationalize a way to escape this place filled with skilled warriors.Flinch!Not to mention, I had just felt a strong presence from somewhere nearby. From the entrance of a private room, which was covered by bamboo mesh, on the other side of this floor. A man was looking through the mesh, looking at me. It felt like a snake closing in.\u2018What is this?\u2019I almost felt a chime go off in my head, telling me to be alert\u2013[Pretend not to hear this old man\u2019s voice]The voice of the old man.I was puzzled at this warning, but I deliberately pretended not to hear and remained wary of those around me. I still couldn;t figure out why I was being warned like this.And then the old man continued to speak,[Have you heard of the title, Joho Strong Hand?]\u2018Joho Strong Hand?\u2019It was a title I had never heard of, so I asked Iron Sword.-Joho Strong Hand? Kwak Gyung?\u2018You know him?\u2019-I do. He is a warrior of Fuhu County, in Yunnan.If it was Yunnan, then it was from the same area as Iron Sword and his former master.Was this man simply trying to discover if I was truly his disciple? If I didn\u2019t have the ability to listen to the whispers of the swords, I would have never been able to pretend as if I was his disciple.There were so many connections, and with fame came many troubles. Thinking this, I passed on the words of Iron Sword.[Are you talking about Warrior Kwak Gyung, of the Fuhu County in the Yunnan province?]The eyes of the old man changed at this. Did this solve the problem?[As I had thought][Why are you asking?][You have the guts a disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman should have]Contrary to his words, the old man still looked angry.Was he acting right now? And then he sent another message,[There is one way to get out of this][\u2026 what is it?][There is Na Yuk-hyun of the Pang family.]Na Yuk-hyung? He was the one behind that bamboo? I couldn\u2019t hide my shock.-Why are you so shocked?\u2018\u2026 it is Na Yuk-hyung.\u2019-Who is that?If we were to refer to anyone as the best warriors then it would be the Eight great Warriors and the Four Great Evils.But doesn\u2019t this wide land have many more strong people? In addition to those who have been deemed to be stronger than humans, there were those who were exactly a step or two lower than those previously mentioned. If the Martial Twin Swords were on the side of justice, then Na Yuk-hyung was on the side of evil.-Then he has to be a strong one?Not strong but dangerous. From what I knew, this man had to be as dangerous as one of the Four Great Evils.Even if martial arts were one thing, he was notorious for his vicious and cunning attitude, and for those who pursued after him, those people would rarely return.-Wonhui. You need to be careful\u2018Why?\u2019-That man he\u2026 lost an eye to my former master\u2026 this.One problem after another. Apparently, he had a grudge against the South Heavenly Swordsman.Somehow, he was already standing behind the bamboo mesh with ominous, foreboding energy. It was dangerous to be here.At that time, the old man brought up,\u201cYou are the disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman? For quite some time, you looked down on us, child.\u201dAnd then he said,[I am not sure if you really are a disciple of his, but I will help you out this time.]There was something strange about all this, and this man was clearly acting. He thought that Na Yuk-hyung might come and do something to me, so he was saying out loud that he didn\u2019t believe me.[Try matching my flow][Thank you so much]Was there any reason to refuse help? Well, no, and then the man said,\u201cDo not underestimate our intelligence network. If you tell the truth now, I will put an end to this, and the cost of deceiving us will remain reasonable.\u201dRecognizing the old man\u2019s intentions I spoke a bit shocked,\u201cYour intelligence is quite scary.\u201dI raised my hands trying to declare my surrender. Since we decided to match each other\u2019s flow, there was no need to care about honor.The two men in black came up like they were going to restrain my hands, and as they were about to touch my swords, I warned them,[If you touch my sword I will think you have different intentions.]So they took me downstairs without touching my swords.\u201cSahyung!\u2019When I went down, Sima Young and Cho Sung-won, who found me, called out a bit shocked at how I was brought out, but I immediately sent a message to explain the situation and asked them to follow us.Thanks to this, I had unintentionally gotten the attention of people on the first floor. We were then taken down to the basement,\u2018Was there such a place?\u2019I remember coming to this place three times before returning to my new life, but not once did I know about this basement.\u2018Smell of blood.\u2019As I descended into the basement, the smell of blood touched my nose. Even though it was for intelligence gathering, the basement felt too explicit.Blood stained the walls, ground, and much more. Perhaps because of this, Cho Sung-won was very nervous and was prepared to attack at any time.[Lord, what the hell is this?][\u2026 I am nervous.]I, too, was working hard to improve my skills.As we further entered the basement hallway, a large space the size of the meeting hall above us was revealed.An old man in black was waiting for me. The same person from the 2nd\u00a0floor, so there had to be another way down.\u201cLet him go.\u201dAt his command, the men let go of my hands and retreated.Staring at the old man, I said,\u201cThank you again for this\u201dAt that, the old man shook his head,\u201cThis is just a temporary measure. Don\u2019t think that cunning people can be deceived by such a small act.\u201dJust as I had thought.Na Yuk-hyung was not someone who could be dismissed so easily. The old man warmed us first and then pointed his hand to the northeast.There was a passage, and a fine wind was coming through the vent.\u201cIf you go through that path, you can get around 200 meters from here.\u201dAh.There was a secret passage. In fact, the more information one dealt with, the more careful one had to be with everything.Even if one could escape their cells, they might be able to get out of this place, but the entrance of the to the passage would be blocked by the men in black.SrngSuddenly, the men behind us drew their swords and separated me from the two.As if to prevent any interruptions to me walking down the path.\u201cThis is different.\u201dSima Young was glaring, and she tried to pull her sword out but I stopped her and asked,\u201cWeren\u2019t you helping us? What is the purpose of this?\u2019\u201cThe situation wasn\u2019t favorable, so we brought you in a hurry, but there needs to be a verification process.\u201d\u201cVerify?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I am not sure if you are a disciple of the South Heavenly Swords?\u201dSh!The old man took something from his sleeve and put it on. Judging from the material of the shiny silver glove, it didn\u2019t look normal.-Wonhui, it feels like this man is the Joho Strong Hand, Kwak Gyung\u2018What?\u2019-The glove he put on is Silver Hand. Gloves that were made of a mixture of black iron and silver, that can block any weapon. And its master has to be Kwak Gyung.\u2018You said that it had to be the other man.\u2019-Well, that man was connected with my former master. However, my former master felt a bit horrible after the man disappeared twenty years ago after their family was annihilated.Their family was annihilated?Isn\u2019t that the plot of a story where a man was forced to turn to the Forces of Evil? The fact that Iron Sword couldn\u2019t recognize him right away meant that his skin mask and voice were extremely mimicked to match that of an old man.This old man was Kwak Gyung in disguise and he said,\u201cTen years have passed since the South Heavenly Swordsman disappeared and while I was working here as a rogue, I met customers who claimed to have a relationship with him about 6 times.\u201d\u2018Um\u2026\u2019It seems like quite a lot of people did this.\u201cAll of them were idiots who were looking for his trial to get his legacy and martial arts that he had left behind.\u201d\u201cYou think the same of me too?\u201d\u201cSo far you seem different from them.\u201d\u201cThen why do you have the Silver Gloves in hand?\u201dAt my words, the old man\u2019s eyes shone. It seemed like he was surprised.Of course, it was Iron Sword who recognized them and not me.\u201cYou keep making me look forward to this.\u201dWith that, he took the stance of a tiger who was ready to rush and pounce on its prey.\u201cIf you truly are that man\u2019s disciple, you will not say that you do not know this sword technique.\u201dPat!As soon as he said it, the man rushed at me. His movement was close to basic close combat.The old man\u2019s hand was aiming for my head with the force of a tiger\u2019s fangs barring out.Sring!I pulled Iron Sword out and stabbed him in the head, but he tilted his head and deflected the sword with his glove.Clang!When Iron Sword hit the glove, a metallic ringing sound could be heard.It was said that it was a mixture of black iron and silver. And this glove was a single, devastating weapon. The old man\u2019s left hand tried to slam into my chin.Sh!I leaned back to avoid it. In such a state, I relaxed my wrist and tried to cut his left wrist.Pat!But he withdrew his hand and went into a defensive stance with the face looking like a tiger that had found its prey.Shhh!My feet moved back gently like I was walking on clouds. I evaded his attacks by stepping backward and unfolded my sword.\u2018Tiger Tooth Sword!\u2019It was the tiger tooth sword. A sword to subdue the opponent with the fierce force of a tiger. The moment he saw my sword technique he exclaimed,\u201cXing Ming Sword!\u201dHe knew the sword technique. His whole body trembled like he had felt a thrill.Recognizing the technique, he looked desperate with eyes of determination.It is as if dozens of tigers were coming at me. As the fierce sword technique and hands clashed, blue sparks flew about.This man had good eyes. He was accurately blocking my attacks and was able to counterattack.But,\u201cWhat?\u201dThe old man looked shocked. And I didn\u2019t miss it. I used the last movement of my attack to take advantage of a gap.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe pulled back after being stabbed in the shoulder. His experience was limited to the incomplete Xing Ming technique.\u201c\u2026 you took matters into your own hands,\u201d said the old man. As he said this, I stabbed the point of his meridian to make him lose his strength.\u201cIsn\u2019t this a battle to prove my identity?\u201dAt those words, he smiled,\u201cLeader of Heuk Hyun-jong, no, Joho Strong Hand, Kwak Gyung formally greets the descendant of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dThe old man revealed his identity and recognized me this time, and I returned his bow.\u201cPlease forgive my rudeness.\u201d\u201cI also apologize for any rudeness committed due to my misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cWhat do\u2026!?\u201dThe old man\u2019s expression went stiff as he turned his head. The men in black who were blocking the entrance were on the floor with my sajaes standing\u201cHa!\u201dThe old man couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Na Yuk-hyung (1)As expected, the martial skills of Sima Young and Cho Sung-won were nothing to scoff at.Just in case, I had asked them to deal with the men in black if I had to truly deal with Kwak Gyung, and they did so in such a short amount of time.Actually, even Sima Young alone could have handled both of them.\u201cYou have excellent colleagues,\u201d said Kwak Gyung, shaking his head.\u201cThese are my sajae and friend.\u201dCho Sung-won\u2019s lips twitched at the word friend. Wasn\u2019t it good that he wasn\u2019t showing a reaction?But the guy\u2019s interests were elsewhere,\u201cSajae? Then you too?\u201dChak!Sima Young greeted him,\u201cSecond disciple Ma Young greets Warrior Kwak.\u201dKwak Gyung couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.\u201cI was worried the great warrior had been missing for too long, but to think he was nurturing disciples of his own all this while.\u201dRespect in his voice.Looking at this, it felt like he liked the South Heavenly Swordsman. It could not be easy to live a life that was respected by so many.Chak!I picked up Iron Sword which Kwak Gyung was holding, but then he asked,\u201cI couldn\u2019t recognize it because there was rust on the sword, but isn\u2019t that the South Heavenly Iron Sword?\u201d-Oh, he knows-Hmm?Short Sword sounded confused, and Iron Sword tried to play it cool. Unlike other normal swords, Iron Sword was made with a mix of cold iron, which could only be handled by the best craftsmen, so the rusted and damaged parts couldn\u2019t be casually restored.Even so, this man managed to recognize it.\u201cThat isn\u2019t all, but Teacher lent me his sword.\u201dI did my best to avoid saying that he had given it to me. If I had to put it into words, well, the South Heavenly Swordsman had retired.I am sorry, but I had to put a title on it.\u201cHuh. To see the sword of that warrior again. It is quite emotional.\u201dKwak Gyung looked like he was thinking back. I was curious about the real face behind the mask.At that time, the guy pointed to the passage,\u2018This isn\u2019t right. If it wasn\u2019t for Na Yuk-hyung, I would have really wanted to talk to the disciple of my old acquaintance, but it is unfortunate there is no time, you need to hurry,\u201c said Kwak Gyung.Things were messed up because of Na Yuk-hyung. The purpose for coming here wasn\u2019t done but then he said,[Asong that servant, I will find him. I will take measures so that I can find the information from any branch.]Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t neglecting my request.[Ah. come to think of it, didn\u2019t you say 2 requests?]He also didn\u2019t forget about the second one. I told Sima Young and Cho Sung-won to go ahead before me. And when they did I took out the jade from my sleeve,[Do you know about this jade?]Kwak Gyung looked at the jade and frowned, it looked like this was his first time seeing it.Kwak Gyung looked at it and asked,[Where did you get this?][\u2026 I apologize, I cannot tell you that.][Hmm.][Do you know about it?][The picture is of a flying crane.][Yes.]Does this guy know of a family which uses this? But then he said something weird,[If you look closely at the jade plaque, it is like looking at the full moon with intaglios all over the place, right?]With that said, he turned the jade and looked. I never thought that the round jade itself was in the shape of a moon.He was looking at it like it was a piece of art. Then, could the plaque be related to the moon along with the crane?Kwak Gyung who looked at it said,[You might not know since it has been such a long time.][Uh?][The Flying Moon Blooming Sect]Flying Moon Blooming Sect.I had never heard of it. There were no writings that spoke about a crane.[Are you aware of the four martial sects?]No one could not know.Martial sects were placed where one pursued only martial arts above things such as political affairs and factions.Thousands of warriors made and inherited their own martial arts, and I had heard that there were hundreds of large and small clans within them.Among those numerous martial artists, four were known to be the strongest.They were called the Four Great Martial Arts. And of the four there were two sects that produced a few of the Eight Great Warriors.[The Flying Moon Blooming Sect was a place that once almost made it the Five Great Martial Arts. Although it is now forgotten by the younger ones.]Five? Does that mean there was another martial arts clan as strong as the other four?I was too shocked as I never could have guessed and I never thought that the sects would be mentioned as they were all in hegemony.[If this old man\u2019s thinking is right, the pattern here is of that clan.][Then the crane on it?][If it is true and what I remember about the crane is that something about the origin has to do with the crane.][Origin?][I don\u2019t know exactly. Apparently, there are high-level and low-level requests.]Even if I was the disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman, nothing was free to me.Actually, work should be separated.[I will pay the price.][I see. But we, too, need to investigate this as this was an incident from a long time ago. We don\u2019t have the time right now, so I will take information from the branches or give it to them. Let\u2019s go now!]Since I had to hurry before we got caught, I moved to the passage. It was said it would be around 200 meters out of here, and the time it took to traverse the passage seemed long.On the way, Iron Sword called me,-Wonhui\u2018What?\u2019-I have heard about the Flying Moon Blooming Sect.Considering the age and period that the South Heavenly Swordsman lived through, he would have seen enough. It seems that he couldn\u2019t think of the name when looking at the jade though.\u2018What do you know?\u2019-Ahh, I don\u2019t know anything too detailed like you expect. However, Han Sung-won was the master of that sect with whom my former master confronted.\u2018Ha Sung-won?\u2019My mother\u2019s surname was Ha.If the surname matched with one of the sect leaders, did that mean my mother was related to him?-I don\u2019t know thatWait.But, doesn\u2019t it seem like how you said it was, he confronted him, and the outcome of the fight?-As I said, he was supposed to, but the sect leader wouldn\u2019t come out\u2018Why?\u2019-I don\u2019t know. There was some problem with the Martial Twin Swords. Shortly after a war had broken out and the peace treaty was shattered. So I remember my former master being disappointed.It was said that the fight didn\u2019t happen due to a civil war. So what happened?It was understandable if the man didn\u2019t want to fight against the South Heavenly Swordsman as the sect was supposedly going down.And now, no one remembers this forgotten sect.\u2018\u2026 sigh.\u2019My mind felt complicated.We could not yet be sure of who my mother was, and her relation to the Martial Twin Swords. But if my mother\u2019s jade was tied to this sect, then what had happened twenty years back?After running through the passage for a long time, I saw two people. Sima Young and Cho Sung-won,\u201cVice!\u201d\u201cWe were waiting.\u201dThey had been waiting for about half an hour.As soon as I joined them, we began to run faster. It wasn\u2019t long before light appeared. The light was shining from the top and bottom and when I looked over, I saw a rope ladder.\u201cI think we should go up.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dBefore I could even finish my words, Sima Young fearlessly climbed up first. Cho Sung-won was being careful about it while she wasn\u2019t.We soon heard her voice,\u201cNobody is up here. I think we should just move up. This is a well\u201d\u201cWell?\u201dAs she said that, we began to climb the rope ladder. As we climbed up, we saw that it was the exit of a well.An abandoned well, and it seemed to have been deliberately left like this.\u201cI am glad we got out safely. Then let\u2019s head out now\u201dAs we moved from there, a village appeared. It was a bit more to the northeast and we managed to find our way into the village.It seemed like everything was going well. We hurriedly reoriented ourselves in the village, and then immediately departed for the hill.But the problem came when we entered the forest,[Vice commander. I think there is an ambush ahead.]It was as Sima Young said. On the other side of the hill, there was a group of 20 men blocking the forest path.None of them had a sword, so I could only sense them from their qi presence.\u2018Enemy,\u2019They were skilled with stealth as we didn\u2019t notice them till now.[What do we do?]At her question, I ordered a retreat. There was no reason to waste our time fighting those ready to ambush us.It was better to avoid them. I was about to change our direction.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019A man was standing right behind us. Neither Sima Young nor I were aware of them.The moment we saw the man in half-white behind us, I felt goosebumps. He had an eye patch with a snake pattern on it, he had this strong energy, and it had the same feeling as the energy I had felt on the top floor of Heuk Hyun-jong.-Wonhui\u2026 that is Na Yuk-hyung-He is?Even if I hadn\u2019t been warned, I recognized who it was. But what I couldn\u2019t understand was how this man had appeared right behind us when we had escaped through the secret passage.When I looked around, Cho Sung-won was trembling, he was from the Beggars Union so he must have recognized this guy at once.\u2018This is insane.\u2019We did all we could to get away from him, but I didn\u2019t expect this situation to turn out like this. The opponent was a warrior who was skilled and notorious through Murim. Maybe he could be someone in the same realm as Hae Ack-chun.At that moment, Na Yuk-hyung shouted,\u201cFight!!\u201dIt was so loud that it felt like my ears would burst. I wondered why he would scream but then a group of about 20 or so men appeared from over the hill.I had wondered who they were, but now I realized that they were his men. It was quite a dire situation now.\u2018\u2026\u2019After hesitating for a while, I spoke to Na Yuk-hyung,\u201cYour junior So Wonhui greets Warrior.\u201dI decided to try negotiating first. As Iron Sword had said, there could be a grudge he held against my teacher and it would be necessary to solve it.Na Yuk-hyung spoke,\u201cI never had a junior like you.\u201dThe power he held in his voice wasn\u2019t normal. Even if I wasn\u2019t sure, I knew that he was better than Mount Hyeong\u2019s First Sword.And there were quite a few men in the crowd who were amazing warriors.Even if the three of us tried to work together, this was a battle that would be difficult to win or even escape from.\u201cSenior. There seems to be some misunderstanding.\u201dAt my words. Na Yuk-hyung smirked and said,\u201cYou cannot deny it anymore, you are the descendent of the South Heavenly Swordsman, why else would you secretly escape the Lower District Sect through that secret passage.\u201dHow does this man even know about the secret passage? This seems to be a situation that even Kwak Gyung didn\u2019t seem to have predicted. And the man held out a red hand.Shhh!A dark red that wrapped around his wrist slithered out like it was a serpent. It was a weapon that had partially caused his notoriety.There weren\u2019t many martial artists in Murim who used whips, and this man was the best with a whip.\u201cWhere is Ho Jong-dae?\u201dHis purpose seemed to be finding the South Heavenly Sword.Of course, I, who called myself his disciple, might be of help. Intense killing intent erupted from his whip.Srng!Sima Young drew her sword. Cho Sung-won protested a bit.\u201cMiss Sima. That man\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is nothing. and this isn\u2019t something that can be resolved with talks anyway.\u201dShe was right.Na Yuk-hyung wasn\u2019t an enemy who would fall from just words.Even if they fought against this man with everything they had, the probability of winning was not very likely.Srng!I also drew my weapon, grabbing Iron Sword. I then told Sima Young and Cho Sung-won,\u201cFrom now on, victory or defeat will be different depending on how quickly they are dealt with.\u201dThe ones I pointed to were his subordinates.\u201cThen Lord?\u201d\u201cVice commander?\u201dThey looked at me in shock as they understood my meaning.At that time, Na Yuk-hyung spoke like he had heard the most absurd thing,\u201cKuahahahaha! Even if you three attack me at the same time, you cannot do much and you want to come against me alone? Your courage seems baseless.\u201dAs soon as he said that, his hand moved. And the whip which looked like it was alive came for me.The momentum felt so great that even the thickest tree would fall down at once.\u201cHurry up!\u201dI shouted at Sima Young and Cho Sung-won when the whip moved. This wasn\u2019t a situation where one could sneak away and hide.After opening my stance, I decided to bring up the qi from my dantian.Clang!The whip and Iron Sword collided.The impact made my hand tremble as I got pushed back three steps.Na Yuk-hyung frowned,\u201cYou can stop this?\u201dHe seemed to be a bit shocked as I had used innate qi which was different from normal qi. But it didn\u2019t last long,\u201cAfter all, you are his disciple. I cannot help but expect such things from that man\u2019s disciple.\u201dNa Yuk-hyung really seemed to have gone against the South Heavenly Swordsman.He even knew about the innate qi considering how shocked he looked.And I could clearly see the difference between me and him with just one clash.This man was clearly ahead of me yet, I felt like the gap wasn\u2019t too large.Maybe it was because I had my foundation of innate qi. Yet that didn\u2019t mean I would be neglecting to recognize the difference.\u2018Should I put my life on the line?\u2019Was that the only way out I could think of?Na Yuk-hyun snorted and laughed,\u201cDo you think you can get away from here by using your head? Even if your teacher comes\u2026?!\u201dAt that moment he went stiff.It was because of the changes happening within me.Swish!It felt like my body was on fire as I rushed to him, causing him to go numb with shock.\u201cYou, what is that?\u201dVapor was rising from my skin.This was a symptom from using the technique that Hae Ack-chun had taught the twins.I might not have the perfect body like the twins or Hae Ack-chun, but even I could handle it to some extent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Na Yuk-hyung (2)\u201cHurry up!\u201dThe moment So Wonhui flew at Na Yuk-hyung, Sima Young began to run ahead. She was about to use a martial art she had learned from her father.For the first time, she was meeting someone who could actually threaten her life. This enemy was a skilled warrior and had subordinates who were also quite skilled.\u2018It is dangerous.\u2019So Wonhui had made a sound judgment.It would be foolish for everyone to focus on dealing with just that one man. This was because no matter how or what they did, they might fail to have any energy to also take down his subordinates.After she had created room between her and So Wonhui, she immediately moved in to attack.Pat!A sword attack enhanced her movement as she swung her sword at a subordinate of Na Yuk-hyung.She only held the target in her eyes as she swung her sword. But a man looking to be in his 40s, probably another disciple of Na Yuk-hyung, intercepted her.Another skilled warrior, Myung Jong, a disciple who was also skilled at handling a whip like his teacher, laughed at her.Did he maybe expect this to happen?\u201cFoolish thing.\u201dMyung Jong swung his whip to prevent her from getting any closer. But she was someone who was swift.Sima Chak\u2019s most notable footwork completely focused on deceiving the vision of his opponent.Sima Young\u2019s form disappeared from Myung Jong\u2019s eyes.\u2018She vanished?\u2019She did disappear. Just beyond the scope of his sight.Myung Jong felt perturbed and turned to whip the place where he thought he had heard a noise come from.Swish!The whip twisted around once before it rushed in like a snake towards the sound. Of course, Myung Jong expected her to back off, but Sima Young slid across the ground when the sound of the whip came.And she sliced down the ankle of Myung Jong.\u201cUh?\u201dWithout a thought of knowing how this happened, Myung Jong jumped back. For the first time in his life, he had experienced such immense pain.Puak!\u2018\u2026!!\u2019But her sword bent as if it was always destined to reach its target, and stabbed into one of his vital areas.\u201cKuaaaak!\u201dI wasn\u2019t some other place, but directly in the wealth of a man.Myung Jong began to feel a horrible pain that no one could describe. And at that moment, the sword continued stabbing through his chin and out the top of his head.\u201cKuak!\u201dWith only a short groan, the man died. Who would have expected that the disciple of Na Yuk-hyung would be so easily disposed of by some unknown, nameless person.Well, at least, the other men were shocked at this, and Sima Young took the chance to provoke them,\u201cI don\u2019t have time, so come at me right away.\u201d\u201cT-this bastard!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dNa Yuk-hyung\u2019s men decided to attack her at once. But even in such a situation not once did she make the expression of being troubled.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019Seeing her like that, Cho Sung-won bit his tongue. While fighting with her all this while, he knew that she was too intent on killing people to use proper techniques. All she did was stab her enemies in their most vulnerable points.[What are you doing? If you don\u2019t rush we will be in danger!]Cho Sung-won, who didn\u2019t want to make her yell, moved right away.Woong!Smoke began to rise from my body.A phenomenon that occurs as one\u2019s blood begins to circulate rapidly, as the body temperature rises, the moisture in the body evaporates.The True Blood Diamond Body was a technique that could be learned by those with a special body constitution. To handle this technique though, the body needed to grow.Unlike Hae Ack-chun or the twins, I could only use it for less than half the original time of those with that special body constitution.\u201cYou, what the hell\u2026\u201dNa Yuk-hyung was puzzled.It was a technique that he must have never seen from the South Heavenly Swordsman. Without delay, I immediately moved to attack him.This combination of the Xing Ming cultivation and the body enhancement technique increased my capabilities.Pat!In an instant, my body began to move ahead. It moved so fast that even I myself couldn\u2019t believe this.But, the opponent wasn\u2019t some weak man.\u201cHuh!\u201dNa Yuk-hyung swung his whip at me.This snake-like whip flew at me. If the range was this long and wide, how could I close my distance to use my weapon?\u2018True Loach Shaped Sword!\u2019The new form. Iron Sword bent into eight different points that stretched out like a gentle willow tree.The whip and the sword began to move like opposing waves and collided.Kwakwang!The whip made of skin leather moved freely, and the blade flowed like a branch.The sword was soft, but so was the whip.The confrontation between these two soft forms of movement was unfavorable for me. The opponent had an advantage since the whip could soar high, curve, and then rush in like a dragon.I blocked the whip by holding my sword. Though I made sure that my sword was never angled horizontally.In that state, I released the built-up strength in my legs and launched my body high.\u2018True Hidden Clam sword.\u2019It was a sword attack that was meant to counter the opponent\u2019s attack.Pat!Originally, the technique was meant to be executed stationary, but as the whip was strong, and the distance wide, I had no choice but to close the gap.Pat!At the same time as I moved, the whip snapped and a wave of wind slammed into me, protecting Na Yuk-hyung. I was surprised a whip could be handled like this.But somehow, I had to look for a gap.-Give him a shock.Said Iron Sword to me. I had the same thought, so I decided to swing my sword with ten levels of qi.\u201cDo you think you can pierce through this?\u201dThe whip continued to spin faster.Shak!The instant my sword collided with the whip, strange, metallic sounds of scrapping could be felt and heard. At the same time, the whip which was still rotating began to wind up and around the sword.Na Yuk-hyung was shocked\u201cOh?\u201dEven I was shocked!I was kind of stupid when it came to pushing past my limits, but as my body was enhanced to match up against this man, I was able to withstand the power of the whip.Yet, my foot still got pushed back more than one step.Although the gap was still smaller than before, Na Yuk-hyung still had the upper hand.\u2018Still, it is worth trying.\u2019At least it became possible to fight now. If there was too much of an overwhelming difference, there would be no way to push him out-Hurry Wonhui! Your body-enhancing techniques gave greater physical backdrops!\u2018I know.\u2019I could only maintain the True Blood Diamond Body for a short amount of time. And when it starts to wear off, my body would have to pay an equally painful toll.\u2018I need to unwind it.\u2019In order to unwind the whip from my sword and attack my opponent, I performed the sixth form of the Xing Ming sword.\u2018True Accelerating sword!\u2019I stepped forward firmly with a long stance to stab and pulled my hand back.The whip which had been wound tightly around my sword began to loosen as I began to rotate the sword, which made Na Yuk-hyung tighten it even more before I had the chance to free the sword.Pak!\u2018Shit!\u2019He seemed to be worried about me trying to get my sword free, and with his all, began to drag my body towards him. My body seemed to float a bit as I was drawn to him.\u201cCaught you, you bastard.\u201dHis hands were like the claws of a hawk, wanting to grab my heart.-Wonhui!I quickly drew my sword with my left hand and performed the Linking Dagger.Na Yuk-hyung\u2019s left hand, which began to move, had to halt to avoid the dagger that I had aimed at his wrist.Pak!He had to drop the dagger in hand at a stinging pain.Ah!At the pain which came in, he kicked Short Sword which fell to the side.\u201cYou really are nothing but a kid\u201dHe smiled a little and came for me again. It was then.Srik!Something flesh-colored began to come forward, a thin shiny thread shining in between. Shocked at how late he had noticed, he immediately moved to the side.Chak!At the same time, something brushed past his ear. It was Short Sword.\u2018Tch.\u2019Right after Short Sword was kicked aside I used the Silver Thread and tried to sneak attack him. Unfortunately, however, this attempt at taking him down failed.Touching his cut ear slightly, Na Yuk-hyung looked like he found this situation to be absurd.\u201cYou, what are you?\u201dThat is what I wanted to say. You are a fuckin monster.In that brief moment of movement, he managed to find the silver thread. I hurriedly continued to move.Pat!During that time, I was ready with the dagger in my left hand. This was my chance to see how well my practice had worked.\u201cHuh!\u201dAs I threw Short Sword out again, he tried to grab it again, to which I stretched out my arm to the side and pulled it back.Pak!As the path of Short Sword was broken twice, it moved in another direction as he turned his left thigh so as not to get hit.If I had taken more time to get used to this technique maybe the movements wouldn\u2019t have been this extreme, but for now, this felt like my limit.Na Yuk-hyung pulled his whip.\u2018This!\u2019Thanks to this, my hand which was still holding the sword was pulled and Short Sword deviated. I infused my qi into the silver thread and pulled it to make Short Sword swerve and aim for his back.Shrik!\u201cDid you think the same thing would work twice?\u201dNa Yuk-hyung quickly turned his body to avoid Short Sword and kicked it up. In that state, he smashed the thread.\u201cLet\u2019s break it!\u201dTing!\u2018\u2026?!\u2019His eyes widened.I felt so lost at the thought of it being broken, but despite his amazing internal qi, nothing happened to the thread.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an ordinary thread.\u201dNa Yuk-hyung was surprised by how strong this was. And soon he tried grabbing onto the thread and pulling on it.Thud!I didn\u2019t miss the chance to surrender myself to the pull.\u201cWhat?\u201dAnd as the distance grew closer, I pushed myself to stop and unleashed the attack of my sword again.Wheik!As the sword rotated, the half-wound whip began to remove itself and the sword rotated like a tornado straight for Na Yuk-hyung.Na Yuk-hyung who was ready to pull the string again hurriedly moved back and drew an oblique pattern from the right side.Pak!The whip was released and struck my right calf.\u201cKuak!\u201dIt felt as if my leg had been cut off, but thankfully, due to my body being enhanced for the moment no such thing came to pass.I clenched my teeth and continued my form.\u2018Insane!\u2019This man could change the techniques with a slight movement of his head. And I had to calculate everything.\u201cFinally caught you!\u201dWithout losing sight of me, he came to kick me in the chest with his foot.Puak!\u201cAck!\u201dMy body got thrown back in pain and my internal organs felt wounded. With the whip pulled back he was ready to attack me againAt that moment, I infused innate qi into the silver string.Puak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe silver string which was wound up had hit the guy in the back. As this all was happening in the fleeting moment with him concentrated on me, he couldn\u2019t avoid it.But the moment Short Sword struck him on the back, he had moved forward to decrease the damage,\u201cYou fucking bastard!\u201dHe pulled out Short Sword and threw it at me, making me lean back to avoid it.Pang!Short Sword which was caught in the silver string, stopped but as my leg and arms were pulled back thanks to this guy\u2019s reflexes, I had to rotate my body to release the accumulated force.Papapak!\u201cKuak!\u201dI barely landed on the floor as dizziness washed over me.\u201cHuk\u2026huk\u2026\u201dMy breathing was rough and my mouth was too dry to even gulp saliva.Gradually, the body enhancement technique was leaving my body.\u2018Shit.\u2019This man was clearly different from the other opponents I had met. Like a warrior who had reached the peak of growth, he was able to move according to any attack I made.His accumulated experience must have had a huge impact on this, and because of this, he was my most difficult opponent.Na Yuk-hyung smiled,\u201cSo there was a limit.\u201dBecause of my rough breathing, he must have noticed it. I widened the distance between us.It looked like he was dragging out the time to make sure my body had returned back to normal, this man was so meticulous.He smiled as he said,\u201cAre you really the disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman? The changes happening in your\u2026 body right now are the Ghastly Monster\u2019s technique.\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019He recognized the technique I had used and he was of the same generation as my teacher, making it easy for him to figure it out.As I chose to just breathe without saying anything, he narrowed his eyes,\u201cWho are you? How do you have the talent of the men who have disappeared?\u201d\u201cHahaha. I have no obligation to answer you. If you want to know then kneel down to me and maybe, just maybe I will consider it.\u201dI was provoking him on purpose. If I kept my distance and he continued to attack with the whip, I would be at a disadvantage.Na Yuk-hyung mumbled,\u201cHuh! It doesn\u2019t matter. After all, if I cut off your limbs then your mouth will open.\u201dHe was someone who wasn\u2019t afraid of using the evil methods of the Forces of Evil. I concentrated on my qi.If there was even the slightest disturbance, I would be hurt, and Na Yuk-hyung would definitely notice. But something distracted him for a moment,\u201cWhat is this now?\u201dHis gaze was on Sima Young and Cho Sung-won who were fighting with his subordinates.Over half of them were dead while he was fighting with me. I glanced at him to check his expression and noticed that Sima Young was back to killing enemies.Well, she was the daughter of the Evil Man, Sima Chak.Puak!When he saw his subordinates collapse, his expression began to distort, it looked like these were his cherished subordinates.Although it looked like he was angry from the gaze not leaving Sima Young, he turned to face me,\u201cYou had something to believe in.\u201dMaybe seeing her use her sword and killing his subordinates changed something, but this guy who was trying to drag out the time with me changed,\u201cTo use this against not even Ho Jong-dae but a kid like you.\u201dSwish! Swish!He began to rotate the whip he was holding, left and right. The whip began rotating in the shape of an infinity, gradually increasing in size and the whip which began to move faster began to touch the ground and rip it up.There was no gap in the whip to move past and attack, if I were even slightly pulled in I was sure to have a chunk of flesh ripped out.My hands and feet trembled as the fear of dying began to seep in. It would be a lie to say that I was not afraid of death just because I had already been through it once.At that moment, I heard Iron Sword say,-Wonhui. Did you say the memory was alright?At that moment a blue light flashed from the point on the back of my hand. My vision blurred and the scene ahead of me had changed.There was a younger-looking Na Yuk-hyung and he was doing the same attack as now.\u2018This\u2026\u2019-Concentrate\u2026As soon as he said that, a young guy sprinted ahead with terrifying speed. And that was the instant the match was decided.\u2018Ah!\u2019The scene in front of me restarted and Na Yuk-hyung was back to before he was using the trick. And Iron Sword said,-Be patient, Wonhwi.Noticing his intentions, I slightly focused on the memory. The current state of my body wasn\u2019t in a state capable of handling qi, but in this past memory, the confrontation between him and South Heavenly Swordsman, there was a way to win.Once, twice, thrice, four times, and five times\u201cCough.\u201dMy stomach twisted and blood gushed out. I had reached the limit, and my body enhancement technique had worn out.The vision scattered as I returned to reality. And I could see the whip turning with the man smiling.Seeing me coughing out blood he was sure of his victory,\u201cLet\u2019s kill you!\u201dWith the force of a storm, his body moved for me.My body felt like it was being thrown away from the pressure of it alone. It was much stronger than the memory I had seen 6 times in my head.\u2018Concentrate. I need to focus now.\u2019I continued to stare toward the middle. The thing was rotating, but that tiny gap was there.Pat!As if moving towards death, I moved for him. Raising my internal qi to its max, I thrust my sword toward the center of rotation without another thought.Papapak!\u201cKuaaaa!\u201dMy hand holding the sword shook violently as if the flesh was about to be ripped off. In that state, I clenched my teeth and moved forward.\u2018I used the accelerating sword.\u2019I had never attempted something like this before, but now I had the memory of how the South Heavenly Swordsman had used it like this after watching that scene six times.As the sword began to rotate in the opposite direction, a crack occurred in the flow of the whip, which was moving around like a typhoon.Papapak!The moment the sword was pushed ahead the frightening movement of the whip stopped.Na Yuk-hyung felt shocked. Did he maybe find the shadow of his old rival right now?And he smiled,\u201cDoes it make sense for me to not check that weakness?\u201dWith those words, he tried to rotate the right hand holding the whip in the other direction. At that moment I pulled my left-handPak!The whip of the guy who was trying to turn with him was stopped.\u201cKuak!\u201dIt felt like my left arm was being pulled out.\u201cUh?\u201dNa Yuk-hyung couldn\u2019t hide his shock as the whip stopped suddenly. The end of his whip was entwined with the silver string.As a result, my left arm felt dislocated because of the tremendous strength he was using to hold it.-Now is the time!Although it was painful, this was my only chance. With every little strength left in me, I thrust the sword into his one and only eye.Pat!\u201cKuak!\u201dNa Yuk-hyung, tired of seeing the same scene as in the past, let go of his hand holding the whip and moved back.It was that moment. My form, like a bird gliding over the air, caught him by surprise. And his eye grew bigger.\u201cT-this!\u201dFlustered by the technique which followed, he tried to raise his hand to stop the attack, but it was too late. My sword was already in his eye.Puak!\u201cAck!\u201dA scream that sounded like a groan and shock when the eye was pierced. I tried to pierce it more.Pat!But then he grabbed the sword which stuck to his eye.His hand holding the sword didn\u2019t even budge.\u201cKuaaak! You! You come with me!\u201dHe reached out his hand to my face. With my left arm already dislocated, I could not stop him any further.It was terrifying to know that he could probably rip my face off.It was then, chak!\u201cKuak!\u201dScreams.And his hand stopped right in front of my nose. His hand trembled, convulsed, and then immediately fell to the floor.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019As his hand that was blocking my sight fell, the stump at his neck began to spurt blood.After that, Sima Young was seen holding her sword, soaked in blood from head to toe.\u2018Ha!\u2019It appeared at an exquisite moment. Sima Young who was exhaling harshly, smiled broadly,\u201cI am not late.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Na Yuk-hyung (3)Sima Young was smiling broadlyShe seemed to be smiling brightly, but her heavy breathing told me how exhausted she was.Her body was covered with cuts and slashes all over. Again, it seemed unreasonable to go against the best disciples of such a person, much less all alone against twenty.It was tough, yet admirable. And she had managed to accomplish the task asked of her.-I really thought we were going to be done today\u2018Short Sword, can you even die?\u2019As I relaxed, I slumped to the floor.Tuk!\u201cKuak!With my body back to normal, the after-effects of the body enhancement techniques began to kick in, and my body was wracked with tormenting pain.Honestly, this wouldn\u2019t be hurting so bad for those who had the required body constitution.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dSima Young came over to support me. Looking at her when fighting gave me glimpses of the monster she had become under her father, but now she was back to being the super innocent one.I really know nothing about this girl.\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dAnd I heard another groaning voice, Cho Sung-won, who was limping from behind.\u2018His calf is cut.\u2019Seeing that he too had many wounds, he wasn\u2019t in his best condition either. If the fight had gone even a bit longer then we were ready to make this place our graves.\u201cDid you take down Na Yuk-hyung?\u201dCho Sung-won looked shocked. It is natural for him to react like this.In a way, the man I had just fought right now was from the same time as the South Heavenly Swordsman, and a thug. Defeating such a person in our current state was nothing short of a miracle.\u201cI was lucky.\u201dTo be honest, I had closed the gap as much as I could, yet there was still a gap between our strengths.I knew that he was a lot better than me, and was able to understand and counter any variables I tried to create.\u2018If I had no innate qi\u2026\u2019I wouldn\u2019t have been able to break him down.Watching the vision over and over again I saw how the man was defeated by the South Heavenly Swordsman.That monster was amused that I had figured out a way in those quick moments in the fight. If I had deviated a little from what I had seen, I would have died.\u2018Is this luck?\u2019I was glad to have survived.\u201cThank you, miss.\u201dI thanked Sima Young. At my thanks, she twirled her hair which stuck out, and smiled wildly.Was she feeling shy?\u201cAhm.\u201dCho Sung-won who noticed it coughed at me. His face looked like he wanted something back.\u201cRight. You did well.\u201dWith that, he smiled and chuckled. Even thinking about it made the situation funny.Such unfamiliar and dangerous fights and what they needed in return were compliments.And he changed the topic,\u201cEveryone will be surprised when they find out that Na Yuk-hyung is dead. Isn\u2019t he someone who was known to be as strong as our Elders?\u201dI shook my head as he was making a fuss over this. Surely the man was good, but this time I was sure of something.I wasn\u2019t sure how he ranked twenty years back, but right now, with the monsters around, he wasn\u2019t a match for them.\u2018Maybe only the First Sword of Mount Hyeong.\u2019It had been a while, but I had sparred with that man once. And Na Yuk-hyung was just a tiny bit superior to that man.-Just how strong is that crazy old man?\u2018Except for the 12 monsters who are known to be above the level of humans, I think these ones are all like beginners.\u2019-I agree.As Iron Sword agreed, I felt confident as I knew he had been with the South Heavenly Swordsman for a long time and had fought against the strong.Cho Sung-won was puzzled so I said,\u201cNo, don\u2019t say such none\u2026 kuak!\u201dThrob!My shoulder began to hurt as I talked. Seeing my shoulder looking droopy, Cho Sung-won approached me,\u201cYour shoulder is dislocated, I need to put it back in, will you be fine?\u201d\u201c\u2026 you know how to do that?\u201d\u201cThis is basic.\u201dWell, this man must have learned the essentials of martial arts considering he was from the Beggar\u2019s Union.At least when it came to the human body, he had a better understanding them me, so I nodded as he grabbed my elbow and shoulder and said,\u201cThis will hurt. One\u2026 two\u2026 three!\u201dHe pulled my moved shoulder to the inside.\u2018Ugh!\u2019Suddenly a sound came from my mouth, a groan. I had my bone put back once before too, but the pain was never easy to get used to.\u201cAre you ok?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was strange.I tried to tell him that I was alright, but it was so painful that I couldn\u2019t respond to him right away. I was only able to open my mouth after the pain had subsided.I told them both,\u201cPhew, we need to dispose of the bodies and then move to a safe place to heal.\u201dThe middle of the forest road being covered in dead bodies would only create problems, so hiding them was the right choice.We didn\u2019t have the luxury to handle any more people after this, so we would need to hide the bodies and then ourselves before we could heal our bodies back to normal.\u201cUgh.\u201dI tried to get myself up, but my affected body constantly collapsed with my muscles visibly twitching.\u201cDeputy commander, take a break. We will dispose of the bodies.\u201dSima Young advised me to wait.I felt sorry, as both of them didn\u2019t look to be in a good condition either, but I had to cultivate my qi, so I would be able to move a little more and not burden them further.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAh. Why bother with thanks between you and me!\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019You and me?When I looked at her wondering what she was talking about, she got excited as she ran for the corpses.I thought she was excited, but she looked fine? She surely was an unpredictable one.\u201cPhew.\u201dI had to cultivate to some extent, but staying here for too long was dangerous.I sat down and began to cultivate. As if my heart was on fire, warm energy spread through as my innate qi was being cultivated.\u2018Uh?\u2019But then something changed.After being able to make it flow in one direction, it stopped near the middle dantian.I knew that innate qi would grow a little more when a person was put in a life or death situation, but this was a bit surprising.\u2018Is this like growing as much as I suffered?\u2019This was really a unique one.I wasn\u2019t sure because it was a qi that had its concept built around the life of a person, and was needed for someone to live.It was nice, but I had to hurry. And I did the same thing twice.-\u2026\u2018\u2026?!\u2019I opened my eyes. The sound of metal was approaching fast.There was one, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was multiple people or just one with different weapons.\u2018Kuak.\u2019The opponent seems to be moving and hearing this sound meant that there were weapons.Seeing that he was also coming from Mangok-ri, he must be a warrior but I couldn\u2019t tell if this one was good or not.I groaned standing up despite barely being able to do it,\u201cEveryone!\u201dSima Young and Cho Sung-won who were moving the corpses turned to me,\u201cStop for a moment and walk away. Someone is coming\u2026\u201d\u201cDeputy commander!\u2019At that moment. Sima Young suddenly moved to me and I could tell why she acted like this. The sound was still approaching but someone else had arrived sooner than it.SwishAnd a sword was drawn.Chak!With the clash, my body was pushed back and when I turned my head, a middle-aged man with an angry face was standing behind me.This was my first time seeing him, and by looking at the long whip I could guess who he was.The disciple of Na Yuk-hyung. I heard that he had two treasured disciples and I thought they were dead, but maybe I was wrong.\u2018Ha\u2026 for real.\u2019There was one problem after another.\u201cYou bastards. How dare you do harm to my teacher!\u201dThis man looked enraged. It wasn\u2019t known who he was. But I knew that the two disciples of the man were known to be skilled and now we couldn\u2019t handle him.When I looked at Sima Young, her hands were shaking.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019She had also overexerted herself. We hadn\u2019t yet become accustomed to dealing with people stronger than us.So there was no way any of us had strength saved up.\u201cDamn it!\u201dA harsh sound came from the mouth of Cho Sung-won.A group of 20 people running behind this man followed.\u2018They were divided into two groups.\u2019Seeing this, I could make a clear guess. Na Yuk-hyung and his subordinates didn\u2019t know about the secret passage, but they just predicted where we would come from and divided them into two groups.They probably were in another place and came here. What do we do now?The middle-aged man who appeared to be the leader shouted,\u201cI will relieve my teacher\u2019s resentment which is suffering here by cutting you into five!\u201dThe eyes of the disciples showed clear anger and were staring at us. He noticed at once that we were all in bad shape.So, they could talk as such.If not, would they be reckless with those who were strong enough to kill their teacher and his group?Sh!I put my hand on my sheath. It cannot be.There was no way the enemies appeared when we were in the best conditions and looking at my trembling muscles he smiled,\u201cCan you even wield the sword properly with that body\u2026 Uh?\u201dAnd he stopped talking and looked somewhere with frowning eyes. It was towards the forest path we were heading down.I turned to see something that was running very fast toward us. What an amazing body was it to run like that. Who was it?\u201cStop them!\u201dThe fat man who came close shouted. Seeing this, the disciple shouted,\u201cEh. Pig. If you don\u2019t want to lose your life, do not interfere with the events of Murim and get lost\u201dDespite the warning, the fat man tumbled and approached us. As the fat man came, Sima Young tried to point her sword at the man to keep him at bay.But then the unexpected things came from the fat man\u2019s mouth,\u201cHa, you people, how dare you leave, and then cause trouble for me! Did you kill that man? Hahahah!\u201dLoud laughter. And my eyes widened as I heard this.\u2018This man\u2026\u2019On the other hand, the disciple looked like he wanted to kill the man,\u201cKill my teacher? How dare this pig!\u201dChak!The guy moved for the fat one. The whip with enough momentum to drown anything. But then the fat man just grabbed it.Pak!The disciple was stunned at what looked like the most ridiculous thing. But then it was a short-lived shock and he tried to retrieve it.Pak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe body of the disciple who was trying to retrieve the whip got dragged away to the side.The startled guy tried to spread his feet apart and attack him.Tak!\u201cKuak!\u201dThe fat man waited for the moment he would come and grabbed his arm and then the fat man broke it. Still, he was a warrior who was supposed to be strong and this fat man was supposed to be a nobody.Grab!The fat man grabbed him by the neck making the disciple even more shocked,\u201cKuak\u2026 kuak\u2026 Just\u2026 who are\u2026 you\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you aiming for my disciple?\u201d\u201cDisciple?\u201dIt was then. Changes began to occur in the fat man.Crack!The skeleton which looked like the actual body began to relocate by itself and grew. This was a phenomenon that happened when the body was shifting.As the body grew bigger, his upper body clothes began to get torn.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019The eyes of the disciple were shocked. What he thought of as flesh were muscles.Even the subordinates of the disciples who were all buffed up were shocked at this. A large muscular man ripped off his skin from behind his ears.The face which showed itself was Hae Ack-chun the Ghastly Monster.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019\u201cGhat\u2026 Ghastly\u2026 Monster!\u201dThe disciple\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cIt is too late to even know.\u201dGrab!Hae Ack-chun grabbed the man\u2019s head with his large hands and as if removing a cap from a bottle, he pulled it from the body.Crack!\u201cKuaaak!\u201dIn the end, the disciple who dreamt of getting revenge was feeling something terrifying.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201crunnnn!\u201dThe crowd, all startled by the death, tried to escape. But in front of them came masked men. Warriors of the Blood Sect\u201cW-what is this\u2026\u201dFlustered people were trying to move when Hae Ack-chun ordered the people,\u201cHuh! Kill them.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAs soon as the order fell, the masked men began to ravage them and Hae Ack-chun who gave the order looked me up and down as he said,\u201cYou had a hard time after leaving the house. You. Hehe.\u201dFor the first time, this laughter felt so pleasant.The early morning of the next dayA shabby manor to the northeast of Seokmun province.Another hideout of the Blood Sect. The twins, Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun, and Deputy Commander Ha Mun-chan and Lee Gyu were walking to the entrance of the manor.Song Jwa-baek was excited as he spoke to the deputy commander.\u201cHe probably hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201dIt was Song Jwa-baek who won the right to participate in the tournament in just three days\u2019 time. He naturally assumed that So Wonhui was late.This time, he was sure that his teacher would praise him.\u201cWho are you?\u201dThe gatekeepers of the manor blocked the entrance. Song Jwa-baek pointed his hand to the blue belt that he was wearing around the waist and pulled out a plaque.Shh!The gatekeeper quietly bowed and moved to the side,\u201cPlease enter.\u201dThe gatekeepers parted and the gate was opened.Song Jwa-baek who was about to enter the gate stopped and asked,\u201cDeputy So Wonhui hasn\u2019t come yet? Well, he should have come\u2026\u201d\u201cHe has arrived.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u2019Song Jwa-baek\u2019s smiling expression hardened and the gatekeeper spoke trying to hold the excitement in a whispering voice,\u201cThere is a riot in the parish right now.\u201d\u201cWhy, why?\u201d\u201cDeputy So Wonhui and the member who returned have taken down Na Yuk-hyung.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!!\u2019Upon hearing this, the face of Song Jwa-baek turned pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - Murim (1)To the southeast of Guizhou. There was a manor on the western outskirts.An emergency report had come into the parish hall of that manor.Baek Ryeon-ha, and the Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baek-ha, were seated in chairs, while the warriors of the Blood Sect were kneeling on one knee in front of the table, and Seo Kalma stood to the side of it.\u201cBoth the Ikyang So family and the Jonhang province Song family have handed their permissions down.\u201dThe faces of the three people who were trying to hide their anxiousness inside instantly relaxed. Had they failed the very first step, they would have been in deep trouble.\u201cGood.\u201d\u201cTruly.\u201dBut then the next report changed their mood,\u201cThere was a problem on the side of Deputy Commander So Wonhui.\u201d\u201cProblem? Of what kind?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to show it, but Baek Ryeon-ha was quite worried and at her questions, the warrior continued,\u201cAfter he took over as representative, the head of the Ikyang So family informed him that the Mangok-ri and Heuk Hyung-jong bar had been commissioned by the lord of the family, so the Deputy headed there to find details about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that was against the plan.\u201dThe Bloody Hand Witch, Han Baek-ha, said with a frown to which Seo Kalma defended him,\u201cIf it was a task commissioned to them, then it wouldn\u2019t be easy to miss what exactly was asked of them?\u201d\u201cContinue.\u201dIrrespective of their talks, Baek Ryeon-ha asked the man to continue his report,\u201cThe Deputy Commander found the place, but decided not to move further with the issue in that place, as it had to do with his time at the sect, but he encountered Warrior Na Yuk-hyung.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAt those words, all their expressions changed.Wasn\u2019t that man the most notorious man of the Forces of Evil?They knew that he was someone skilled enough to survive even after fighting with the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201cIf there was no special need to get in contact\u2026 was it a\u2026 fight?\u201dThe thought of the South Heavenly Swordsman passed through Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s mind.Now, So Wonhui was claiming to be a member of the Ikyang So family and a disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman to participate. Which meant he showed most of his cards.Baek Ryeon-ha stood up with eyes wide open,\u201c\u2026. And now?\u201dAn ominous thought flashed through her mind. She was worried that something had happened.Na Yuk-hyun was a warrior who could not be dealt with by anyone other than the Blood Star or the Elders. The warrior opened the box he pushed ahead, a box in which a head would fit,And everyone who saw what was in it looked shocked,\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cHa\u2026\u201dInside the wooden box was a pale head without eyes.Seo Kalma, who was acquainted with Na Yuk-hyung, couldn\u2019t even understand this,\u201cWhat happened? Hae hyung? Did that man intervene?\u201d\u201cNo. When Fourth Elder had arrived it was after the Deputy and the two warriors with him had already taken down the man, and his disciples were there.\u201d\u201cOh! Then they dealt with him alone?\u201dEven the Bloody Hand Witch who always put on an expressionless face to most things couldn\u2019t hide her shock.She wasn\u2019t sure how he did it, but the one thing she was sure of was that even she would fail in front of Na Yuk-hyung.Even if the three kids fought together, catching him would prove to be quite tough.\u201cHow the hell did you say that he was killed?\u201d\u201cWe were told that the Vice Commander had used a trick to deceive him. We were told that he could be killed because he was careless and that the Vice Commander risked his life by putting himself as the bait.\u201d\u201cHa! He threw himself as bait?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHan Baek-ha chuckled.She wondered how such a strong warrior was killed and when she heard that he had used himself as bait, this felt like something that went beyond simple guts.\u2018Young master So. You\u2026\u2019Baek Ryeon-ha bit her tongue as she slumped into the seat. It was fortunate that he was safe, but she didn\u2019t expect him to do this.\u2018No.\u2019Come to think of it, this man always exceeded their expectations. Quite a peculiar one. Then Seo Kalma spoke up,\u201cAnd the three are safe?\u201d\u201cIf Fourth Elder didn\u2019t arrive on time, he would have been in danger of injury, but he is safe now. Fourth Elder told us to inform you that the rest of the remaining time will be given to the Vice Commander to devote himself to recovery.\u201dTaking the rest of the time meant that the injuries that were accumulated weren\u2019t light, and Seo Kalma nodded as if he understood.And looking at the head they sent, they sighed,\u201cThey don\u2019t lose to nothing.\u201dThey were talking about their disciples.Even if they had been kidnapped, these kids were still raised with great care, and Baek Ryeon-ha was relieved.\u201cSure. If we are headed to the tournament, then they need to truly recover, the judgment of the Fourth Elder is correct.\u201d\u201cThank you, Miss.\u201dThe other warriors also nodded. Han Baek-ha who thought that the report was over told the warrior,\u201cIf the report is done then take\u2026\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet. Fourth Elder has asked me to deliver a\u2026 um\u2026\u201dHe was hesitating, so Baek Ryeon-ha asked him to spit it out,\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d\u201cSince the man, Na Yuk-hyung has been taken down, the Fourth Elder wants you to acknowledge the achievement and promote Vice Commander So Wonhwi to commander\u2026\u201dAt those words, the faces of the three turned pale. After a pause, Seo Kalma couldn\u2019t hold back his expression and grinned.As expected of the Ghastly Monster.Mount Anhui, late at night.There was an ordinary-sized manor. If one looked at the gate, the manor and the gatekeepers looked peaceful. However, if one opened the door and took just a few steps in, they would see how horrific it truly was inside.There were countless dead bodies, all with their limbs lopped off. A group of masked men draped in black were cleaning up the corpses.If one walked through the room with the dead bodies, it would lead to the main manor\u2019s hall, and there was a woman with a bamboo hat looking out the window.How many people needed to be killed for that bamboo to be dyed red?\u201cThe moon is bright. It is a perfect night to die, right?\u201dLooking out the window at the full moon, she turned to look at the middle-aged man with his knees bent.The middle-aged man shook his head in a hurry. At this, she smiled, raising her hand.And the masked man next to the middle-aged man unsheathed his sword and placed it next to the man\u2019s neck.The man had tears in his eyes.The woman moved closer and grabbed the man by his chin and pulled him closer.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Her eyes were shining red.The moment the middle-aged man saw this, his eyes widened and his body trembled.She was Baek Hye-hyang, the woman close to becoming the next sect leader.\u201cCan your skills even cover these eyes?\u201dAt those words, the man couldn\u2019t answer right away, making her fingers dig into his thighs.Puak!\u201cAckkk!\u201d\u201cYou can do it, right? No?\u201dThe middle-aged man nodded in pain, Baek Hye-hyang smiled and got up.\u201cIt would be great if you had cooperated already. We wouldn\u2019t have had to see blood on such a moonlit night.\u201dSeeing her like that, the middle-aged man turned stiff. The woman he saw was truly horrible. He had never seen anyone who could kill someone and smile this brightly.\u201cI will give you three days.\u201dWith those words, she finally left the room.One of the masked men approached her as she walked out. He was a person who could be assumed to be old from the fine lines around his eyes.\u201cHere already?\u201dAt her words, the masked man bowed his head and said,\u201cAll five managed to infiltrate.\u201dWhat did it mean to infiltrate? At those words, her red lips smiled and she mumbled,\u201cHow many are being inserted by Ryeon-ha?\u201dTo this, the masked man spoke in a sneering voice,\u201cThere won\u2019t be much anyway. Even if they managed to infiltrate they can never win. Do not worry. The sword will be brought to you.\u201d20 days had passed since that full moon.Wuhan City, Hubei province was considered the holy land of the Murim people.Now we have entered the beginning of Wuhan city.\u2018Long time no see.\u2019Before returning, this was my main stomping ground.It was a place where I had spent around eight years of my life as a spy, without knowing when I would be caught.-The atmosphere is different from Mangok-ri.Of course.This was the sanctuary of the Forces of Justice.Two of the Eight Great Warriors were protecting the Hubei province, so there were no sects of the Forces of Evil here.The sect leader of the Wudang sect, Jong Seon, and Baek Yang-muk, the leader of Murim Alliance.Two of the most powerful Eight Great Warriors were supporting the Murim Alliance.-Are there a lot of monsters in the Alliance?Short Sword seemed surprised.Right. Only in the Alliance, there were two of the Eight great Warriors.And that wasn\u2019t enough, they had joined hands with the Double-Sided Martial Forces, who had produced another two warriors, so the Blood Sect had no choice but to lose.-No, it is obvious that you will lose looking at the numerical advantage, right?Short Sword asked like she couldn\u2019t understand.To this, Iron Sword who knew about the circumstances of Murim answered in my stead,-At that time the Blood Demon was on the side of the Forces of Evil and was the closest to being the best in the world. And among the Six Elders and Twelve of the Blood Stars who supported him, one was one of the Five Great Evils. If it wasn\u2019t for the alliance, I know that they wouldn\u2019t have been far behind-Uh? Six Elders and Twelve Blood Stars?Ah, right.Before losing to the orthodox sects, the Blood Sect had 12 Blood Stars. Nearly half of them had died, and the others became present-day Elders and Blood Stars.And with the death of two of the Five Great Evils, and the emergence of one new Evil, the term Four Great Evils began to come into use-And they were still at a disadvantage? There are two of the Eight Great Warriors on the side of the Alliance. The Blood Sect has none.\u2018No. it isn\u2019t like that.\u2019I know that one of the Four Elders had entered the realm beyond humans. The person who hid the information from the Blood Sect would never come to me, a low-level spy.-Oh!I am guessing that it is the First Elder, but I wasn\u2019t sure. Unlike the Seven Blood Stars, there wasn\u2019t much difference between the others.In addition to this, a major incident occurs just six months later.-Incident?\u2018Because the Eight Great Warriors change\u2019Ten years before my return, two of the Eight changed. One of the fastest among them, was Jong seon, the sect leader of Wudang.-How does he die?He dies at the hands of the Ruthless Heart.What was more surprising was that he was to die within Wudang itself. As a result, it could be said that the power of the Blood Sect and the Murim Alliance were somewhat equal.Before my return, the power of both sides was almost balanced.-\u2026 Wonhui. According to what you said, the peaceful period so far is probably the eve before the storm.\u2018Right.\u2019The eve of the storm is right now.The abolition of the alliance between the Double-sided Martial Troops and the Murim Alliance and the death of the Wudang sect leader brings the time of chaos back.Of course, some events were happening much faster.\u201cOver there.\u201dHae Ack-chun, who was at the forefront, pointed to a cup with his hand.A small bug flew through the wind.The guest house we were staying in was on the outskirts of the Alliance region, and we had decided to make contact with our spies inside the Alliance.\u201cShit. Still hot.\u2019Hae Ack-chun wobbled as he moved to the guest house. He was probably feeling the worst headache as he had reduced his skeletal structure and covered his muscles with thick clothes.-It is hard for that crazy old man.Right.This was Wuhan city in midsummer and the heat was nothing less than boiling water. Originally this mission was to be given to Seo Kalma.The task was to wait outside the Murim Alliance, preparing for the last day of the tournament, and prepare an emergency route.Since Hae Ack-chun\u2019s body and clothing were too well known, Seo Kalma had to take over, but then this man was stubborn in wanting to take the role.\u201cPhew. Truly hot.\u201dWhen I looked to the side, even Cho Sung-won was drenched in sweat. It was because his face was covered in a human skin mask.The heat could be dissipated with cultivation. However, how many people can practice cultivation while walking around?Even Hae Ack-hun didn\u2019t bother doing it.-There is one, right beside you\u2018Uh?\u2019Looking to the left, it was Sima Young, who wasn\u2019t sweating a single drop despite also wearing a mask.When I looked at her she smiled.\u2018\u2026\u2019Well. Was it better to consume internal qi than be hot? Turns out, I hardly sweated.It wasn\u2019t because my body was protected from the head, I just normally didn\u2019t get too hot.-Because of your innate qi. My former owner used to say that the innate qi protects the body from any harm without the body being conscious of it.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Despite not being aware there were times when I would feel warm in cold areas.When I went to the guest house, my teacher and the twins took up seats and began to drink water.\u2018The seat\u2026\u2019It had to be a table for six people to sit at, but there was no space after three large people sat.If possible we had to take any wooden chairs which were empty, but the guest house was full.Even though this was outside Wuhan, there were a lot of visitors due to the tournament being announced.More than half of them were people of Murim. But none looked famous or strong.\u2018Umm.\u2019Rather, looking at the atmosphere it felt like we would have to stand until more chairs arrived. Hae Ack-chun was conscious of it and said,\u201cWe will be here, so you people go and find a place.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs I was about to answer came the voice of someone,\u201cThere is no other place, so if you are fine with it, why not let the young people join us?\u201dI looked at them and saw two people sitting under the awning a little further away.Of the two, an old man with gray hair and fine lines spoke to us.The old man was looking at us, a black cloth wrapped around the back of the one sitting ahead of him.Hae Ack-chun nodded and said,\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dAnd I went there with my people and tried to sit down.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019When I saw the man with his back to me, I became shocked.-What is it?Short sword asked.\u2018F- Flame Emperor Blade.\u2019-\u2026!!!The middle-aged man with strong impressions and thick eyebrows with a short beard.He is one of the Eight great Warriors of Forces of Justice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Murim Alliance (2)The Flame Emperor Great Blade.They were one of the Eight Great Warriors and one of the twelve known superhumans.It was said that he had reached the peak of the blade path, along with another man. Although he didn\u2019t side with any faction, he was famous for having a larger-than-life personality, a great man who never compromised with injustice.Who would have imagined that the great man I could only see from a distance before was right before me now?\u2018Why is he here?\u2019From what I knew this man wasn\u2019t interested in the slightest of any events in greater Murim. Even before regressing, I had never heard him doing such things.\u2018I am confused.\u2019One of the Eight Great Warriors was drinking alcohol, in a guest house, on the outskirts of Wuhan sitting under the awning.-Something doesn\u2019t seem right.I felt the same, unlike the old man who was sitting quietly across from him, covered in fine clothes, this man felt like he had just returned from a battlefield.I froze for a moment and stopped walking, and Jin Gyun who was leaning to drink looked at me.It felt like his gaze was looking past all the facades.His unimaginable intensity made me feel like I was stuck in the palms of his hands. It made me want to withdraw. Hesitating what to do, I tried to greet him.My opponent was a senior from Murim. Well, I had to.Then, the Flame King Jin Gyun raised his hand to stop me,\u201cHow did you know?\u201dHe recognized at my glance that I knew him. While the two behind me were puzzled.They didn\u2019t recognize this man. This was normal since Jin Gyun wasn\u2019t the kind to show his face to everyone, and he looked like the most ordinary warrior.On the other hand, Cho Sung-won seems to have recognized him as he was open to dealing with information.I looked at him for a way out, and he hardened as well,[Why?][\u2026 he is Flame Emperor Great Blade, Jin Gyun.]When I said this, even Sima Young couldn\u2019t hide her surprise. It was because it was her first time seeing someone as great as her father.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me? Young one.\u201dI hurriedly decided to speak out,\u201cI remember seeing Elder at a distance in the past.\u201dEven though he looked like this, I knew he was older than Hae Ack-chun. Those who have transcended have a different aging process.\u201cYou saw me?\u201dYes. I was sureThough it was in the future.\u201cThen how come I don\u2019t remember seeing you?\u201dMy heart pounded at his words.I said I saw him from a distance so I didn\u2019t think he would react like this. Was he doubting my identity?This was something that couldn\u2019t be ruled out. He was a warrior at this level, so he was probably capable of remembering every warrior even in this guest house.I couldn\u2019t even turn my head but I was conscious of everything.Hae Ack-chun was sitting a little further away.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Come to think of it, before I returned, this man, Jin Gyun, had cut off Hae Ack-chun\u2019s arm.This is about 5 years from now. Of course, I didn\u2019t believe that anymore.I knew such a thing had only happened because Hae Ack-chun had moved on his own. But was worried now,\u2018What will happen if he finds out now?\u2019Even the Flame Emperor Great Blade I knew was someone who didn\u2019t stand injustice, but he also didn\u2019t hate any of the unorthodox sects.If it had been so, he would have participated in the war.But knowing what was going to happen in the future, I was worried.[What is it?]At that moment, I heard Hae Ack-chun. He must have noticed how uncomfortable I was since I wasn\u2019t sitting down right away.Hae Ack-chun hadn\u2019t noticed this man yet. However, if I did something to bump them into each other, it would be the worst for this mission.[Nothing.]If said anything Hae Ack-chun would move. So I had to quickly say something to answer Jin Gyun and sit.\u2018Think. Think So Wonhui!\u2019Right then something flashed. An incident 5 years back.\u201cIt is natural for Senior not to remember me. I saw you at Dongting Lake, how could you remember me in such a crowd?\u201d\u201cDongting Lake?\u201dJin Gyun frowned. Five years ago the man came to the lake with his family.At that time, a group of people from an unorthodox sect had targeted his family, and this man annihilated them\u201cI also remember seeing you when I went out with my father.\u201d\u201cAnd your father\u2019s name, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cMy family name is So, and his name is Ik-heon.\u201dHearing that, the man in the fine clothing opened his mouth,\u201cHoo. You\u2019re from the Ikyang So family then? I didn\u2019t think you were from such a prestigious family.\u201dJin Gyun who heard this nodded his head. Thankfully Dongting Lake and Ikyang were close.I thought my head was sweating profusely all from thinking of a way out of this.\u201cI think I have misunderstood you. We thought that Young Man was a disciple of that old man with a strong appearance\u201dThe old man with a strong appearance huh? The place they looked over to was where Hae Ack-chun was sitting.Although there was a little distance, Hae Ack-chun was listening to the conversation we were having.\u201cAh\u2026 that person is an acquaintance with whom my father has a long relationship. Did you know he is called Diamond Body?\u201dI used the identity I had prepared in advance for Hae Ack-chun. In fact, he was someone who was expected to stand out somewhat.However, the name I had used would probably hurt this guy.\u201cI see.\u201dI didn\u2019t recognize the old man or understand Jin Gyun\u2019s look.Thank god.The more one knows the more disinterested one becomes, and the old man smiled broadly,\u201cHaha. Seeing that you have come all the way here, Young One must want to participate in the tournament.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was no reason to lie. And to my answer, the old said that it was nice,\u201cI think I can see a good match with this friend\u2019s grandchildren.\u201d\u2018Grandchildren?\u2019\u2018This friend\u2019 pointed to Jin Gyun. Wait, did it mean that his grandson was participating?My head started to hurt. It seemed like this part of the future had changed again.-Didn\u2019t you say he wasn\u2019t interested in such events?\u2018Yes.\u2019But I didn\u2019t understand why he was participating. Could it be that he was trying to establish a strong relationship with the Murim Alliance?And then someone walked out of the guest house. It was a tall young man with a pleasant appearance, and he had the same black clothes as Jin Gyun.\u2018\u2026Flame Blade.\u2019Perhaps he also had the same bizarrely bladed weapon as his father.The sword was short and the blade wide, and I knew that this was the kind of blade made for the user to comfortably use a specific technique.However, it was impossible to guess the level of Jin Gyun\u2019s grandson without seeing him in action.So I began to test him.\u2018\u2026 it isn\u2019t easy.\u2019I could feel that this guy was above most first-rate warriors. And if I hadn\u2019t opened my mid dantian point, it felt like I wouldn\u2019t have even been able to sense this much.\u2018Uh?\u2019However, the eyes of Jin Gyun\u2019s grandson were on Sima Young.He seemed to have sensed the qi coming from \u2018him\u2019. He had probably sensed that \u2018he\u2019 was of similar strength to him, so he might not be interested in seeing me, who was weaker than him.\u201cGrandfather. I paid the bills.\u201dWhen I was just wondering why he had come out, he answered my question.There were a lot of customers, so it seems like the servers were too busy, and they required patrons to head inside and pay themselves.\u201cBut these people?\u201dAt that, Jin Gyun glanced at me. It meant to introduce myself.And I took the initiative and spoke to him politely,\u201cI am So Wonhui, the third son of Ikyang So.\u201dHearing those words, the old man\u2019s smiling face looked a bit shocked. It was the same with Jin Gyun.Maybe it is because they had heard rumors about me being trash? Contrary to my expectations\u2026\u201cNo. Did Ikyang So send their third son to represent them? I thought you were the eldest son.\u201dUh?They didn\u2019t know?The old man seemed unaware of the rumors regarding me.-Maybe they weren\u2019t interested?I thought what Short Sword said might be true.I wasn\u2019t sure who the other old man was, but even Jin Gyun wasn\u2019t interested in me despite being from one of the strongest families.Even if he had heard it, he must have let it out through the other ear, and so Jin Gyun\u2019s grandson took the initiative.\u201cI am called Jin Young. I want to know about you.\u201dJin Gyun\u2019s grandson introduced himself as Jin Young and spoke to Sima Young.I was being treated like someone he didn\u2019t care about.He seemed to be the kind of person who didn\u2019t care about those who were weaker than him. He was more arrogant than I had thought.But there was something he didn\u2019t know,\u201cI am Ma Young.\u201dWithout looking at him, Sima Young bowed to the old man and Jin Gyun.She straight-up ignored him, making Jin Young frown.Sima Young never treated those who mistreated me with any sort of politeness. The old man smiled,\u201cHehehe. Such a witty young friend.\u201dJin Young, who understood the meaning of those words, bowed his head feeling embarrassed.He didn\u2019t make any eye contact with me till the end. If there was even a little bit of flexibility in his attitude he might have apologized.Jin Gyun put his finger into his glass, pulled it out, and flicked his finger lightly.At that moment, a drop of alcohol on his finger flew into Jin Yong\u2019s abdomen.Pang!\u201cKuak!\u201dJin Young grasped his stomach as if he was in pain.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019It was unbelievable to see.How profound was his qi to create such a shock in his grandson\u2019s body with just a drop of alcohol flicked from his finger?Jin Gyun said,\u201cUnlike my sin, I let my grandson have a bit more freedom, Disciple So. Please do not be offended.\u201d-Ugh. Disciplining.I didn\u2019t think I was important enough for him to put his hands on his own grandchildren.Jin Gyun turned his head and looked at Jin Young who looked uncomfortable as he hurriedly apologized,\u201cI was rude to Disciple So. Please forgive me.\u201dHe apologized but I could feel no sincerity from him. This was a show for his grandfatherShould I push him a little?Well, I waved my hands as if I didn\u2019t care about it,\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get your attention because I wasn\u2019t good enough, so I think it is the family\u2019s prestige that is undermined.\u201dJin Young\u2019s expression turned stiff at my words. At first glance, it sounded like a humble thing to say but it wasn\u2019t.And the expression of Jin Gyun contorted at this.Tak!Jin Gyun got up and spoke to Jin Young in a low voice,\u201cYou are smearing the face of this old man. Follow me. I will fix that habit of yours before you enter the tournament.\u201dJin Young\u2019s face had turned pale.This was fine.In this way, I could use his attitude to my advantage. Anger filled Jin Gyun and he strode away without even looking back.\u201cHuh, this friend.\u201dThe old man shook his head and said,\u201cYou said you are participating, so we will meet later. I wish you good results.\u201dWith those words, the old man hastily followed Jin Gyun and Jin Young looked at me with a half-angry and half-tired face.The old man who followed Jin Gyun tried to appease him,\u201cDo not say too much. Did your grandson do that on purpose? The friend that was standing behind the third son of the Ikyang So family was much more skilled, so he did it out of curiosity.\u201dJin Gyun shook his head at those words and said,\u201cThat is why I need to scold him more.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t know who to really watch out for.\u201dAt those words, the old man\u2019s expression contorted in confusion.Jin Gyun was displeased with his grandson\u2019s attitude, but he knew the child would have no rival.However, the third son of Ikyang So, whom he had met for the first time, was highly skilled, and he anticipated that they would meet.\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201dIn the eyes of the old man, the third son of the Ikyang So family was strong but that was all. He didn\u2019t seem like the one with a chance of winning.Jin Gyun said in a heavy voice,\u201cHe is an opponent my grandson might not be able to beat.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Murim Alliance (3)[I don\u2019t like him. Even if his old man is one of the Eight Great warriors or something, I don\u2019t like him.]Sima Young grumbled to me.Perhaps because she was the daughter of One of the Four Great Evils, Sima Chack, she didn\u2019t seem intimidated at all.On the other hand, Cho Sung-won looked like he had been through a storm.And the two vice commanders who followed the twins were simply amazed by Jin Gyun.At that moment, I heard Hae Ack-chun speak,[\u2026 who was that?]As I thought, he had noticed.Even if he was far away, he wasn\u2019t the kind of person who could have missed this.[The Flame Emperor Great Blade.][He doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal.]Said Hae Ack-chun, his voice rising. It wasn\u2019t fear, but it was a confidence that screamed \u2018I could win.\u2019[Unfortunate. If it wasn\u2019t this kind of situation I would have wanted a fight.]It was only expected that this man wanted to fight.[I apologize. We suddenly met\u2026][Huh. Enough. Your thoughts are too obvious. It must have been because you thought I would bump into him.]Listening to his tone, it felt like he knew my feelings.Even though he had the name Ghastly Monster, he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to fight at the heart of the orthodox sects.I thought this man was great.\u2018I feel embarrassed,\u2019-Why?I saw one of the twelve humans who were known to have transcended, and up close at that.When I thought of Hae Ack-chun in that fight, I felt scared. It was like being suppressed solely by the difference in skills.-There is no need to be embarrassed, Wonhui.Iron sword said to soothe me.\u2018Uh?\u2019-Even my former master who was stronger than you couldn\u2019t have come close to the Transcendent 12. Don\u2019t beat yourself up.He was right.This wasn\u2019t something I could rush into. However, it was necessary to learn about Hae Ack-chun, whose spirit would burn bright for victory, no matter who his opponent was.Soon Hae Ack-chun spoke up again,[He comes.]Did our contact arrive?When I turned to Hae Ack-chun, I saw a middle-aged man wearing a blade walk up to his table.Ah! The spy who was infiltrating the Murim Alliance.-Someone you know?Could I not know?A High-level spy, Do Young-hyun.One of the three most experienced spies. A spy skilled enough to have been on this job for nearly nine years.Around this time I was also sent in as a spy, I remember hearing a bit about the education system and the current state of the alliance.-He had been here longer than you.I understood it.But I also didn\u2019t work nine straight years here. Nine years as a spy was not easy. Among the many spies sent to the alliance, those who had lived more than nine years numbered less than ten.However, he remained without dying for ten years.[The end of a spy is decided. Do not expect too much.]\u2026 there is no hope. In any case, Do Young-hyun was needed for this mission. He was serving as a member of the guarding troops which were stationed on the outskirts of the Murim Alliance compound, so he was needed to help seize the sword.-Uh? He is passing by?As Short Sword said, the guy passed by the seat of Hae Ack-chun. There were people seemingly waiting for him, waving their hands at him.\u2018He is doing it properly.\u2019-He is?Unless it was a rare sight, how could one pretend to recognize this man in such a crowded space? This was probably one of the common stomping grounds of Do Young-hyun.-What are you even saying?Long-term spies have multiple contact points. These junctions are places that are included in the regular routine of the person, places where the spies would normally go with their \u2018colleagues.\u2019Because if he was alone, people would become suspicious. Perhaps those three men who were already there, were from the same troop as him and regulars too.\u2018Now he will look around.\u2019-Uh? For real?As I said, Do Young-hyun quickly looked around. At that moment I took a certain stance.Not just me, but Song Jwa-baek in the other awning struck the same stance,-Ah, this is the code. Who is on the mission?\u2018Right.\u2019I remember it all well.Meeting him directly, but only signaling who was on the mission.Names could be given, but that might lead to confusion. Do Young-hyun looked around naturally twice.Now it is done.-That works?\u2018It is the basic skill of a spy.\u2019One should be able to familiarize faces with only two or three scans. Even I could remember someone\u2019s face with two scans.Do Young-hyun, who now knew our faces, naturally touched his neck.Who was he signaling?Ah\u2026Song Hwa-baek was suddenly startled as he moved. If there was a spy master here, then they would have noticed right away.Even Hae Ack-chun was shocked.We got information from the contact point and moved to a village outside of the Murim Alliance backyard.Since the Murim Alliance was now flooding with many people coming and going, there were large villages orbiting the alliance.A guest house in one such village with three rooms was reserved in advance.Entering the rightmost room and tearing off the third wooden board under the bed, a book the size of a palm was hidden there.This was the current situation that the spy had created for us.The guard\u2019s shifts, most of which varied, were carefully and neatly recorded in this book.We had memorized the contents in half an hour. And then the book was burned.When everything was done, Hae Ack-chun told us,\u201cNow, only you people can head in. I will be outside the grounds until the day of the tournament. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHae Ack-chun couldn\u2019t enter the fort.As it was a Murim tournament many sects would gather here.There would be many people there who would have been able to recognize or discover Hae Ack-chu, especially the Wudang Sect leader.And such people had a way to figure out it was Hae Ack-chun even if he wore a mask.So he had decided to not enter the fort.We would be the only ones sneaking in.Once we moved in, our party was divided into two.Song Jwa-baek and I moved separately, each aiming to win this tournament.In the end, if both of us made it to the finals then Song Jwa-baek would concede.Tak!Hae Ack-chun unwrapped a cloth and placed it on the table.There were two sheaths in it. From the outside, they looked plain, but these swords were a little longer and thicker than normal swords, which were specially made and had a space inside to hide another sword\u201cYou need to know what to do.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, there is no need to remove this sheath from your body.\u201d\u201cWe will keep that in mind.\u201dI was handed the sheath which I replaced the former sheath I had been using for Iron Sword.-I feel like I am wearing ill-fitting clothes, WonhuiIt must be because there was an empty space inside. Now he could enjoy the extra space.And after a while, another guest would arrive.\u201cYou have about ten days, you know that you need to get the work done before that, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was something we had to do. Rust must be removed from the body of Iron Sword before the tournament begins.That way, everyone would be able to recognize Iron SwordTang!The sound of something knocking on iron echoed everywhere.The vibrant noise was filled with the sounds of bellows, the heat and smoke from iron being heated.I had come to forge street on the west side of town. The village outside the Murim Alliance compound was full of such things, since this place was crowded with warriors.Unlike other blacksmiths, there were many who specialized in weapons, but there was one I was looking for, who could handle the cold iron.The number of blacksmiths alone numbered more than forty, but if I went to a famous place they would keep me at the bottom of their waiting list, so I went to find a quiet place.-Can ]cold iron be handled in a quiet place?\u2018There is a place I can think of\u2026\u2019-There is?But I wasn\u2019t sure if it was here.-What are you talking about?Before returning, a great craftsman appeared on blacksmith street.He made his name as a sword craftsman for generations of ancestors, repairing the treasured sword, Vivid Silence, the sword of the Murim Alliance leader.Having repaired the weapon of one of the Eight Great Warriors, it was only natural to become famous.I remember hearing that it was a place that only acquaintances knew, but now anyone can go now, right?-But why does everyone look so busy?Right.The blacksmiths all around us seemed to be busy, probably because the tournament was right around the corner.It seemed that there were quite a few other people who were here to repair their weapons beside me.Before long, I found a shabby blacksmith in the far corner-Is it really the place?While the other forges were crowded with men, this one looked quite shabby. The common knocking sound couldn\u2019t even be heard from inside.And Iron Sword said,-My former master one said that the world is the same as nothing, so the higher one climbs, the less noticeable some things become.-What are you talking about now?-Aren\u2019t there a lot of places that look shabby yet have the most delicious food? The former master always found such places to eat.-Right, is there something your former master didn\u2019t know?-Ahem.Well, even if Iron Sword tried to spin it like that, it didn\u2019t change that this place was still shabby. First of all, I had to head in and meet the man to confirm, right?As I was about to go to the corner of the street, I heard something.-Please\u2026 please kill me-I cannot live like this-Melt me.Sounds of swords I had heard from before.Ah, right. At that time, the sword Baek Hye-hyang held was making this sound. The sword kept telling me that it wanted to die.And this was coming from the shabby forge. I moved quietly.Snore!As I went into the forge I could hear the sound of snores. In the front room was a man in his forties with a red face, holding a wine bottle, stretched out, and asleep.\u2018What?\u2019Broken pieces of iron were littered around the man.When I looked at the hammer next to the pieces of iron, it looked like he broke it.-\u2026The terrifying sound continued to come from further insideCurious, I moved in and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why such sounds were being made.And when I went in, I felt shocked.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019There were nearly a hundred cracked swords stuck in a place that looked like a burner. But the swords all had the same shape.-What are they?I mumbled,\u201cVivid Silence\u2026\u201dAll the broken swords looked similar.No, were they swords based on it? Were they all based on the sword of Baek Hyang-muk, the leader of the Murim Alliance?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - The Unexpected (1)Before heading from the Murim Alliance, Leader Baek Hyang-muk gave a speech just before we began.At the end of his speech he drew his sword to boost our morale, which was why I remembered what his sword had looked like.However, so many swords were here that shared the same shape. Even the distinctive circular pattern on the sword was present on all of them.-Please\u2026 kill me-I want you to break meSwords suffering from being struck repeatedly by a hammer. None of the swords were in good shape, and they were all on the verge of cracking or breaking. It could be said that these swords couldn\u2019t be used again.\u2018Why are they suffering so much?\u2019Iron Sword was the one who answered,-\u2026 I don\u2019t know for sure. But isn\u2019t the moment when they wish to die the moment when their value is gone?\u2018Value is gone? Like undermined?\u2019What was the value of a sword?First, it was a weapon.Even with curved swords, and many others, it could not be denied that swords were created with the purpose of killing enemies.If so, does it mean that they could not perform that role anymore?-If they are in such a bad state then they might not hear us right here. If you are curious, talk directly to them.I frowned at Short Sword\u2019s words. It was creepy to even hear them and she wants me to grab one?Honestly, if they were just ordinary swords, I would never even touch them, but there were swords modeled after the Martial First Sword, the one that belonged to one of the Eight Great Warriors.Finally deciding to face the music, I put my hand on one of the nearer swords,-KILL MEEEEEEE!Creepy!I could feel the goosebumps rise on my body. The scream that pierced through my head was filled with bitterness and anger but after holding it I realized the truth,\u2018\u2026 this was a new sword?\u2019Contrary to the overflowing emotions, the sword\u2019s ego felt weak.\u2018You! You!\u2019-Please\u2026 please break me.He wasn\u2019t even listening to what I had to say. Or maybe he didn\u2019t even hear me.As I started to become frustrated with the one babbling of his suffering, the star on the back of my hand began to shine blue.At the same time, my vision began to turn dull and something new came.The scene took place where I was standing now. It was hard to see anything, but it was dark outside, and the man who I saw drunk before was standing in the room.The sight of the sword, the memory of it was open.And so I looked at the figure holding the sword. The moment I saw the face I recognized it.\u2018Baek Hyang-muk!\u2019How could I ever forget his face? The leader of the alliance and the Martial First Sword.I thought one of his subordinates had commissioned the task but he had come here directly.[I will check it.]The craftsman nodded at his words.Baek Hyang-muk took his stance.\u2018Oh!\u2019My heart pounded as I saw this. This was a chance to see what technique he was using in person! Baek Hyang-muk blinked and the craftsman held out a black cloth he was previously holding.[Phew.]Baek Hyang-muk, who cleared his throat, began to move forward. A haze rose through the sword.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019Watching this covered me in goosebumps. The trajectory of the sword and the flow of energy were different.While coming to Wuhan I didn\u2019t take a day off to watch the skills of the South Heavenly Swordsman.The sword of Baek Hyang-muk was so perfect that it felt like South Heavenly Swordsman couldn\u2019t get close to it.\u2018This is a sword technique of\u2026\u2019The trajectory of the sword was shocking considering it reached its highest point. And the style of the swordsmanship, the Clear Vivid Great Sword truly deserved to be called the best in the world.\u2018Ha\u2026\u2019After seeing this sword technique I realized.There was still potential for further development of the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s technique. There was more room to make it stronger and more radiant too.This made me excited.[Nice.]After finishing the sword dance, a satisfied voice came from Baek Hyang-muk. The craftsman who covered the eyes with black cloth opened his mouth,[Is it not enough?][Not yet.]The craftsman who was about to open the cloth licked their dry lips\u2018What is not yet?\u2019I couldn\u2019t understand. This was such an excellent sword that managed to handle this technique.At that time, Baek Hyang-muk put two fingers on the sword blade and wiped it with another sword.-Kuaaaaak!The sword screamed in pain. The blade screamed enough for me to bleed.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019I wasn\u2019t sure what this was. The sword which had been intact was now bright red as if it was in pain.It was the moment when the sword was half stained.Jjjjlkkk!The sword cracked. At the same time, the color of the sword returned back to normal. This strange thing was shocking to me, but what really surprised me was the energy from him. This man was full of killing intent.It was as if he had a purpose to go after someone.[Huh!]Puak!As if the man changed, Baek Hyang-muk put the cracked sword into the ground and caught his breath after closing his eyes.After a while, the intense killing intent was cleared. And his energy was balanced once more.[Make it again.]With that, he left the forge and the man took the cloth off his eyes and looked at the cracking sword with a bitter face.And with that, the vision faded and I was back to reality.\u2018\u2026 it must have been so painful.\u2019I thought I knew why the sword was depressed. I didn\u2019t realize why he gave out such a potent killing intent, but it made it impossible for this sword to be remade.As soon as the sword was born it had been broken and put in a state of disuse so it was natural for it to be suffering.\u2018Do not feel down. There is nothing wrong with you.\u2019I said to comfort him, and the screaming stopped as he spoke with a childlike voice,-Thank youJajajak!As soon as it thanked me, the entire sword body cracked and the metal pieces of the sword fell to the ground and turned to powder.All that was left was the handle.-What is this?I don\u2019t know either. Why did the sword shatter into powder?I myself didn\u2019t know why the memory was suddenly visible to me either. This was something that happened because the star was activated.What followed was unknown to me, but at least the sword Baek Hyang-muk used was accurate.\u2018Ah\u2026!\u2019When the sword was engraved in my mind, something tickled within me, the feeling of finally touching something.This one time I couldn\u2019t figure it out. My gaze naturally turned to the other sword in the forge,\u2018Shall we see it one more time?\u2019If my prediction was right, it seems like the swords too had gone through the same process and had been cracked. Then wouldn\u2019t I be able to see the technique again?-Wonhui, look back\u2018Back?\u2019I turned back at the ushering of Iron Sword and came face to face with the craftsman staring at me with wide eyes. His red face told me he hadn\u2019t completely sobered up.\u2018This.\u2019Maybe I was a bit too focused so I didn\u2019t even notice the man waking up. Thinking that I was done, I decided to apologize to him\u2026But he ran to me first and said,\u201cA martial artist? You are a martial artist right?\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019The tone of his voice was unclear as he must have still been drunk.\u201cYes but\u2026\u201dBefore I could even speak the man touched the metal powder on the ground. The fine iron powder. He frowned at it.Doesn\u2019t this look like I turned the sword into powder on purpose?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I wanted to break\u2026\u201dThe man touched the sword handle and interrupted me.\u201cCan you break the other swords into powder?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dI was stunned at the moment I heard those words. I was too shocked about the man who wanted me to break his swords.\u201cI will pay you.\u201dI wasn\u2019t even sure why he was bringing up payment. If he wanted to break these swords couldn\u2019t he just dispose of them?And he explained,\u201cThese swords were things I made with my soul. But now they have turned to things that can no longer be used. Do you think I can break down the children I made with my hands?\u201dAh\u2026I think I could understand why he had placed incense burners around. To commemorate the broken ones he created with his heart.\u201cCan you do it? No? Just say so.\u201dThere was no reason for me to refuse. Even if it wasn\u2019t for this, I was aiming to look at their memories. And this wasn\u2019t a bad condition as I could look through them comfortably.\u201cI understand. But the swords\u2026\u201d\u201cI am sorry. Unless you are a client I will be declining the questions about the swords.\u201dBefore I could even ask, he refused to answer and this made me wonder just how strong Baek Hyang-muk had to be to make this man so tight-lipped.Pointing to his hand he said,\u201cLooking at you, you seem to be using swords, I can help you with your swords as payment. As you can see, I don\u2019t have money to pay you with\u201dThis wasn\u2019t my intention but it worked fine. Even if it wasn\u2019t like this, I was going to ask Iron Sword to be cleaned.I pulled out Iron Sword from his sheath.Srng!Seeing this, the man frowned. When he looked at it, it felt rusted and I pointed to something,\u201cIs it alright for the sheath to be bigger than the sword?\u201dHe immediately noticed,\u201cIt is fine. Rather it is this.\u201dI handed him Iron Sword and the man who received the sword looked at the rust. I wondered if he could handle it.\u201cCold iron\u2026\u201dContrary to my concerns he noticed the rusted part and found out what the sword was made of. When I took them to some blacksmiths earlier no one had noticed it.Indeed, this was the man who would eventually become known as one of the best later.\u201cHow could such a famous sword turn like this? Did you leave the sword in a damp place for several years?\u201dThe man seemed a bit upset. It was true that the sword was left in a cave for over 15 years.\u201c\u2026 there were certain circumstances for it. Can you clean it?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t that difficult. But when the iron is mixed in like this, the work will be difficult, so it might take five to six days.\u201dThat was enough.I had 10 days left, and I could look into these cracked swords for 5 days to come.I left Iron Sword to the man and left for the dorm I was staying in.I told Sima Young and Cho Sung-won that I would be there right away. It was all good that things were going well, but one thing bothered me.A sword body that turned red with the qi of Baek Hyang-muk.No matter how I looked at it, it didn\u2019t seem like something a man with such fame should do, it felt closer to him being on the evil side.\u2018What could it be?\u2019A moment of concern. And as I was leaving the forge the crowd stopped me.A young man with a small body wearing a black robe and bamboo hat.I could hear no weapon, so I just decided to move past the crowd, when the man tried to grab me by the wrist.\u2018What is this?\u2019I sneaked to the side and tried to avoid it.But this man seemed to be rather clever and tried to grab me again. It was difficult to stop him as his hands were too quick and in the end, I slapped it away.Tak!Two to three times our hands collided and as they did, the young man looked at me with shock and so did I.The qi of this young man was more than what I had imagined, maybe even surpassing mine.Papak!The young man changed what he was trying to grab from the wrist to my palm.And pulled me stronger.I felt like I could do nothing, so I increased my qi.But\u2013\u2018Huh?\u2019Chachka!The man dragged me to the side of a corner alley.It was an unbelievable force. When I saw only the exposed face they looked like someone my age, but I still didn\u2019t expect this much power.As I was still too shocked, a young voice came from his mouth.\u201cYou. You\u2019re alive?\u201d\u2018Baek Hye-hyang!\u2019Surprisingly, the voice belonged to one of the two candidates to be the sect leader of Blood Sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The Unexpected (2)If my ears weren\u2019t messing with me, then this voice belonged to Baek Hye-hyang. I was quite shocked.-What? That gumiho? Why is she here?I wanted to ask the same thing. In a way, the strongest candidate to be the next leader of the sect coming out was quite arrogant, even for her.\u2018Isn\u2019t she afraid?\u2019This was the land of the Forces of Justice. Although the Murim Alliance was strict, security had been heightened as the tournament approached, and the best warriors of the Forces of Justice had gathered here.And to infiltrate such a place meant to have a strong heart.\u201cYou recognize me?\u201d\u201cI heard your voice before, why wouldn\u2019t I recognize you, Miss Baek Hye-hyang?\u201d\u201cNow you even know my name.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang chuckled and smiled. Even though she had a human skin mask on, it was obvious she was smiling.\u201cI heard you fell into a valley, but you survived?\u201d\u201cI almost died because of that.\u201dHer words made me want to cry. I didn\u2019t even know how much she must hate me, to send me down to that ghastly man.Of course, the ghastly part hadn\u2019t been planned, and the worst didn\u2019t come to pass, so I somehow managed to escape.\u201cYou seem quite upset? But you are alive right?\u201d\u201cYou talk as if it was so easy.\u201dThis woman was shameless, she was nothing like Baek Ryeon-ha.\u201cAre you going to continue holding me like this?\u201dShe was still pushing me. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t shake her off at all.-Are you going to use the qi from your dantian?\u2018No.\u2019There was no need for that. This alley was sparsely populated, but the blacksmiths\u2019 shops were only a few steps away.It was crowded with people so why would she kill me? No matter how daring she is, she wouldn\u2019t jump in for a hasty move\u201cIf you have no intention to kill me, then let me go.\u201d\u201cYou got confident in the time I haven\u2019t seen you. Is it because your skills have improved?\u201dOf course, my martial arts had changed a lot from when I first met her. But my confidence came from the situation we were in.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be revealed here.\u201dI said turning to the side.What would happen if I give out her identity right here? Maybe she understood what I meant and she smiled,\u201cYou are interesting.\u201d\u2018Uh?\u2019I had threatened her, but instead of being angry, she was coming out strong. She had a more difficult personality than Hae Ack-chun.However unexpected words followed,\u201cA guy like you doesn\u2019t suit that child.\u201d\u2018That child?\u2019Was she talking about Baek Ryeon-ha?She looked at me and said,\u201cI will give you a chance.\u201d\u201c\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cCome under me\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dAt this unexpected offer, I was surprised. She must have learned that Hae Ack-chun had chosen to side with Baek Ryeon-ha, so what was this?\u201cI will let you use your abilities to the fullest. Your future will be bloody under them.\u201dShe wants to take me?It was a proposal worth considering, especially since there were no further incidents like the time I was pushed into the valley. Being on the edge wasn\u2019t a bad thing. But there was no guarantee that I wouldn\u2019t be eliminated once my use had come to pass.\u201cThank you for the offer, but my master doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI want you.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019What did this mean? She wants me and not the Ghastly Monster?I couldn\u2019t understand. There were numerous thoughts running through my mind.For example, it could be that she wanted to reach out to Hae Ack-chun and try to persuade him, but first wanted to bring me in and cause internal strife.I politely told her,\u201cI have a long list of things I am lacking, so I cannot be of help to you. And how can a disciple walk a different path from their teacher? Please take back\u2026\u2019It was at that moment. I felt a weird creepy feeling rise up.Pat!For a moment I tilted my head back when she moved so close to me. Had I been a little late, I was sure she was going to kill me with the small knife in the hand\u201cSee. You avoided it.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cI feel something different from you. I always thought it was weird.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cA guy who has only hit the wall to the master level notices my assassin weapon and avoids it?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019I couldn\u2019t say anything to this after knowing she was testing me.\u201cWhy do my senses say you are stronger than this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was a scary woman.I didn\u2019t even use the qi in my mid dantian, and she had noticed I was hiding my skills. Without using my innate qi she would have no way of knowing its existence, but being able to guess about its existence with this much was quite shocking.\u201cAre you on this level after learning martial arts for just a year? This is the first time I have seen someone grow so fast. Well, except for me.\u201d\u201cI think you are misunderstanding\u2026.\u201d\u201cI changed my mind.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang clicked her tongue with a strange expression as if she found her next meal.\u201cIf you are ready to be marked by me, it is likely that you will be the best aide for the sect leader.\u201d\u201c\u2026!!!\u201dWhat is this girl speaking of now? Do what? Looking at how confused I was, she smiled,\u201cI thought you would make a good guardian or something, but no. You are not inferior to being my husband either.\u201dWhat? What? This woman continued to utterly confuse me.-Wonhui. She really is a thousand-year-old gumiho, I am telling you. You will be eaten up like this.\u2018What do you mean!\u2019At Short Sword\u2019s words, I shouted.I didn\u2019t know much about any other women, but this was someone I could especially never guess what she was thinking. And then she slowly touched my cheek.As she said,\u201cWhat do you think? If you think about it, you will become the second most important person if you take the role I give you, be mine.\u201dIs she asking me to go under her skirt?She continued to stroke my cheek. However, there was one thing she had overlooked, she was currently wearing the mask of a man and I didn\u2019t feel even the least bit seduced by it.\u201cI will pretend I didn\u2019t hear this.\u201dHer eyes shone,\u201cWhy? Do you like Baek Ryeon-ha that much?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d\u201cYou would have more fun at night with me than her.\u201dI felt a shiver course through my body. Please don\u2019t say such things to a man\u2019s face!She giggled as she grabbed the skin under her ear and ripped it off revealing her face which I had seen a year back.She definitely shared some resemblance with Baek Ryeon-ha. If only her hair and eyes were different they would have looked like twins.She had splotchy hair while Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s hair only had a singular color.\u201cCan you really take your mask off here?\u201d\u201cI have plenty where they came from.\u201dI stuck out my tongue at her horrid words. Was it because no one knew her face that she was acting this bold?\u201cThere aren\u2019t many chances to be married to such an attractive woman, So Wonhui.\u201dThis was the first time I was in such a situation and it was burdensome to see a sect leader candidate act like this.Calling me a subordinate would have felt a lot better. And I decided the topic had to be changed.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dAt my words, she raised an eyebrow,\u201cI think the same reason as you.\u201d\u201cAnd you still have the time to do things like this with me?\u201dAt that, she chuckled,\u201cWell, the sword is going to come into my hands either way. You do not have to worry about that. What you should focus on is coming to my side.\u201d\u201cDo you think you could do that if I reveal your identity here?\u201dI decided to act more aggressively. In fact, this was something everyone was concerned with.Because even Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s side might reveal our side in the tournament.But Baek Ryeon-ha said that this wouldn\u2019t happen. Rather, we were aiming for the moment to just obtain the sword and escape. We wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish that task if we were too caught up with what the other side was doing.\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026 why so?\u201dShe smiled as she spread her hands,\u201cLooking at this, the child and I are destined to confront each other.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dShe raised her hands high,\u201cAnd if we do such things, we will end up being in the same position. Do you think that a kid like that and a smart one like you would simply reveal to all that the sect has internal conflicts?\u201d\u2018Ha!\u2019The same thing that Baek Ryeon-ha said.To not show the divide to others, and protect each other by not trying to reveal such a weakness. Exposing such a divide would make both sides large targets of the Murim Alliance.\u2018This won\u2019t work.\u2019She was too aware of the position of either side.If that was the case, then I had to make this work. So I spoke in a polite voice,\u201cThank you for the offer. Being Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s husband is an attractive position for me, but it is too much for my current self.\u201dI bowed. And she smiled,\u201cCurrent self huh? It means you aren\u2019t sure about the future then?\u201dThis woman was good at reading too much into things, and I had no intention of being her partner in bed.\u201cI am certain. I never let go of what I have set my eyes on.\u201dThis was what made such a difference between this woman and Baek Ryeon-ha, being so open with her desires.\u201cI wish I could take this as an exception.\u201d\u201cNo. I will force everything to have you. I like you even more now.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang clenched the hand she was holding, and quickly tried to close one of my blood points, so I blocked her hand.At that moment she decided to break my wrist.\u2018Ugh!\u2019Making me open up my middle dantian.And the innate qi soared up as her hand bounced back, making her eyes shine.\u201cI was right.\u201dRight. She had no intention of breaking my hand.But if I didn\u2019t do this I was sure to be dragged around by her.Pak!I drew Short Sword and aimed it at her wrist.Of course, I thought she would avoid it by letting go of my wrist but she just caught the blade with two fingers\u201cIf this is the level\u2026\u201dPak!Before she could finish speaking, I kicked her on the shoulder making her release Short Sword and block the kick.But she was still pushed to the side by three steps, and this was my only goal, to finally escape her grip.Tak!I unfolded my footwork technique to distance myself, and her lips twitched.Rather than feeling bad, it felt like she was riled up with excitement.\u201cYou are pretty good. Moderate hits aren\u2019t good against you.\u201dCreepy!A bloody red haze rose from her body and the intent to kill spread out around us. No matter how much in the back alley we were, there were still many people around!\u2018Damn it.\u2019This would be difficult.Why did this have to happen when Iron Sword was being cleaned?! Should I deal with her using Short Sword and a couple of assassin needles?Pat!Baek Hye-hyang narrowed the distance as if she was moving through the shadows. And it was then.Chak!A silver light flashed past my eyes and Baek Hye-hyang who was reaching out to me stopped a step back.And she looked at me with sharp eyes, no, she was looking at the person in front of me.\u2018Miss Sima?\u2019It was Sima Young.\u201cWho are you?\u201dSima Young asked Baek Hye-hyang as she leveled her sword. There was no laid-back feeling on her face.Was she nervous about the killing intent rising from Baek Hye-hyang?\u201cMove.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang spoke in a cold commanding voice. At this, Sima Young only took the proper stance and with the other hand calling the opponent she said,\u201cMake me.\u201d\u201cCheeky.\u201dWith that, Baek Hye-hyang came for Sima Young. The moment the two were about to collide I sprinted hardBang! Pak!Both of them bounced back\u201cStay still!\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dI wrapped my hand around Sima Young\u2019s waist and put my left hand on her back.The silver string was thrown in a straight line and tied to the pillar behind the blacksmith alley.In that state, I infused my innate qi.Swish\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Sima Young and I moved out of the alley with great speed. The crowd around us was so startled that they moved away.\u201cV-vice commander.\u201dSima Young grabbed my arm and blushed.I guess this was something to be a bit embarrassed about but my gaze didn\u2019t move from the alley.Baek Hye-hyang looked like this was all absurd as if she hadn\u2019t expected us to get out like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - The Unexpected (3)\u201cSo you just ran?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded my head in response to Hae Ack-chun\u2019s question.Fortunately, we were staying in the dorm and he was around so I could inform him about Baek Hye-hyang being here.Actually, she didn\u2019t just let me leave.As we were leaving, she sent me a message that gave me a horrifying feeling.[Even if you leave now, you will soon be under me.]\u2018\u2026?!\u2019It was confusing and shocking.But I couldn\u2019t simply convey those words to Hae Ack-chun. So I just let them know that she wanted me.And that it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cSo she is also aiming for it.\u201dThe problem was that she also wanted the Blood Demon Sword.\u201cWe knew.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue, probably because of her daring talk. This seemed like the worst variable.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026 if Lady Baek Hye-hyang is participating then it will be more difficult to win.\u201dAfter a brief fight with her, I knew. She was too strong for her age.Hae Ack-chun once told me that it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Baek Hye-hyang was so talented in martial arts that she was known to exceed the normal standards of geniuses.Hae Ack-chun who was fiddling with his beard said,\u201cThe Lady might not be coming out to spar.\u201d\u201cUH.\u201d\u201cHer pride will not allow her to compete at this point, this is a tournament run by the Forces of Justice.\u201dHearing that, it did make some sense.As Hae Ack-chun said, she was someone aiming to be the next sect leader. It wasn\u2019t appropriate for someone who aimed that high to be participating here and to be evaluated by people they didn\u2019t like.Even if her age was close to the contestants it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cAfter all, it will be a problem.\u201dHae Ack-chun clicked his tongue.She, too, was born from the Blood Demon so he couldn\u2019t hate her. But this made it more difficult to steal the Blood Demon Sword from her.Luckily, even if the Blood Demon Sword was taken, the other side would still have to deal with the problem of handling both the sword and taking Baek Hye-hyang back safely.\u201cWhat would you like to do?\u201dIt all came down to the same thing.Right now she looked determined to aim for me and all her plans could get taken down with the Blood Demon Sword being stolen.Hae Ack-chun who was thinking, finally came to a conclusion,\u201cChange of plans.\u201dOriginally, Hae Ack-chun was supposed to be waiting on the outskirts of the Alliance compound.However, the plan had been changed due to the variable called, \u201cBaek Hye-hyang.\u201dThey cannot simply go inside so they decided to wait outside. This was a given, since one didn\u2019t know when the situation might change.Hae Ack-chun made two requests,[If the lady aims for you again, do not delay and run right away or maybe shout. I will come there.]Hae Ack-chun decided that I could not face her with my strength. Of course, I couldn\u2019t deny that.Even when I opened my mid dantian I felt so intimidated by her killing intent.[When moving around, do so in three-person groups.]This was a bit inconvenient but he was right.It would be easier to deal with an enemy if we moved as three than if we moved independently. I was fine with Sima Young and Cho Sung-won following along, and they were already beside themselves with the boredom of waiting inside.I had to enter the forge to do my work, so they could just look around the village. The village was huge, so they could move wherever they wanted.The roasted duck I had yesterday was delicious so they could eat that too.Three days passed like that and Baek Hye-hyang hadn\u2019t appeared again. But none of us were careless.On the fourth day, I had turned seventy-five swords to powder, and seeing their memories, I comforted each one.Psss!More than seventy-five techniques.Now, I had a strong understanding of Bae Hyang-muk\u2019s technique, it was now deeply engraved within my mind, that I could even possibly use it.The unfortunate part was I wasn\u2019t sure how to use qi in tandem with this technique, but I could maybe perform half the technique.If I could grow a little higher, I would know how to manage my internal qi and perform it correctly. For now, this was my limit.\u2018Is this it?\u2019It wasn\u2019t right to overdo anything.One could practice in succession, and one might even see results, but they also end up with even greater exhaustion.As I looked at the other swords, I suddenly had a thought,\u2018I might be able to perform the sixth form of the Xing Ming Sword now, right?\u2019I had seen the memories of these swords more than seventy-five times now, I wasn\u2019t sure how many times I had seen these different yet same memories in these last four days, so I should have reached another awakening.\u2018\u2026 maybe I wasn\u2019t conscious of it.\u2019I felt ready enough.I closed my eyes and focused on my innate qi for a moment. And slowly I raised this qi to the fifth level\u2026\u201cPhew.\u201dBreathe in and out and lift the qi.Papak!At that moment, the wooden board under my feet cracked.This was called intimidation.Iron Sword told me that if I trained enough, then my qi could be formed into a sharp sword that could not be seen.I reached out with what I felt to be a form of qi and threw it at a wooden pole.Chak!A sharp scar formed on it as if a sword had cut through it.\u201cHuh!\u201dWithout realizing I smiled at this. I had finally touched the sixth level of qi.Taking a break, I continued to watch the sword dance of Baek Hyang-muk, and finally, enlightenment struck. It was a step into the Super Master Realm.\u2018Maybe it will be possible now.\u2019The seven forms of the Xing Ming sword techniques were known to only be possible at a higher level. Because it was a sword technique that needed one to ascend higher, it wasn\u2019t something I could perform when I wanted.I did think about trying it, but then I realized I would make the forge a mess.\u2018Ahhh.\u2019This felt so different. Finally, I had reached the level that Iron Sword had been struggling to teach me.And this was only the start. If I continued to train, then maybe, just maybe I could reach the level of the Iron Sword\u2019s former master.Dang!A knocking sound came from within the forge. As I crossed over the heated forge, a man hammering a sword could be seen. Iron Sword had his rust removed the day before, and the man was currently in the process of correcting his form.-Haa\u2026The sound of Iron Sword breathing heavily. He seemed to like it very much.-\u2026 brat, I like this too muchThat was all.Despite hearing such things for a long time, I still felt goosebumps rise. However, after this, Iron Sword would be reborn.Seeing the faint light shining from the red-hot sword, I knew it would be the most treasured sword.\u2018Will this be done tomorrow?\u2019One more day.After taking back Iron Sword tomorrow, I would have to enter the Murim Alliance compound. That was when my mission would start.Today\u2019s quota was met and I had made a couple of achievements, so now I need to meet with Sima Young and Cho Sung-won.Entering the guest house in the middle of the village showed just how popular it was with the number of bustling customers.From the entrance, the unique octagonal-sided house with meat all around stimulated the nose.I was already salivating.\u201cFinally we get to eat.\u201d\u201cThe dongpo pork!\u201d\u201cThey say that it is fine to die after having this!\u201d\u201cThen the vice commander will pick you up and take you home.\u201d\u201cEh. Then I will fall down in peace.\u201dWhether or not they had hunger pangs, Sima Young and Cho Sung-won were a match when it came to banter over food.The two of them looked excited as I moved in and a young server greeted us,\u201cAre you the ones who came 2 days ago?\u201dThe good-looking guy recognized us. He chuckled and gave us directions telling us to follow him.When we asked for a good place, he took us to a window seat with a view of the village.I gave him a coin. And his mouth smiled widely,\u201cThe other is Dongpo pork?\u201d\u201cYou can hear from their words.\u201dSima Young excitedly spoke.After the server went down we all watched the others who were eating. Even though it wasn\u2019t something we ordered, we felt satisfied watching them eat.And the dongpo pork was a disk of boiled and stir-fried pork which had an amazing texture over it.It was delicious and wouldn\u2019t one be happy seeing others enjoy it too?-WonhuiShort Sword called to me and I think I knew why.Five to six warriors had entered the guest house and they looked to be quite strong.It was easy to recognize them.\u2018Is it because of the two?\u2019-Yes.The moment I heard the metal sound of the two people with swords I could feel their strong presence.Since another constellation had opened up, my sense of swords had also gotten stronger and I could tell how great the sword was too.\u201cHmm.\u201dSima Young, who was also watching the others eat, turned away. She too had noticed them.Shortly after, six people climbed up to the second floor.\u2019Ah!I recognized them at a glance.The three men and women were people belonging to the Mount Hunan sect, and the other three were of the Sichuan Tang and Qingcheng sect.Somehow we had managed to find where they were staying before even joining the Murim Alliance.-It must be them.My eyes turned to the Qingcheng sect warriors. The swordsman from the Qingcheng sect had long drooping eyebrows and was called Chung Myung, and he was also called the First Sword.And then there was Hyun Jin, a warrior of the Jeonjin Sect who was known to be excellent when it came to control. And the swords these two people were holding were famous swords of their sects.\u2018As expected of the people on the side of justice.\u2019In my memory, these were pretty decent places, and like most members of these sects, they had no self-interest and would focus on training.But these good people had entered with other kinds of people.\u201cSo annoying.\u201d\u201cUh!\u201dAnd their seat was placed right next to us. Those three others, Do Il-chan, Jo Kang, and Kang Hye-so who So Jang-yoon was attached to.Of course, they were the ones who knew my title better than anyone else.Do Il-chan\u2019s older brother, Do Kyung-wook, came to our table,\u201cYah. Isn\u2019t this the trash of Yulang county?\u201dIt was more of a sarcastic remark than an actual greeting. Another man approached me too.-Guess they haven\u2019t heard the new rumors then?It seemed to be so, if not they would have had So Jang-yoon be the representative of their group. When I moved from the Ikyang So family, it was natural for them to know I was coming to Wuhan.Yet, it seemed like they pretended not to know,\u201cIt is nice to see you here. It has been so long, So.\u201dStill, the trash of Yulang county couldn\u2019t fight back.In the past he would have outright called me trash, but he couldn\u2019t do it this time, maybe because was conscious of the people that had come with him.\u201cIt seems like this is someone you know?\u201dTwo people had come up to talk to me, so Chung Myung of the Qingcheng sect asked in interest.At that one of them smiled,\u201cDo you remember what I had said before? The friend who got kicked from the Ikyang So family.\u201dAn audible whisper which made Sima Young\u2019s eyes change. Things would dissolve into a mess if she decided to act out, so I decided to intervene.\u201cAren\u2019t you disciple Chung Myung of the Qingcheng sect?\u201dChung Myung looked puzzled, and bowed,\u201cI am Chung Myung. Does the Young Master know me?\u201d\u201cHow can I not know you? It is more weird to not know about the divine-born disciple Chung Myung of the Qingcheng sect.\u201dIt was said that praises could make even whales fly.Chung Myung smiled at this and as I thought, he was a person with a kind heart.Chak!We greeted each other.\u201cI would also like to extend my greetings to disciples Hyun Jin and Tang Hyehwa of the Sichuan Tang family. I am So Wonhui, the third son of the Ikyang So family. It is an honor to meet such famous people.\u201dThe man and women were shocked at my words.\u201cYou are the young master of the Ikyang So family. I am Tang Hyehwa of the Tang family.\u201d\u201cI am Hyun Jin of the Jeonjin sect.\u201dThe importance of greetings. Recognizing the opponent first and greeting them could increase your impression on them.\u201cHow?\u201dWhat? Did you think I didn\u2019t know them? I know them a lot better than you.The expressions of Do Il-chan and Jo Ik changed. I guess they couldn\u2019t take the lead anymore.\u201cYulang\u2026\u201dUnable to stand it, Jo Ik tried to say something but then I patted him on the shoulder\u201cLong time no see, Jo hyung.\u201dI smiled as if I was happy to see him.And he tried to shake off my arm\u201cWhen were we this clo\u2026\u201dBut before he could shake off the hand, my wrist was around his neck and clenched.Kwak!\u2018\u2026!?\u2019Because of the qi I was using on his neck, his body went stiff. If he moved even a little in the wrong direction, his neck would break.His eyes trembled as he looked at me and I said,[Smile. I do not want your neck to be broken before the tournament.]Clench!As the strength was being clenched, he forced his lips to a smile. And I smiled back too\u201cIt is nice to see people from the east side coming this far.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - The Unexpected (4)Jo Ik had put on an awkward smile as I leaned on his shoulder. Do Kyung-wook\u2019s throat trembled. He was probably asking what was happening. But how would he be able to respond?The human neck was one of the more fragile areas of the body and, if put under pressure, would surely snap. Jo Ik found it difficult to speak, let alone send a message with his qi.[Ei. Do Kyung-wook.]Do Kyung-wook\u2019s eyes widened as I sent him a message. He must have been quite shocked that I had learned martial arts.But, having heard my message, unless they were an idiot, they would have noticed my strength.[How did you get internal\u2026][That\u2019s not for you to know. I will warn you. Stop thinking about making a fight happen with me. I no longer have a broken dantian.]His expression hardened at my warning.If he had the slightest bit of awareness, he would back down. If his pride took center stage, then they would probably do something foolish.Before that, I needed to ensure they could not act recklessly, at least. I smiled as I looked at Chung Myung, Hyun Jin, and Tang Hyehwa.\u201cIt is an honor to be able to participate in the tournament and to also be able to greet such esteemed people.\u201d\u201cYou are participating?\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t hide their shock at my words. Looking at their reaction, it seemed they had been told something about the Ikyang So family sending their eldest son as their representative.\u201cAh. You might not know. My older brothers are both ill, so I was asked to represent our family in their place.\u201dIf I said I had been elected rightfully, it would only bring more questions, and I was no longer the trash that everyone knew me as.\u201cSo Yong-hyun is ill?\u201dDo Kyung-wook looked at me, not understanding, and I said,\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to know. He is.\u201dWith that, I released my arm that was placed around Jo Ik\u2019s neck.He, who almost had his neck broken, stumbled back in fear as he understood the difference in our skill.\u201cYong-hyun is really not feeling well?\u201dKang Hye-so\u2019s older sister, Kang Hye-mi, asked me with a worried voice.She had been someone who naturally treated me with disrespect. I just nodded.\u201cRight. If you are worried, come visit us later, Child Hye.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShe couldn\u2019t say anything, though.-What is it?What?I had been despised, and I was told to treat her as my older sister and with the associated respect, but I decided I would only give her half-respect.I smiled as I said.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dHer cheeks trembled. She must be angry with me, but, well, I was older than her.She looked at me and spoke in a sarcastic voice.\u201cThat is quite sad. If Brother Yong-hyun had come, your family might have brought back good results, but you came.\u201dSo young and childish.She acted as if her judgment had been clouded by the painful news. The same feeling I had when dealing with my siblings returned since these people played a huge part in tormenting me.At that time, Sima Young, who was standing to the side, smiled brightly at this. Seeing this, Kang Hye-mi frowned.\u201cAre you laughing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt is fun seeing you evaluate my sahyung without knowing his skills.\u201dAt her words, Kang Hye-mi narrowed her eyes. On the other hand, Chung Myung, who was standing with Hyun Jin, felt embarrassed.As a member of a sect that solely concentrated on martial arts, they would naturally be skilled at estimating someone\u2019s skills, and Hyun Jin should be able to guess my skills to some extent.Kang Hye-mi trembled in anger and said to Do Kyung-wook.\u201cBrother Do.\u201d\u201cHye-mi.\u201d\u201cSince you are from the same eastern side, why not Brother Do teach a few lessons to this one?\u201d-She is also another fox.Short Sword clicked her tongue.She decided to hand over the task of fighting to Do Kyung-wook. However, he doesn\u2019t respond hastily.It was only natural.Being the Ikyang So family\u2019s representative meant that the head acknowledged me. He couldn\u2019t just come out and do anything he wanted.As he hesitated, Kang Hye-mi\u2019s throat trembled, making Do Kyung-wook\u2019s face visibly shocked.She must be pushing him with a silent message. Ah\u2026 come to think of it, these two were engaged.\u2018So annoying.\u2019It was annoying to spend all this emotion on these children. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I just pushed them down now? As I thought that\u2026\u201cSo sasuk!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to the stairs at the shout. There stood a young man wearing blue robes.-Wonhui, isn\u2019t he that one? The disciple of Mount Hyeong?Just as Short Sword said, the young man was the disciple of Moung Hyeong, Cho Jeong-un.I didn\u2019t expect him to be here. Did this mean the Mount Hyeong sect came here too?Yong-yong had to be here as well, then.\u201cSasuk?\u201dHearing this, Chung Myung became puzzled. Well, that was to be expected.No one standing there looked old enough to be called sasuk.However, he was referring to me. Since we had a bit of history back at my family home, the man had naturally started to call me sasuk.Hyun Jin, who recognized the man, greeted him.\u201cAren\u2019t you Disciple Seo Hyung of Mount Hyeong?\u201d\u201cHyun hyung! It has been so long.!\u201dThey seemed to recognize each other. This was somewhat expected because they both belonged to sects that used the blade.Tang Hye-hwa and Chung Myung followed the lead and also bowed. Hyun Jin then asked.\u201cBut who did hyung refer to here when you called for your sasuk?\u201d\u2018Oh.\u2019This was good.If they could make him give an answer, I wouldn\u2019t have to do anything troublesome. So I then looked at Seo Il-joo, Cho Jeong-un\u2019s actual name, and bowed.\u201cYou are here.\u201dSeo Il-joo waved his hand at my actions.\u201cSasuk, why are you doing this? Please speak freely. Teacher will yell at me if you do this.\u201dEveryone was shocked at how polite he was being to me. There were many sects, especially on the orthodox side, where hierarchy was important. Seo Il-joo referring to me by a higher hierarchical rank, shocked them.\u201cSeo hyung. Is this young man a direct family member?\u201cAh, you must not know.\u201dWith that, he turned towards me and asked permission with a gentle glance. I nodded my assent.He pointed to Sima Young, who was seated at the table, and said to Hyun Jin.\u201cSo sasuk and Ma sasuk are disciples of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019At those words, everyone, not just the six people there, in the guest house became silent.Well, even if they didn\u2019t look like it, people do always like to listen to other people\u2019s commotion.Once the South Heavenly Swordsman was mentioned, everyone lost their minds.\u201cSouth Heavenly Swordsman?\u201d\u201cHo Jong-dae\u2019s successor?\u201dThe entire floor became noisy as everyone talked with their mouths wide open.\u201cI-Is that true?\u201dI responded with the most humble expression I could muster to Chung Myung\u2019s question.\u201cI am lacking, but I did learn my martial arts from my teacher.\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201dChung Myung groaned. Hyun Jin\u2019s attitude quickly changed as he bowed his head.\u201cYou should have told us right away! If you are Seo sahyung\u2019s sasuk, then you are my sasuk as well. I almost committed the most horrible sin!\u201dAs expected of a Taoist sect, they valued manners above all.\u201cYou are a sasuk to me too!\u201dChung Myung also said this as he bowed his head. As expected of another Taoist sect disciple.In an instant, I was considered their close friend.\u201cThis is a bit embarrassing.\u201dThis had all been intentional, but I pretended to be slightly embarrassed.I then glanced at Kang Hye-mi, Do Kyung-wook, and Jo Ik.All of them were stunned as they stared at me. I gave them a smile in return.\u201cWhat were you saying earlier? Teach me what?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019My question caused a buzz to fill the air. Being the successor to the South Heavenly Swordsman was enough to cause havoc. Then these kids said that they would teach me something. Naturally, this caught the attention of everyone around us.They were unable to hide their shock as they said.\u201cWho will teach whom?\u201dEventually, they waved their hands while backing down.\u201cAhhh. I feel so full and satisfied.\u201dSima Young cutely patted her stomach as she came out of the inn. The Dongpo Pork was a delicious food worthy of the hype.I must say, it was excellent.Thanks to Mount Hyeong\u2019s Seo Il-joo, we avoided some troublesome moments during our meal.The three members from Mount Hunan probably felt a bit uncomfortable.\u201cI think we can ask for some to be packed. Should I bring it?\u201dSima Young agreed with Cho Sung-won\u2019s words.\u201cRight. Earlier, didn\u2019t Seo Il-joo also say he was going to get the pork packed!\u201dAs she said, Seo Il-joo had gone in to get some food packed. It seemed that the other members of his sect had gone straight to the castle.It was because they had been given lodgings inside. Yong-yong seemed to be there too.\u201cVice commander?\u201dThe two of them looked at me with pitiful eyes that made me smile.\u201cI will go and order!\u201dChon Sung-won ran back inside with excitement. As he entered, I suddenly thought it would be good to take some back for Hae Ack-chun and the twins.I asked Sima Young to add to the order, prompting her to re-enter the guest house.As she went in, a six-year-old child approached me.\u201cExcuse me. Have this.\u201d\u201cUh? Me?\u201dThe child handed me a small, folded piece of paper. Once she was done with the task, she then ran off somewhere.I looked at what was given to me.\u2018\u2026\u2019I couldn\u2019t understand what was written on it.[If you do not want to lose the sword, come alone to the forge without anyone else.]It was late at night, with few people left on the street.It could be said that they had deliberately aimed for a time like this.As I entered the forge, I could see the cooling furnace and hammers and tools lying on the side.I could feel a presence inside the place, more than one.\u201cCome in.\u201dAs I heard the voice, I went inside and saw the craftsman lying in the corner. Inside, a masked man was wearing a bamboo hat sitting inside.-WonhuiI could hear Iron Sword\u2019s voice in my head.The Iron Sword was in the masked man\u2019s hand.As its restoration was complete, the masked man was stroking an Iron Sword that looked beautiful now.\u201cSuch a good sword. Is this the famous treasured sword of the South Heavenly Swordsman?\u201dThe masked man asked this, to which I replied coldly.\u201cYou\u2026 what are you?\u201dAt my question, the masked man smiled and placed the Iron Sword on a wooden board next to him.He then folded his arms and spoke in an arrogant tone.\u201cI have come to deliver a message from the young lady.\u201d\u201cYoung lady?\u201dIt was then that I guessed that he was from Baek Hye-hyang.Since he wore a bamboo hat, it perhaps meant that he should be participating or had another mask covering his face.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cGive up on the tournament. If you go back now, Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s life will be spared once she surrenders.\u201dI was a bit taken aback by the words. This man, he must have looked down on me.So I took a stride forward.\u201cStop.\u201dThe masked man immediately placed Iron Sword on the floor by its tip. He then held the handle and pushed his leg on the blade.It felt like he was trying to bend him.\u201cYou do not want to lose your sword, right?\u201dNow he was threatening me with the sword. If I did not comply, then the sword would be broken.As the boy stared at me, I shook my head and laughed.\u201cWhat is this supposed to mean?\u201dI spoke to him in a low voice.\u201cThis isn\u2019t Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s message but yours, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019At this, the boy\u2019s eyes fluttered. I then stretched out my hand.The silver string moved like lightning and wrapped itself around Iron Sword.Chak!\u201cHuh!\u201dOnce I infused my innate qi into it, the silver string pulled my sword back into my hand.I then pointed the sword to the shocked-looking boy and asked.\u201cWhat about the sword?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - First Military Commander (1)-Wonhui\u2018Are you fine?\u2019-I am fine. It\u2019s not like I can be bent easily.As he said, the South Iron Sword wasn\u2019t bent at all. He wasn\u2019t just made of stiff iron but also had a slight elasticity.Swords that were referred to as treasured ones tend to be like this. However, it was still unpleasant to have someone threaten you with a sword as a hostage.\u201cWhat will you threaten me with this time?\u201dAt my words, the man stood up.\u201cI was told there is something like a trick on your body. What was that?\u201d\u2018He didn\u2019t see it.\u2019It seemed like he didn\u2019t even get a good look at the silver string. That must have been it.The masked man wasn\u2019t strong enough since I didn\u2019t even need to use my middle dantian to pull back the sword.The man then took a stance.\u201cYou should have just given up when I gave you a chance.\u201dPat!He then ran towards me with his fists aimed at my face. I stood still and just drew my sword diagonally across his fist.Tatak!He then used his footwork to dodge my slash and aimed for my side. His kick was aimed directly at me.But\u2026Papak!I shifted my body to the side and grabbed him by the neck.\u201cHuk!\u201dHe became shocked at this. I didn\u2019t care and simply threw him to the ground.Bang!\u201cKuak!\u201dAs soon as he hit the ground, he tried to make me lose my balance with his legs, but I countered with a stab to his ankle.As the sword went through his foot, he screamed, and I punched him in the chin.\u201cKuak!\u201dThe sound of his teeth smashing against each other was clear. His face and body trembled with the pain.Tatal!I removed his bamboo hat and mask after ensuring he couldn\u2019t move anymore. He had a face that seemed to be in his early twenties.\u201cHuman skin mask.\u201dThe face was injured, and the skin had crumbled a little.When I pulled it off, an ugly face full of scars became visible.\u201cWhat are you?\u201dLooking at his martial arts, he was around the level of a first-rate warrior. At least captain level.The man growled through the pain and his broken teeth.\u201cI\u2019d rather take another punch!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t answer the question despite knowing your position.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I told you to come alone? My men are\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish, a rumbling sound came from the entrance. Alongside the sound of something being dragged, Sima Young and Cho Sung-won entered.They were dragging along three masked men with them, all unconscious. Sima Young then said to me,\u201cThere were only three people, vice-commander.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201dAt her words, the boy looked shocked.This boy was an imbecile.Did he really think I would come alone just because he asked me to? Naturally, I would bring someone else to scout around if someone was acting suspicious. I thus asked these two to come along.But the number of people they had beaten seemed too little. Cho Sung-won pointed at one of the fallen ones.\u201cThese ones are first-rate warriors.\u2019I believed it.He thought bringing three first-rate warriors would have been enough to subdue me. Of course, if I was at the same level as them, I definitely would have been subdued.I then told the one I\u2019d subdued.\u201cWhich side are you from?\u201dIf he came with a human skin mask, he had to be participating in the tournament.Considering that we are around a similar age, I can\u2019t simply leave him. There was a high chance that he was a disciple of an Elder or a Blood Star.\u201cYou think I will tell? If you don\u2019t release me, the lady will\u2026\u201dSlap!Sima Young slapped him on the cheek. Her actions were always quicker than her words.\u201cAnswer what the vice commander asks.\u201d\u201cYou, how dare\u2026\u201dSlap!She added another slap. As the boy was raging with anger, Sima Young grabbed his hand.While I wondered what she would do next, she held on to his index finger and said.\u201cFrom now on, every time you don\u2019t answer, I will pull one nail out.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019His expression became twisted.\u201cD-do you think I will succumb to such threats?\u201dPull!\u201cKuak\u2026!\u201dI covered his mouth as Sima Young pulled out a nail.Threats and torture were necessary during certain instances, but she was always ready for them whenever it was needed.She suddenly was holding a nail.Cho Sung-won, who was standing behind us, turned his head.\u201cUgh\u2026 even if you do this to me, the lady will later\u2026\u201dPull!Sima Young pulled out his middle fingernail. Tears were flowing down his face now as he groaned in pain. Right, having your nails pulled out was the worst.\u201cAhhh. I am sorry. Her actions are faster than my words.\u201d\u201cUhhhh!\u201d\u201cNow, will you answer?The effect that this torture had was immense. His eyes moved around at an insane speed from the pain.I then take my hand off his mouth and ask.\u201cWhich side?\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026 Hahh\u2026second disciple of the Fifth Blood Star.\u201dThe Fifth Blood Star?Was he talking about Hwang Kwang?I heard that he was a warrior that excelled in close combat. However, as a low-level spy, I never once managed to get to meet him.\u201cBe honest, did Miss Baek Hye-hyang send you?\u201dAt this question, his eyes fluttered.I knew it wasn\u2019t her order because she told me she wanted me to warm her bed. However, it wasn\u2019t right for me to jump to conclusions.\u201cI don\u2019t hear an answer.\u201dSima Young began moving to remove another nail, scaring the boy into speaking.\u201cNo! The lady only asked me to watch you.\u201dThis was expected too.But only keeping an eye on me sounded strange.\u201cThen why did you make such a threat?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026 uhhh. I will speak, so stop pulling!\u201dSima Young was ready to pull another nail out if the reply was even a little late.\u201cThen speak.\u201d\u201cS-sahyung asked me to do it. The lady ordered no one to touch or kill you, so he sent me here.\u201d\u201cYour sahyung?\u201dI don\u2019t understand this.They were going against the orders of their leader, Baek Hye-hyang. Of course, these nonsensical threats would never work on us, and they had to do something to ensure getting the weapon from the tournament. However, this all seemed a bit too much.\u201cYou were aiming at our vice commander for that reason!?\u201dPull!Sima Young pulled out a nail again.\u201cKuak! I answered!\u201dI covered his mouth.No matter how painful it was, this boy was stupider than I expected. If he was the disciple of the Fifth Blood Star, he should have gritted his teeth instead of screaming.I then asked him.\u201cYou\u2026 actually know, right?\u201dThere was no way he wouldn\u2019t have known.He was someone who didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know him. There was no clear reason to come after me.\u201cNow your thumb is the only thing left.\u201dSima Young gave him her warning as he said.\u201cThe fact that the lady wanted you as her husband was overheard!\u201dSima Young\u2019s eyes became wide at those words. Ahhh, this was insane.I hadn\u2019t told anyone that Baek Hye-hyang had wanted this. Yet this man blurted it out just because he was afraid.\u201cVice commander\u2026 you didn\u2019t tell us everything.\u201dPull!\u201cKuaaak! W-why! Uhh!\u201dI covered his mouth again. This time she pulled out a nail even when it was no longer needed.\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t say anything because it was nonsense.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why, but I couldn\u2019t even look at her because I felt like I was making excuses.\u201cThis is why that woman came after the vice commander.\u201dClench!As Sima Young clenched her fist, the sound of bones being broken filled the air.Looking at her eyes, it looked like she would kill him right away if I left her alone. Sima Young then touched the man.\u201cEupo!\u201dThe guy twisted his body with a bewildered face.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dShe responded to my question with the coldest voice.\u201cThey are aiming for someone else\u2019s thing, so they must be killed.\u201d\u2018\u2026?\u2019What do you mean by someone else\u2019s thing? I became more perplexed at her voice as Iron Sword said to me.-It is the suffering caused by women.That only upsets me more! I held her wrist and pulled her away from the man. She responded by pouting.\u201cWhy? They are aiming for the vice commander!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to kill.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dSima Young didn\u2019t seem to understand those words.The boy, frightened by my words, managed to calm down a little.This wasn\u2019t something he could be relaxed about. I think I know some people in the sect.If we killed him now, all we would be doing was asking for his sahyung to come to look for vengeance.Inside a manor on the outskirts of the village.Baek Hye-hyang sat cross-legged while fanning her forehead.The expression on the faces of the four people in front of her wasn\u2019t that great.They were trembling as if they had committed a terrible sin.\u2018Why aren\u2019t we being helped?\u2019Someone lifted their head and looked at the young man standing in the back.He said that would fix the situation, but now that they had come here, he said nothing! The young man had clear eyes and white skin.He was Sang Hyun-myung, the first disciple of Hwang Kang.\u2018Tch\u2019He was annoyed that his plans had gone awry.He was the one who wanted the Fourth Elder\u2019s disciple to be killed.If that was the case, he also wanted to ask why the lady Baek Hya-hyang was being deceived by that man. Therefore, that man had to be killed.[Sahyung!]Sang Hyun-myung quietly turned.[Stay still. Saying anything will not help us.]Right.Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s anger was hard to handle, even for the First Blood Star. He might not even intervene in this scenario right now.Baek Hye-hyang got up from her chair and slowly walked before opening her lips while looking at the kneeling men.\u201cI told you to just watch.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do when the dog disobeys their owner?\u201d\u201c\u2026 kill.\u201d\u201cThen die.\u201dChak!She closed her hand that held the fan. At that moment, one of the three people\u2019s heads in front of her was cut.Blood gushed out of the neck stump, and the head had a terrified expression.\u201cM-My lady. It wasn\u2019t done on purpose. I just\u2026\u201dTak\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Someone grabbed the head of another of the three and twisted it to the back.\u201cKuak!\u201dHis neck broke, and the boy fell. It was Sang Hyun-myung who decided to kill one of his own.\u2018Shit.\u2019The last person was even more terrified now. One of the men who had been killed was his own sasuk!Shhh!At that moment, the tip of the fan touched Sang Hyun-myung\u2019s neck as she moved close and asked.\u201cWho gave you permission to kill?\u201dThud!Sang Hyun-myung immediately fell down to his knees and said.\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t enough to break the orders given, they were making excuses which felt insulting to\u2026\u201dPuak.\u201cAck!\u201dBefore he could even finish speaking, she kicked him in the face making him bleed from the nose, which looked broken.\u201cI am\u2026\u201dPuak!\u201cKuak!\u201dHe tried to get back up, but she kicked him in the chin again.Sang Hyun-myung fell in pain from his jaw being crushed as she pressed him down with the fan.\u201cDogs need to know how dogs act.\u201dThud!\u201cKuak!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t even iron, but when the fan pierced his chest, it felt like a sword was being pushed in.A little more, and he was sure to die.\u2018W-will I die?\u2019Sang Hyun-myung\u2019s eyes fluttered at the thought of him possibly dying.At that moment, the fan stopped.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the tournament, this wouldn\u2019t end here.\u201dWith those words, she snorted and stood back up. Being four of the five participants from their side had saved their lives.\u201cW-we will keep it in mind.\u201dSang Hyun-myung lowered his head to the ground. But his bowed face was as red as an asura.\u2018So Wonhui\u2026 the lady\u2019s chosen man should be me.\u2019His killing intent was fully directed at So Wonhui.A day passed.Now all of us were standing in front of the Murim Alliance\u2019s castle.Thousands of martial artists, sects, and clans were lined up.The number of people there seemed to have easily exceeded a thousand. If we included those who had arrived and taken to their rooms, the number would easily exceed thousands.Clans full of famous people were everywhere.There were many clans that used swords, blades, great swords, and many other weapons.The young man who had a mustache despite his age had to be Pang Woo-jin, the next head of the Nokhyun Palace.He was a man who was quite rough in my memory. A man filled with anger.If we move inside the castle, he will be there too, right?-Who?\u2018\u2026 Moyong Soo\u2019-Ah\u2026 the guy who helped kill you before coming back?Moyong Soo. Among those who were skilled, he was called the Twin Dragon.I knew that he would participate here. A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. If we move inside the castle, I might even see Baek Wei-hyang too, the fourth elder of the Murim AllianceEven now, when I think of them, something soared from the depths of my heart. The moment will come when I will see them again.My emotions began to rise.\u201cUh?\u201dAt that time, Sima Young saw something and let out a sound of excitement.The people of the Hubei Pang family.Unlike the others waiting in line, they were checked in right away by the castle\u2019s guards and sent inside.\u201cIsn\u2019t this discrimination?\u201dAt Sima Young\u2019s words, I just shrugged.Even within the Murim Alliance, there was differential treatment. There were five great families, and those with excellent fame would get the best treatment compared to normal groups and sects.\u201cIt is nothing. We must wait.\u201dSong Jwa-baek pretended to know what was happening and said to Sima Young.The Ikyang So and Jojo Song families also dominated the Hunan region, but their reputations were lacking compared to the Five Great Families. If one looked at the standards of the Murim Alliance, a family had to be within the middle to upper levels to be treated right.Unless the warrior was highly skilled, then it is unlikely they would pass easily.\u201cWe only need to wait an hour. In the meantime, I will talk to you, so you don\u2019t get bored.\u201dThat was true.Song Jwa-baek still liked Sima Young.On the other hand, he wasn\u2019t the type to talk to her for a long time either. Either way, she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201cHuh.\u201dPang Woo-jin of the Hubei Pang went in after a short amount of time. Some people saw that they were being given special treatment.\u201cSo cheap.\u201dShe said that while looking at Pang Woo-jin.One of the warriors that guarded the Hubei Pang family looked over to us and ran over.\u201cAren\u2019t you the Ikyang So family\u2019s young master and young master Ma Young?\u201dUh?How did they know us?\u201cYes, but.\u201dWhen we answered, the warriors bowed to us.\u201cMurim Alliance\u2019s warrior greets the descendants of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dThe buzz inevitably came.\u201cDescendant of the South Heavenly Swordsman?\u2019\u201cIs he that man?\u201dIn an instant, the eyes of everyone who were coming in all focused on Sima Young and me. Even the people of the Pang family who were being guided to the front stopped and looked at us. It was embarrassing to get so much attention.\u201cWe were ordered to let you pass immediately. I will guide you.\u201dAs the warrior called Po Mo called to us, some of the warriors handling the Hubei Pang family\u2019s luggage came over to help with ours.Sima Young, who had complained of unfair treatment, licked her lips. It seemed that she felt better after this treatment.\u201cUs too!\u201dSong Jwa-baek hurriedly tried to get on board by getting Po Mo\u2019s attention.\u201cYou must be?\u201d\u201cSong family\u2019s Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun.\u201dHe said their names while hoping for something, but the warrior simply shook his head.\u201cI apologize. But we didn\u2019t get any information about this. You will have to stand in line and come in later.\u201dAnd this made him go pale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - First Military Commander (2)\u201cWhy apologize for saying we should stay in line?\u201dSong Jwa-baek muttered this, but his expression didn\u2019t look that good.Actually, I thought I\u2019d just leave them there, but looking at their faces go pale, I felt bad and asked the warriors for a favor.The man looked flustered and said I didn\u2019t have permission for it. However, he still allowed them through the procedure before letting them through.-You should have left them to stand in line.I thought so too.As soon as we had passed the gate, the idiot had burst out laughing. I knew for sure that half the people there must have insulted him in their heads.There wasn\u2019t much difference between Song Jwa-baek and Pang Woo-jin.\u201cWow!\u201dAs we passed through the castle walls, Sima Young exclaimed loudly at seeing the large square that appeared in front of us.This was the place that was the Murim Alliance\u2019s pride, the Blue Sky Field.It was named after the spirit of the Forces of Justice, which strived toward purity. The tall buildings surrounding it were also spectacular.\u201cSo huge.\u201dThe Murim Alliance definitely paid a lot of attention to making the place seem majestic, starting from the shape of the land to the buildings around it.We were about to follow the guide when someone approached us.\u2018Uh?\u2019Pang Woo-jin? Despite his family not wanting him to, he still came over to us and struck up a conversation.\u201cHubei Pang Family\u2019s Pang Woo-jin.\u201dWhat was he up to?Still, he greeted us first. I returned his bow and responded.\u201cIkyang So\u2019s So Wonhwi.\u201dAfter hearing my response, he looked at both Sima Young and me before swiping his hair back in an attempt to look good.\u201cI heard you are the successor to guardian Ho Jong-dae. Let us have a good match.\u201dSuch lies.The people of his own family were covering their faces to pretend to avoid our gazes.I think I understood why he had no one around him.I\u2019ve seen quite a few people pretending to be this cool in the past, right?-He resembles Jwa-baek a lot.Just as Short Sword said.When I thought he resembled someone I\u2019d seen before, I also meant Song Jwa-baek.I wondered who would even react to such an action, but people still showed interest in our interaction.\u2018Ha.\u2019In some ways, he definitely had talent.Before my regression, he was a man who didn\u2019t shy from using me to give himself a higher level of fame.Song Jwa-baek then stepped forward.\u201cI am Song Jwa-baek from the Song family. I wish you well.\u201dIt was like looking at someone in front of a mirror.Song Jwa-baek was pretending to be some kind of deadly handsome man. These people would never get tired of receiving so much attention.However, Pang Woo-jin nodded with disinterest at Song Jwa-baek\u2019s greetings and left without even responding.This made Song Jwa-baek\u2019s expression look positively distorted.\u201c\u2026 fucking rude.\u201dHe grumbled in embarrassment and lowered his hands.Why did you have to intervene?I knew that living like that didn\u2019t leave a good aftertaste.\u201cSo cheap, just as I thought.\u201dSima Young mumbled, expressing her dislike of Pang Woo-jing.Inside this castle of the Murim Alliance, many warriors had been gathered for the tournament. Among them were many who had unique personalities.If it didn\u2019t end in an argument, it would inevitably devolve into a tiresome one-on-one fight.\u201cThis way.\u201dThe warrior who watched the exchange simply guided us to one of the wagons waiting in line. The Murim Alliance\u2019s domain was a bit too spacious after all.Once we got onto the wagon, we were moved to the castle\u2019s east side. Over one hundred guest houses could be seen there.This was where we would separate.We were let through right away. However, Song Jwa-baek and Song Woo-hyun\u2019s dorm was a guest house made for warriors, so they left first.On the other hand, we were guided to a place closer to a mansion located a bit further inside the complex.Was this perhaps a bit of special preference?Compared to the standard dorms, where hundreds of people were crammed into one large room, this building had spacious individual rooms.There was even a garden in the front. Fortunately, Song Jwa-baek had been left behind first; otherwise, he would have complained too much.\u201cThis is nice.\u201dSima Young couldn\u2019t hide her satisfaction. Who would not like such special treatment?As we unpacked, the warriors told us.\u201cI wonder if the two of you can spare us some time.\u201dOf course, I knew this would come. A superior must have put him up to this.\u201cMay I ask who?\u201d\u201cThe First Military Commander asked me to bring you.\u201dThe First Commander?Cho Sung-won and I were surprised at those words. Sima Young, who knew nothing, looked at us with a puzzled expression.The person who called for us was one of the three commanders of the Murim Alliance\u2019s so-called Military Commanders, Zhuge Won-myung.After the Alliance leader, he was the next real power.The thought of seeing such a person up close, something I didn\u2019t even dream of in my past life, made me nervous.The site of the Military Commander\u2019s hall was located near the main building of the Murim Alliance.His building was at the center.The building on the left belonged to Baek Wei-hyang, the third commander.The desire to see Baek Wei-hyang bubbled inside me like a volcano, but I didn\u2019t have time for that. Coincidentally, it was said that the three military divisions were currently absent due to a mission that was handed to them.-WonhwiAs I entered, Iron Sword called out to me.\u2018What is it?\u2019-There is a strong weapon inside.\u2018Strong weapon?\u2019I am not able to hear the voices of anything other than swords. However, if Iron Sword said it, it had to mean something.\u2018What is it?\u2019-Where did I feel it?He felt it?Couldn\u2019t it be Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s weapon? He was quite skilled, after all.-It seems like it is a blade.I became puzzled at Short Sword\u2019s words. Zhuge Won-myung had a reputation for being skilled in using Battle Fans.This meant that there was another guest inside. I wonder who it was?\u201cFollow me.\u201dSima Young and I followed the warrior inside the building. Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s office was located on the top floor of this three-story building.As we stood waiting, Iron Sword said.-Ah\u2026! I think I know!\u2018You think you know?\u2019-Right, it\u2019s the North Heavenly BladeThe North Heavenly Blade?Wait, I felt like I\u2019d heard about it before.In the meantime, the door to the office opened. At the top-most seat sat a middle-aged man in his mid-to-late fifties wearing a white robe.\u2018Zhuge Won-myung!\u2019He was Zhuge Won-myung.And there were two other people in the office.On his right side was a man wearing brown robes sitting on a sack beside the chair. However, there was something unusual about him. The man\u2019s right sleeve looked loose, meaning he was missing that arm.\u2018\u2026 there is no right arm!\u2019Only then did I realize his identity.-Who is it?\u2018The North Brave Blade Star\u2019The North Brave Blade Star, Kwak Hyung-jik.At one time, there was a saying that the South Heavenly Swordsman looked after the Southwest, and the North Brave Blade Star looked after the Northeast.However, unlike the South Heavenly Swordsman, who had gone missing, the North Brave Blade Star had lost his arm in a fight and retired from the front lines.If the weapon he was using was the North Heavenly Blade, then he had to be none other than Kwak Hyung-jik.But why was he here?-What? He wasn\u2019t here in the past?No.Before my return, this man had no ties with the Murim Alliance.Even his successor, whose name I remembered, had made a name for himself independent of the Murim Alliance.A blue-eyed young man then turned towards me. The man had small eyes, as if he was closing them, and seemed to be Jang Myung, disciple to Kwak Hyung-jik.\u201cCome in.\u201dWe bowed respectfully as we made our greeting.\u201cThird son of the Ikyang So family, So Wonhwi, greets the First Military Commander.\u201d\u201cMa Young greets the First Military Commander.\u201dSima Young followed my lead and greeted him as well. Zhuge Won-myung then regarded the two of us.And then said\u201cDisciple So, I apologize but can you show me the sword on your back?\u201dShow the sword? For some reason, it felt like he was asking me to prove my identity.Without hesitation, I drew the sword.Srng!While holding the hilt, I politely offered it to the two of them. Zhuge Won-myung then very lightly gestured toward Kwak Hyung-jik, who said.\u201cDisciple So. Bring the sword here.\u201dContrary to his name, his way of speaking was blunt. It was as if he had already decided that all of this was false.I then bowed to him and said.\u201cMy greetings might be late, but it is an honor to greet the great warrior Kwak Hyung-jik in person.\u201dHis eyes shone after hearing my greeting.Perhaps he thought that I wouldn\u2019t recognize him. Kwak Hyung-jik then looked at the sword he had received. We had only recently managed to get the rust off Iron Sword, so he looked brand new.\u201cAs I thought.\u201dHe nodded and returned the sword to me as he was done with his check. But then.\u201cJang Myung\u201dAt his words, the younger man stood up.He then took the North Heavenly Blade that Kwak Hyung-jik had placed next to the chair.Zhuge Won-myung then said to me, who was a bit puzzled.\u201cDo not be offended. Besides you, there have been other people who claimed to be that great man\u2019s disciple.\u201dCome to think of it, many of the people I had met as a disciple of the South Heavenly Sword had said the same thing. All of them had considered me a fake initially.\u201cAs you can see, this man had competed against Ho Jong-dae for years, so he would be able to judge you.\u201dHmm\u2026But was this necessary to prove myself? Wasn\u2019t showing the sword enough?From the looks of things, I would need to compete against Jang Myung. Zhuge Won-myung then smiled as he said.\u201cA confirmation as a swordsman to another. Will you please accept it?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cYou can both stand there.\u201dZhuge Won-myung pointed to a spot a bit further away from where he sat.This room was spacious enough to swing the sword, but I still couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to make me do.Zhuge Won-myung motioned for something, prompting the escort warrior behind him to come forward.It was a wooden box containing Go pieces.Kwak Hyung-jik held a handful of black and white pieces before placing them on the table as he said.\u201cFirst, Jang Myung will show you. Cut one hundred pieces. Disciple So should step aside.\u201dCut one hundred? As I backed away, the man flicked a Go piece from the table at high speed with just his finger.The Go pieces flew towards Jang Myung.Srng!Jang Myung had pulled out his sword and cut down the flying piece.How fast must Kwak Hyung-jik\u2019s fingers be moving, and how quickly could Jang Myung see to cut them down? They seemed to be quite accustomed to it.The cut pieces fell to the ground. And he wanted me to split exactly a hundred of them in half?Despite his movement with the blade, not one piece had been cut an extra time.After hitting thirty pieces, Kwang Hyung-jik stopped.\u201cDid you see that? Can you do it with the Xing Ming Sword technique?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201dNow I understood.This was the reason why they wanted me to do this. He wanted to compare me with his own disciple to show that he had achieved something.A test to prove that I, as the disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman, still aimed for the top and would protect my teacher\u2019s honor.\u201cPlease show us.\u201dJang Myung politely bowed, but his eyes were gleaming in joy.-Can you do it?\u2018Well.\u2019Frankly speaking, I\u2019ve never done something like this before.Cutting down Go pieces was not something people did for training. The man\u2019s way of handling the blade was also truly shocking.As I hesitated, Kwak Hyung-jik said.\u201cIf it is really hard, just show the sword technique.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d-Now he is taunting you.Kwak Hyung-jik was deliberately provoking me.He knew that the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s honor would be tarnished right here if I could not show at least this much.\u2018\u2026I feel like I need to show off a little.\u2019I stood still and drew a small circle on the ground.Kwak Hyung-jin asked.\u201cWhy did you draw a circle?\u201d\u201cI will do it without coming out from this.\u201dAt those words, both the teacher and disciple frowned.This was my counter to their taunts.Kwak Hyung-jik frowned but then smiled as he grabbed more Go pieces.\u201cLet\u2019s see if you can get it done. Black ones.\u201dBang!As soon as he said this, he randomly threw the Go pieces.The Go pieces that flew toward me reminded me of the Finger Snap Shorts. At that moment, I stood still and drew my sword.Srng!The moment I pulled my sword to the center, I felt my eyesight becoming enhanced as the pieces seemed to fly toward me slowly.A mixture of white and black pieces flew toward me as I moved my sword to the fore.I used the Loach Shaped Sword technique, which resembled a soft willow branch in its remarkable changes in trajectory, which was the most suited for cutting down these little things.The black pieces fell to the ground as the air filled with the sound of me cutting them in half.Kwak Hyung-jik\u2019s hand stopped, and Jang Myung looked at the soles of my feet.It was to make sure that I wasn\u2019t coming out of the circle.Chak!They didn\u2019t realize this wasn\u2019t difficult for me because the pieces appeared to move slowly in my eyes.As I hit around thirsty pieces.Kwak Hyung-jik stopped, and the floor was covered with the split halves of the black Go pieces. Naturally, my feet have yet to move out of the circle.\u201cTeacher, I will do it again.\u201dWhen I succeeded in doing this, Jang Myung expressed his desire for another chance.At this, the teacher shook his head with a frown. As his student moved to ask for a reason, Kwak Hyung-jin pointed his finger at the floor.\u201cDo you not realize?\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dI held out my left hand to Jang Myung, who didn\u2019t realize it yet. After seeing what was in it, his eyes became wide.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019In my left hand were fifteen white Go pieces. Not a single one of them had fallen to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - First Military Commander (3)Jang Myung looked surprised by the Go pieces in my left hand.Would this be enough proof of my victory?Kwak Hyung-jik\u2019s disciple, Jang Myung, was very talented, but I had just displayed a level of skill that was at least two steps above him. Kwak Hyung-jik frowned at this.\u201cGive me what\u2019s in your left hand.\u201dHe flicked another of the Go pieces with his finger.Chak!Since I held the Iron Sword in my right hand, I grabbed the Go pieces with my left hand and then gave them to him, making his eyes shine.\u201cYou know how to use your left hand.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat was a key difference between ordinary people and me. I have polished the skills of my left hand to use either my dagger or the silver string during times of crisis.His lips twitched at this. Was he unhappy that I was better than his disciple? But then he smiled.\u201cHo hyung taught his disciple quite well.\u201dHis words were as blunt as before. However, his tone was as if he remembered an old acquaintance.\u201cThere is no need to be ashamed since you aren\u2019t lacking too much.\u201dAt his master\u2019s words, Jang Myung bowed.\u201cSuch an amazing sword technique. So hyung must be the first to do this to the Go pieces. I am truly humbled that you could do this better than me.\u201dHis words contained genuine feelings, which probably meant that he accepted me to some extent.-Unlike someone.Short Sword\u2019s words reminded me of Jin Young, Jin Gyun\u2019s grandson, whom we met in the inn. That arrogant man who was drunk on his grandfather\u2019s fame.In contrast, this guy was a true gentleman.\u201cI am sorry for testing you here. I have been unintentionally disrespectful to you as I have often seen people use the name of my old friend.\u201dHe apologized, and I replied.\u201cNo. How could I blame Great Warrior Kwak, who is my teacher\u2019s acquaintance?\u201d\u201cAs expected of that man\u2019s disciple.\u201dKwak Hyung-jik nodded his head with a happy expression. Still, it was fortunate that the South Heavenly Swordsman\u2019s honor wasn\u2019t destroyed here.Along with Hae Ack-chun, South Heavenly Swordsman was my teacher too. How could I tarnish his name as his disciple?\u201cIt is a pity. When it came to nurturing the disciples, I thought I was ahead of that man.\u201dKwak Hyung-jik expressed his regret at his disciple\u2019s defeat in this impromptu contest.In truth, Jang Myung\u2019s skills would likely put him in the top five of people his same age. The only mismatch had been that I was his opponent.Jang Myung bowed his head and apologized.\u201cThis incompetent disciple has brought shame to the teacher.\u201d\u201cThere is no such thing as complete superiority over others. There is always something above, and we take it as a lesson to work on.\u201d\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201dThe conversation between the two was a typical example of a happy teacher and disciple. The teacher would likely have created an uproar if their relationship had been twisted.Well, this was expected.-What?\u2018He was trying to compare me to his disciple.\u2019He was the one who wanted to test me and placed his disciple into this mess. He must have wanted to know who between the two of them was better at nurturing their disciples.-North Brave Blade Star has often been compared with my former master. So more than anyone else, he considered my former master as his rival.As Iron Sword said, it was only natural to want any kind of victory over a rival. However, this was still an unfortunate sight.Both of them had been placed in the spotlight as the new generation of Eight Great Warriors or even their own level of greatness. However, both of them failed to cross that final wall.\u201cI should also apologize now.\u201dZhuge Won-myung got up from his chair and politely bowed to me.\u201cForgive me for acting rude because I wanted to check your real identities.\u201dActually, I was prepared for this.Claiming to be a disciple of the South Heavenly Swordsman, who had disappeared for sixteen years, was bound to bring about doubt. Moreover, all of the opponents were people who had information about him.So I had to be careful.\u201cI heard you showed up after missing for over a year. It is highly unlikely for a child who got kicked out of the family due to a broken dantian to come back as the successor to the disappeared South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dAt his words, I felt a little nervous. Again, this man could be holding some information.\u201cThe First Sword of Mount Hyeong has confirmed your identity. However, as a member of the Military, I had no choice but to personally assuage my doubts.\u201dSo he had already checked with Cho Jeung-eun. Well, this man wasn\u2019t the military head for no reason after all.It was fortunate that I met that man both at the inn and back in Ikyang So.\u201cNot at all. I think it is fortunate that the honor of my teacher isn\u2019t damaged along with the doubts being resolved.\u201d\u201cThank you for taking it like this.\u201dWith those words, Zhuge Won-myung turned to Sima Young.As expected, such a meticulous person. He wasn\u2019t letting anyone pass by without a thorough check. Information about me was well disseminated and easy to find.However, Sima Young was different. She was wearing a mask on top of not using her real name.\u201cI am Ma Young.\u201dAfter confirming with me through a glance, she introduced herself.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t too rude, can I ask how disciple So ended up becoming a disciple of Ho Jong-dae?\u201d\u201cI lived near the Aileo Mountains, Yunnan province, and naturally formed a connection.\u201dI had prepared for this too. Many herbalists lived near the Aileo mountains.It would be difficult to understand who of them I had been in contact with as the place was full of people. Add to that, it was also the hometown of the South Heavenly Swordsman, so they could do nothing.\u201cHmm. I see.\u201dZhuge Won-myung looked a bit skeptical at this explanation.\u201cWhen the teacher suffered from his sickly body, this disciple had suffered too much, and he accepted me then.\u201d\u201cThe South Heavenly Swordsman is ill?\u201dThis was a topic that was worthy of changing the discussion. Zhuge Won-myung showed clear interest.\u201cHe is better now, so there is no need to worry.\u201dHowever, when he heard of that man feeling ill, Zhuge Won-myung turned towards Kwak Hyung-jik instead of me.Their throats trembled as they sent messages. When I looked at him curiously, he turned to me and said in a dismissive tone.\u201cHuhuhu. Look at my brain. I have guests, and I didn\u2019t even serve tea, such a bad-mannered person. Please sit down.\u201dZhuge Won-myung pointed to the empty seat with his hand. It was opposite Kwak Hyung-jik.As Sima Young and I sat down, the servants came to serve the tea that they had prepared outside. Seeing the hot steam coming up, it seemed like they predicted how long the talks would be.\u2018Hmm.\u2019I suddenly wondered.Kwak Hyung-jik had no connection with the Murim Alliance before my death in my past life. Therefore, it would be impossible for him to have come here in such a short time to confirm my identity.-Why? What else has changed now?\u2018Well\u2026\u2019He had no reason to be here if there had been no other change. Besides, I don\u2019t think bringing in a disciple would even be necessary.Zhuge Won-myung motioned for his servants, guards, and everyone else to leave the office. As they left, he looked at me and said.\u201cYou must be wondering why they were asked to leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026 it has to be something that no one else can listen to.\u201dAfter hearing my words, he smiled brightly.\u201cYes. From now comes the story no one should listen to.\u201dThese words filled me with complicated feelings. He would be telling me something that no one should hear.I could understand wanting to verify my identity, but what reason would there be for even telling me anything remotely secret? At our first meeting at that?[Vice commander. Will this be fine? Wouldn\u2019t it be a hindrance to our mission?]There was some truth to Sima Young\u2019s question. So I got up from my seat and bowed.\u201cI apologize. If it is such a burdensome story, then I do not want to listen\u2026\u201d\u201cI do not mean to burden you. And how about hearing the story first? You can freely walk out if it has nothing to do with you.\u201dWhat the hell was he trying to say? This was not within anything I had ever expected.Then, as if to push me further into listening, Kwak Hyung-jik added.\u201cIt might have something to do with your teacher. You can leave if you want to, though.\u201dThe South Heavenly Swordsman? These words made me pause.They would be suspicious of me if I acted like I didn\u2019t care.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019So this is what they were doing. They were planning to use me by using my teacher\u2019s name.\u201cAlright.\u201dI sat back down.If something I shouldn\u2019t be involved in came up, I would not hesitate to get up and leave. As soon as I sat down, the two men exchanged glances and asked me.\u201cHave you ever heard from your teacher about his duel with a man with a golden eye?\u201d\u2018\u2026!?\u2019This was a completely unexpected question. I had forgotten for a while but knew of the man they mentioned.-WonhwiIron Sword called out to me. It was only natural.Wasn\u2019t he the mysterious man who drove his previous master to death? I felt troubled.It seemed these two knew something and wanted me to share information with them?-We have no information either way.Like Short Sword said, we didn\u2019t know much. Even Iron Sword only remembered the man\u2019s golden eye.The problem was that I could not tell them of his death.-Wonhwi\u2026 you don\u2019t have to be here just because you are conscious of me. I don\u2019t want you, my current master, to be associated with that dangerous person.Iron Sword\u2019s words warmed my heart. I now think of these people and swords as my family and understand that they cared about me.However, after thinking about it for a moment, I spoke.\u201c\u2026 I heard about it from my teacher.\u201d\u201cAs I thought!\u201dAt this confirmation, Kwak Hyung-jik showed a strong reaction. Zhuge Won-myung reached out his hand to calm him down.\u201cIs it something to do with your teacher\u2019s illness?\u201dFrom this, I could guess that the two were concerned about my teacher\u2019s health. From here, then, I spotted a place to fit a new lie.\u201cYes.\u201dThis confirmation made Zhuge Won-myung sigh.\u201cThen it is the same case as it was with the North Brave Blade Star.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dAt my question, the man slipped the stump of his arm out of his baggy right sleeve and said with a heavy voice.\u201cHe made my arm like this.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dWas it due to a confrontation with the man with the golden eye? I had thought that it was strange that how he lost his arm wasn\u2019t publicly known.\u201cHas your teacher been looking for him?\u201d\u2018\u2026this man disappeared from the limelight of the murim because he lost his arm to the man with the golden eye.\u2019I could guess the intention behind his question. Unfortunately, the South Heavenly Swordsman lost his life after his own duel.\u201cNo.\u201dHearing my words, Kwak Hyung-jik frowned.\u201cDid he simply accept the outcome?\u201dIt didn\u2019t look like he knew at all.Well, how could he survive that fight? Hearing the account of the battle from Iron Sword, I was sure that the man with the golden eye didn\u2019t have enough compassion to leave an opponent alive.\u201cDidn\u2019t your teacher say anything else about him?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNot even a little?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dHearing my words, both men\u2019s faces became stiff. Zhuge Won-myung then nodded his head as if he understood that there was nothing left to do.They wanted clues from me? But what could I even do here?Even Iron Sword, who had been with the man in question, could remember nothing.\u201cMay I ask why you are doing this?\u201dAt my question, Zhuge Won-myung stroked his beard.\u201cWhat I am telling you now is a confidential matter that only elders or those higher in rank know about. I am only telling you as you are related to your teacher, so keep this a secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand.\u201dIf it was a secret, then it was likely to be of help to me. After hearing my words, Zhuge Won-myung opened his lips and spoke with a heavy voice.\u201cIt seems like the Blood Sect will rise again.\u201d\u2018\u2026U\u2026h\u2026?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - First Military Commander (4)\u201cIt seems like the Blood Sect will rise soon.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019I became speechless when I heard the name Blood Sect being said here. I wasn\u2019t sure how to react to this.-I am more surprised that they have spies in the Blood Sect.Short Sword mumbled.She wasn\u2019t joking either. Zhuge Won-myung then spoke as if he felt sorry for me.\u201cI know it must be a huge shock. And this is the truth.\u201d\u2018Hm\u2026\u2019He first talked about the man with the golden eye and then shifted to the Blood Sect. Was there a connection between the two of them?My insides felt as if it was twisted in themselves.\u201cIs the golden-eyed man related to the Blood Sect?\u201d\u201cWe are not sure, but we think it is likely.\u201d\u201c\u2026why?\u201d\u201cThe Grand Heavenly Blade and\u2026\u201dUh?-Someone you know?How could I not know that man?Only two people had a strong enough reputation and could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the South Heavenly Swordsman as his peers.-Then why?The reason for my shock was simple, two of the warriors he spoke of were already dead.\u201cAnd your teacher and this man too.\u201d\u2018No!\u2019\u201cAll four warriors have two things in common.\u201dI figured out what he wanted to say.\u201cThese four people are not strangers to us. No matter how they grew, they were touted to be part of the next generation of Eight Great Warriors and be part of the future of Murim. However, just one person managed to defeat all of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 the man with the golden eye?\u201dZhuge Won-myung nodded.\u201cYes. To be honest, this had just been speculation on our part as your teacher had gone missing for a long time, but your words had confirmed it.\u201dTo summarize what he was saying, the golden-eyed man had taken down the four warriors who had been likely candidates to become the next generation of leaders of the Murim Alliance. As a result, the alliance was now lacking in power.-That is right.But the problem wasn\u2019t that.He spoke of this secret as something that was only known to the elders of the alliance.This meant that the current Murim Alliance and its high-ranking people believed that the golden-eyed man was from the Blood Sect.And they did have a point.From the point of view of the Blood Sect that wanted to revive itself, lowering the power of its opponent was only logical.But I knew that the Blood Sect did not do that.\u2018\u2026 are they simply taking advantage of this?\u2019That was a possibility that I couldn\u2019t rule out. The current Murim Alliance was having issues with low morale due to the recent departure of many warriors.To overcome that, they were holding a tournament with the purpose of inspiring its members to move as one again.A Blood Sect that tried to kill their best warriors. What better story was there to unite people for the Murim Alliance?Zhuge Won-myung stood up and pointed to a wooden board covered by a cloth in the center of the wall. The cloth was then removed, revealing the woodblock under it.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019The map on the wooden block had red dots and some familiar locations.\u2018The Six Blood Valley?\u2019I gulped unknowingly at this. As he continued, I tried to hold back my shock as much as I could.\u201cAfter the war, I have been collecting the information for a very long time in search of the Blood Sect remnants. Doesn\u2019t your heart tremble when you see all these red dots?\u201dA dozen dots. Some of them were places I knew.Just like the Murim Alliance, which was currently under a strong leader, the capabilities of their intelligence group were also shocking.\u201cThe Blood Sect that had been divided after the war is slowly growing its strength like works that would dig and eat anything to grow.\u201dTak. Tak!Zhuge Won-myung pointed to several places with a wooden stick. One of them was the Six Blood Valley. It was several small and medium-sized places belonging to the Blood Sect that the Murim Alliance had recently attacked.\u201cThough it is bright above the lamp, it is dark below. A swarm of cunning Blood Sect people ready to stab us from under our chins.\u201dIt felt like I should react here.I opened my mouth with a serious expression on purpose.\u201c\u2026 I thought the Blood Sect was destroyed 20 years ago? I never dreamed they were hidden around like this. We can\u2019t just let this happen, right? Shouldn\u2019t this be announced to force them to appear?\u201d-Amazing.Short Sword mumbled her awe at my acting that made it seem like I had nothing to do with the Blood Sect.I could understand Short Sword, but Zhuge Won-myung also paid close attention to my reaction.\u2018\u2026 even though I am the disciple of South Heavenly Swordsman, he still seems to hold doubts about me.\u2019This man was dangerous. I would be dead if I acted just a little out of character.\u201cYou are right. This is a serious matter, but they will only go into hiding if we announce it too early.\u201d\u201cThen how?\u201d\u201cDo you know how many places on the map have even been touched?\u201dI gave no answer to that, prompting him to continue.\u201cWe have only dealt with three of them. They were skilled enough that they kept slipping out of my hand. Do you know what that means?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI knew the meaning behind Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s question. However, it was difficult to say it with my own mouth, though I ended up saying it anyway.\u201c\u2026 the information is being leaked. The Murim Alliance might have a spy within it.\u201d-You are too daring.To think there would be a situation where I would have to talk about the possibility of someone being a spy with my mouth.This had never happened in the past. When a spy was mentioned, Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s expression changed.\u201cTruly an insight expected of that man\u2019s disciple.\u201dI feel slightly relieved now. Even if it wasn\u2019t complete confidence, I felt he had some trust in me.It seemed like he was testing me differently than Kwak Hyung-jik. Zhuge Won-myung then smiled.\u201cSeeing the waves of the rivers growing like this, is reassuring. The South Heavenly Swordsman deserves everything in this world.\u201d\u201cNo. Please don\u2019t say that. I am afraid of bringing his honor down.\u201d\u201cToo much modesty does no good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 thank you.\u201d\u201cJust as you said, I have noticed three spies of the Blood Sect. There might even be more than a dozen that we don\u2019t know of. Perhaps even more as well.\u201d\u201cThat many?\u201d\u201cWould it make sense for an organization with tens of thousands of members to use just a few spies?\u201dI probably know the identity of some of the three he mentioned. Unlike the Blood Sect that hid itself, the Murim Alliance was open to all.It wasn\u2019t that difficult to plant spies here. It was just difficult to plant spies at the higher levels of the organization.\u201cAren\u2019t we all supposed to catch the spies then?\u201dJang Myung, who was listening quietly, spoke. At this, Zhuge Won-myung shook his head and said.\u201cEven if we catch people, new ones will inevitably come.\u201d\u201cThen, without leaving\u2026\u201d\u201cThe information would then become confusing for us.\u201dAfter hearing my words, Zhuge Won-myung and Kwak Hyung-jik looked at me with shining eyes.The reason for keeping the spies alive was simple. It was because they could use a known spy to leak false information.A distraction.\u201cHmm.\u201dZhuge Won-myung looked at me. He must have thought I would have stayed quiet.I had to do this to at least avoid them becoming suspicious of me, but\u2026\u201cA talented person. If only you weren\u2019t aiming to be a warrior, I would have wanted to recruit you for the military division right away.\u201d\u201cYou praise me too much.\u201dFortunately, he was praising me. However, I was still alert in case something happened.\u201cIf you are this talented, I would like to ask a favor of you.\u201d\u2018Favor?\u2019Things were becoming difficult for me. Zhuge Won-myung then spoke with a serious face.\u201cIt would be very important for us. And this is a request I would like you to take.\u201d\u201cMe too?\u201dJang Myung looked at Zhuge Won-myung with a puzzled expression.Seeing the young man\u2019s expression, it seemed he wasn\u2019t informed of this. What would this man ask of us?\u201cDo not worry. It is related to the tournament you will be participating in.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThere is a high chance that at least three members of the Blood Sect would be participating.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s right. One of them was right in front of you. You really can\u2019t miss him.\u201cWe can make a guess as to their purpose in two ways.\u201d\u201cTwo ways?\u201d\u201cIf they are skilled and receive a high position in the tournament, they would likely make an unexpected move for my position. The second\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t like this.What would he say? I hoped it didn\u2019t come down to information or\u2026\u201cThey might aim for the Blood Demon Sword in the armory.\u201d\u2018Ahh\u2026\u2019I sighed inside.Difficult things just kept coming up. As these people were aware of the Blood Demon Sword, taking it would be more challenging.I will have to use my head even more.To take advantage of this situation to find a way out.\u201cThe armory will be opened during this tournament, so they might be aiming for it. Likely, they will not want to miss this chance.\u201dI then carefully said.\u201cIf they are aiming for the sword, then we cannot be careless now. Does your request have something to do with the Blood Demon Sword?\u201dHe shook his head at my words.\u201cNo, you do not have to worry about that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean we do not have to worry?\u201d\u201cEven if they are lucky enough to win the tournament, they will not be able to take the sword. In five days, the Blood Demon Sword will be transferred to Wudang mountain.\u201d\u2018\u2026!!\u2019\u201cElder Jeong Seon will take charge of it and move it, so we don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201dImportant information came out of his mouth.The Blood Demon Sword would be moved from here. Furthermore, one of the Eight Great Warriors would be accompanying it.The man then continued.\u201cThen what do you want us to do?\u201d\u201cWhat you have to do is to find the questionable people in the tournament.\u201d\u2018\u2026this is.\u2019Insanity.He asked me to spy on the same sect I was working for. Sima Young seemed to share my thoughts.Zhuge Won-myung smiled.\u201cIf possible, I would like you to take the highest positions in the tournament so that any spies do not get the chance to do anything around here.\u201dHearing his words, Jang Myung bowed.\u201cHow could we reject this as members of the Murim Alliance? I will not disappoint you.\u201d\u2026shit.His words forced me to do the same thing, and I ended up making my move.After So Wonwhi left the office, Kwak Hyung-jik, who had stayed still, opened his mouth.\u201cMilitary commander. Is it the truth?\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201cThe words you said before, when you told the disciple of South Heavenly Swordsman that you would let the Blood Demon Sword leave with the Wudang sect leader.\u201dAt that question, he smiled.\u201cHuhuhu.\u201d\u2018\u2026?!\u2019Kwak Hyung-jik asked.\u201c\u2026 you. Did you deceive the child?\u201d\u201cIt is because we had to be sure.\u201d\u201cYou do not believe the child?\u201dKwak Hyung-jik had tested Wonwhi and, as a result, believed in the child. However, it felt like Zhuge Won-myung did not.\u201cGreat warrior Kwak personally confirmed it, so how can I not believe it? I believe in him but want to see my heart be at ease.\u201d\u201cYou mean?\u201d\u201cThis is something I had to do for the sake of my heart.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIn addition to that child, there are children who have disappeared for a year and returned.\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201dAt that question, Zhuge Won-myung stood up from the table and went through his books.\u201cChildren of the Song family. They belonged to the Hunan Murim branch.\u201d\u201cThe Song Family? Is that true?\u201dKwak Hyung-jik frowned at Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s words.\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we be checking them out as well?\u201d\u201cI will do it.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI already threw the bait.\u201d\u201cBait?\u2019\u201cIf they are lured by the false information about the Blood Demon Sword, then wouldn\u2019t it be a good chance for us to strike them in one go?\u201dZhuge Won-myung smiled as Jang Myung mumbled.\u201cFlanking!\u201d\u201cHuhu. Do you get it? This is why we didn\u2019t move to catch the spies.\u201dJang Myung felt fear fill him with these words.He learned that martial arts weren\u2019t the only form of power in this world. If So Wonhwi was a spy, then he would be defeated.After they finished talking, the men exchanged their greetings and were about to leave when Kwak Hyung-jik turned.\u201cUh? What is this?\u201dZhuge Won-myung, who had seen the thing, looked at the dagger that had fallen between the chairs.Jang Myung, who also saw it, said.\u201cThat dagger. I think it belongs to So hyung?\u201dThe dagger was none other than Short Sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - The Unknown Trial (1)\u201cAre you not going to report it?\u201dCho Sung-won asked me this as if he couldn\u2019t understand my decision.Sima Young had briefed him of all that had happened once we returned to the dorm where he had waited. After hearing it, he wanted to report to Hae Ack-chun to insist on changing the plan and seizing the sword.Like me, he, too, had become a real member of the Blood Sect. The goal was to reclaim the Blood Demon Sword, after all. Everyone in the sect would react the same way he did if they heard that the sword was being moved.\u201cVice commander.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dWhen I continued to say nothing, Cho Sung-won became visibly frustrated. What would I do?I was listening to Short Sword recount the conversation that had happened in the room after we left. I had planned to head back and retrieve it, but Jang Myung had brought it to us.-So that happened. The thin-eyed kid then said that I belonged to So hyung\u2026Short Sword spoke with excitement.Thanks to this, I managed to learn some good information. I almost fell into a trap.\u2018\u2026 Zhuge Won-myung.\u2019The military commander\u2026 I didn\u2019t know he was capable of creating such a trap.Leaving Short Sword to eavesdrop on their conversation saved my life.-Ahem.Short Sword metaphorically raised her shoulders at my compliment. No matter how smart of a man he was, he would never have guessed that Short Sword could overhear him, right?-Right. Right.Iron Sword chimed in as the two of us spoke.-Everything happened as planned, but wouldn\u2019t it be faster to just look through her memory?-\u2026Right. If I had done that, there would have been no need to hear her words. I would have to do that in the future.\u201cVice commander.\u201dI looked at Cho Sung-won, who was addressing me and said.\u201cIt is a trap.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that such important information was leaked to us? We\u2019re not even part of the Murim Alliance.\u201dHe frowned at my words.I couldn\u2019t say that Short Sword had told me the truth, so I had to explain it to him convincingly.Still, it was easy to put together a story since I had rough approximate knowledge of the situation. However, as I began my explanation, a thought popped up.\u2018\u2026 couldn\u2019t they have leaked the information to that side too?\u2019-That side? Do you mean that fox?If it was the military commander, he must be suspicious of quite a few others besides us. It would be inevitable that spies on the other side had also been spotted.Of course, they would have everything prepared, but Zhuge Won-myung must also be using this bait to test her.-Isn\u2019t this good? Isn\u2019t it a chance to get them taken down?Short sword wasn\u2019t wrong.But the problem was, if she was caught in the trap, then the Murim Alliance could use it as an excuse to mobilize their whole force towards the Blood Sect.-Still, if the fox is caught, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to unite the sect as one without even getting the Blood Demon Sword?I\u2019ve been chased a lot in my day, and my insight has also developed a lot. That line of thinking could pan out, but the worst could always happen.-What?The critical factor was the loyalty of those who supported Baek Hye-hyang. If their loyalty was stronger than we thought, they would try to save her even at the cost of their deaths.Seeing this, that could be right.But from another angle, both candidates for sect leader were akin to a single body. Only by ending this internal war without much damage could a perfect state be achieved.-I have been influenced a lot.Right.In a way, Baek Hye-hyang could grasp the Blood Sect in her hands without much effort. It was only because of me that she had to go down a difficult path similar to Baek Ryeon-ha\u2019s.-Tch. I wanted to see the fox in trouble.Did you think I didn\u2019t also want to see that?It wouldn\u2019t be good for me to weaken her by getting her captured.If her identity was unintentionally revealed in a place filled with the Blood Sect\u2019s enemies, then even we would be at risk.\u2018He said five days later?\u2019-Yes.According to Zhuge Won-myung\u2019s words, the trap would be ready in five days. We had to make contact with Baek Hye-hyang before then.We need to at least inform them to not fall into the trap, so how could we find them? All of them must be hiding extremely carefully to avoid capture, so how?That evening, we went outside the castle. Our purpose wasn\u2019t to find Baek Hye-hyang.We were headed towards the blacksmith\u2019s forge and nowhere else. Since it was a place not involved with the Murim Alliance, we were free to wander.Didn\u2019t the First Sword of Mount Hyeong also come out here to buy pork for the others in his retinue?\u2018But, it is hard to even catch a glimpse of Yong-yong\u2019s face.\u2019I tried to find their dorm\u2019s location, but I couldn\u2019t see her anywhere.There had been a meeting with the disciples of the Nine Great Sects, so we were unable to meet. To tell the truth, she seemed like a child who was even busier than the First Sword of their sect.Shh!As soon as we left the castle and entered the village, Sima Young gently grasped my collar and said.\u201cSahyung.\u201dShe called me sahyung to try and get my attention. What kind of request did she have to call for me so cutely?\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the forge and send us to pack more pork?\u201d\u201cHuh! I like it.\u201dCho Sung-won also became excited at her request. Clearly, he liked it. The pork was quite delicious even when it was cold after we took it to the dorm. Eating the chewy meat while sipping alcohol felt like a glimpse of paradise in hell.Even my own mouth watered as she mentioned it.\u201cIf all of you want it, then sure.\u201dCho Sung-won smiled brightly as he heard my words.\u201cEh~ Be honest! You were also tempted, but you\u2019re trying to act so cool! Haha.\u201dLook at this jerk.Was he trying to make a joke of me? Well, if he didn\u2019t cross the line, then this kind of relationship was more convenient.Sima Young then said.\u201cUh? But don\u2019t we have to make a reservation in advance to get the pork before it runs out? It is dinner time now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 right.\u201dThe Dongpa pork was so popular that it ran out in the evenings. Sima Young then said.\u201cYou go ahead and make the reservation. Sahyung and I will head to the forge.\u201dFlinch!I saw her eyes twinkling strangely! It was like a hawk that had caught its prey. The corner of her lips was raised as if she was excited about something.Was she aiming for us to be alone?\u201cHmm. This time sajae can head there and make the reservation. I will go and be back soon.\u201d\u201cUh?\u201dSima Young seemed a bit confused.Cho Sung-won, who had keen eyes, immediately nodded.\u201cHmm. It is better if you do that. If we go ahead and make a reservation and wait, you can come there.\u201dAt those words, she turned to look at Cho Sung-woon.It was as I expected.Whenever we were alone lately, she kept saying stuff like, \u2018Vice commander, what kind of woman do you like?\u2019 and \u2018Vice commander, when you get married later, do you not like a scary person as a father-in-law?\u2019Short Sword mumbled.-You can never get rid\u2026\u2018Shut up!\u2019Don\u2019t say strange shit.-\u2026 fine. I am a small one. Which is why I know better than you!Short Sword had returned to her rebellious age. Uh\u2026 I also noticed that she clearly likes me.All of her words were all directed at me. I just\u2026-Don\u2019t want to have a scary father-in-law.\u2018\u2026\u2019I stumbled. Who would even dare to have a relationship with the daughter of Sima Chak? One of the Four Great Evils?I am an ordinary person.Iron Sword intervened.-Wonhwi, do not worry. My former master had a sago in the past. He told his junior, who was about to marry, about whether or not in-laws could be killed based on how much hatred was present.\u2018\u2026\u2019Enough, arguing with him was even more confusing. In a situation where it was difficult to keep myself safe, having someone would be too much of a luxury for me.At my words, Short Sword mumbled.-I don\u2019t like it. You are unnecessarily\u2026I said stop.Anyways, Cho Sung-won went together with Sima Young, and I headed to the forge. It was getting dark, and many of the forges had closed for the day.Right, the working day was done.\u2018As I thought.\u2019I was a little too optimistic.After disposing of the Fifth Blood\u2019s disciple, the craftsman had woken up and misunderstood that I had saved him. He then offered to give me something I wanted in return.When I asked if he could make Short Sword faster and better, he promised to make something by melting the iron powder I had made out of his failed swords.Now that there were just five more swords left to destroy, the blacksmith had to find a way to use them. But something felt strange.Cho Sung-won felt it too.\u201cI feel nothing from inside.\u201dWe hurriedly moved and went inside. Once we entered, almost all of the tools inside the forge and the weapons hanging on the wall were missing.They had vanished as if the forge had shut down.\u2018What is this\u2026\u2019There were some traces left on the ground of broken blades and other useless things. All of the important tools were gone.Just in case, we moved closer to the forge.\u2018Ah!\u2019Even the five swords that I had to destroy were also gone. All the other broken swords were thrown away, yet it was strange that the imitations of the Murim Alliance leader\u2019s sword were missing.Cho Sung-wun searched the place and came out shaking his head.\u201cThere are no clothes. Looking at the living room, it seems like he left in a hurry. I don\u2019t know what could have happened.\u201dIt was strange.Does it make sense for a person to suddenly get up and leave in just a day? Besides, I wasn\u2019t the only one who had made a request. The alliance leader had as well.\u2018Kidnapping?\u2019It was a possibility that couldn\u2019t be ruled out. But it was strange for this man to be kidnapped.-Could the Alliance Leader have taken him? Wonhwi?Iron Sword\u2019s words rang true.All of the broken swords had been thrown away, and the imitations were missing. Perhaps he had used his hand to clean off any traces.\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019But was there any reason for him to do it?Come to think of it, the Alliance Leader had considered this to be a secret task. He wouldn\u2019t have given this task to some random blacksmith on the street.As I wondered about this problem further\u2026-Behind!Hearing Short Sword\u2019s shout of warning, I bowed my head without another thought and felt something flash over my head.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019I quickly threw myself forward and turned around.\u2018Uh?\u2019Cho Sung-won was lying on the ground as if he had fainted, yet no one was around. I couldn\u2019t even feel any presence until Iron Sword said.-Wonhwi\u2026 right now behind you, a black warrior. You don\u2019t feel him?\u2018What?\u2019His words made my spine shiver.They were right behind me, and I couldn\u2019t feel anything. How did such a warrior appear here?And then I heard a voice.\u201cDo not look back.\u201dA voice that sounded inhumane.If I moved just a little, I felt like I would be stabbed from behind. This was my first time feeling such threatening energy.\u201cWho\u2026 are you?\u201dI asked in a tense voice. But no answer came.-Wonhwi, he is looking around.\u2018Looking around?\u2019I felt a moment of conflict. The moment he decided to kill me, I would fall.But it wasn\u2019t like just turning around would give me a winning chance, either.\u2018Phew.\u2019There was only one way out of the situation: to run away from the enemy with all my might.But\u2026 Cho Sung-won. If I ran away, he would end up being captured by this person, and anything could happen.\u2018\u2026 this is insane.\u2019That was my only conclusion.After all, wasn\u2019t this place right in front of the Alliance\u2019s castle? Yet this person didn\u2019t seem to be scared of any potential conflict.If I could run, I should go to the roof and shout. Hae Ack-chun couldn\u2019t be too far away.\u2018Huh!\u2019I began to tap into my mid dantian. I then pulled out Short Sword and swung it behind me.But at that moment, something unbelievable happened.Tak!I couldn\u2019t even see the moment Short Sword was deflected back as I crashed into the ground.A handwritten note was on the ground, and I hadn\u2019t noticed it. At that moment, I jumped back and drew Iron Sword.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019But I couldn\u2019t see the opponent.-Wonhwi, behind!\u2018Damn it!\u2019As soon as he had blocked Short Sword, the person moved behind me again. He was too fast. I couldn\u2019t even imagine what his next move would be.\u201cIt seems like you don\u2019t value your life.\u201dThe voice said from behind.I couldn\u2019t feel any killing intent, yet my heart pounded. This unknown person then said.\u201cYou cannot see my face with your skills, so give up.\u201dI couldn\u2019t see his face? At that moment, an idea popped into my head.I turned Iron Sword so that my face would be visible on it. In the process, I saw the black-robed man reflected behind me.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019The faint eyes that could be seen through the black mask visibly narrowed as he said.\u201cYou are one sly ki\u2026um? That sword\u2026\u201dHis voice was puzzled.I rotated my body without missing the moment. My body turned rapidly as my sword soared in the wind like a whirlwind.This was the technique of the Returning Dragon Sword.It was the only sword technique that could work when dealing with an enemy at the rear.I did it.I soared high and headed right for the roof. As I thought of escaping, the technique suddenly stopped.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019My heart pounded again.Suddenly, I saw that the black-robed man had caught my blade with his two fingers. He then swung it away like flicking a bug.\u201cHuk!\u201dMy body was slammed down to the floor with heavy force.Bang!The wood flooring had cracked open as my body fell down grotesquely. It felt like my body was breaking, yet I had to endure it and jump up.In front of me stood the man in a black robe and bamboo hat.-W-wonhwi!He was holding Iron Sword and looked like he no longer cared about hiding his body.My shock at my sword being snatched away as I unleashed my technique hadn\u2019t disappeared. Seeing this, the man asked.\u201cYou are the successor of the South Heavenly Swordsman.\u201dHe recognized me as he saw the sword. I then asked him cautiously.\u201c\u2026 senior recognizes me?\u201d\u201cHow can I not know? I wanted to see you.\u201dWith those words, the man flicked Iron Sword with his finger. This made it fly at great speed, as if an arrow was shot toward me.Puak!The sword shivered at the force, but the floor below was fine. Such incredible skill.I was then sure of something.\u2018\u2026 he is stronger than teacher.\u2019This man was an expert who had far exceeded Hae Ack-chun. Only a couple of people came to mind.The man then said.\u201cTake your sword and try to attack.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - The Unknown Trial (2)\u201cTake your sword and try to attack me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNow I really had no idea what his intention was.Someone who treated me like a child even after I opened my middle dantian was now beckoning me to attack.Was he testing me?-What do we do?Short Sword, stuck on the floor, asked in a worried voice.Honestly, there was no chance for me to win against him. There had to be a sure way to counter his attack, but it\u2019d likely cost me more.Running away\u2026 well, I tried that and failed.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of thoughts.\u201dThe man wearing the black robes stomped on the ground lightly, forcing a cracked wooden board to rise up.The man caught a shard that was of a good size. He then whipped it around a couple of times and the wooden plate transformed into a sword-like thin sheet.And he then said to me,\u201cYou better do your best.\u201dHe wants to fight me using that thin wooden sword?Did he forget that Iron Sword was a treasured blade no matter how skilled he was?-Wonhwi, my former master, said weapons are meaningless once a person has reached the peak.\u2018\u2026 meaningless?\u2019-Yes.Then I had no other choice.It looked like the only way out was to pass this man\u2019s test, and even then, I was not sure.\u2018I need to unlock the 6th level of power.\u2019Although it was still the start of the fight, I realized I needed to use the 6th level of my internal qi.A sharp energy rose from my body.When he noticed this, the man exclaimed a little.\u201cOh. Have you reached a level where you can directly release any amount of qi you want?\u201dWas he actually praising me? Well, I don\u2019t think that it was intentional.\u2018Phew.\u2019I tried to calm my breathing to refine my natural instincts as I moved towards the man. In terms of speed and technique, I was confident in at least unleashing it.The best answer I could give to this man who excelled in everything was to cut him directly.Thud!I stepped hard on the ground and pulled my sword back into a stabbing position. I then turned my hand to the left.I gathered an intense amount of qi and concentrated it on the tip of my sword.\u2018Sword of True Chase Until the End.\u2019I was unsure how this technique would work since I pushed myself to the 6th level of internal qi in one go.Jjjkkk!The wooden boards cracked in the direction that I moved to. It was the same phenomenon that appeared when he had begun to release his qi.It might be a good sign if such things were happening before I fully unfolded the technique.I rotated my sword with all my might and pushed it forward.Jjkkk!Sharp, tornado-like energy rushed forward like a wild storm. Yet, in the face of such a powerful attack, the man simply stood still with his wooden stick.\u2018What is he trying to do?\u2019He seemed to have no intention of avoiding or countering it. However, as soon as the technique got close enough to his nose, the stick in his hand moved.Shhh!He made a large rotation in the opposite direction of my attack and curled it up with a stick that acted as if it had its own life.Even the sharp qi radiating from the attack seemed as if it was nothing to him. It was as if he was embracing it all.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019At that moment, the tornado was pushed in the opposite direction from where I had directed it to.\u2018W-with my sword\u2019s force?\u2019He had done it with that wooden stick without even touching my sword.This man was even superior than I had thought in every way. He was a monster whose limits I couldn\u2019t even fathom. It felt like I was witnessing a miracle happen right in front of me.Clench!He had bent my attack to the other direction to ensure that not the least amount of qi touched him. I\u2026 this was completely beyond my expectations.\u2018Countering by reversing the direction?\u2019This idea popped into my mind.If the opponent was trying to deflect everything, shouldn\u2019t I try to adapt to his reversal movements?I take another step forward again.\u2018Reverse, Chasing Till the End Sword!\u2019As my sword rotated in the opposite direction to the man\u2019s movement, it felt as if the power behind the sword had doubled.\u201cOh.\u201dAgain, he sounded excited, but this only made me feel ridiculous.I clenched my teeth as I pushed my sword forward.Jjjak!The wooden board once again was ripped apart by my whirling sword technique, and my eyes became clouded with dust.A clear sensation could be felt on my sword. Did my attack work?Pang!My body was thrown back by an invisible force.After being thrown back with such force, I crash directly into the wall.Bang!It felt like my entire body was broken for sure now.Using the technique in reverse didn\u2019t seem to have worked at all. The dust had obscured the vision in front of me, and it took a bit before I could see the man in the bamboo hat.Numerous sword marks were clearly visible on the surface of his wooden sword, but that was it. There was no significant damage.\u2018Sigh\u2026\u2019Nothing I did worked on that thin wooden sword.\u201cPretty good.\u201dThe man said this as he looked at his weapon and pointed it at me.\u201cThe attack was good. But what about the defense?\u201dWith those words, he began to walk to me. It felt like he was giving me time to get up.\u2018Shit. Shit.\u2019After struggling to get out of the wall that I had been pushed to, I held Iron Sword and took up a stance with a nervous face.Was there any chance for me to use the silver string here?Even as I tried to simulate a plan of action in my mind, I couldn\u2019t see the man missing any of his attacks.-Aren\u2019t you supposed to do something?I would like to do something, but it felt so unreasonable. If this monstrous person was on the side of the Forces of Evil, then I couldn\u2019t even use the technique Hae Ack-chun taught the twins.It would be a trump card that would take me to my death.\u201cYou are thinking a lot.\u201dThe man said again.It was like he kept pointing it out.\u201cThinking a lot can be advantageous, but it can also be disadvantageous. Your teacher should have pointed that out.\u201dShhh!\u2018Uh?\u2019At that moment, the stick in his hand coiled like a snake as it aimed at my head. I thought it wouldn\u2019t reach me because he was quite far away, but I was wrong.I had to hurriedly use footwork to move back.Tak!But his weapon extended and followed me as if it was alive.I felt like I could not do much now, so I swung my body back and immediately used the True Loach-Shaped Sword technique.I tried to keep his weapon in check by countering it with gentle sword movements.But\u2026Bang! Bang! Bang!The sound of metal clashing against each other filled the air.His weapon had surprisingly blocked the flow of my sword. They collided three times, and his attack didn\u2019t seem like a light movement.\u2018Is this possible?\u2019What I was using now was the Xing Ming Sword technique. Yet this man managed to find loopholes in my technique after just one clash?His weapon suddenly reached my neck.\u201cYou died once.\u201d\u2018Once?\u2019His weapon twisted back as he tapped me on the chest. That was enough to send my body back ten steps.\u201cLet\u2019s try again?\u201dThe man asked me again.Until now, that wooden sword had only felt like an item he was using. However, it was now being used to unleash a technique.\u2018Ah!\u2019The moment I saw this, I felt blown away. I\u2019ve seen this sword path before.I\u2019ve seen this movement dozens of times.\u2018The Clear Vivid Great Sword!\u2019He was a warrior who had reached an incomprehensible level of swordsmanship.This technique was just a grain of what I had seen. This was his sword path.Having seen this martial art in my visions many times, I have experience in how it should move and what it would do. This sword technique was surely what I thought it was.And there was exactly one person who could do this.\u2018Martial First Sword, Baek Hyang-muk!\u2019The man in front of me was the Alliance Leader.Right now, I was clashing my sword against one of the Eight Great Warriors, the Apex Warriors of the Murim.\u2018Ha!\u2019I had some doubts, but this cleared them up for me.This was quite clever.It wasn\u2019t enough for me to just meet this man. I had to fight him inside a forge as well?Shh!The wooden sword was aimed toward one of my blood points.It didn\u2019t seem like the complete sword technique but was instead just a part of it. This left me confused about what he wanted to do.But he didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d seen this countless times already.At that moment, I remembered what this man had told me.[A lot of thinking can be an advantage, but also a disadvantage too.]\u2018\u2026 let us not do the unneeded calculations.\u2019Tak!I utilized my footwork.And surrendered myself to Bake Hyang-muk\u2019s sword. Instead of thinking about how the sword moved and how to avoid it, I decided to trust my intuition instead this time.Shhh!The wooden sword simply swung past me.I leaned slightly over to slip myself past it.\u2018\u2026!?\u2019His eyes, faintly visible through the gap in his hat, betrayed his shock. I barely managed to lean back enough to avoid the weapon aimed at my neck.At the same time, I aimed my Iron Sword at his chest.This immediately made him reach out his left hand to grab the blade of my sword.\u2018Now!\u2019Pak!I trusted that he would hold my sword stiffly and turn my body. I rotated my body into a jump using my sword and immediately kicked him in the face.At that moment, my kick was about to make contact with his face.Woong!\u2018Huh!\u2019My body flew up. He suddenly redirected his qi into my sword, which created a wave that pushed me upwards.As my eyes soared high, the wooden sword came towards me.I held onto Iron Sword firmly and unleashed a technique without overthinking.This was the Meteor Falling Sword technique. For this moment, I tried my best to not create distractions for myself.I only thought of one thing.\u2018Bend!\u2019Baek Hyang-muk raised his stick to strike down my sword. I could feel just how much energy was in his weapon.The anticipation missing from all the previous exchanges could now be felt as my mind was freed from all distractions.Ba-dump!My heart raced in excitement. For me to be able to go against someone like this.\u201cHhh!\u201dUsing the synergy I had created, I clashed with his weapon.Chak!The wooden sword was split in half at my blow, and my sword made its way down to cut him down.Tak!He had caught my blade again with just two fingers.\u2018\u2026!!\u2019It was simply amazing.The best sword technique I knew in this life was blocked with just his fingers. My body was trapped in that position as he held onto my sword.At that moment, Baek Hyang-muk spoke.\u201cRight. This is how a sword needs to be handled.\u201dSh!After saying that, his left hand reached for my forehead and my vision became dyed black.As I lost consciousness, I could hear him say.\u201cYou raised your disciple really well.\u201dBaek Hyang-muk was walking in the back alley of the blacksmith street.On either side, two men in bamboo hats appeared. They stayed silent, as Baek Hyang-muk said.\u201cAsk around. The craftsman has vanished. Ask around and find who came and went out from here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe one on his right immediately vanished. They continued to move even after letting him go as the one on his left became startled and asked.\u201cAlliance Leader. Your hand is bleeding?\u201dThere was blood between the index and middle fingers of his right hand.\u201cIt is a small scratch.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201dTo shed the blood of one of the Eight Great Warriors of Murim.Even if it was just a scratch, it wasn\u2019t something to be taken lightly. Baek Hyang-muk raised his left hand and smiled timidly.\u201cI was there to teach but took two more steps than necessary. I did something that doesn\u2019t fit me, Baek San.\u201d\u201cWho is it? This Baek San will deal with them right now!\u201dBaek Hyang-muk raised his hand to indicate he was fine and said.\u201cI don\u2019t know if Jeong Gyeom should be nervous about this now. Right.\u201dAt those words, Baek San became a bit shocked.The Jeong Gyeom mentioned was a student that the Wudang Sect leader, Jong Seon, taught personally.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The Unknown Trial (3)-Wonhwi!-Wake up! Wonhwi.\u201cVice commander!\u201dVoices rang in my head and ears. I opened my eyes to see Cho Sung-woon looking at me as I sighed.-Phew. I thought you died.That\u2019s right.I lost consciousness, right? I wondered if I was dead. Hearing those muffled sounds made me realize that it wasn\u2019t the case.My head throbbed. The qi that the man had put into my head was different from what I thought.This was a feeling I had never experienced before.Thud! Thud!My heart was beating quickly, and I could feel innate hot qi circulating around my body.\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201dCho Sung-won asked me, unable to understand the situation.Almost half of the workshop around him was utterly devastated.A broken furnace, broken floors, and a broken wall, all showed signs of a battle.I then asked Cho Sung-won.\u201cWhen did you wake up? How long was I out?\u201d\u201cAsk me one thing. I always wanted to ask those questions to you, but then you wake up and ask such things\u2026\u201d\u201cAnswer what I asked. Beggar.\u201d\u201cEhh. This is discrimination\u2026 well\u2026 I just woke up. As soon as I woke up, I saw you.\u201dWhat discrimination?When you discover Sima Young\u2019s true identity, let\u2019s see if you can continue to say this. I then asked Short Sword.\u2018How long was I out for?\u2019-Not long. Maybe around half an hour?That was it. That wasn\u2019t long.Seeing that Cho Sung-won woke up not long before me, it seemed like no one was harmed.The Murim Alliance leader, Martial First Sword, Baek Hyang-muk.What on earth was he thinking by testing me like this and disappearing?\u2018Ah!\u2019Wait.I looked back towards the forge. Thinking about it, the man had been looking around the forge. That meant that he, too, didn\u2019t know what had happened here.\u2018Did the man disappear then?\u2019No.This was the work of someone else.A third party must have kidnapped the man.A few visitors stopped by here, but the craftsman would send them back. Looking at it, it felt like he had sent many away just to finish Baek Hyang-muk\u2019s sword.\u2018No.\u2019At that moment, someone came to mind.The Fifth Blood Star\u2019s second disciple\u2026 he was the only one who saw the imitation swords.\u2018Baek Hye-hyang?\u2019Naturally, all my thoughts moved to her. But why would she kidnap him?It was difficult to comprehend. The only suspicious part was that the tormented swords that Baek Hye-hyang possessed were similar to the imitation swords.\u201cVice commander?\u201dI stood up.After recovering Short Word from the ground, I put Iron Sword back in its sheath and then told Cho Sung-won.\u201cThere has to be something.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt would be better to say it like this.\u201cThe one who did this\u2026\u201dFlinch!I stopped my words and looked towards the forge\u2019s entrance. An unexpected person had arrived.Their face was covered with a bamboo hat\u2026 but that jawline and those lips, I could tell who it was.Baek Hye-yang.What was more shocking was that Sima Young had followed behind her.\u201cSeems like you all had a lot of fun?\u201dBaek Hye-hyang asked this with a raised eyebrow.I turned to Sima Young as I was unable to understand the situation. She seemed to be having a tough time trying to explain this.Half an hour in the past.Sima Young grumbled as she headed towards the guest house.\u2018Seriously, he doesn\u2019t get the hint. Tch.\u2019She thought that he would take the hint if she acted in moderation. Instead, he kept constantly doing something to deprive her of a chance.Even so, eating this pork made her feel better.Its unique flavor stimulated her nose and made her mouth water.She went in to make an order, but there was a line.\u201cPlease wait for a while until we prepare it.\u201dAfter the server left, she leaned against the pillar to wait and watched the other people eat until she felt someone\u2019s gaze on her.\u2018\u2026\u2019A few people on the first floor of the guest house were staring at her.There were many other guests, but why were they looking at her? It wasn\u2019t like she was in her real face, either.\u2018\u2026 quiet.\u2019The upstairs was quieter than usual.It was still early in the evening, so the guest house should be full of customers. But now it was quiet.She wanted to draw attention, but that didn\u2019t feel right, and she realized something odd.Sima Young went upstairs to check and saw that the floor was packed. However, all the guests talked, ate, and drank quietly.\u2018\u2026?!\u2019She then noticed something stranger.When she moved, not a single guest even glanced at her. This felt even more unusual until she looked at a particular person.A young man sat alone by a window table and used their chopsticks to eat the pork.He had a petite body, and a bamboo hat was placed on the table.When Sima Young glanced over, the man turned his head to her.Unlike the other people, he was staring intently at her with no intention of avoiding her gaze.Sima Young slowly walked over as the people sitting around him moved around her.Sima Young smiled as she approached the table and sat with the young who was alone.Pak!At that moment, the hands of everyone there moved to their weapons.The young man chewing the pork raised his hand, and everyone placed their weapons down.The young man opened his mouth.\u201cIt is good enough to eat.\u201dThe voice that came out of her mouth was a woman\u2019s. Sima Young\u2019s eyes lit up.The man drank a glass of water before putting it down and said.\u201cYou\u2019re the one under So Wonhwi, right?\u201d\u201cAre you that woman? Was it Baek Hye-hyang?\u201dPak!\u201cHow dare you!\u201dSomeone stood up with a loud bang from a nearby table. The young man didn\u2019t look over at him as he said.\u201cSit down.\u2019\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI said sit down.\u201dThey had been warned and began to sit down. As he sat, the young man asked.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t a scent that a man would have.\u201d\u201cScent?\u201dThe young man sniffed his clothes and mumbled at the absurdity.\u201cWith just this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I have a sensitive nose. There is no way that I couldn\u2019t smell that scent from you. It is naughty, like a woman\u2019s.\u201dThe young man frowned.\u201cYou are funny.\u201dEven though the voice carried a subtle killing intent, Sima Young didn\u2019t feel slightly scared. Instead, she continued to say what she wanted to.\u201cDo you think the smell of blood can be covered with that?\u201d\u201cYes. I was trying to kill some time.\u201dWith those words, the man grabbed the skin from below his ear and tore it off. The real face below it was revealed.It was Baek Hye-hyang.\u201cI don\u2019t think that mask did much to help you.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do after being caught with it on? And I have an extra. But I don\u2019t hate handsome men like you\u2026 but I hate the look in your eyes.\u201dPat!As soon as those words were said, Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s blade attacked Sima Young.It was so quick that it would be missed by the naked eye. But to everyone\u2019s surprise, Sima Young managed to grab it.Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s eyes shone at this. Even those sitting at the tables around her had become shocked.\u201cYou stopped it?\u201dBaek Hye-hyang smiled. Her eyes tinged with joy.\u201cCan I not stop it?\u201dBaek Hye-hyang turned to Sima Young\u2019s hand and frowned.\u201cThere are a lot of calluses on the palms, but\u2026 your hands are pretty,\u201dPat!Baek Hye-hyang reached for Sima Young\u2019s face. The moment she was about to reach it, Sima Young kicked the table away.Part of the wooden table cracked and flew toward Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s chin.Bang!The wooden pieces were shattered and fell to the ground. At the same time, Sima Young gathered strong energy in her right hand that had held Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s blade, causing it to bounce back.Papak!In an instant, their hands began to collide. It was a clash between a hand that wanted to reach her face and hers that was blocking it.The confrontation between both hands ended with Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s victory.Half of a torn-up face mask was in Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s hands. Sima Young took off the remaining parts on her own.\u201cHa!\u201dBaek Hye-hyang snorted.She looked at her with a distorted expression. The eyes of the men who watched the woman who had taken off the face mask also looked shocked.\u201cShe wore one too.\u201d\u201cYou should have taken care of your own mask too.\u201dAt Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s words, Sima Young boldly replied.\u201cOwn?\u201d\u201cYour note of caution applied to yourself as well.\u201dAt those words, Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cYou are similar to me. I need to be cautious.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cLooks like I have to take the lives of two people. Few people have walked in front of me and could use their mouths like this and live.\u201d\u201cI must be one of the few.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou are aiming for the Blood Demon Sword? Do you have the confidence to subdue me in front of the castle of the Murim Alliance?\u201dBaek Hye-hyang\u2019s expression had become strange after hearing Sima Young\u2019s words.It was more an expression of interest rather than an unpleasant or offended one.\u201cAre you proud of those skills?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough to make a fuss.\u201d\u201cWould you like to try? Will you die before making the mess, or will the mess you make trouble me?\u201d\u201cThat would be a fun thing too. But if that was the case, you would have chosen to attack me right then, right?\u201dSima Young smiled brightly with her eyes shining.Seeing this, Baek Hye-hyang made a strange expression and licked her upper lip with her tongue.It was a strange look that made Sima Young frown.\u201cYou have a charm.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you seem to be interested in that side too.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an answer but sounded like an affirmation. This made Sima Young shudder.\u201cI have no interest, though.\u201dBaek Hye-hyang smiled and sat down as she poured a drink into her glass.\u201cInteresting. Right. What did you want to say?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can pretend to not know. Isn\u2019t there a reason you risked it all and approached me?\u201dAt Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s words, Sima Young thought to herself.This woman was a lot tougher than she thought.But soon, the truth came out.\u201cThere is information that the vice commander wishes to convey.\u201dThis made Baek Hye-hyang\u2019s eyes focus\u201cSo Wonhwi.\u201dI frowned at what Sima Young told me.She said she brought her here by chance after seeing her at the inn while she had pork, and a couple things had happened between them?Baek Hye-hyang then said.\u201cI heard you had something to say?\u201dEven as she asked me this question, her gaze swept through the broken forge.\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201dShe bit her lips with her tongue, asking seductively, but I shook my head\u201c\u2026 it isn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u201cThen why did you ask to see me? You couldn\u2019t have wanted to be caught like this, right?\u201d\u201cI am asking a straightforward question. Have you heard of the Blood Demon Sword being transferred to Wudang in five days?\u201dBaek Hye-hyang frowned at my question.Looking at her reaction, it seemed like she did hear about it.As expected of Zhuge Won-myung and his plan. I wasn\u2019t the only one he was suspicious of. He had a lot of suspects and wanted to take them down in one swoop.\u201cDo you trust the information?\u201d\u201cAround five out of 10.\u201d\u201cFive?\u201d\u201cAfter listening to you, that\u2019s gone down to one.\u201dAt her words, I almost smiled.I didn\u2019t even mention anything about a trap, and yet she was able to guess that the information was unreliable.Baek Hye-hyang looked at me and smiled\u201cYou wanted to let me know about that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause my lady\u2019s side and yours are the same body.\u201d\u201cI see. I like that.\u201dIt was a burdensome thing to be watched with that greedy look.Maintaining eye contact became tough. Bake Hye-hyang then turned her head to see the broken place and asked.\u201cWho did you have such an intense conversation with?\u201dI replied quickly as if I had waited for her question.\u201cMartial First Sword.\u201dHearing this made her expression change\u201c\u2026 you clashed with the alliance leader?\u201dI looked at Baek Hye-hyang and said.\u201cThanks to a certain someone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
