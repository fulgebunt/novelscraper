    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 Personal Interspatial Space part1\"Mother, I'm so hungry. \"In the single apartment, Lin Qing He opened her eyes on her bed and was in a daze. After a while, she sighed frankly.She grabbed the phone at the bedside and checked the time. It was only 5:30 in the morning, and it was May in the lunar calendar. The sky outside was already bright at this time.Lin Qing He put down her phone silently, and then a magical scene happened. Out of nowhere a glass of water in her hands!Lin Qing He observed this cup of hot water which was still steaming. It was just like when she put it in last night.Taking in the phenomenon within her eyes, Lin Qinghe no longer hesitated, she got up to wash up.She was just an ordinary office worker and did it pretty well. She is currently the sales department manager. Although she was ordinary, what happened to her recently was not ordinary.As she brushed her teeth and saw her dark circles in the mirror, Lin Qing He shook her head again and sighed. Although her heart was in a mess, she did not forget to put on her makeup.No one would believe her if she talked about it. For three consecutive nights, the dream she had contained a child who grabbed her, called her mother and ask for something to eat. The dream felt so real, it nearly scared her witless.At first, she thought she was too tired as she had recently worked overtime, so she didn't care.But the second night, she had the exact same dream. Along with this dream, an interspatial space of about ten square meters appeared in her body. It was about the same size as her single apartment.This scared her.But probably because she had the habit of reading novels, her ability to accept was relatively strong. Of course, this is also related to her strong tenacity.In short, she accepted quickly.The interspatial space on her body is in the palm of her hand. With just a thought, she can see it. The space was like a storage box. Last night, she put a cup of hot water into it as an experiment and it was exactly the same when she took it out in the morning. The temperature didn't change at all.This is enough to prove that the space was unchanging. The condition it was in when placed inside, is the condition it'll be when taken out.And just now, the child was in her dream again, calling her Mother and saying he was hungry. And then she was awakened.But this time, she finally didn't hesitate anymore. The strong uneasiness in her heart made her have an intuition that something strange would happen, so she had to make some preparations.Because she saw in the \u2018dream\u2019 that the place was extremely poor, she wondered whether if it was in the apocalyptic years. The supplies and food were very scarce. The faces she saw were very vague, but without exception, their bodies were all skinny and faces were sickly yellow.Although her childhood days weren't easy. But compared to the environment seen in the 'dream', her life growing up under the five star, red flag (basically Chinese flag) in the early days of reform, food and clothing was not a problem. It is impossible to imagine that(the dream) kind of living environment.Her novel was not read in vain, and now she had an additional interspatial space on her. She believes that if she didn't do anything else, then maybe by chance transmigrated to the apocalyptic era, she will starve to death!Soon Lin Qing He finished washing and sorting herself. She took out a pen and paper and began to count the supplies to be purchased. The basic seven (firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy, vinegar, tea) had to be prepared with the exception of firewood and tea.Among them, rice and oil are the top priority!Lin Qing He replaced the firewood and tea with brown sugar and rock sugar. White sugar isn't necessary. Rock sugar was enough to replace it. Eggs were added to the notebook.In the dream place, something like eggs is definitely an asset currency.In addition to the eggs, there was meat. No matter what kind of meat, she had to get some anyway.And also medicines, for emergencies, colds, fevers, bloating and diarrhea are all necessary. And needed to buy some oil/menthol balm for all kinds of aches.One box of these things was sufficient, and will not occupy much space.After writing these, Lin Qing He felt that the food supplies were almost enough.Then she started to write the rest. She didn\u2019t know if it was cold there or not, but warm quilts had to be prepared. The mattresses had to be prepared as well. All of it needed to be grey and not colorful because she saw in the 'dream', the place is gray and white. There was no color at all.Thinking of this, she blew out some heavy exhales, despite her optimistic nature.Afterward, materials began to be added again. There were some personal items of her own. Although the materials were important, she also wanted to leave some private space for herself to buy some female personal items, which were also equally important to her.Few pages are written full of materials. She looked back and forth several times to make sure she didn't have anything left out and then sighed in relief.Then she started counting her savings.After checking a few times, her saving was only 50,000 yuan.For her who had been working as a department manager for just a few years after graduation, this deposit is naturally small. But there was no other way, as her expenses weren't small on most days.Cosmetics are a necessity. Every so often, she goes shopping or eats out with my friends, which one didn't cost money?From the current her, one can't find the shadow of the past.She was an orphan girl abandoned by her parents. She grew up with her grandmother in rural from a young age. When she was a sophomore, her grandmother passed away. From them on she fed herself until she graduated from college to find a job.Although life wasn't easy, she still persisted. Now she was living very well.Originally she wanted to save a down payment, and when the time comes for her to get a house for herself so that got her to save on some expenses and try not to be part of the moonlight group.She still had more than 2,000 yuan of loose money on her, plus 50,000 in her card, it's a total of more than 52,000 yuan.Straight out, she rented a minibus online.It was a driver's license she got from the time she studied in college and work. At that time, she wanted to make some money as a chauffeur. Later, I dislike the fact it was little money and lots of trouble, so she dropped it.It was a young man who rented out the minibus. Because he wants to go back to his hometown for a few days, so he planned to rent it out. He originally thought of just giving it go, and didn\u2019t expect someone would really rent it.After Lin Qing He contacted him and heard that urgently need it, he drove it over. It was not too far away and arrived downstair in around ten minutes.Lin Qing He paid the deposit online, so there is no need to pay anymore. After trying to drive it, it was very smooth, even if she hadn't driven for a long time.Although the minibus was a bit old, there was only one row of seats behind the seat, and the last row was dismantled to become a minibus that could carry goods. Lin Qing He was very satisfied.Sending off the vehicle's young owner, who tried to strike a conversation with her, she carried her bag and hit the road.She hadn't had breakfast yet, so better to eat breakfast before you start fighting.This breakfast shop was a ten-minute drive from the apartment where she lives. The journey was short. Lin Qing He was aware she's a foodie. But she can't come here often because the location wasn't on the way to work.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2. Personal Interspatial Space part2Sure enough, the other business had yet to open, but the breakfast shop here opened at 6.15a.m. There were already street cleaners buying buns from here and ate while leaving.\"Auntie, give me one bun and a cup of soy milk. The three yuan worth bun.\" Lin Qing He said.The aunt of the breakfast shop answered and soon brought it to her.A hot steamed bun with a cup of soy milk.Lin Qing He came by this store by chance half a year ago and came in for breakfast once and found this store.The aunt in this store is local. Her family got three buildings for rental. According to the current house prices, like her single apartment will cost one thousand a month, without including the utility bills.Cheap ones cost six or seven hundred a month. And three buildings are collecting rent, what does that mean?Even if a family does nothing, there's no worry about food and clothing.But the aunt's family couldn't sit still. The couple opened the breakfast shop with their eldest son and daughter-in-law, and the business was extremely prosperous.Not only was it clean and hygienic, but it was also particularly good.Like the bun Lin Qing He was eating, just one is enough for her to be full as she got a small stomach.A bun costs three yuan, but it contains meat, eggs, and cabbage. It tastes very delicious and had plenty of ingredients.And this bun is why she drove all the way here.When Lin Qing He still haven't figured it out, she was skeptical. Would transmigrating with an interspatial space really happen to her?After hesitating for two days, she thought it through today, the third day. This decision made her feel a sense of urgency. She was afraid that she would transmigrate to the poor place before she was ready.Then that would mean call heaven get no answer, call earth get no inspiration (T/N: nowhere to turn for help).And she didn\u2019t know if there was any place for cooking. This big and delicious bun was really suitable!\"Auntie, how many buns are there? You're very skilled. It's so fragrant, I want to buy it for my colleagues.\" Lin Qing He wiped her mouth with paper and told the aunt.The aunt laughed, \"There is still more, but if you buy more, I can't make it cheap for you, our profit is not big.\"Because the business is really good, there are a lot of made in general stores. Before there were construction sites making a large order, but it was the same, no discount on the price. That's because no matter how much was bought, this store's bun can be all sold out.There is no shortage of big clients like Lin Qing He.\"Auntie, how much you have, pack it all for me. I drove over here, so I can be put in the back seat.\" Lin Qing He said: \"But you really have to give me a cheaper price, this trip of mine saved your family a lot of effort?\"The aunt saw that she wasn't joking, said, \"Then I'll see how much there is.\"She went to take a look and soon came out: \"I have made a lot today. There are three hundred, how much do you want?\"\"There are only three hundred?\" Lin Qing He couldn't help ask.\"Oh, little girl is not big in age, your tone is not small. Three hundred isn't little. At most, three of our buns are enough to make a big fellow full,\" the aunt said.\"There are many people in our workplace unit, and they are all big men. Their appetite can't be compared to us. And it tastes this good, one person will have at least two or three. The three hundred are not enough to share.\" Lin Qing He said with a smile.\"Are there that many people in your unit?\" Aunt froze and looked at her suspiciously.Even if one person gets three, three hundred are enough for one hundred men.Lin Qing He laughed: \"Just our unit doesn't need so many. Isn't there a unit next door? However, I'll take those three hundred first. Auntie, what do you think it should be pack in? I'll take it to them first to see if they like it. If they like to eat them, you may have to work hard and do overtime today. Been working overtime for a while, so the workplace order snacks.\u201d\"What kind of workplace are you in? To need a big girl to come out to handle this?\" The aunt saw that she wasn't fooling her, so she took out a foam box and spoke.It's a bit like a foam box that contains popsicles when you were a kid.\"How about using this box?\" said the aunt. Because construction sites order buns, so the store had these big boxes, specially reserved for packaging buns.\"Okay.\" Lin Qing He saw it looked very clean, nodded, and replied to her last question: \"This wasn't appointed for me to do. My sister-in-law is responsible for the few unit's meals, but she has a cold. I have no choice but to help her out? Auntie, your bun is good, a lot of filling and clean. This is famous in the area, everyone will definitely like it, and my sister-in-law can also rest. \"Although these words are full of loopholes, under the rendering of Lin Qing He's colorful rubbish, the aunt didn't care about it that much.First packed up three foam boxes for her, because some had not been steamed yet, so the aunt asked Lin Qing He to wait for her. Lin Qing He said that she'll take the three foam boxes first and told the aunt to continue steaming for her and she will take the already steamed ones in the foam box to her workplace first and will return soon.Although there were some loopholes in Lin Qing He's remarks, it was true she got matters to handle. The payment was cleared in one go, so the aunt didn't doubt anything. Under Lin Qing He's bargaining, the aunt reduced the price by twenty yuan.Although it's only twenty yuan, Lin Qing He doesn't mind the saving was small. She can't wait to divide one cent into two cents. Twenty yuan is enough for her to refuel.After leaving the breakfast shop, Lin Qing He parked the car in a quiet, deserted place, and directly put three foam boxes into the space.Then she headed straight to the nearby market.She came to buy eggs.She usually cooks herself and treats herself, so she comes to this market to shop.As soon as Lin Qing He arrived there, she bought up the free-range egg from a local old aunt.It was because they are familiar and she also knows the old aunt's eggs are the freshest, and basically, none are broken.Speaking of about, there are also free-range eggs sold in supermarkets. Those eggs are also cheaper, but they have to be picked carefully, otherwise, it was easy to buy bad ones.Although the eggs of this old aunt are a bit expensive, Lin Qing He doesn't mind buying from her. And this transaction, the old aunt also gave her a little discount.It was the old aunt\u2019s son who carried them over to the market for her to be sold. Lin Qing He came over at that time. The old aunt's son hadn\u2019t left because he will help the morning rush, otherwise, the old aunt can't handle on her own.So Lin Qing He asked the young man to load her two baskets of eggs into the vehicle.Two baskets of eggs got loaded in, Lin Qing He immediately settled the money including two baskets and carrying pole. Then sent him away.Knowing that the other party would be confused, Lin Qing He ignored it. Anyway, she gave him enough money.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3. Personal Interspatial Space part3This kind of basket was relatively large and contains a lot of eggs. She heard the old aunt said that one basket of eggs weighs 45 pounds.A pound of eggs cost her eight yuans, originally was eight point two. Ninety pounds of eggs in two baskets cost her more than seven hundred yuans because they are all free-range eggs. Even if she got a discount, they are still expensive.Naturally, two baskets of eggs couldn't satisfy Lin Qing He, but it was still OK. She crossed the eggs out of the book.At this time, the aunt from the breakfast shop called. Lin Qing He drove back to the breakfast shop. She gave the aunt a few positive comments. After the praises, she took away three boxes of steamed bun.Although the size of this foam box wasn't large, the volume wasn't small. It can hold almost fifty in one go. Three hundred big buns were completely packed in six boxes and two trips.However, Lin Qing He still wanted more big buns, so she straight out booked five hundred, and planned to come to collect it tomorrow morning.Although the aunt didn't understand the reason behind the action, Lin Qing He gave a deposit of 1,000 yuan, so she readily agreed and didn't act nosy. She simply asked her to come over at this time tomorrow morning to get her buns. At that time, she would have it all packed up with the same foam box and not one less.Lin Qing He expressed that they're a known brand, she naturally believed nothing will go wrong.Then she drove away, returned to the market again. Because she had bought eggs here, and what's more two baskets. So this time Lin Qing He didn't dare to make such a big move.At this time, the market has opened, and soon it became bustling with people.Lin Qing He got her eyes on the pork. Her luck was pretty good because today \u2019s pork was all excellent and from local pigs. It's the type that has no taste and very delicious. Even if she didn\u2019t like pork much, if she encounters this pork, she'll buy a little.However, the price was a bit more expensive, but Lin Qing He didn't care a bit.Originally she wanted to be low-key but seeing this kind of pork, Lin Qing He threw it out of mind. At once, she asked for a half side of the rib, pork belly, lean meat, oily fat and the likes she wants from the first pork shore. The same situation with the next few pork store.This made the few pork stores' bosses puzzled and questioned what's going on?\"There are three relatives from my mother's family who have a happy event happening today. Initially, they already had it arranged with the pork store there but suddenly they sold it to others. This is an emergency ah, so they came to me?\" He helplessly explained: \"I won't talk more. Hurry, help me chop up the ribs. Don't need to bother with the pork belly and fats meat. Just pack them for me.\"Although the few pork store owners didn't understand how the other pork store promised and then go back on their word? But there seems to be no other explanation than this.Why else would they suddenly ask for so much pork?Only weddings can use so much pork.So without hesitation, they immediately chopped the ribs and the likes for her.Lin Qing He settled the bill one store by one store. Altogether the ribs weighed 80 pounds or so and one pound was 25 yuan. The ribs cost more than 2,000 yuan.There were also pork belly, lean meat, and fatty meat. Because they were already picked out and heard her say that it was for happy events, they were willing to give her leeway.Just buying so much at once, except for giving her back a few yuans change, the price was not cheap.Lin Qing He asked them to help carry them to the vehicle and transported all the pork away.She drove the vehicle to a remote place. After Lin Qing He made sure no one was around, she immediately put the eight bags of ribs and all kinds of meat into the space.Adding up the pork and ribs, it amounted to 5,000.In addition to buying buns and eggs, she now has almost 45,000 yuan left.She canceled the word meat off the list. With this much ribs and pork, it's enough to eat for a long time. As for other meat, chickens, ducks, fish, etc., forget it, she didn't have much money. She thought it through, even if there's a lot of money, the space only has ten square meters. It is very limited, can\u2019t hold much.She had to prepare some of everything for the just-in-case moments.As for the market, she couldn't go there anymore. She drove to a pretty far large wholesale market in the city.She began to order rice, brand name rice, and 50 full packs of it. Each pack was 20jin (aka 10kg) of top-quality good rice packed in vacuum.The wholesale manager thought she was going to open a store by herself. As soon as he asked and found she wasn't, he wondered why did she order so much?Lin Qing He explained that it was ordered by her workplace and was a benefit for everyone.Besides the fifty bags of rice, she also ordered fifty bags of 20jin flour, also top quality.Because it was a large order, the price was at the wholesale price, so it wasn't expensive.On top of that, there was peanut oil. She bought a certain flower brand one. This brand was very expensive, but it was also very pure.She also uses this brand of peanut oil. A barrel was 5.5kg, equalizing to 11jin. She looked at the wholesale price. After a moment of hesitation, she got five barrels. Even wholesale price, it was 100 yuan or so per barrel!Five barrels were nearly six hundred.The wholesale price of one bag of rice was 45 yuan. The retail price was 60 yuan. Meaning 15 yuan cheaper.But fifty packs of rice also meant more than 2200 yuan.The price of flour was similar to rice. Fifty bags also amounted to 2000 or so.Adding all these, it's at the boundary of 5000.Lin Qing He counted in her head and then appraised the space again. Two baskets of eggs, eight bags of pork, and six foam boxes of ready-to-eat buns were inside. This left five-sevenths of the ten squares space.After putting these rice, flour and peanut oil, there were still about three-sevenths space left.She asked the wholesale manager to call people to put all the goods in the minibus. But there were too many things and the minivan couldn't fit it all.Lin Qing He decided to take half and send it to her workplace first and then came back half an hour later. The wholesale manager said that it was no problem and gave her a receipt.Lin Qing He left fifty bags of rice and five barrels of peanut oil before leaving. Halfway on the road, she placed the goods inside the space.And crossed out the words oil and rice in the book.As a sales department manager, Lin Qing He was skilled at making maximum use of one day's time.Halfway on the road, she changed direction and headed directly to the pharmacy next to the urban hospital. She visited this pharmacy once before, and their stock was complete. Just the price was expensive. One trip a few hundred was cut down.But now Lin Qing He couldn't care about so much.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4. Personal Interspatial Space part4She got some for cold, fever, bloating and diarrhea and other emergency use. She bought ten boxes of the triple six brand cold capsule.She also bought some other medicines that are very likely to be used, such as the menthol balm jotted in the book.Several of them were particularly expensive, costing her nearly 10,000 yuan, but Lin Qing He didn't mind as they were prepared for just-in-case.These don't take up much space. Because Lin Qing He bought a lot, she asked the pharmacy to give a paper suitcase to pack it.After putting it on the minibus, Lin Qing He took out the notebook and crossed out the word 'medicine'.Then she drove over to the wholesaler, and the wholesale manager called someone to load her remaining fifty bags of flour into the vehicle.\"If you still need anything, I can prepare it all. As long as you come here, I can ask someone to load It into the vehicle for you.\" The wholesale manager said politely.Dragon Boat Festival was nearly approaching, and he deduced that this must be a big company giving benefits to its employees.When Lin Qing He heard what he said, on impulse, she took out the notebook and wrote down brown sugar, rock sugar, soy, vinegar, and salt.Then she gave it to the wholesale manager and asked him to prepare it according to the amount above while she sends the flour to the unit first.The wholesale manager expressed that it was no problem.Lin Qing He drove away and collected the flour into the space halfway on the road.Now there are three-sevenths of space left in the space. She felt that the food supplies are almost enough.She stopped on the main street, took out the notebook and crossed out the words flour. Then she looked at the other things to see if there was anything missing. She would make up for it if she lacked it. She organized the space and checked if she can make more room.Taking out her cell phone and checked that it was nearly half an hour, she drove back.The wholesale manager had brown sugar, rock sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt ready for her.Twenty jin of brown sugar, twenty jin of rock sugar, twelve bottles in a box of soy sauce, fifteen bottles in a box of vinegar, a large sack with twenty-five small bags of salt inside, and one small bag contain two jins of refined salt.Someone put it in a vehicle for her, and then Lin Qing He settled the bill first.\"I still have something to buy.\" Lin Qing He said after the checkout.\"Miss, what you want to buy, you can tell me, I will take Miss over.\" The wholesale manager nodded.Lin Qing He didn't act shy with him, this time she came to buy women's products (a.k.a. period stuff).She frankly ordered ten boxes of supplies, and she requested the wholesale manager to call someone to tear off the outer packaging and scattered them into five boxes.Because this saves space. With these five large boxes plus the brown sugar, white sugar and stuff before, the two-sevenths of space was left in the end.Although it was a bit excessive, Lin Qing He felt that the current supplies are not in short supply but this stuff was really indispensable!Because a lot of materials had been stored in the space, enough to temporarily stabilize the situation in the desperate situation, she did not believe that if she was really to transmigrate, she wouldn't be able to live successfully.So what she had to consider now should be personal issues.Lin Qing He ignored the perplexed look of the male wholesale manager and asked someone to take it to the minibus. and took it with her, Then she took the yet-to-recover and first-time-meeting-such-bizarre-client male wholesale manager with her to continue shopping.Lin Qing He also bought two large boxes of tissues.Toothbrush, toothpaste, body wash, shampoo, face towel, soap, moisturizer and so on also can't be forgotten.She even saw old-fashioned double-eared iron pots and old-fashioned casseroles pot in the supermarket. She got two of each. In addition to those, were five sharp old-fashioned cleavers...The male manager automatically attributed this was for her female colleague to take home to use, so there was nothing to ask.Whatever the client wants, he just give it to them, and it's not like he never saw this kind of client.Lin Qing He glanced at him and said, \"These things, you have to make it cheaper for me. I bought so much from you.\"\"That's for sure,\" asserted the male manager with a slight smile.\"How heavy is this quilt? How is it sold?\" Lin Qing He came to the clothing area (T/N:shouldn't it be homeware), pointed directly at the shelves of quilts packed in bags.\"This is a good five-jin quilt. If Miss wants to buy it, I'll give Miss a discount. The wholesale price for one is only three hundred and eight.\" The wholesale manager said.\"Five pounds isn't enough. Give me another. No, give me two seven-jin quilts!\" Lin Qing He glanced and frankly spoken.The male wholesale manager swiftly arranged two seven-jin quilts, both of which can be used for double beds.Lin Qing He was satisfied with a glance because the quilt could leave the inner core and remove the outside.She briefly looked at the mattress and also asked for two wool mattresses, both of which were grayish in color. They looked very old, but the quality was really good and the price was not cheap. The wholesale manager said that it was targeted at middle-aged and elderly people and would she like to change it?Lin Qing He conveyed no, it's exactly what she wanted!\"A new batch of fruit arrived in the fruit area today. Would you like to see it, Miss?\" The wholesale manager said politely when it seemed like she was almost done.Lin Qing He originally wanted to leave, but after he said that, she examined the space. There was currently one-seventh space left. It was just enough to keep the ordered big buns, but if it was packed in a bag, she can find a bit of space.And with more than 10,000 savings left, Lin Qing He came to the fruit area. In the end, she got a box of grapes, a box of yellow pear (Pyrus nivalis) and two boxes of apples.(T/N: it's one of these? For me, it's right)When the bill was settled, Lin Qing He drove away with all the goods. It was one vehicle full. She took all the materials into the space halfway on the road.After solving these problems, Lin Qing He let out a sigh of relief.Now that these things are gathered, even if there were any accident, she should not have to worry about it for a short time when she went over, right?Ten square meters was only so big. From start to end, so many things were put in, the space in her palm left some room but not very big. There was only a place reserved for the last five hundred white buns.And when the time comes, she'll have to put it in a bag and take it inside. If she uses a foam box, it may not be able to fit it.After being busy outside all day, she grabbed a bun from the space and ate it when hungry, drank mineral water, and passed it as a meal.She reached home when it was 6:30 in the evening.After a long day of exhaustion, her spending was down to the last few thousand yuan after all her spending. However, she didn\u2019t plan to spend any more. Don't mention that the space couldn\u2019t fit anymore, it was for in case the unexpected didn't happen. Then she'll be empty-handed!However, after sweeping in so many things, satisfied Lin Qing He was tired and paralyzed. She planned to sleep after taking a bath.She didn't know whether these preparations were enough or not, but she had done her best. The only thing she prayed now was to hope that place would not be the apocalypse.She had read a good quantity of popular male apocalypse novel. The male lead got a space without a warning, but apocalypse was too dangerous ...Along with the random thoughts, Lin Qing He went to sleep, but she didn't expect that once she sleeps, she would sleep to the sixties...If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5. Three villain sons\"Mother, I'm hungry.\"A ragged child carefully pulled her hem and pulled Lin Qing He, who was familiar with this phrase, from her daze.Lin Qing He looked at the child, who was as thin as a little monkey, with complex eyes, and fell into the silence again.She didn't expect that she would transmigrate like this, and what's more transmigrate into a novel she had read before.It was after she had received the memory of the original body owner that she reacted.Because the deepest impression she got this novel was the three villains in the story, Zhou Kai, Zhou Xuan, and Zhou Gui Lai.These three are brothers, the eldest Zhou Kai, the second Zhou Xuan, the third Zhou Gui Lai.This (the boys' names) inferred wish for their father, who is on the front line of the organizational unit (T/N: the army?), to be able to return triumphantly early.But the name didn't have any use, their father didn't return triumphantly but instead retired halfway.This was a fatal blow to the family.The mother of these three villains a.k.a the original owner who was one of the village flower (prettiest girl), only married the villains' father cause she got her own objective. She wanted to be an official wife one day.From a young age, she dreamed of flying up a branch and turn into a phoenix.For this purpose, the original owner resolutely married the villains' father and toward the villains' father, who wasn't at home all year round, even if he goes home he had to leave before the seat gets warmed and what's more never say words of love, she tolerated with the little patience she had.But it was also limited to tolerance. Don't think about getting any warmth and tenderness from her.As a village flower, the original owner got a proud heart as she was beautiful from young to big. Only others can coax her. How can she be humbled and be good-naturedly with others?However, because the villains' father sent money back every month punctually, the original owner would pretend to be polite and compliant with him, even when she hadn't taken a liking to him. That's why they got three sons.However, this situation remained until the villain's father retired.The villains' father retired due to injury.But no matter what the reason was, the original body owner's dream of becoming an official wife was broken and in the following month, there wasn't any stable allowance of a dozen yuans. On top of that, the villains' father wasn't thoughtful and don't know how to say pleasant and comforting words. Let alone words of love.How could the original owner, who had taken a blow, endure such a life?Under the same roof, the original owner's grievances became deeper and deeper, and her temper became more and more irritable. When she was in a bad mood, she would readily treat the three sons with hits, scolding, and punishment of starvation.Although the three sons weren't so decent after growing up in this environment of domestic violence but also weren't super bad.The real trigger was the original body a.k.a. the lowest rank/18-line female cannon fodder, at the age of 31, also the time of 1977 college entrance examination restoration, ran away with the educated urban youth(a special term during the Cultural Revolution) who passed college exam and was going to return to the city!Having said that, got to talk about the appearance of the original owner even if she was an 18-line female cannon fodder that was only mentioned in a few sentences under the author's pen.The author's description of her appearance was carefully written, saying that her eyes were eyes and her nose was a nose. From young to big, she was pretty in her maternal family's village and well deserved to be the village's flower.And even if the villain's father retired and got no allowance for every month, she never went to the field and relied on the incommunicative villains' father and her three sons to support her. She took the blood of the whole family to provide herself.As for the villains' father and the three sons, don't think of getting anything. For she must have two new clothes every half a year, and she always had to apply vanishing cream and clam balm on her face.Additionally, she didn't need to go out in the wind and rain. So even at the age of 31, the original owner looked younger than the average 25-year-old girl.The foundation was there and she knew how to dress up, so even if she was 31 years old, she was still a pretty beauty.In private, she hooked up with the educated youth in the countryside. Later, the college entrance examination resumed, the educated youth became part of the first group of intellectuals admitted to the university. At this time, the original owner couldn't endure. Under his encouragement, she took all the family's money and ran away with him.The author's description of the backgrounds of the three villains, Zhou Kai, Zhou Xuan, and Zhou Gui Lai did not stop there. Later, the tragic end of the original owner was written. She was abandoned by the educated youth, all her money got scammed and finally died in a foreign land.And her three villain sons had made a name for themselves in the underworld. But their ends were no exception, including the villains' father.When the description of the villains' father appeared again in the novel, he was already in his fifties. On the way out, he ran into his eldest son who was fighting with people and was losing because other side got more people.The villains' father was skilled, but because of old injuries that haven't been nursed in the early stage. Sometimes it acts up, making him unable to walk in the past years. So how could he be a match to 20 or 30 years old youths?He was stabbed with a knife within a few moves, and it was a good few. He died before his eldest son Zhou Kai could cry and send him to the hospital.The villains' father was the biggest trigger because when he died, it cut off all the chance for the three villains' sons to turn back, prompting the three of them to truly embark on this path of no return.Later, there was a severe attack on their underworld. The oldest brother Zhou and the second brother clashed with the police male lead, while the youngest brother fell in love with the gentle and kind like a rabbit girlfriend of the male lead, which was the female hero.The author wrote that at first, the three brothers planned to kill the male lead through his weak point, the female lead. Zhou number three pretended to be mentally retarded, approached the female lead and was taken home by the female lead to be taken care of. In the end, instead of using her, he was attracted by her kindness and innocence.He fell really deep and couldn't extricate himself.Zhou number three had a lot of entanglement with the female lead. As a reader, Lin Qing He had spitslot at the time.Because under the author's pen, the heroine was not completely without feeling toward infatuated Zhou number three.Zhou number three described by the author as a very manly and handsome man and was smooth talker, especially skilled at pleasing girls.In fact, the three villains' appearances were top quality in the author's writings. They can be compared with the male lead. And if he wasn't good-looking, the female lead wouldn't take him home if she saw an ugly monster with mental retardation.Let's not go into details on the process. In the end, because of this kind female hostess, Zhou number three, as well as his elder brother and second elder brother, were all served.Without exception, they got executed (by gunfire).From the beginning to the end of the story, this novel is laying the foundation for the hero and heroine's love road. Using the misfortunes of other people to set off the happiness and purity of love of the hero and heroine.\"Mother, have you cooked yet? I'm starving to death!\"When Lin Qing He was immersed in the plot she had seen before, a completely dirty boy burst inside from outside.Seeing this boy, Lin Qing He's mind sprang at Zhou Da Wa a.k.a Zhou Kai, the same message was same as Zhou Er Wa, who was glancing at her as he held onto her hem and asking for food.It was also because of the names of her three sons, did she come to sense that she had entered this kind of wolf and tiger den.\"Mother, my elder brother said that he was hungry.\" Zhou Er Wa was worthy of being a dog-headed tactician among the three brothers in the author's writing. Listening to it, he's only three years old and already knew how to play mind games. He himself really wanted to eat, but label another as the culprit.\"Ah, ah.\" At this time, Zhou number three, who was sleeping on the side, was also awake. He was one year old. He couldn't speak now, not even the simplest father and mother.That's all right, all three big villains who cause trouble in every direction are all here. Should she hang them up first and beat, or beat first then hang up?T/N: The three sons' name are Kai, Xuan and Gui Lai. But it later changes in the chapter, cause it's their nickname or childhood name. The nicknames are simple. Da Wa is biggest baby, Er Wa is second baby.

    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6. Mold and pinch\"Guru.\"When Lin Qing He looked at the three brothers without good intentions, a loud belly sounded.Zhou Da Wa, Zhou Er Wa, and one-year-old Zhou San Wa, all looked at their mother's belly.Zhou San also puffed out saliva to copy the stomach grumble.Lin Qing He: \"... Let's eat first.\"According to the memory of the original owner, it was time to eat at this time, otherwise, Zhou Da Wa, this kid won't come back. It was all well-timed to come back for dinner time punctually.\"Mother, what did you buy?\"Zhou Da Wa saw a package on the Kang and asked.Lin Qing He noticed the big package, and the corner of her mouth twitched.This was what the original owner got from to the market in the county city after breakfast at half-past five. The fabric she bought for herself was going to make a new dress for herself.It was already the end of September in the lunar calendar. Although it was not cold, it was already a bit cool, especially in the morning and evening, but after entering the lunar calendar's October, it will get colder each day.This fabric was for preparing clothes for herself, and there are two pounds of new cotton in it, so the package looks a bit big. But it doesn\u2019t matter how big it was, it had nothing to do with the three children are. The original owner prepared it for herself.\"Delicious stuff.\"With a turn of a head, Lin Qing He answered.\"Don't coax us, mother. Every time you buy cloth for yourself when you go out and lie to us that it is food.\" The future villain who was still Zhou Da Wa, was already very smart. He grinned when she said that.In fact, the original owner's treatment toward the three brothers was so-so. It was set to the minimum level of won't starve to death. As for how well, it was non-existent.However, children at this age have a natural dependence and attachment to their mothers, and what's more, they are also in the age of remembering to eat and forgetting the hit, so naturally, they won't hold it to their heart.Hearing what his elder brother said, Zhou Er Wa released her dress, because he remembered it too.\"Ah.\" Zhou San Wa could not understand this, also noticed the big package, so he stood up and staggered towards that side.Lin Qing He quickly hugged him. It won't be a trivial matter if he fell.It then came to her and asked Zhou Er Wa: \"Who put your brother on the kang?\"The thoughtless original owner went to the market early this morning as she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to buy good cloth if she was late. She had saved a lot of cloth coupons.When she left in the morning, Zhou San Wa was left to his two brothers' care. However, Zhou Da Wa immediately ran off to play. While Zhou Er Wa stayed behind but he didn't have the ability to put San Wa on the bed to sleep.\"My grandma,\" said Zhou Er Wa with disinterest.His grandma was Mother Zhou, the mother-in-law of the original owner.Speaking of which, Lin Qing He even wanted to criticize the low rank, small cannon fodder.The population of Old Zhou's family wasn't monotonous. The villains' father, Zhou Qing Bai was the youngest son of Father Zhou and Mother Zhou. Above Zhou Qing Bai, were three brothers and two sisters. And below Zhou Qing Bai, was a still-not-married sister. She was currently a worker in the county city, which was very decent.All three elder brothers above him had already started a family, but they did not receive as good treatment as the original owner.That's because Father Zhou and Mother Zhou both doted on the youngest son Zhou Qing Bai.But it was also exactly because of this, that the original owner wickedly caused trouble on the first day of the marriage. The excuse had come knocking on the door.On the day of the wedding, Zhou Qing Bai could only consummate and then hurried away after receiving the urgent report, leaving no words behind.This made the original owner feel like she lost lots of faces.Of course, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou felt like they owed her, so when she complained, they said nothing. After all, the newlyweds hadn\u2019t stayed together for two days before their son left. They had mistreated Fourth Daughter-in-law.At this time, the original owner wanted to seize the opportunity to propose a separation. She had the idea of splitting away from the family before she married, as she wanted to have sole financial power.Perhaps the original owner was a bit lucky. One month later, it was found out that she was pregnant.Forgive all three sisters-in-law above her for are secretly lamenting the original owner's stomach capability.The original owner was a person who knows how to take advantage of the situation. On the day she found out about her pregnancy, she started a starvation strike. An appearance of not wanting to live.If it was just her, Mother Zhou, her mother-in-law really didn't want her to get used to getting her way. But there was no other way, she had her Fourth Son's baby in her stomach now ah.Being on the front line, Fourth Son was in a lot of danger. If something ever happened, then this was the only bloodline of the Fourth Son!So when the original owner proposed a separation, she had no worries at all and did not think about the consequences of the word coming out of her mouth like what would the villagers think of her or what would they say her behind her back.But even if she thought of it, the original owner didn't care at all,because she had never put herself together with the people in the village. She thought that she would leave the village and barren land sooner or later.Because of using her life, as well as treating her tummy as a protection amulet, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou finally let her separate in desperation.And also mobilized other people in the old Zhou Family to build two bedrooms house.This caused quite a stir in the village.No matter how others comment, the original owner ignored it. In short, the original owner successfully separated and had not been to Father Zhou's and Mother Zhou's side since then.But it's still that phrase, the original owners have no other skills other than a capable belly. One after another, she got three sons. With this, even Father Zhou said nothing.Because the eldest brother, Zhou Qing Mu and Eldest Sister-in-law Zhou now have three daughters. It was until the fourth child, they got a son, currently only two years old.However, her stomach have movement again now. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a boy or girl. The author did not elaborate.The second brother, Zhou Qing Lin was also in a similar situation, two daughters in a row, the last child was the son, now only three years old.The third brother, Zhou Qing Sen, currently had a daughter, who was already six years old. The last time she gave birth to her daughter, she lost her vitality. It was until this year she recovered and became pregnant.Third Zhou Sister-in-law's stomach was no longer small, it seems that she will give birth by the end of this year.Under this premise, the original owner with three sons in a row made the original owner stood very tall in Old Zhou Family's home.Rural people, especially people in this era, have a desire for a son that is more than a full stomach. The stomach can be hungry, but one can't be without a son.Sons birthed by the original was equal to all of her sisters-in-law, so Mother Zhou didn't make it hard on her.But in the end, her heart ached for her three grandchildren. What's more, Mother Zhou was also clear about original owner's personality. From time to time, she would come and take a look.For example, now, in the midst of a busy autumn harvest, Mother Zhou still took the time to take a look.\"Mother, why are you in a daze? My stomach is flat out hungry!\" When she was in deep contemplation, Zhou Da Wa became a little impatient waiting.Lin Qing He took a deep breath and glared at him: \"Dare to yell at your mother again, there is nothing for you to eat!\"Who cares that he'll be some villain in the future. Right now he's just a small bean now for her to mold and pinch!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 Big White Bun?Zhou Da Wa didn't put it on his mind but curled his lips.\"Wait for me.\" Putting Zhou San Wa on the ground to let him move freely, she then hummed away as she carried her big parcel back to the room.She had her own room, next to the children's room. Outside was the kitchen.\"Mother really brought back delicious food?\" In the neighboring room, Zhou Da Wa asked Zhou Er Wa.Zhou Er Wa pouted. When his mother just got back, he thought so. After being reminded by Big Brother, he didn't have any hope. Even though he looked three years old, he was already sharpwitted.Under the command of Zhou number two, besides killing the male lead, it was possible for a tie when fighting with the male lead, if it weren't for Zhou number three ruining everything.\"Keep acting like this, I'll beat you!\" Although Zhou Dawa didn't understand his brother's expression, he still felt like he was being underestimated and glared at him.\"Who do you want to beat?\" Lin Qing He opened the door and spoke out.And she was holding a bun in her hand at this time, it was still warm, and the scent emitted from it made Zhou Dawa and Zhou Er Wa gulp: \"Big white bun?\"\"Want to eat?\" Lin Qing He glanced at the brothers.\"Want.\" Both nodded honestly.Even Zhou San Wa stepped forward to hug her feet. He also wanted to eat.\"Will you be obedient in the future?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Mother, I have always been obedient, and the disobedient one is Big Brother.\" Zhou Er Wa expressed.\"You dare to talk about, I'll really beat you!\" Zhou Da Wa angrily roared.\"Beat who?\" Lin Qing He glared.Zhou Da Wa wanted to reply with 'beat Second Brother', but in the end, the big white bread was too tempting to say anything.\"Half for you guys. I still have it in the cupboard, so if you behave well, you will have it for the next meal. But if you are not obedient, eat cornmeal cakes.\" Lin Qing He stated.Compared to the earlier famine years, cornmeal cakes are undoubtedly a good thing. In those years, it wasn't a lie to say that they ate bran and coarse vegetable. Obviously, Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa did not like to eat it.After all, they received allowances and ration coupons that villains' father sent back each month, all of which the original owner had to bring their marriage certificate to get.So even if the original owner does not go to the field to earn workpoint, living standard at home was not bad. But eating cornmeal cakes was a common occurrence.\"I'll be obedient!\"Lin Qing He finished speaking, and Zhou Er Wa immediately answered.Zhou Da Wa scolded him for being gutless, but under Lin Qing He's gaze, he also quickly followed and copied him.Then Lin Qing He decided to give these three villains half a white bun...A white flour bun wasn't small. Lin Qing He just transmigrated over and couldn't fully digest the matter. So eating half a white bun was enough.The remaining half was given to the three sons, but half of the white bun was not enough for them to eat. Lin Qing He looked at the egg jar at home and there were a few eggs inside. So she beat the three eggs for their brother. She poured boiling water over it, and it became egg drop soup.\"Mother, I not full yet!\" Zhou Da Wa quickly drank and declared.Zhou Er Wa was not full either, at most was half full.On the other hand, Zhou San Wa's appetite was not that big. With a few gulps of the egg drop soup, he was full.Of course, he got full fast and got hungry just as quick. Children of this age were generally white and fat, but Zhou San Wa was skinny.Although the children in this era were all like this, as they were thirty to forty percent starved. They all lived like this. However, on this side, it was because the original owner didn't care.Because with the villains\u2019 father\u2019s allowance, there was no shortage of food in the family. The three children could avoid being raised to this extent.\"Both of you, go to sleep on the kang,\" Lin Qing He said.\"I'm going out to play.\" Zhou Da Wa immediately rebutted.\"Go out after sleep and I'll cook meat for you tonight.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Really?\" Zhou Da Wa quickly enquired.Not just him, even Zhou Er Wa's eyes also brightened as he looked at their mother who was a little different today.\"It's fine if you don't eat.\" Lin Qing He gruffly responded.Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa immediately hopped to Kang. Zhou San Wa couldn\u2019t get up, was still off the Kang, uttering 'ah-ah'. Zhou Da Wa was afraid that this little brother would cause them to have no meat tonight, so he came down, picked him up and Zhou Er Wa pulled him up.Really must say, the two of them really got Zhou San Wa onto the kang.\"... sleep well.\" Lin Qing He covered them with thin sheets and said.\"Is there really meat tonight?\" Zhou Da Wa confirmed again.\"Yes.\" Lin Qing He nodded with certainty.Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa were relieved and then took their brother to sleep together.Lin Qing He returned to her room regardless of whether they were whispering in private.It was a single room, but it wasn't big. It only got a kang and a closet, as well as a washbasin and a towel. Next to it were rice crock, corn pot, egg jar, half a bottle of oil and salt container that was about to reach the bottom.These were stored in her room.Because there was a small door in her room, she didn't put it in the cabinet. In other people's homes, it was directly placed and locked in the cabinet.Lin Qing He was also a little tired. The original owner had walked all morning and she also just transmigrated over. So she came out to close the door and decided to let other matters wait till she wakes up.So the mother and sons took an afternoon nap together.At the same time, in the remote frontline units, Zhou Qing Bai was immediately sent to their district hospital for an emergency operation.Several of the partners rescued by him almost kneeled down to the doctor, willed for the doctor and nurse to save their old Zhou!The district's major upper ranks deeply frowned when he learned that Zhou Qing Bai was seriously injured and was sent to the district hospital. He was very optimistic about Zhou Qing Bai, but this time it may not be easy to save his life. In the future ...\"Prepare for a small clerical job for little Zhou.\" Finally, one upper rank sighed and declared.\"With Little Zhou's temperament, I'm afraid he won't stay again.\" Another upper rank also felt deep pity, shaking his head.If this hadn't happened this time, Little Zhou's position would have also be promoted again. It wasn't easy for the farmer's children to break into the current spot with their bare hands. Really a pity.Hearing this, the previous upper rank was also silent, because they all knew Zhou Qing Bai's character. If he could not go to the front, he would not stay.\"Then used the credit he made this time to apply for a living allowance for him to take home. I heard that he still had three sons at home.\" Finally, the upper rank stated.The other one had no comments.While at home, the mother and sons, who carelessly and heartlessly slept, didn't receive the legendary telepathy-connection at all.Lin Qing He slept till four o'clock. When she woke up, her three sons were awake as well. Probably because of thinking about the meat she promised, Zhou Da Wa didn't run out to play in private.Lin Qing He scooped up and washed her face.She took out two new towels from her space. The color was very low-key, one for herself and one for their brothers.As for the original owner's treasured one, she was going to use it to wipe the feet of the three Zhou brothers.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 Egg &amp; Lean Pork CongeeShe called them over, wiped the face of all three brothers, washed their hands again and then sent them off.\"Mother, it's time to cook.\" Zhou Da Wa reminded her.The children were hungry fast. At this time they all became hungry.Lin Qing He relied on the fact that the brothers were all young and didn\u2019t know what she brought back in her big package, so she went in and got an apple. Without peeling, she just washed, cut to two quarters, and gave a quarter each to Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa.As for San Wa, Lin Qing He took a spoon and scraped apple puree to feed him.Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa never expected there was such delicious fruit to eat. Even though it was only a quarter, the two of them were very satisfied.Lin Qing He was not worried, because there were apples and pears at this side, but there were no grapes. She intended to eat the grapes secretly. Occasionally taking advantage of the absence of the two big ones, she can feed some to the little baby, who can\u2019t talk yet.As for Zhou Er Wa, he was too ghostly sharp. Don't give it to him to eat, so she can save all the trouble that comes from eating.After feeding half to San Wa, Lin Qing He ate the rest herself. Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa, who already finished and was prepared to protest about her bias, shut up.\"I'll make meat for you, so take care of your brother.\" Lin Qing He got up and instructed.Because the white bun at noon and the little half of the apple, Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa dare not disobey.Although they were young and don't understand a lot, they are not stupid. They can slightly feel that their mother seems to treat them better than before?Lin Qing He entered the kitchen.There was only one earth stove in the kitchen, but the wok on the top was good. Although the spatula was very old, it was in good condition.But these were all exchanged by the original owner with her maternal family after her family separation. She had exchanged them for a large price. And it was because of the kitchen equipment, old Zhou Family only agreed on splitting the family.Otherwise, the wok would have been a big problem after separation. Industrial coupons were not easy to get, and the old Zhou family didn't have any.Although the kitchen was simple, everyone else was in a similar condition.From young Lin Qing He had lived with her grandmother in the countryside. So it wasn't hard for her to use this old stove pot, even if she wasn't used to it. What's more, she still had the memory of the original owner. She scrubbed the wok, boiled water, and then got a pot of rice washed.There was rice in the barrel and flour in the other barrel. But there wasn't much. The original owner had not thought of buying rice and flour on this trip, just cloth for herself to make clothes.Lin Qing He shook her head, took a bag of rice from the space and poured it in. And then took another bag of flour, poured it into the other barrel and filled the jar full with eggs.The three kids in the family don't care about these, and they don't know to count. At most, they know that there are more eggs and more rice. As for how much, they don't know. So it was up to her how it goes.After doing this, Lin Qing He took a piece of lean meat from the space, about 150-200g of it. She planned to make egg lean and pork congee (rice porridge).As the knife at home was very blunt, Lin Qing He frankly took a new old-fashioned styled kitchen knife from the space and used it.Since there are few kids at home, as long as she did not do anything out of the ordinary, she was not worried at all. Even if there was something out of the ordinary, can she be worst than the original owner?Besides, she collected these materials to make herself more comfortable, but not for them to collect dust.Her new knife was sharp. After washing, it was much easier to chop the meat. The 150-200g lean meat was soon all chopped up. At this time, the water in the pot was also boiled, so the washed rice was poured into it, and then she started stirring with a large spoon to avoid them sticking to the bottom.\"Mother, what are you making for us?\" At some unknown time, Zhou Er Wa appeared at the kitchen door and blinkingly asked.Lin Qing He said: \"Tonight we're having egg and lean pork congee tonight.\"\"Is it delicious?\" Zhou Er Wa never had egg and lean pork congee before. But there are eggs and meat, just think about it, it must be very delicious.\"That's of course. It'll make you swallow your tongue later.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Er Wa could hear that his mother was joking, looked at her, and then cautiously walked over to hug her leg. Lin Qing He glanced down at him, \"What's wrong?\"\"Mother, you're so good,\" Zhou Er Wa gazed at her.\"It's enough to know I'm good. In the village, whose mother is a stepmother. Look at the lives of other children, and then look at you, three brothers.\" Lin Qing He said.This wasn't a false statement. A household in the village married in a stepmother and toward the former wife's children, she beat and berated. Their lives weren't easy.Zhou Er Wa giggled, \"Mother, don't scare me.\"\"Won't scare you. Take good care of your younger brother, and I'll have a few new clothes made for you brothers this New Year.\" Lin Qing He promised.\"New clothes?\" Zhou Da Wa heard this as soon as he brought San Wa in and his eyes brightened.\"Mother, do I also get new clothes?\" Zhou Er Wa also had an anxious face.Lin Qing He opened the lid and without turning her head back as she answered, \"Be obedient and not do bad things, there will be delicious food and new clothes. But if you are not obedient, then go wear your broken clothes and nibble your cornmeal cake.\"\"I'll be good!\" The brothers shouted immediately.\"Good!\" San Wa echoed.Lin Qing He looked at him in surprise: \"San Wa can speak?\"\"Ah.\" San Wa immediately hugged her legs and act spoiled.Come on, back to his original form again.However, Lin Qing He was not worried at all. Under the author's pen, he started talking later. Later, he became a guy who is so skilled at talking that he can coax a girl into bursting in joy.Lin Qing He said to the two big ones: \"Do you know where the eggs are? Go in and each get two.\"\"I know.\" The two older ones left to get the eggs.One in each hand meant a total of four. Sure enough, the brothers didn't think about why there were more eggs.Lin Qing He let Zhou Da Wa go in to get the salt. At this time, the salt was the kind of coarse ones. Lin Qing He glanced and sent out all three brothers.Then she took out a pack of table salt and used it.Now that she had materials in the space, it goes without saying she would use the materials in the space first.Anyway, there are fifty pounds of salt in her space.After the congee was cooked, Lin Qing He put the minced meat in it and evenly mixed it. She stirred the beaten egg in, added a little salt and this pot of egg and lean pork congee was ready.Don't know if it was because the original owner hadn't eaten meat for too long, Lin Qing He felt it was very fragrant.So don't mention the three sons. All three brothers stared into the kitchen.\"All of you wait, it's very hot.\" Lin Qing He said as she took the bowls, ladled one bowl each for Zhou Dawa and Zhou Er Wa and placed it on the side.\"I can blow my own food!\" Zhou DaWa immediately said.\"I can too,\" Zhou Er Wa followed.And Zhou San Wa, who was still unable to speak, ran over to hug her leg and screaming 'ah-ah'. His eyes were desperately staring at the porridge.Lin Qing He picked up Zhou San Wa and left the porridge in the kitchen to cool. She brought Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa out.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9. Sound bitchyShe carried Zhou San Wa. Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa wanted to eat meat congee, so they do not want to leave. However, Lin Qing He had a task for both of them: \"Go and call your grandma to come over.\"\"Call grandma to drink meat congee?\" Asked Zhou Er Wa.\"Your grandma usually treats you well and it's only right to call her over to have a bowl of meat congee. Piety is the foundation of all virtues. You need to be filial to your elders, okay?\" Lin Qing He explained.\"Mother, you are not always filial to grandma.\" Zhou Er Wa blinked.Lin Qing He choked, pretended to be angry: \"Are you going or not? If you don't go call your grandma over, all of you don't get to eat!\"\"I'm going to call grandma now!\" Zhou Da Wa said.After he finished speaking, he opened the door and sprinted out. Lin Qing He looked at Zhou Er Wa. Zhou Er Wa responded: \"Brother already went.\"It meant that one was enough, no need for him.Lin Qing He didn't bother about him then. Zhou Er Wa spoke: \"Mother, I want to eat first, I'm hungry.\"\"If you're not afraid of your elder brother coming back and beating you, then you can not wait for him. This time I will definitely not stop him when he beat you.\" Lin Qing He said with a smile.Zhou Er Wa knew that his elder brother's fists were powerful, so he stopped talking and waited honestly.Although they were separated, the house was not far away from the old Zhou's house. It takes less than two minutes to run on the foot for Da Wa.But even at this distance, the original owner had never been there again. She never thought herself was as Old Zhou Family's daughter-in-law and everyone knew this.Therefore, Mother Zhou was surprised when Zhou Da Wa came to find her and said his mother was looking for her.Because she was clear about Fourth Daughter-in-law's character. She usually wanted to stay away from them. How could she take the initiative to invite her over?Toward Lin Qing He sending Da Wa over to call her instead of Lin Qing He coming to find her, Mother Zhou did not care, because there were more worst things than this. For example, the ruckus to split the family at the time. That was really going all the way out. Not letting her split off, she'll go die together with Fourth Son's unborn child.\"Mother, go over and see. Maybe there's really a matter.\" Third Zhou Sister-in-law said as she held her stomach.\"Third Auntie, when will little brother come out?\" Zhou Da Wa asked as soon as he saw her belly.These words made Third Zhou Sister-in-law, who only had daughters so far, smiled with more sincerity and replied: \"It will be two months. When the time comes, play with little brother?\"It was said that the child's eyes are wise. From the first time, Zhou Da Wa saw her belly, he always says it' a little brother. This made Third Zhou Sister-in-law, who didn't really like his mother a.k.a her Fourth Sister-in-law, be friendly with him.\"Okay, when little brother comes out, I will take him around to play.\" Zhou Da Wa cheerfully promised.Afterward, he couldn't wait to pull grandma away.Truthfully, Mother Zhou was not so kind. She just favored her youngest son, so she also loved these grandsons. They also knew that their grandma dotes on them, otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t dare to pull her like this.\"What's the hurry?\" Said Mother Zhou verbally.Mentally, she started to figure out what Fourth Daughter-in-law wanted to do. Was there no food and wanted to take advantage of the autumn harvest to buy food with the family?That shouldn't be. Fourth Daughter-in-law always turned her elbows outward. She had always bought them at the market and disdained to have exchange with old Zhou Family's people.They have a market here. In the countryside, there was no need for a food coupon to buy food, just money was enough.Fourth Son sent money back every month. She wasn't short of food and drink. Just by looking at how well-fed she was, one can tell.If it weren\u2019t for her fourth son, this lazy girl who only knew to eat would have been pulled out and have her acts criticize by all.This wasn't Mother Zhou joking. Now it was quite strict, however, because there was Zhou Qing Bai, a divine needle which guarded the sea (T/N: a reference from Journey to the West Chinese novel?). Old Zhou Family members were highly respected whenever they go out.The original owner thought Zhou San Wa was still too young and Zhou Da Wa was not as sensible as the female kid. He didn't do any chores at all, so of course, there was no food share at the end of the year.In half a month or so, the production team will kill pigs to reward everyone, but the original owner does not have any pork work points. If she wanted to eat pork, it was possible. After all, they are all from one village. She just needed to use the money to buy it from the team. And it was leftovers after everyone else picked their share.But the leftovers were also good. In this era, anything with oil was good stuff.The original owner had done that and didn't care that in others' eyes, she was a spendthrift and that marrying someone like her was three lifetime of misfortune for a good guy like Zhou Qing Bai.Of course, this was what women thought. Every time men see the original owner's swaying, healthy posture and the way she carried her face and figure when going out, they can\u2019t help but take a few more glances. And then feel that Zhou QingBai wasn't blessed. To marry a beautiful girl like this, he can't sleep with her for more than two-three days a year.It's not that some bachelors didn't have thoughts (of doing bad things) in the village. It was just that the current social atmosphere was the best security, so who dares to do anything?And take look at whose woman it was. This was Zhou Qing Bai's woman, the daughter-in-law of the old Zhou family.Even though Old Zhou Family was dissatisfied with her for causing a ruckus to split, but if something really happened, the dozen to twenty people in old Zhou Family will definitely unify to fight outsiders.At this time, people wanted more sons exactly for this reason.To put it awkwardly, if there was no son at home, there's no power to go out and quarrel with others.But the most important reason was at that stage, the original owner, who was still dreaming of becoming an official wife, don't want any dust in her sight. She looked down at these single bumpkins.Not to mention the bachelors, she even looked down on the urban educated youths who went to the countryside.But then the dream shattered, so she lowered the standard.Along the way, Mother Zhou had misgivings. It was until she reached the house and she saw Fourth Daughter-in-law carrying the egg and lean pork congee, she was stunned: \"Where did you get your pork?\"\"I bought it from that part in the city,\" Lin Qing He replied casually, as she held San Wa.That part referred to the black market, but it was inconvenient to say with children present.In the county town, a black market existed. It was a place for private transactions. The original owner had visited there as well, but not to buy meat and grain, but to buy cotton.She bought one jin of cotton at the Demand and Supply Cooperative, and the remaining jin was bought in the black market.Mother Zhou understood. She knew that Fourth Daughter-in-law was a daring one, but she didn't expect her to be that daring. To even go to the black market!\"Mother, you don't need to talk about me. My sons are all growing. How can it do to be without meat from the start to the end of the year?\" Lin Qing He said.Mother Zhou mentally commented, 'I hadn't seen you show any affection toward your children before. If you have any tricks, show them already and don't drag on these.Lin Qing He said: \"Today's made a bit too much meat congee. This autumn harvest has been very busy, mother, you have some for nourishment.\"This was not surprising when the other three daughters-in-law said it to Mother Zhou. But the words were spoken by Fourth Daughter-in-law, so she should be careful.\"Say it. Did something happen to you?\" Without being roundabout with her, Mother Zhou asked her directly.\"I bought some cotton and cloth from the black market and plan to make a new one for these three boys, but my skills are lacking as I can make my own. Mother, how about you help me to bring it back to Third Sister-in-law to avoid me ruining it. Third Sister-in-law's craftsmanship is excellent and among the sister-in-law, I only have taken a liking to hers. Treat the leftover fabric as a fee for her. \"Lin Qing He said.These words were said very bitch-like. But this was the original owner's tone.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 Well Made FoundationMother Zhou also knew she was distressed for herself, as for others, don't think about it. In fact, the clothes Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa wore were from a year ago. At that time, it was made a bit longer and was wearable even to now.At that time, it was made by Third Sister-in-law. And because of this, Zhou Da Wa would 'little brother' whenever he saw Third Auntie's belly...Must say he was discerning.\"But third daughter-in-law's belly is so big now.\" Although she doted her three grandchildren, Mother Zhou was hesitant.\"How far along is she?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"There are still two months left,\" Mother Zhou answered.\"Then Mother, go back and ask Third Sister-in-law to see if she wants to or not. If she is willing, I can give her two pounds of brown sugar to nourish her body while she is confined in birth rest.\" Lin Qing He stated.\"Brown sugar? Where did you get the brown sugar?\" Mother Zhou couldn't help saying.\"With money, naturally there is brown sugar.\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.When Mother Zhou heard it, she understood that it must have been obtained from the black market.Lin Qing He also what kind of character the original owner was, she put Zhou San Wa in her arms and said, \"Mother, you feed San Wa first. I'm going in to get brown sugar.\"At this time, brown sugar was a rare thing. Especially for the soon-to-give-birth Third Sister-in-law, it was definitely a scarce item.When Lin Qing He returned to her room, she took two jin of it out of the space. In her space, she only had twenty jin ( or 10kg), so it was not much.Two jin of brown sugar was packed in a clean jar, which was a lot of weight, and what's more the color of this brown sugar was also good quality.\"Mother, have a look.\" Lin Qing He showed her the brown sugar.Toward the business-like tone, Mother Zhou didn't find it strange. Having a quick look and she said, \"Then I'll take it back and ask for you?\"\"All right.\" Lin Qing He nodded and pointed to the porridge: \"This is for Mother to nourish your body. Have it.\" It was an appearance of once this passes, it expires.If she had acted filial, Mother Zhou would panic in her heart and not eat it. But seeing her like this, Mother Zhou thought 'I'm your mother-in-law, so what if I eat this?'So she ate the bowl of egg and lean pork congee as well. The taste was really fragrant.Then she took a jar of brown sugar and went back.\"Mother, do you really want Third Auntie to make clothes for us?\" Zhou Da Wa's eyes shone brightly.\"It's a big jar of brown sugar.\" Zhou Er Wa was focus on that.Zhou San Wa was already full and played by himself in the yard. Lin Qing He started eating by herself, and said, \"One for each person, no more. As for the brown sugar, it takes a lot of care to make clothes for you, so I need to give some fee for the effort. \"Although she inherited the original owner's skill, she really can't make children's clothes. Probably was because the original owner's obsession was too deep, she will make ...\"Mother, if you do it yourself, you don't have to give Third Auntie brown sugar.\" Er Wa was still thinking about this.Lin Qing He stared: \"If I don't make clothes for you, I don't have to give this brown sugar!\"With this sentence, Er Wa shut up.Lin Qing He wasn't going to spoil him and drank her egg and lean pork congee. After a while, she remembered, \"You have to change your shoes. I have to make shoes for you as well. It would have been good to have a daughter to help out, but you all are sons. Can't count on it any of you. Giving birth to sons is making debts.\"When she said this, Mother Zhou had just returned. And her face was unchanged. This Fourth Daughter-in-law is lazy to death, so naturally, she wishes for a daughter to work for her.\"Your Third Sister-in-law agreed.\" Mother Zhou said when she came in.\"I'm finished. Mother, wait a moment, I'll go in to get the cloth and cotton.\" Lin Qing He put down her tableware and said.It was already the end of September now and it wasn't that fast to make cotton coats. Afraid it will be around mid-October when the cotton coats for the three brothers are done. At that time, it will be cold. Now it was one day different from another.And as Third Sister-in-law's belly grows bigger, so can't really order her around later.Lin Qing He went in and took the cloth and two pounds of cotton.This time the cloth bought back was not only for the original owner herself. The original owner intended to send it to her maternal family to gain face. In fact, one jin of two jin of cotton was prepared for her maternal family.But now Lin Qing He was here, old Lin Family better not expect anything. If there was a chance, she still wanted to take back the new military coat that Zhou Qing Bai sent back before!Counting how much it takes to make her own clothes and the amount reserved for old Lin Family, it was just right to make three sets of winter clothes for the three brothers. After all, Zhou Da Wa would need a lot of fabrics because she had to reserve some length to avoid it being too short when he grew next year.The same thing for Zhou Er Wa. Actually, there was no need to do it for Zhou San Wa, as above him were two older brothers. But since they were making it, then they should make it for all three brothers.Anyway, she didn't need to use her hands, just only move her mouth.As a low-rank female cannon fodder, she was that capricious!Mother Zhou did not expect that she could get such good cloth and so much cotton, and what's more, it wasn't for herself but for her three sons.This was somewhat comforting for Mother Zhou. But it was inevitable that she'll say a few more words: \"Now Da Wa and the others are still young, but within a few years, they will all grow up one by one. At that time, it will cost money to marry a wife... \"\"Mother, don't worry, I know.\" Lin Qing He interrupted her directly and said.Mother Zhou choked, mentally said, 'You understand? What do you understand? Whose life isn't like a tight belt? You are eating congee from outside. As well as that, egg and pork are in the congee. How much does it cost?'But in the end, the original owner had a well-laid foundation, so Mother Zhou didn't go too far and stopped talking. She took the cloth and cotton and went back.As soon as she left, Lin Qing He was actually quietly relieved in her heart.In fact, she was asked to deal with Mother Zhou like this, she really couldn't. But according to today's performance, it seems that Mother Zhou adapts well to her performance?Oh, original owner, original owner! You can be considered doing a good deed.Lin Qing He was very emotional. With such an extraordinary foundation, even if she acted out of character, it won't be excessive now.In a good mood, she picked up Zhou San Wa and kissed him, causing Zhou San Wa to giggle.Both Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa saw it, and they couldn't help staring at Lin Qing He. Lin Qing He kissed each of their foreheads.Zhou Da Wa blushed and said, \"I'm going out to play!\" Then he ran out.Zhou Er Wa was also a little embarrassed and ran out.Lin Qing He didn't bother about them either. She divided a bowl of congee for Mother Zhou. There was almost one bowl left in the pot. Lin Qing He scooped it up and put it aside.Then she cleaned up the tableware and boiled the water while she was at it to prepare for the kids to wash up when they come back.Mother Zhou brought the cloth and cotton back.Actually at this time was getting off work hour, but old Zhou Family members haven't returned yet. It wasn't five o'clock yet. Mother Zhou had been working for three days and couldn't keep going, so she rested today and not go work. Her family was large, so it didn't matter if she rested for half a day.As for Third Sister-in-law, her pregnancy month was big, so she was responsible for cooking at home. Of course, Eldest Sister-in-law, whose pregnancy was small, also helped out. However Mother Zhou was resting today, so she was replaced by Mother Zhou. Otherwise, it was usually Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law was responsible at home.Seeing the cloth and cotton brought back by Mother Zhou, Third Sister-in-law was envious. However, this can't be enviable. She looked at the cloth size and the amount of cotton, and she said with some joy in her heart: \"Mother, Fourth sister-in-law request that Da Wa and his brothers each one set of clothes? And the rest is for me?\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11. Zhou Family's Affair\"That's what she said, but you have to leave extra length for them, as they grow up fast.\" Mother Zhou still loved them a lot, so she said it like this.\"That is a must,\" Third Sister-in-law complied.Mother Zhou nodded and said nothing more. In fact, except for Fourth Daughter-in-law, none of the other three made her worry.Third Sister-in-law started to estimate in her heart. After finishing Zhou Da Wa's and his brothers', there was still a lot of fabric left and adding the bits from last time, she can still make a warm jacket for her daughter.Coupled with the two jin of brown sugar given by fourth's wife, this action was still very generous.Just looking at it, Third Sister-in-law was very satisfied. But now was not the time for this. She placed the cloth and cotton in her room and went to the kitchen to help Mother Zhou.As a matter of fact, everyone was dissatisfied with the matter that the original owner had moved out at the beginning, but as time passed, everyone felt it was really fortunate.Because the original owner never worked at all. When she first got married, she would say this hurt, this ache. In short, she didn't work no matter what.But where does the work point come from if she didn't work? This was a person who eats free rice. She had hands and feet, and still want the whole family to support her!Everyone had an objection at that time.Especially because Mother Zhou felt like she was in debt to the original owner, as at the time her son left within a day of their wedding. So she let the original owner take Zhou Qing Bai's allowance.Then asked her to pay the living expenses to the family, so even if she did not go to work, it was Zhou Qing Bai who raised her. Others can't really say anything.However, Mother Zhou did not expect that it was because of this that the original owner gained more courage. Otherwise, she would not dare to act suicidal once she confirmed pregnant.Made it looked like no one else had been pregnant before.Contrary to expectation, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou, happened to eat this cake (fall for this act).The reason for this, in the final analysis, was because Father Zhou and Mother Zhou doted on their little son.However, when the original owner was there, their family was very crowded. Because they were newly-wedded and it was the youngest son of Father Zhou and Mother Zhou, the family arranged for a room for them when Zhou Qing Bai married.Others don't have this treatment. They were all crowded in a room, but at that time there were not many children, so it was okay. It was just that the couple's nightlife was somewhat embarrassing.At that time, it wasn't that the three branches didn't have other thoughts toward the original owner getting a room for herself. It was the same phrase, who made Zhou Qing Bai the most doted and youngest son of Father Zhou and Mother Zhou?Another thing was that before Zhou Qing Bai got married, the money was sent to the family. It can be said that adding up the earning of eldest three brothers in the Zhou Family didn't even meet the amount Zhou Qing Bai earned.So even if they have an objection, they have to hold back.Originally, the only original owner got special treatment, but after she fought to split from the family...At that time, all three sisters-in-law were watching the drama but didn't expect her to use her tummy as a protection amulet, and she was able to move out on her own.However, after she split up, in order to appease the other three daughters-in-law, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou gave each of them their own room. Which was much better than being crowded together.At that time, the original owner's initial room was included and was given to Third Sister-in-law.Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law were all divided into one room each.Now the other three branches in the old Zhou's family were all at ease. Father Zhou took out all the allowance bills sent back by Zhou Qing Bai in the last three years, as at that time the original owner was moving out after all.At that time, the allowance was only a bit over 20 yuan per month. So it was more than 200 yuan a year, and more than 600 yuan in three years.To build the original owner's two-bedroom house with a small central room and other inexpensive bits, it cost more than two hundred yuan altogether.It wasn't a small sum.But compared to what Zhou Qing Bai sent back, it wasn't really much.Mother Zhou used the reason that the money was Fourth Son's filial piety to them, old couple, and did not intend to give it to the original owner. Truthfully she was worried that the original owner will cause harm to the saving.The original owner got her share of grains and oils, naturally. And what's more, she would receive the allowance from Zhou Qing Bai every month.So she really didn't make trouble with Mother Zhou again.As everyone had a room, and their family can live in a much more spacious room as well as knowing Zhou Qing Bai sent that much money home, they weren't onto the case of building a house for the original owner.Because five years ago, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou were still young, they didn't need to be financially supported by their children. Even if Father Zhou and Mother Zhou were still under 60 years old, they were still healthy!It can be said that even if the original owner had split away, the original owner was more filial respected toward Father Zhou and Mother Zhou by a few hundred yuan than them.Although this money was earned by Zhou Qing Bai, it made no difference.With the family divide, they did not need to watch the original owner do nothing did or her expression of everyone owe her. So after all these years, old Zhou Family was extremely harmonious.Although there was occasional envy toward the original owner not needing to go to the field to work and just wait for her man to send allowance back to support her, there was nothing to hold a grudge for on the surface.At about six o'clock, the rest of the old Zhou Family returned.It was now the autumn harvest time, it was very busy. Being busy from the start of the year was all for this big harvest. No one dares to be lazy, otherwise, with one autumn rain, their one-year effort will be in vain. The whole family's livelihood can't survive.Therefore, they all need to swiftly collect the grain. Then they can be at peace.\"There is brown sugar water in the room, specially made for you father and daughter. Hurry, go drink it.\" Third Sister-in-law saw her man and daughter's sunburnt face and then whispered quickly.Third Sister-in-law's daughter ranked fifth among the daughters of old Zhou Family, so she was named Zhou Wu Ni. (T/N: Wu= fifth Ni= girl)Zhou Wu Ni was initially a bit exhausted, but her eyes brightened when she heard this.Zhou Qing Sen didn't ask anything, just took his daughter back to their room. The father and daughter were satisfied after drinking brown sugar water.The next step was everyone to wash their faces and hands and prepare to eat.The food at old Zhou Family\u2019s home was good. Cornmeal pancakes are served with rice soup and a pot of scrambled eggs. Although the scramble only had five or six eggs, there were few other dishes. Although they were all vegetarian, other families may not even have this food.This was because the current autumn harvest was too busy and very tiring, otherwise, they wouldn't usually eat like this and don't have such food.After eating, everyone went to rest.Third Sister-in-law held her stomach as she returned. Now that her month was getting bigger, the tableware and chopsticks were left for Second Sister-in-law to clean up. Eldest Sister-in-law was also pregnant, so she also rights to rest.Although Second Sister-in-law curled her lips in displeasure, she said nothing. As the other two had done it when she was heavily pregnant previously. This was the rules of the old Zhou family and it had always been fair.Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law didn't know what happened at home today. They all went on with what they should be doing.Third Sister-in-law returned to the house and was greeted by the father's and daughter's question.Zhou Wu Ni was six years old. At this age, children were already sensible and understood very well that brown sugar was so precious. How could her mother have it?If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12. Need to buy it sooner or later.\"Fourth Sister-in-law given it.\" Third Sister-in-law explained.It was almost six o'clock at this time, but the sky was still bright. Now the sky can start to dim around half past six.So Third Sister-in-law took out the cloth and cotton.Zhou Qing Sen understood then. Fourth's wife wanted to make clothes: \"Isn't she able to make clothes by herself? How can she bear to give you two pounds of brown sugar for you to make it?\"\"She doesn't know how to make it for Da Wa and the others. So naturally, it can only be brought to me to make it.\" Third Sister-in-law's hands started moving as her mouth clarified.Toward her own skill, she was still very confident.\"She is using such a good cloth and cotton to make winter clothes for Da Wa and others?\" Zhou Qing Sen was really surprised.\"In the end, she's their biological mother. And what's more, the brothers really don't have any cotton-padded clothes this year,\" continued Third Sister-in-law.\"Mother, when do I have new clothes to wear?\" Zhou Wu Ni looked at the cloth and cotton with an envious face.She actually wanted to be Fourth Auntie's daughter, because Fourth Auntie's life was really good. Da Wa and the others didn\u2019t need to pick up cow dung to earn work points or even collect wheat ears in the field. Every day they got to play.\"Mother had looked for you. These cloths and cotton will have leftovers after I finished the brothers' set. And Mother still has some leftover cloth saved. When the time comes, add that bit, and I'll have enough to make you a new jacket.\" Third Sister-in-law said.\"Then Mother, hurry up,\" Zhou Wu Ni excitedly cried.Then Zhou Qing Sen remarked: \"You have such a big belly, she still makes you make clothes.\"\"It's cause she saw I got a big belly, otherwise why can she bear to give me two jin of brown sugar? It looks top-quality. The last set I was asked to make it for Da Wa and his brother is what the brothers are currently wearing for autumn. She gave me three eggs then,\" said Third Sister-in-law.Mother Zhou didn't confiscate the two jin of brown sugar, instead, let her store it. So Third Sister-in-law was especially satisfied with this.Brown sugar was a scarce product. And it was two jin.Zhou Qing Sen didn't say anything. His wife wasn't afraid of getting tired, instead, she was delighted.People in this era were keen on saving kerosene. After all, the supply was limited every month. So they went to bed early.It was only eight o'clock, and Mother Zhou and Father Zhou went to the Kang to sleep.Mother Zhou mentioned about today's affairs: \"Fourth's wife invited me to eat a bowl of egg and lean pork today.\"\"Since she gave it, eat it.\" Father Zhou was tired. He earned ten points and was very exhausted.\"Those fabrics and cotton are good conditions. I thought she was going to make it for herself. Didn't expect it is for Da Wa and his three brothers,\" Mother Zhou continued.Today, she didn't work, so she just heard the villagers said fourth's wife went to the market again. Only then did she go to see the brothers. She heard that she came back with a big package.Two jin of cotton and fabric were really enough for a big package. She never expected it was bought for her three grandsons.\"She's the brothers' mother. No matter how bad she can get, they all are meat that fell from her stomach.\" Father Zhou was sleepy but still responded.Although he had some opinions on the Fourth Daughter-in-law, there was nothing to complain, now that she was happy to make winter coats for his grandsons, and also make egg and lean pork congee to eat.\"It's just she is too spendthrift. Fabric, cotton, egg, lean pork, and two jin of brown sugar. From her look, I think she is familiar with the black market. There's definitely not much left of the monthly allowance sent by Fourth Son. There is certainly not much money left. I told her to save a little money, and she found me nosy.\" Mother Zhou said.Father Zhou had already snore. It was clear he fell asleep.Mother Zhou said nothing and soon fell asleep.The rest of old Zhou family was in a similar state.As for Lin Qing He's side, she was tossing around, unable to sleep.It was too early to sleep at eight o'clock. It was modern-day her night-life hadn't started yet.However, she entered the countryside, so she can only follow the custom. The two big ones in the next room were already sound asleep. As Zhou San Wa was still young, he slept with her.Before going to bed, Lin Qing He warmed the bowl of leftover congee from the dinner with boiling water and split it between the brothers.Of course, before going to bed, she gave them three baths. The three brothers washed and turned all the water black. Then she shooed them to go to Kang and sent them to sleep.Lin Qing He also scrubbed herself in the dark. It wasn't good to be without a separate bathroom.Lying in bed, her mind wandered. Don't know when she fell asleep. In the middle of the night, according to the original owner's instinct, she got up and shuued her three sons to pee so she can avoid them peeing on the Kang and she had to clean up...Because she slept too early last night, Lin Qing He got up very early the next day. As soon as she saw the three boys were still asleep, she freshened herself first.Then she busied away in the kitchen.This morning she cooked millet porridge, but there was no meat, just plain rice porridge. Besides the millet porridge, there were two white buns.Thinking of the white bread, she recalled the 500 bun reservations with the breakfast shop's aunt. That really hurt ...Soon the porridge was cooked, and the big white bun was also hot and fragrant.She shouted into the room. Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa got up, quickly dressed themselves and then climbed off the Kang. Underneath was a tall and short set of wooden stumps, almost like the role of a ladder so the brothers could get up and down more conveniently.Lin Qing He then went in, wake San Wa, washed the little boy's face, and then carried him out.\"Mother, there are big white buns!\" Zhou Da Wa washed his face and ran over. His eyes brightened.\"Go brush your teeth.\" Lin Qing He instructed.\"Mother, you didn't buy a toothbrush for me!\" Zhou Da Wa pointed out.Lin Qing He could only let him eat, and then she started thinking about when to make a trip out again?She had just visited yesterday, so to go over there today was a bit overboard. The most important part was what to do with the three children in the family. Going from the village to the town \u2019s supply and demand cooperative, was easier for her than the original owner, who spared no effort to run to the county town to buy cotton and fabric. But still, it needed at least an hour to travel from here to the town's supply and demand cooperatives.But if she didn't go, there were still many things to buy at home.In fact, according to the original owner's ideal living standard, the family's items were quite complete compared to other people's families. But in Lin Qing He's view, there are still many things needed.The original owner had only taken care of herself. Toothbrushes, other hygiene essentials, the foot bath bucket, there was only her share. The children do not have any. they shared one washbasin.Now they were young, but it won't do when they grow up.Anyway, it was necessary sooner or later, so why not buy it early.Although she planned to go again, Lin Qing He didn't go now. She decided to leave it a few days later.In a few days, the autumn harvest in the village will be completely over. Then, she can leave Er Wa and San Wa in the old Zhou's house to help her take care of them.As for Zhou Da Wa, she didn\u2019t have to worry about it. He can go off and play by himself.In the morning, they ate millet porridge, accompanied by a delicious white bun. The stuffing in this bun was particularly sufficient. The meat, half of the egg, and cabbage were enough for them to eat as a dish with the porridge.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13. Siren-likeThe mother and sons had filling breakfast. Zhou Da Wa wanted to go out to play but had been restrained back by Lin Qing He: \"Mother is going to do the laundry, you take care of your younger brothers at home. Wait for me to come back.\"Zhou Da Wa did not refute her, as he was satisfied with the meal from yesterday to this morning.Lin Qing He departed to do the laundry.There was a river on the tail of the village, which everyone goes there to wash.\"Shenzi, the autumn harvest will be over in a few days. Do you still need firewood at home?\"Lin Qing He beat the clothes with a wooden board, especially with Zhou Da Wa's clothes. It was really dirty. In her mind, she deeply yearned for the era of the washing machine, when a little girl came over and asked.As soon as Lin Qing He looked back, it then emerged from her memory: \"Little Xi ah! I do ah. We're almost out of firewood at home. When you go back and tell your elder brother that once the autumn harvest is over, send it over. How much he can get is how much I'll take. The price will be according to the amount. \"This little girl was called Zhou Xi, only about ten years old. And her brother was Zhou Dong, fifteen this year.The ancestors of the brother and sister were also relatives of the old Zhou family, but now they were distant.Their parents were gone early, and it wasn't easy for the siblings to survive. But her brother Zhou Dong was very capable, even if he was young. He followed the adults to work and could earn two work points.This wasn't a lot of food. In the end, the team pitied the brother and sister, so on the premise of obtaining everyone's consent, they gave a little more during food distribution and there were some neighbors occasionally reduce their intake. That's how the brothers and sisters survived.Initially, the brother and sister had nothing to do with the original owner, but the original owner was lazy.Her own son was still unreliable, so she asked her brother from her maternal family to send her firewood and occasionally gave him a little fee for the effort.However, her younger brother got married later on and was strictly managed by her younger sister-in-law, so he never came back.At that time, the original owner had to get the firewood by herself. How could the original owner willingly let her well-maintained hands do the rough work? If the conditions didn't allow it, she wouldn't wash the dishes, chopsticks, and clothes!But in desperation, she can only collect firewood once. In the original owner's impression, there was no work more insulting than this in the world...So, she set her eyes on Zhou Dong, who just turned 12 years old that year.She made him go get firewood for her to use and they'll treat it as she bought it from him. How could Zhou Dong not be happy? He kept at it til now.To others, the original owner said that this was not capitalism. She felt that the brother and sister don't have it easy and didn't want them to feel like they owe her, so they did this.It wasn't like nobody in the village didn't know her temperament, but at least every time the original owner paid an adequate amount to Zhou Dong.When he brought less, it was a dime. When it was more, it was two dimes. Don't look down on these one and two dimes. To the siblings, Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi, who have no other income except for fieldwork, this money allowed them to eat three full meals on days when they can't earn much work points in winter.So even when the villagers knew that the original owner was hiring child labor, they said nothing.Zhou Dong was now fifteen years old. The original owner gave him two dimes every time he sent firewood because he had grown up and gained a lot of manpower, so every time he sent a lot of firewood.This was an important income for the brother and sister.Hearing her words, Zhou Xi was really delighted and said, \"OK, I will go back and tell my elder brother to collect a lot of firewood after the autumn harvest is over.\" Then she continued: \"Shenzi, there's no one at the moment, let me wash your clothes! \"The original owner had already asked her elder brother to get firewood. Although she wished Zhou Xi could wash her clothes, she still wanted face, so she refused.But if there was no one, then the original owner will let her wash.There was really no one in this moment. Downstream had some, but not here.If it was the original owner, she wouldn't be polite (i.e accept). The original owner thought she took care of them, brother and sister, so what if she called her to wash her clothes?But Lin Qing He was not the original owner, and her lower limit did not stoop to that level.\"No need, it's just a few clothes. Once the autumn harvest is over, you go with your brother. Shenzi will have to store more firewood for the winter, so I need a lot.\" Lin Qing He replied.\"Shenzi, rest assured. We will definitely send it to Shenzi.\" Zhou Xi nodded.Lin Qing He nodded and said, \"You can return, I'm nearly finished.\"Zhou Xi saw that she really didn't plan to let her wash, so she went back first, and then reported to her brother who was going to work.\"I'll go after the autumn harvest!\" Zhou Dong uttered.Now that he can earn six points, his life should have been better, but in the end, he was at the age of puberty and ate a lot.Now Zhou Xi also followed to work, but she can only earn two work points.Lin Qing He sneaked some soap out and washed. With the soap, it was much faster. She quickly washed her clothes and returned. As for Second Sister-in-law, who was washing clothes at the downstream, she did not go to say hello when she saw her.Because the relationship between the original owner and this Second Sister-in-law wasn't really good.Second Sister-in-law brought Eldest Sister-in-law's eldest daughter Zhou Da Ni (T/N: means first/big girl) and several women to wash a family of clothes at the downstream. Naturally, she saw Lin Qing He go back and she also did not have any intention to say hello.Few other women sourly commented: \"This Sister-in-law of yours live a life more relaxed than the old landlord of the past.\"\"Don't talk nonsense like this ah! What an old landlord, our ancestors were three generations of poor peasants. Poor as a pauper.\" Second Sister-in-law immediately interjected. Lin Qing He was not very pleasing to the eye, but still, she can't let people put 'the old landlord' hat on old Zhou Family's head.\"I don't mean anything else. Just want to say, her life is going too well. She has three sons, and look at her face and figure. If someone says that she is unmarried and it is believable.\" Another older Saozi said.\"I heard that she put vanishing cream and clam oil on her face and hand every day!\" Said the former one.\"What a family-wealth-destroyer. No wonder she looks so tender that one can pinch out the water!\" Another bitterly responded.Which families weren't living on a tight budget? But Old Zhou Family's fourth daughter-in-law was not at the same level as them. She always made herself beautiful. That face and that figure were like a siren.Of course, they didn't dare to scold her outright, otherwise, they would just look for trouble. Lin Qing He wasn't one to suffer in silence, so they whispered behind her back.Second Sister-in-law brought Zhou Da Ni to wash her clothes and went home. She didn't take the incident of seeing Lin Qing He seriously, it was a usual occurrence.As for Lin Qing He, toward what was said about the original owner behind her, of course, it was no different to talking about her, she didn't treat it seriously as well.Actually, she was really satisfied with the original owner's maintenance of her figure and face. She can't deny this, nor can she get cheap and sell innocence.So they can say what they want, just don't mention it in front of her.When she was drying the clothes, Lin Qing He recalled what she thought just now when talking to Zhou Xi about accumulating firewood for the winter.According to the development of the plot, it seems that the villains' dad was injured at this time?Saozi: related=sister-in-law, unrelated=a way to call a married woman.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14. Unresponsible MotherBecause of serious injuries, the villains' father remained at that side for a month to recuperate.Afterward, he came back. It'll be the end of October or almost November in the lunar calendar when the villains' father would return.Lin Qing He felt that after the villains' father come back, she would definitely not be as free as she was now. After all, there was an adult living at home, and she couldn't be as unscrupulous as dealing with three children.So before the villains' dad comes back, she must acquire everything that should be added to the family.This era didn't have much to entertain themselves with. It was in the midst of the busy autumn harvest and the sun was still a bit merciless. The original owner's skin was very well maintained, so Lin Qing He does not want to ruin it.In fact, in her opinion, it wasn't too white. Just not tanned. But compared with the people in the village, then she was really white.So in the following days, Lin Qing He cooked at home.Because the original owner didn't interact with anyone, meaning she didn't have much communication. So it goes without saying, she could only make stuff for the children to eat at home.This made Zhou Da Wa, Zhou Er Wa, and Zhou San Wa overjoyed.Under the last few days of Lin Qing He's guidance, Zhou San Wa began to speak. As soon as he spoke, words after words jumped out of him as if a vessel in his brain opened up.Like 'meat', 'pee', 'eat', 'water', and of course, the most said was 'mother'.The three children ate with a mouthful of oil. Although the original owner was lazy but knew that she did not interact with the people around her, so she must be self-sufficient.So there was a vegetable garden in the backyard with tomatoes, cucumbers, leeks, green vegetables, and radishes planted.Varieties are relatively mixed and not planted a lot. Each one was planted one row.So naturally, it was up to Lin Qing He.Like scrambled eggs with leeks, stewed radish and bones, and fried pork slices and cucumbers. It was her choice. The three children at home did not understand these and Lin Qing He also had her explanation.She said it was bought last time and been marinated with salt.Lin Qing He also took out a piece of pork belly and a piece of loin and marinated it. She marinated it with salt and then fried it to eat. It was nice and salty. It could not be better when it was served with congee or noodles.Lin Qing He kept feeding them this way, and in just a few days, Zhou San Wa became white and delicate. Kids got chubby fast.Being nurtured like this by Lin Qing He and kept clean every day, Mother Zhou froze when she saw Zhou San Wa after coming over with the San Wa's winter clothes that Third Sister-in-law finished first once the autumn harvest was over.\"Third Sister-in-law's craftsmanship isn't bad at all.\" Lin Qing He placed Zhou San Wa in Mother Zhou's arms to let her appreciate it and took a look at a set of clothes in a small shallow basket.Third Sister-in-law's skill was pretty good, and because she did it as soon as she was free, it took only a few days for her to make San Wa's set.Of course, it was because of San Wa's smallness, and it didn't take much effort.Zhou Da Wa's and Zhou Er Wa's one should be coming soon. Now the autumn harvest was over, Third Sister-in-law she didn't have much on her hand. She can go all out in making clothes as they didn't need her for house chores.She gave enough cotton, so even if Third Sister-in-law hid a bit, the cotton coat and trousers were still made very thick.For example, in this set, it was perfect for the little one to wear in winter.Even though it was a little small, it was just this one set.\"Oh, that's right, Mother. There is no egg at home. Give me some food first, I will give money.\" Lin Qing He declared.There were no chickens at home. So naturally, the eggs that aren't laid, was eaten quickly. She intends to take a few jin out of the space, but she must have a source for eggs.\"There is some at home. How much do you want?\" Mother Zhou glanced at her and said.\"Just give me one jin. In two days, I'll have to go to the town for the market. I need to buy some stuff, so I'll get them together.\" Lin Qing He said.\"You are going to the market again?\" Mother Zhou exclaimed.\"If I don't go, what do we eat? The three boys at home have a big appetite and it\u2019s getting colder and colder. At that time, I don't want to head out. So buy what I need and the earlier it's done, the earlier it finishes. Mother, do you need to buy anything? If you do, I'll get it as well for you. \"Lin Qing He said.\"I don't lack anything.\" Mother Zhou had a change of opinion about her since she had taken good care of her three grandsons, especially little San Wa, who got a lot chubbier. But once she heard her plan to spendthrift again, her heart ached.She had the mind to say something but knew well that Fourth Daughter-in-law wouldn't listen to what she said. So she suppressed it.Lin Qing He said two days. But in fact, the next day she fed Zhou San Wa early in the morning and carried him to Mother Zhou.Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa also followed. The two actually wanted to go with their mother. Lin Qing He found the one hour plus journey was too long. She found it troublesome and what's more to bring two small kids? She didn't want to.So they were brought to the old Zhou Family. Of course, she also brought a small bag of rock candy and gave it to Mother Zhou to let her deal with it.It was still very early at this time. The rest of the old Zhou family hadn't gotten up yet, as they were very tired for a period and could finally be inactive and sleep in.Lin Qing He didn't care. She dropped the children and went out carrying a basket.\"Every day, only know how to deplete money, Don't she know to save a little money? The children are still so young. When they grow up, everything needed money?\" After she left, Mother Zhou grumbled.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law heard a voice and came out to ask what was going on. Mother Zhou didn't withhold her complaints.The Two Sister-in-law listened and remained silent, but they actually agreed with Mother Zhou. Fourth's wife really squandered away the money without a blink as if her money wasn't money.They wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. Each bit of money they spend, they got very distressed. After all, the three branches only get so much pocket money for the whole year. Because they haven't separated from the family yet, the majority of the money was kept by Mother Zhou. However, she does give them pocket money. Just one liang or so for them to save.\"But I see that Fourth Sister-in-law is putting more care toward Da Wa and his brothers.\" Eldest Sister-in-law said as she watched the brothers.At least she knew to bring San Wa over when going to the market. Before, she didn't. Just dumped them at home. Such a small child, to be so careless.Mother Zhou didn't comment.Third Sister-in-law asked Zhou Da Wa: \"Da Wa, what did your mother cook for you? Third Auntie can see that you brothers have grown a lot of meat in just a few days.\"\"Our mother made meat for us. Bacon is very fragrant!\" Zhou Da Wa said aloud.\"Meat?\" Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law was stunned. How could there be meat now?\"Why are you two asking so much? In a few days, the team will divide the meat. At that time, your share won't be missing.\" Naturally, Mother Zhou thought she knew and interrupted.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law understood that their mother-in-law did not want them to ask anymore, and they tactfully not ask anymore.This made Zhou Da Wa, who was prepared to say what his mother had made for them these days, disappointed. However, hearing the kids outside calling him to play, he said nothing and immediately dashed out.Of course, he did not forget to ask his grandma for a piece of rock candy before going out.After the rest of the old Zhou Family woke and saw Er Wa and San Wa were all here. It was only after they asked did they know the brother's irresponsible mother went to the market again.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 Long-term Meat CouponsAlthough the food had been harvested now and the overall situation had stabilized, there was still some final work to be done.After breakfast, Mother Zhou brought the two boys with her to peel corn.The corn gets peeled, threshed, then dried, and then sent to complete the final payment to the state.The day that all grain got handed over was the day of food distribution, which was what everyone waiting for.Especially the pig killing after splitting the grain.Of course, winter wheat will be planted before the pork is divided.But these have nothing to do with Lin Qing He, so she left with no burden at all.Using her impression, she walked along the road toward the town's supply and demand cooperatives.Although the supply and demand cooperatives in the communal town cannot compare with those on the county city, it still had many things, such as rice, oil, soy sauce, and vinegar.But they all need ration coupons. The original owner bought them before. There were bottles at home and she washed it a few days earlier to contain the goods that were taken out of the space. So she didn't lack these seasoning.With a subsidiary food coupon, she came to buy half a jin of dried edible fungus, as well as half a jin dried seaweed.After browsing the things nearby, there was nothing she wants.In fact, the main reason for this trip was to come and walk around, otherwise, how can she explain the materials in my hand?But toothbrushes, washbasins, and basins had to be bought.First, get a toothbrush for Da Wa and Er Wa. There was still some toothpaste at home, their mother's leftover. She can use the stock in the space herself.She didn't plan to buy the washbasin and the basin this time. It was too hard for her to carry it back on such long distance. She had other plans.After buying a toothbrush and toothpaste, she headed to the slaughterhouse in the community suburbs according to her memory.The slaughterhouse on the outskirts of the community was a very small type, and the community applied for it last year. Otherwise, the slaughterhouse was only available in the county city.However, Lin Qing He just wanted to come to the suburban area and try her luck. In fact, she also wanted to go through the motion. After all, she didn't think she could buy meat at this time.And what luck she had. She arrived there in an hour and happened to chance upon a Dajie who came out carrying the meat from inside. Lin Qing He immediately stepped up and asked: \"Dajie, did you come to buy meat?\"\"Yeah, you too? But did you make a reservation? If you didn't make an appointment, then there's nothing.\" Dajie gave her a glance and pointed out haughtily.Lin Qing He observed her blue work clothes and knew that this person knew people. She smiled and said, \"Dajie, I'm from the country, how could I have your kind of connection? Just don't know if Sister can make it convenient?\" Looking around, she made sure no one was around and took a five liang food coupon out.For those working in the commune who eat supplied food, food coupons were more important than money. Without food coupons, one cannot buy food even if one had money.This Dajie's age was already in her thirties, so she must have children at home. And at this age, the children are usually at the age with great appetite.Toward food coupons that weren't from dishonest sources delivered to their doorstep, how could she not refuse? They just have to do the matter well.\"Meizi, just say something if you need something. Dajie can help you for sure, don't be polite.\" Even if it was just a five liang food ticket, Dajie's tone also eased.\"I know, but I\u2019m from the country. I can buy food without this food ticket. In a few days, there'll be food distribution. I just have to go to the production team to buy it. My man is a soldier. He can\u2019t finish these and send it to me. It\u2019s basically useless for me to keep.\u201d Lin Qing He explained a bit.Then she went directly to the main point: \"The children at home are craving for meat. Truthfully, the team will divide the meat in a few days. But which mother is willing to see her child crave so much? So, I want to come and take a chance.\"When Dajie heard the words, she was relieved. As mothers, they really have their children on their minds.\"Dajie, I can see at a glance that you are a helpful samaritan. Can you see if you have any acquaintances? I don't need much. Just half a jin of leftover is enough. I don\u2019t have a meat coupon, but I can give more. What do you think? \"Lin Qing He stuffed the food coupon over as she talked.\"Big Meizi, you also dotes on kids. I will go in and check for you.\" This Dajie calmly accepted the food coupon and nodded.\"Alright.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Dajie went in for about five minutes before she came out and then announced: \"Big Meizi, since you don\u2019t have a coupon. it'll be nine point five per jin. If you have a coupon, you can pay seven. Big Meizi, it'll be more expensive without a coupon. How much do you want to buy?\"\"Then Dajie, can you go in and get me half a jin. And on the way, if you see any big bones or something, please called the master to weigh some for me.\" Lin Qing He said and passed some money to Dajie.\"Then I will buy it for you.\" Said Dajie.Then she went in and bought the meat, and soon she carried out the meat for Lin Qing He. Half jin of meat, the fatty kind. There were also ribs, big bones, and marrow bones. This age, only big fat meat was the most popular. Other ones with bones were very cheap.There are many, but they were for Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He didn't accept the change of half a yuan.\"Dajie, at your age, nephew and niece must be growing up. Buy them more food and don't let them be hungry.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Big Meizi, you are too polite.\" This Dajie directly returned the half yuan to her. She had already gotten a food coupon from her, so she didn't want her money.Lin Qing He's mind moved and smiled, \"Dajie, I feel kindred to you. My name is Lin Qing He, from Zhou Jia Village. My man is a soldier, the only soldier in Zhou Jia Village. You will know once you inquire.\"Seeing her announce her family status, Chen Mei returned a smile and introduced herself. She also had a good impression of Lin Qing He.\"The three boys at home are really greedy. Thankfully Mei Jie has a wide range of connection, otherwise, I don't know if I can buy some back this time.\" Lin Qing He gratefully expressed.\"Meizi, you're so young, and you have three children?\" Sister Mei was surprised.\"I married at the age of seventeen and gave birth at the age of eighteen. The oldest one is now five years old. After the new year, he should be counted as six years old.\" Lin Qing He warmly smiled.\"I really can't tell,\" Mei Jie said.\"Mei Jie, you work in the Community's Supply and Demand Cooperative. If I come again, can I find you?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Sure, if you need anything, you can go to me. I can definitely help you if I can help. However, this time a master in the slaughterhouse gave his share to you, otherwise it would not be so much. Unless you book in advance, and you have to come early.\" Mei Jie disclosed to her.These words weren't false. At this time, the meat was not easy to get, and there was a fixed quota.Lin Qing He quickly agreed.She didn't expect this trip to be so smooth and found herself a 'long-term meat ticket'. With Mei Jie, she had a source for the meat in her space.Lin Qing He mentally calculated again. Truthfully, a lot of things were missing now.For example, she still needed a stove. In this era, there was a coal stove, which can be used to hold a small pot. In her space, she contained the two old-fashioned double-ear iron pots and the two old casserole pots she bought.It can also be used in this era, and say it was bought on the black market. Who would investigate so much? Because they are all old-style, very in line with the shape of this era, so she wasn't afraid of being investigated.Dajie / Jie : Big Sister, a way to address an older woman than youMeizi: Younger Sister, a way to address a younger than youIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16. Tighten your belt to liveNow there was only one stove in the house. All the water boiling, cooking rice, and frying dishes were done there. If there was another coal stove, it will be much more convenient.However, the coal stove was obviously not so easy to getWhat's more, on top of the coal stove, she also needed coal ball coupons. Only the talented in the city have these, and none in the countryside.If she wanted to get this, she had to go over and look around the county city.Besides the stove, was some kind of earthen pot. However, she can take it slowly. She should be able to raise the living conditions after Zhou Qing Bai returns.Realizing that's about it, she covered the basket with a cloth. As for what she bought, no one would know.Now she can pull anything out of the space.When she also arrived in the village, she took some pork out of the space. As for the fatty meat, she did not take it out, because it would be too eye-catching to take it out and decoct oil. Better wait until the village divided the meat.There were others like ribs, meat, eggs, etc. In short, she had to make the basket look full. However, all got covered by a cloth, so it was unknown what she bought.She went early in the morning. But the road was pretty long, so after going to and back, it was already past nine o'clock and nearly ten o'clock.She didn't pick up her three sons first. Mother Zhou would certainly take good care of them. She filled up her egg jars with eggs and loaded the barrels with rice and flour again. Then she began to sort the meat.Two large pieces of pork belly were salted. As for lean meat and the likes, she planned to make meat congee for three children.They liked the meat congee she cooked a lot and was satisfied eating it. This made her content.She chopped the ribs by herself. As for the big bones, she will send it to Mother Zhou later on as an expression of sincerity.After finishing this chore at home, Lin Qing He looked at the time. It was still early and started to go to the vegetable garden in the backyard. After tending it for a while, she heard someone shouting.She went to open the door and check. It was Zhou Dong, who carried two bundles of dry firewood.\"That fast! I thought you'll go in two days.\" Lin Qing He widened the door and let him bring it in, as she spoke.\"For peeling corn, let my sister and others do it. I'm not needed.\" Zhou Dong explained.He was only needed when it was time to plant winter wheat, and that had not yet begun.The two bundles of firewood were not small. Two bundles like these cost three dimes. Straight away, Lin Qing He took out three dimes from her pocket and settled the bill. And also said: \"We're still short a lot at home.\"They were short a lot because she used more firewood than the original owner. And at the end of October, Zhou Qing Bai should also come back and he had injuries. She dared not force him to go out get firewood like the original owner did, who wanted to vent her anger.That's right, in the novel, the original owner did this. And it was because of this villains' father gained a long-term illness, which was an endless cycle of pain. When he reached his fifties, his body was even worse.\"Shenzi, rest assured, I can go to the mountains to pick up firewood before the snowfall. After the food distribution and my sister will be able to go with me. We will ship it back with a cart, that way we can transport more.\" Zhou Dong promised to her.Others didn't like Lin Shenzi. But he and his sister actually have a very good impression of this Shenzi, because the original owner was willing to give work to them.Having work means they'll have food to eat.In winter, they were unable to earn work points for a long time, so they have to live with a tightened belt. It was not easy in the past, but because of helping the original owner and the original owner gave money, he and sisters can only eat twenty-thirty percent full in winter. Otherwise, they would have been at most ten percent full every day, and drink water when hungry. They endured to survive.\"These are eggs that were cooked in the morning. I cooked too many. You take two back to eat.\" Lin Qing He entered the house, grabbed two eggs and handed him.\"No need Shenzi. I ate already in the morning before going.\" Zhou Dong quickly refused: \"Shenzi, I'll go back first. I can go again in the afternoon, and deliver it to Shenzi in the evening.\"After that, he hurried away.Lin Qing He paused for a moment but did not say anything. At this time, the eggs were indeed quite expensive. Initially, she just wanted to find an opportunity for Zhou Dong to take a trip with her to the county city with a driving cart. At that time, she can bring back all the basin for foot wash and washbasin. That's why she gave the eggs, but judging from Zhou Dong's reaction, it appeared he didn't dare accept it.She'll have to wait for when he goes with her to the county city, then give them siblings some reward.As for the trip in the afternoon that Zhou Dong mentioned, then it was possible.From here, the distance to get firewood on the mountain wasn't close. According to Zhou Dong's foot pace, it'll take at least about three hours. To bring two bundles of firewood back at this time, he must have gone out in the morning when it was still dark.However, she also knew that Zhou Dong was not alone. He went with several 17- or 18-year-olds in the village, so there was nothing to worry about.At this time, everyone else also prepared firewood for the winter. The firewood collected by Zhou Dong was sold to her. Others in the village sold theirs in the county city. Generally, it got sold out, but Zhou Dong had it a lot easier.So Zhou Dong can go back to eat now, head out again and can return before dark.As for the rural people themselves, there was no shortage of firewood. The straw and likes can be distributed a lot, but her family had no share. As long as she prepared it, they can survive the winter.Lin Qing He understood these matters pretty well, and obviously, Zhou Dong also cherishes such opportunities, as he worked very hard.Rather than living with a tight belt over the winter, Zhou Dong preferred to find more firewood now.Lin Qing He felt less guilty for hiring a child. So she ordered ... with more and more ease. Exactly the same as the original owner's way.Two bundles of firewood were carried into the fire shed in the backyard. This fire shed was built when Zhou Qing Bai came back. It was specifically used to accumulate firewood to avoid rain, snow and get wasted from moisture.Then she continued to water the vegetable garden, tidied it and picked the cucumbers for lunch.A plate of fried cucumber and meat was enough for the mother and sons. There were a few eggs leftover from boiling in the congee in the morning. There was still a lot of congee left from the morning. She had deliberately cooked more, so she can reheat and eat.After taking out two white buns, that should be about it.As for the evening, Lin Qing He already had an idea. Dumplings for dinner and she will make dough after lunch!At eleven o'clock, Zhou Da Wa returned. He came back to see if his mother got back. One look and he found she did return.\"Your grandma and others are still peeling corn over at the production team?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"En.\" Zhou Da Wa nodded, then looked at the stove: \"Mother, what good stuff did you buy back today? Is there a big white bun?\"\"Yes. Go bring your younger brothers back. But don't outside know, or you get nothing,\" Lin Qing He ordered.\"Can't talk about meat outside?\" Zhou Da Wa couldn't help say.But he had been chattering about it with his friends and they envied him a lot.\"It's fine if you said it before, but don't talk about it in the future. Understand being low-key?\" Lin Qing He said.\"What is low-key?\" Zhou Da Wa questioned.\"... If you like to boast, then boast away. Quickly bring your brother back and prepare to eat lunch!\" Lin Qing He sent out.\"I will go now!\" Zhou Dawa immediately responded.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 Private Little TreasuryIt was Eldest Sister-in-law \u2019s second daughter, Zhou Er Ni, who brought Zhou San Wa back. Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa was also there.\"Take this big bone back, another dish for your grandpa and grandma.\" Lin Qing He didn't care what old Zhou Family would think of her, gave a big bone to Zhou Er Ni and sent her off.\"Just one morning, you're already a dirty cat.\" Lin Qing He drew water and wash Er Wa's and San Wa's face.Then she washed Da Wa. Da Wa asked, \"Mother, how many big white buns did you buy?\"\"How many do you want?\" Lin Qing He questioned.\"Of course, one per person,\" Da Wa answered.\"You wish.\" Lin Qing He harumphed: \"I only bought two and can give you each half of one.\"Half per person was also excellent.After cleaning up the three of them, Lin Qing He began to heat up the congee. Sure enough, it was troublesome to not have gas.Lin Qinghe, who had been accustomed to modern life, tried her best to adapt. In fact, she had already adapted well, but she was still feeling a bit lazy.Lunch was congee, with fried cucumber and meat, boiled eggs and most importantly, two large white buns.There wasn't much porridge, just one bowl per person. But with these dishes and two large white buns, both mother and children are satisfied.Especially Da Wa and Er Wa, their love for white bun was unswerving.\"Mother, what else did you buy back?\" Asked Zhou Er Wa.\"Nothing much.\" Lin Qing He replied while picking up the chopsticks.Speaking of this, the supply and demand cooperative in the town were quite lacking. According to the memory of the original owner, the county city's supply and demand cooperative have a larger range of varieties.This time she wanted to order some red date, shrimp skin or something, but there was nothing. However, in the county's supply and demand cooperatives, have all these.As for the original owner, she always kept an eye out for good-quality fabric, and toward these, she wasn't interested.She wasn't interested, but Lin Qing He was. The kids were currently in a growing age. And the shrimp skin was great for supplementing calcium.She also wants to buy some red dates, which can be added to stewing chicken.And other mushrooms. This time she bought half jin of fungus and kelp. Once Zhou Qing Bai returns, then it won't be enough for him to eat, so she had to go to the county city and shop around.After planning to bring Zhou Dong with her tomorrow to transport supplies back, she took three sons to prepare for a nap.Can't help it, there was nothing to do other than sleeping.Thinking how the days were getting colder and colder each day, Lin Qing He inspected her space as she waited for the three boys to sleep.She had prepared two seven-jin large quilts, especially warm ones. Even if the color was low-key, it was full of modern elements. Which was not in line with this era.She was missing a big quilt cover. So she had to go to the county city to buy one. When the time comes, she'll stuff the quilt in cover. And Zhou Qing Bai couldn't say anything about her.She can say that she got it by her own ability!In addition to the quilt, was a mattress. This mattress can be taken out. It's old-styled and not patterned at all. The key feature was warmth.She had it all planned out. The quilt and the mattress were to be used by herself. When winter here, the three sons will sleep with her. As for the villains' father, he can sleep in the neighboring room, a.k.a the sons' room. Anyway, there was an old quilt, so can't freeze him.Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\"Lin Qing He, who looked at the space supplies, fell into the dream world with her three sons.Once the old Zhou Family came back, they found out that Lin Qing He had given them a big bone. Although there wasn't much meat, anything that produces oily substance was a good thing at this age. So who can dislike it?In particular, this was sent over by Lin Qing He through Zhou Er Ni.This big bone was chopped and then used to stew pickled vegetables. It tasted very fragrant to the old Zhou family who had not eaten oil for a long time.After eating, they dispersed.When Mother Zhou returned to the room, she asked Father Zhou: \"Old man, what's the matter with Fourth's wife?\"\"What matter?\" Father Zhou actually didn't understand her, and he didn't like to think about these things.\"What else could it be? She used to wish to stay as far away as possible from our old Zhou's house. As if she's afraid we might take advantage of her. Now she sends Er Wa and San Wa over when she's going to the town and this big bone too!\" Mother Zhou pointed out.Father Zhou didn't have such deep thought. In his opinion, it's enough to change for the better. Why care so much.What's more important now was to quickly hand over the public rations, and then prepare for the winter wheat cultivation after the food distribution. These are important matters.In fact, it wasn't only Mother Zhou who is puzzled, the other three sisters-in-law as well.Second sister-in-law mumbled to Zhou Qing Lin: \"What does Fourth's wife mean? It can't be that she wants a share of our family's meat!\"Zhou Qing Lin didn't care: \"She already separated from us. How can we give her a share of our family's meat.\" There were so many people in the family.\"She did separate but Da Wa and his brothers are Father's and Mother's grandsons.\" Second Sister-in-law felt that she had seen through Lin Qing He's plan.\"Why think so much? She's so proud, and Fourth has sent so many allowances every month. If she wants to eat meat, she can buy it from the production team. No need to take our family's. I guess she has a way to get meat, otherwise, she can't bear to give us a big bone.\"Zhou Qing Lin said.Second Sister-in-law couldn't concealed the acidity in her tone: \"Did you not see? Da Wa and his brothers have grown a lot in this period, especially San Wa. His face is so chubby?\"She had two girls and a son, who was only three years old this year, and they're skinny as a stick.Initially in the past, he was the same age as Er Wa and despite being younger than Er Wa, he was not as thin as Er Wa. But after not seeing him for a short while, Er Wa became sturdier.\"Don't think about it anymore. I guess the money in her pocket may be less than ours.\" Zhou Qing Lin said.This sentence scratched Second Sister-in-law's itch.Second Sister-in-law believed that she was very family-oriented. Even if she had no income at home, she somehow saved more than ten yuan.This was definitely a huge sum of money!But looking back on Fourth's wife. So what if Fourth Brother-in-law sends back allowance every month. With a wife like Fourth's, who didn't how to manage a family, no matter how much the allowance was, it will be wasted.For example, Third Sister-in-law was now helping her make her sons' winter clothes. It was said that the three brothers were getting complete new sets, and the cotton and cloth were all good. This was really squandering away the family wealth.She dared to bet that Lin Qing He's wallet might not be as big as hers!\"I don't know how much pocket money Mother will give to our family this year.\" After Second Sister-in-law comforted herself, she was in a good mood.As a mother-in-law, Mother Zhou was actually one of the best in the village. Apart from being biased toward Zhou Qing Bai, the young son, and not counting Lin Qing He who moved out, she was fair to the three families.And she wasn't that stingy. For example, when distributing money at the end of the year, she will give them one or two yuan of pocket money.Whether they save it themselves or give it to the relatives on New Year's maternal family visitation (a.k.a the second day of New Year), it was up to them in the end.The daughter-in-law of the same age in the village didn't have the same treatment as the old Zhou Family's daughter-in-law. Those mothers-in-law kept everything in control. So how can there be any private little treasury?In contrast, her life was still very good.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 Little Saving At HomeIn the neighboring room, Eldest Sister-in-law also talked about the big bone Lin Qing He sent today.Although she didn\u2019t have the same thought as Second Sister-in-law, she did have a confused face. Therefore, Zhou Qing Mu expressed that Fourth's wife became sensible.Eldest Sister-in-law gave him an eye roll. Previously when Fourth's wife was causing a scene, her man also said that she was too young and not sensible yet. But after that, she was already the mother of three children. When did she ever act sensibly?Now sensible? Who would believe it?\"This is splurging too much. I heard Tao Zi's mother said she saw her carrying a basket full of things back.\" Eldest Sister-in-law said.Just don\u2019t know what it was, with a cloth covering it. But if she was willing to give out a big bone, then she must have bought a lot.Zhou Qing Mu also agreed on this point. How can you splurge so much to live well? And the three brothers, one was five years old in a blink of an eye and will be six years old after the new year. When kids grow up, what didn't need money?Truthfully speaking, Zhou Qing Mu was also a little envious, because he only had one son. The first three were daughters, so the pressure is relatively small. But he would rather be more stressful.\"I don't know if this is a son.\" Zhou Qing Mu touched Eldest Sister-in-law's recently showing tummy and spoke.Eldest Sister-in-law's attention was attracted, commented: \"Every time Da Wa sees Third's wife's belly, he calls out 'little brother'. I also don't know if this is the son or not.\"She wasn\u2019t really worried, because no matter what, she still had one son. Of course, it was better if this was a son. If it wasn't, it didn\u2019t matter.Third Sister-in-law was currently making clothes for Da Wa and Er Wa. Now that the harvest business was over, she didn\u2019t need to do any work at home, so she can make clothes all day long, and the speed will naturally be faster. The one in her hands was Er Wa's, and it was half done.In a few days, Da Wa's will be finished, then she can make a jacket for her daughter.Although the old Zhou Family each had their own thoughts, the days were still very harmonious. When Third Sister-in-law yawned to go to rest, Lin Qing He had already awakened.Tonight she decided to eat dumplings, so she started making the dough.She had already chopped up all the ribs and put them in the space. The day wasn't so cold, so except for the pork belly sprinkled with salt, the fresh meat and ribs were not durable. To have a space, which was comparable to the refrigerator, at this moment was great.When Lin Qing He was busy in the kitchen, the brothers woke up one after another. When they learned that they were having dumplings for dinner, they were overjoyed.Zhou Da Wa went directly went off to show off. Zhou Er Wa also went out to play, and San Wa stayed at home with Lin Qing He.As far as Lin Qing He was concerned, as long as the eldest two didn\u2019t go overboard, she won't restrain them. They were boys, so no need to raise them through restraining. And the most important thing was that winter will soon arrive. At that time, there's not much to play. She planned to get Zhou Da Wa to study then.Wait until next year, she'll send him to elementary school.Elementary school was a five-year model, while junior high school and high school were two-year systems.Six years old was not too young and it was not bad to go to school. It was better than petting cats and teasing dogs at home.Zhou Da Wa, who didn\u2019t know his free-spirited days were diminishing, was having fun outside, and Zhou Er Wa was running behind him like a tail.Don't know what they played outside, but they always end up dirty when they return.Lin Qing He saw the dough was mostly done and after sweeping one glance to the brothers, she sent them to wash their hands and face.There was a well in the house, which was very costly. In the whole village, there was a maximum of five households who can have a well in their own yard and she was one of them.Of course, it was usually covered, to prevent the brothers from messing around.It took a lot of money to dig this well. As the original owner relied on Zhou Qing Bai's money that was sent back every month, she didn't mind and simply hired people to dig the well.While Second Sister-in-law was complacent. She thought that the original owner's net saving did not necessarily add up to her. However, she underestimated Zhou Qing Bai's ability.In the early years, Zhou Qing Bai did only send back a minimum of 20 yuan per month, usually 23 or 24 yuan. When more, it was 25 or 26 yuan. Basically, he sent it all back.He didn't need to spend any money over there and had no place to spend, so he sent as much as he could. Same with the coupons.However later in the last two years, the money sent back by Zhou Qingbai can reach above 30 yuan a month. Usually, around thirty-five or six.Even if the original owner splurge extravagantly, but in this era, even having money didn't allow one to go around the world. Although the boys were still a kid, their intake wasn't big enough to eat his old man to poverty, especially the original owner setting the limit for them at not starving to death. So how much can she spend?The majority of the expense at home was due to her own use. Vanishing cream, new dresses, new cotton coats, scarves, scarves, socks, and shoes. She had all of these.Because she was just spending on herself, the original owner can still save a little.Although she had spent a lot to her, Lin Qing He found out she saved more than two hundred yuans, nearly three hundred dollars after counting the family's wealth.In the age when the money was spent one cent at a time, three hundred yuans was undoubtedly a huge sum of money.It's just that the image of the original owner frittering away the money was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Everyone unanimously believed that she didn't have much savings at all.Of course, an old lady in the village had told her to save and only spend on necessity in the past.At that time, the original owner casually replied: \"This is not enough for me to spend, so how can I save?\"These words were still being spread in the village until now. Seeing her put on vanishing cream and wear a new dress and leather shoes, all the villagers dare not to buy or even ask the price of these high-end products. They don't doubt the authenticity of her words.\"Mother, what kind of stuffing is in the dumpling?\" Zhou Da Wa said while washing up.Lin Qing He replied: \"Pork dumplings.\"\"I like mother's dumplings, so no matter what stuffing, I like to eat,\" said Zhou Er Wa.Er Wa was used to pleasing. Lin Qing He also gave him face and directed smiling eyes at him. Er Wa grinned.\"Mother, do you want me to help you?\" Zhou Da Wa asked, his eyes brightened with the desire to be hands-on.I will definitely have you to do it in the future. I don\u2019t intend to spoil you into a young master who didn\u2019t touch the spring (clean) water.But for now no need. All of them were like they came out of the mud. Their nail all got dirt. Although she had washed them, they can return the original state within one day.\"Don't intervene, just go stay at one side.\" Lin Qing He batted away his hand.Zhou Da Wa said: \"Mother, you dislike me!\"\"Me disliking you wasn't a day or two matter. Why didn't I see you mention it before? That's right, our family is going to raise chickens. Do you have anything to say?\" Lin Qing He proposed.\"Raise chicks?\" Er Wa parroted with bright eyes.\"En.\" Lin Qing He nodded: \"Zhou Da Wa, take your brother's hand away. Don't let him feed it to his mouth.\" She gave San Wa a little dough and told him to play there.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19. Number one wealth dissipating womanZhou Da Wa took down his brother's hand and pointed out, \"Mother, there's no chick now.\"\"There's none?\" Er Wa couldn't help be disappointed.\"I know that there are no chicks now. I plan to raise them next spring. At that time, will definitely have them and I just need to buy them from the villagers. If we want to raise chickens in the future, then what the chicks eat will be a problem\" Lin Qing He said.The house was very empty, especially the vegetable gardens in the backyard, which was mostly stalks. It was a pity not to raise chickens.However, the original owner loved cleanliness more than her. She was set on not raising them because she didn\u2019t like the smell. But if it was clean up well, the smell won't be so exaggerated. and the backyard was still some distance away from the house.When Zhou Qing Bai comes back, she'll ask him to build a chicken coop.\"If there are chickens at home, will there be chickens to eat in the future?\" Zhou Da Wa's eyes shone.\"Chickens need to lay eggs!\" Zhou Er Wa said immediately.How can the eggs be laid after eating the chicken?\"Chicken is very delicious!\" Zhou Da Wa retorted.After being told this by his brother, Zhou Er Wa instantly drooled and looked at his mother.Although the kid didn't speak, Lin Qing He could see the meaning in his eyes: Mother, I haven't eaten chicken yet.\"Wait and see which day I can find any chickens to buy.\" Lin Qing He could only say.\"Mother, you're so great.\" Er Wa immediately came to hug her leg and said softly.Although he will become the villain's leading strategist for three brothers in the future, he was still a small bun right now.After being so spoiled by Lin Qing He for a few days, he threw the coldness of the former owner out of his mind and was extremely close to her. Who knew that Zhou Er Wa even proposed his desire to sleep with her along with San Wa last night.Before he dared not mention it to the original owner.Children were very discerning, who treated him well and who didn't, they know in their mind.Knowing that Lin Qing He was kind to them, he dared to make a request. However, Lin Qing He did not agree and let the two of them continue to sleep on their own.\"Next year, when raising chickens, you guys are responsible for feeding.\" Lin Qing He said.\"I'll go catch bugs from the garden and feed the chicks!\" Er Wa responded immediately.\"Then I go out to dig the earthworms and bring back to feed!\" Zhou Da Wa followed up.\"Eat, eat chicken.\" San Wa looked at his eldest brother and then his second eldest brother and jumped in.Er Wa went over to educate him that the chick had to be raised for laying eggs and could not be eaten.The family had dinner before five o'clock. The pork dumplings were very fragrant. However, the three brothers were still too young to eat much, so a bowl was leftover.And it was at that time, Zhou Dong carried today's second load of firewood over. Lin Qing He brought it out to him and said, \"Little Dong, take this bowl of dumplings back to eat. Shenzi has something to discuss with you.\"Zhou Dong shook his head and said, \"Shenzi, if you have a matter, I will do it for you. But you can leave the dumplings for Da Wa and his brothers.\"\"Brother Zhou Dong, we have all eaten it.\" Zhou Da Wa spoke unrestrainedly.It was obvious that Zhou Er Wa didn't want his mother to give away such delicious dumplings, but he remained silent.\"You hear, they have eaten. If you don't accept this bowl of dumplings, Shenzi won't be able to speak.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Dong hesitated a bit when he heard this. Then he took it and said, \"Shenzi, tell me.\"\"It's like this. Shenzi intends to go to the county town. There are a lot of things to buy this time. At that time, Shenzi can't bring it back by myself. Do you think you can go with Shenzi the day after tomorrow?\" explained Lin Qing He.There was a trailer in Zhou Dong's house, which can transport what she wants. This time may be the last time for her to go to the county town this year. There was no way since it was too far.Three or four hours. Just going to and back and the day was already over. The most important part was how exhausting it was ah!\"Okay, I will come the day after tomorrow. What time, Shenzi?\" Zhou Dong listened and agreed.There was nothing to do the day after tomorrow because the day after tomorrow was handing over the public ration. He wasn't needed then. The day after that day was the day when the food gets distributed, so it didn't delay anything.\"Five o'clock.\" Lin Qing He stated.Departing at five o'clock for the county city, and it'll open at nine o'clock.Zhou Dong nodded, looked at the bowl of dumplings. He still wanted to return it, Lin Qing He declared: \"Take it back to eat, otherwise, I dare not call you.\"She also paid the three dimes to Zhou Dong for the evening's bundles of firewood, then let him go back.Not long after Zhou Dong went back, Zhou Xi returned the washed bowl. She asked Lin Qing He whether she would use her to take care of the brothers the day after tomorrow.The original owner used to call her, and the little girl was quite reliable. However, Lin Qing He didn't plan to and replied: \"No need. The day after tomorrow, I will call their grandma to take care of them.\"Zhou Xi returned.As for Lin Qing He telling Zhou Dong to go to the county town with her, which delay him to find firewood to make money, there was no problem. Because Lin Qing He\u2019s bowl of pork dumplings was worth five dimes if eaten in a restaurant in the county city or town. And that needed a food coupon, otherwise, you can\u2019t buy it even if you have money.So they didn't suffer a loss with this bowl of dumplings.The villagers also saw Zhou Dong take back a bowl of dumplings from there, and curiously asked.There was no reason to hide and explained that Lin Shenzi need his help for something and gave him this.And the something, he was asked to accompany her to the county city the day after tomorrow.As for why Lin Qing He take Zhou Dong to the county city, the people in that village didn't need to ask. They knew that there is a lot of things to buy, and since she couldn't carry it back, she found someone to lift the goods.But this bowl of pork dumplings was also worth it ah. they smelled its fragrant.Zhou Dong was not stupid. He went directly home, devoured it with his sister, and had the dish washed to be sent back.Although there was only one bowl of dumplings, it was enough as there were flour and pork, so the brother and sister did not plan to cook any more tonight.Soon it was food distribution, people who were short on food supply can get paid in advance first. And it'll be deducted later when the food was being distributed, so every family won't starve for the time being. However, they have to pass the winter afterward, so they can't casually eat.In particular, for a household like Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi. If they don't tighten their belts to live their lives, there will be sudden shortages all year long.However, this year Lin Qing He needed much more firewood than last year, which was also a very good income for them. For example, today, the four bundles of firewood, they made six dimes.The village was only so big, so the news of Lin Qing He calling Zhou Dong to go to the county city soon spread to Mother Zhou's ears.Mother Zhou was so angry that she was one step away from grasping her chest: \"I thought she really wanted to change for better! Still the same old!\"She just went to town today and brought back a basket of supplies and want to go to the county city the day after tomorrow. It was only a few days since she last went to the county city. Is there such a waste of money!Eldest, Second and Third Sister-in-law all had unsurprised expressions.Everyone in the village had different opinions, but their key point was relatively uniform. They all criticized how Lin Qing He didn't know how to live a life and was extremely family-ruining. She was simply the number one wealth dissipating woman in their entire production team, who didn't know how to live life!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20. Pan-fried sweet potato cakeNo matter what the villagers said, Lin Qing He and her three sons were having sweet dreams.Early the next morning, Lin Qing He came back after washing clothes and cooked millet porridge.Now she gave them a bath every three days, but the feet were washed every day.She fried with salted pork belly for the three brothers. The salted pork belly didn't need any more seasoning. Just cooked like that in oil, it became very fragrant.With the remaining oil in the pan, she hatched an egg in it for each brother.Breakfast was that simple, but the three brothers were satisfied.\"Mother, people outside say that you don't know how to live.\" Zhou Da Wa blurted out as he gobbled the fragrant sunnyside up.He heard it while playing outside.Lin Qing He saw Er Wa nod as well, expressing that he had heard it too. She raised her eyebrows: \"Do you think Mother doesn't know how to live?\"\"No.\" Zhou Da Wa answered.\"Mother, this is how to live life,\" Zhou Er Wa replied as well.\"Yummy.\" The gluttonous San Wa added.\"Let them say what they want to say. Your mother, I, didn't spend their money. My man can make money for me, why can't I spend it? And I still have three sons to raise. Don't I need to nurture you into a white and chubby? If I don't spend money, what am I going to use to take care of you little greedy ones? \"Lin Qing He said.Zhou Da Wa grinned and Zhou Er Wa laugh in embarrassment. As for Zhou San Wa, he already opened wide his mouth waiting for his mother to feed him.\"Quickly eat. After you finish, go with your grandma to sundry the corn. In the afternoon, let your grandma come over to eat at home.\" Lin Qing He ordered.\"Do Mother need something from Grandma?\" Zhou Da Wa asked.\"There is.\" Lin Qing He replied.\"Alright, then.\" Zhou Da Wa agreed.After breakfast, he slipped out to play. Lin Qing He finished feeding San Wa and let him play with Er Wa at the entrance, while she ate herself. After finishing, she tidied up the bowls and chopsticks and then began to clean the room.Her only dissatisfaction with the original owner was that she was too capable and too realistic. And for the other traits, Lin Qing He still approved.For example, the original owner would make her home clean and have everything organized. Nothing out of place.Lin Qing He was satisfied with this point.After cleaning the house, Lin Qing He began to take out the original owner's clothes and hung them under the sun.The original owner's clothes were excellent. There were several sets in the closet, all of which are very good condition. No patch at all.Toward this, the original owner was still not very satisfied.In Lin Qing He's words, how could last year's clothes match up to this year's her?So this year the original owner also wanted to make new clothes. As for the three sons, she just made do with whatever.In fact, the original owner had a lot of clothes, but she took them back to her mother's house to give her sisters-in-law. Basically, she sent back one or two sets.But even like this, she still had several sets of clothes in her closet. Among them, three sets were summer. The one on her, the one chilling out outside and one set in the closet was for autumn. Three sets of autumn clothes in total. There were two cotton clothes. One set was from two years back and one set was from last year.This year, she wanted to make another set as the previous year one was to be sent to her family.As well as the cloths and cotton were specially obtained for her mother's family...Speaking of this, old Lin family was not losing out for raising this girl.But now? Sorry, she was here. Let's focus on her sons first, as for the others, she didn't have much ability to take care. What she spent now was still the hard-earned money earned by Zhou Qing Bai.Since she took all these clothes out to sundry, then it goes without saying she took out her sons' clothes and let them bathe under the sun as well. The three sons ... didn't have many clothes.One set of autumn clothes was the ones they wore now and another one was the ones that were just washed. And that was it.There was also a set in the cupboard, which Zhou Da Wa wore last winter. As for Er Wa and San Wa, they had none. The two brothers had basically spent last winter on the kang. It was like this and was still scorned.However, because of the lack of firewood, it was impossible to heat two Kang. In the end, she could only let them come over to her kang. And because of wetting the kang, they got beaten more than once by the original owner.It won\u2019t happen this year. The brothers each get a new set, but still, need to prepare one or two more warm inner clothes and trousers. Also summer wear. They were broken into unrecognizable bits. She didn't plan to continue to let them wear them, so straight out make new ones.Moreover, in the black market, a bolt of good-quality cotton cloth was three dimes at the moment. And that was on the premise that no coupons are needed. To her, it seems cheap.A bolt of fabric was enough to make many sets of clothes.Lin Qing He planned to go to the black market tomorrow.After finishing the chores at home, she watched Er Wa and San Wa playing sand at the door a bit. She went back to the house to start the preparation.Taking the pen and paper from the space, she jotted down what she will buy tomorrow.Shrimp skin, red dates, coal, coal stove, foot wash basin and basin. And also two more enamels for drinking water. There was one at home at the moment. The two new ones are brought back to drink water, while the old one for brushing teeth.There was no need to buy a thermos flask. Zhou Qing Bai had brought one back. It was very convenient to use. Because there was only one of them, the original owner was reluctant to give it to her maternal family. Thank god this one left here. Although it wasn't adequate for winter, it was still barely sufficient to use She did not plan to buy one, as this thing was very difficult to buy.Then there was malted milk powder. She planned to buy a can of malted milk powder for the three brothers to drink. Oh right, and the white rabbit candy.White rabbit candy was a notoriously good thing in this era. More or less, it was equivalent to a glass of milk.But the price seemed to be more expensive, but that didn't matter. If she remembered correctly, this time when the villains' father return, he'll bring a large sum of money back. So no need to care too much.In addition to these, there were mushrooms.There were no mushrooms in the town's supply and demand cooperative, just half jin of dried edible fungus and dried seaweed. Both she planned to buy more in the county city. In winter, there weren't many foods that can satisfy oil craving.And if pumpkins can be found, she must buy more.After a lot of things were written, she double-checked it. When she felt a shortage, she added more and that was about it.After this shopping trip, she didn't plan to go to the county city anymore this year. It was so far away that she already dreading it by the thought.There was no way this time. There were so many things to buy back for passing winter. Stop after once!Lin Qing He finished her mental construction, and it was only about eight o'clock. What should she do next to pass the time?Visit old Zhou's house? Check out Third Sister-in-law's progress on the clothes?Forget it. She better not go over and didn't scare other people. (TN: XD) If she didn't perform well, she could ruin the cloth she gave.Turning her mine over, there was really nothing to do. She grabbed a bowl, added rock sugar in, and pour boiling water into it. And like that, she let this small bowl of sugar water cool.She took out the sweet potato and began to peel it. Then cut it into strips. Altogether two sweet potatoes were cut up. The sweet potato was still the latest produce.She placed the sweet potatoes in the large bowl and add flour. Seeing the sugar water was about done, she added a little less than half of it in.Lin Qing He actually wanted to lament a bit. If she knew early, she won't buy just rock sugar. She should have bought some white sugar. Ah, forget it. Let\u2019s take a look at the county city.The sweet potato was covered in flour and fried in a pan. Lin Qing He wasn't reluctant to use oil, after all, it was rare to make a snack for her three sons.The fried sweet potato was extremely fragrant, and soon the sweet fragrance spread out and Er Wa and San Wa, who were playing at the entrance soon smelled it.\"Mother, what are you making?\" Er Wa swallowed his saliva.\"Pan-fried sweet potato cake. Go find if your big brother is around. If he is, tell him to come back to eat. Never mind if not,\" Lin Qing He answered.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21. Being excessiveThis time, it was unknown where Zhou Da Wa ran off to play and Er Wa was unable to find him. He asked an older child in the village to pass a message. If he saw his eldest brother, tell him to come home to eat pan-fried sweet potato.Then Er Wa ran home by himself.So when Zhou Da Wa heard the message and ran home, Lin Qing He had eaten with Er Wa and San Wa.It goes without saying, she left a piece for him.\"Mother, you didn't tell me there are pan-fried sweet potato cakes!\" Da Wa complained while washing his hands.\"I got Er Wa to call you.\" Lin Qing He responded.Da Wa immediately glared at Er Wa: \"You dare not call me and run back on your own to eat?\"\"I did go call, but I didn't find you, so I told someone to pass a message to you. Otherwise, Eldest brother, you will definitely not return home now.\" Er Wa gave a lazy response.After eating three pieces of sweet potato cakes, he was sunk in delight and felt full now, so he does not want to quarrel with his eldest brother.Da Wa can only eat sweet potato cake, and there was only one piece left. His appetite was relatively large, so it wasn't enough. He turned to Er Wa: \"How many pieces did you eat?\"\"Three pieces,\" Er Wa answered.\"Mother, why did you let him eat my share!\" Da Wa expressed dissatisfaction.\"Who told you to run off to play where people can't see you. Remember next time you play, stay near around the house, otherwise, don't think about having what I'm cooking.\" Lin Qing He said.Although she won't rein him in, it was impossible to let him run like a wild horse.However, compared to her holding his ear and counseling him, it was obvious this method of using good food was more capable of affecting Zhou Da Wa and hinting him to decide not to run so far next time, and let Er Wa find him easily when he heads out!He also wanted to tell Er Wa where he usually went to play, so that Er Wa could find him easily. However, Er Wa was not happy, and object to the number of places he played at. He had no way of finding and won't look for the entrance he can't find.Then he got beaten by Da Wa, and Er Wa howled. Lin Qing He planned to beat Da Wa.After a while of chaos, Lin Qing He asked Da Wa, \"Did you tell your grandma?\"\"I did. Grandma said she would come once she's not busy, but don't need to prepare her meal.\" Zhou Da Wa replied.Even though she said this, Lin Qing He still prepared lunch for Mother Zhou. After all, she was asking a favor from the other.Steamed rice for noon. After washing the rice, she left it to soak in the iron pot. After soaking for half an hour, it can be steamed.They do eat rice here, but just fewer people. Generally, they ate more noodles. Rice, especially this white rice, was very rare.However, it was obvious that white rice was the tastiest. It wasn't easy to buy and required food coupons. But still, the original owner liked it very much.Lin Qing He also liked it, so the rice tank was always full. She was afraid that Zhou Qing Bai will come back suddenly, then she can\u2019t refill it when she wants.She didn't have a large appetite, and the three children hadn't reached that time. However, Da Wa's food intake was not small. This kid was fed by Lin Qing He for a few days, although he didn't develop more meat, he was obviously much stronger.While Mother Zhou, her appetite should be relatively larger.Around eight bowls of rice were steamed. She, Er Wa, and San Wa get three bowls, two bowls for Da Wa, and lastly three bowls for Mother Zhou.There was a good bit of salted pork belly left, so Lin Qing He picked two cucumbers.After the rice was steamed, she heated the pork belly in the pan. After scooping up the pork belly, there was a lot of oil with a salty fragrance left. The cucumbers went in the pan and it started sizzling as the fragrance emit out.After the cucumbers were fried, Lin Qing He also made an egg drop and seaweed soup.Steamed rice was served with salted pork belly, fried cucumber, and egg drop, and seaweed soup. This was also a relatively simple and ordinary meal.But when Mother Zhou came to see the food, her heartache acted up again. It was no worse than the landlord's household in the past!\"Mother, sit down, and eat. I specially made steamed rice for you. If you don't eat it, then there will be leftovers. I promised Da Wa that they would eat lean pork congee tonight.\" Lin Qing He said.Mother Zhou's expression was not good, but she knew she wouldn't listen to her. So she sat down and looked at the plate of salty meat, and the plate of oily fried cucumbers. Even tasty smell filling her nose didn't alleviate her worry.Fourth's wife really didn't know how to live!\"Grandma, eat it quickly, it's really fragrant.\" Da Wa received the rice that his mother had served him and called her.Er Wa began to eat. San Wa sat quietly, but could not wait for his mother to feed her with his mouth open.Lin Qing He also called: \"Mother, eat. Don't just sit there.\"Then she began to feed San Wa. San Wa was very obedient when eating. He sat on his mother's lap and pointed at whatever he wanted to eat.His favorite was meat, and his appetite was not small. He ate a small half bowl of rice, with a lot of meat and vegetables, and a few sips of soup before she let him play by himself at her feet.Then Lin Qing He also started eating and said to Mother Zhou: \"Mother, it tastes pretty good.\"Mother Zhou's lips twitched and thought, how can it be bad with so much oil in. However, seeing the amount she fed San Wa, she didn't mind anymore. The money-splurging was still the same as before, at least it was spent on the three brothers. So she was beginning to be considerate.\"Why did you think of having me over for lunch?\" When Mother Zhou finished eating, she started talking. Lin Qing He got up, filled another bowl for her, and poured cucumber's oily juice over the rice with a spoon, making it especially fragrant. Da Wa and Er Wa liked to eat it this way.Of course, she too.Mother Zhou glanced at her, Lin Qing He replied, \"It's like this. I plan to buy some dry goods from the county city for passing winter. Our local supply and demand cooperative doesn't have much. After this trip, I won't go out again this year. I will head out at five tomorrow, so I want Mother to come over to watch the three tomorrow and cook for them. \"Knowing that she can't stop her, Mother Zhou had no other choice but to agreed. If she didn't, she would definitely leave her son behind and go.Thankfully, she knows to get her to come over and help watch the children now.After comforting herself, Mother Zhou agreed, but still advised: \"Don't buy anything that is not necessary.\"\"I know.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Mother Zhou ate three large bowls of fragrant rice, and then went back. Before going back, she said that she'll come over to sleep with the kids tonight, so so does not have to come over in the dark tomorrow morning.Lin Qing He conveyed to her to join them for dinner tonight. Mother Zhou refused.In fact, she could promise to let her come and sleep with the kids for a night made Mother Zhou a little surprised. According to her temperament, even if she agreed, she wouldn't agree so frankly.In the end, Lin Qing He was not the original owner. She can't copy the original owner to the T. Mother Zhou was willing to come over to help, why would she disagree? Not happening.Mother Zhou, who was very satisfied with the food, talked about it with Father Zhou when she returned.Except for the love to spend money and the unchangeable habit of being excessive, Fourth's wife's other aspects seem to have changed a lot.Father Zhou said: \"Already separated, so why intervened so much. It's enough that she can now care about the children and raise them well.\"It was much better than supporting the old Lin Family!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22. County city shopping battleMother Zhou came over at eight o'clock for the sleepover.The kids had not washed their feet yet. Lin Qing He washed the brothers first and then fetched a basin for Mother Zhou.Mother Zhou was so shocked. Fourth's wife actually got her water for washing feet?\"Mother, make lean pork porridge for the kids tomorrow. I used well water to cool the meat.\" Lin Qing He only fetched the water and as for washing feet, that was left to Mother Zhou. She'll just help pour it out later on.\"What are you going to buy tomorrow?\" Probably because Mother Zhou found her more pleasing, she asked.\"Nothing much, mainly because the kids don't have warm inner clothes and trousers. I have to get some material. This demand isn't too high. At that time, I'll just ask Eldest Sister-in-law to help, however, she would pay a lot for her effort.\" Lin Qing He explained.Mother Zhou thought that if the money wasn't spent on her grandsons, then it must have been taken back by this daughter-in-law to the old Lin Family, so she said: \"It is time to make some inner clothes for the brothers.\"Lin Qing He wasn't familiar with her, so when she was mostly done, she took out her foot basin and prepared to rest.After a few days, Lin Qing He became used to it. Especially since she needed to wake up earlier tomorrow to go to the county town. She would have to leave before dawn.Just the thought of it made her leg ache.Lin Qing He got up the next morning. She got up, washed herself, and then came out. Of course, she went to give Mother Zhou a head up.During the darkness, she came out and saw Zhou Dong pulling the tow cart. He had just arrived but waited outside without knocking on the door.\"I'll be hard on you today. Later when we are at the county city, the white bun will be on Shenzi.\" Lin Qing He declared.Zhou Dong hurriedly said no need, he had eaten at home before coming.It was now October. It was a bit cold in the morning, and what's more, it was still dark.If Zhou Dong wasn't with her, Lin Qing He dare not to walk on this dark road.\"Now it is getting colder and colder every day. Does your quilt still ward off the cold?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"It's warm,\" Zhou Dong nodded.\"I ordered a big quilt on the county city last time, so the one at home can be a replacement.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Dong stunned: \"Shenzi, is that true?\"There were quilts at home, but it was getting quite old. And now that he and his sister have grown up, it goes without they can\u2019t sleep together like when they were young. So the siblings have one each.But it was because one each, the brothers and sisters were freezing since the year before. Fortunately, there was the kang, which burns until the middle of the night and become cold again.He was fine, but the main point was his sister.\"It is.\" Lin Qing He nodded.On this trip to the county city, she planned to pull the big quilt out of the space. Not only the big quilt but also the bedding. These were essential for keeping warm in the winter.\"Shenzi, how much does that one cost? There are some cloth coupons I haven't use at home. I can give them to Shenzi.\" Zhou Dong quickly responded.It wasn't easy to get a quilt in this era.Although in Lin Qing He's eyes, the one at home was a bit old, it was only a few years since she was married. Of course, this one wasn't a newly-wed quilt. It was another piece bought afterward. Not old either. If Zhou Dong didn't want it, she planned to keep it as a mattress.As for the mattresses in the space, she can sell it in the county city, and someone will want it.But seeing how tough the Zhou Dong's and his sister's life was and what's more, they help out with chores even if paid, supporting them wasn't a problem as the siblings weren't bad in the end.\"You can forget the money. Your Shenzi, I don't lack that money. However I'll be buying a lot during this year's food distribution, you will be responsible for carrying it home for me then.\" Lin Qing He said.In previous years, the original owner called for Eldest Brother Zhou's help. It goes without saying, she gave him two eggs back to bring back before leaving.Zhou Dong shook his head: \"Shenzi, don't need to mention it. I would have volunteered to carry it back for Shenzi.\"\"Besides that, do your best with this time supplies. I am going to buy a lot of things this time. Today will exhaust you without exception.\" Lin Qing He said.On and on they walked, as the sky began to light up. When they reached one-third of the way, it was dawn.At this time, Lin Qing He was hungry, but she couldn't take anything out to eat. So she kept on going with Zhou Dong till they reached the county city. Then she entered the state-run restaurant and came out with three white buns. One for herself and two for Zhou Dong.Zhou Dong wanted to refuse but was told by Lin Qing He that he had a lot of work today, so hurry up eat and they can start working after eating.Then Zhou Dong ate.One was enough for Lin Qing He. Zhou Dong had the most delicious meal of white bun in his life, and what's more two of them. The ingredients inside made Zhou Dong nearly swallow his tongue.Although he could finish three more white buns like this size, the two made his stomach really comfortable.Lin Qing He took him over to the county supply and demand cooperative.She planned to come here to make a large purchase today. In fact, at this time, there were many from the production team in all directions. Some production teams have handed the public ration early and issued the coupons and money, so they naturally come to the county city for consumption and purchased this year's supplies.Sure enough, there were a lot of people in the supply and demand cooperative and basically, they couldn't buy any fabric. Lin Qing He wasn't concerned. She originally planned to buy it from the black market. Although the price was a little more expensive, the quality wasn't worst than the supply and demand cooperative.As for the other goods in the supply and demand cooperative, there were still some. After browsing, Lin Qing He bought the shrimp skin, mushroom, seaweed, edible fungus, and red dates with the family's subsidiary food coupon.She got one jin of shrimp skin, one jin of mushrooms, one jin of seaweed, two jins of red dates, and two jins of dried fungus.Because she and the children like to eat fungus.In addition to these, there were three packs of white rabbit candy, a jin of white sugar that reserved for an emergency, and two cans of malted milk powder instead of the initially planned one after seeing how small a can was.Also canned fruits. She wasn't interested in canned fruits during this age, but the children haven\u2019t eaten it before, so she bought two cans back for them to try.The taste was definitely no match for the apples in her space.She also grabbed other snacks, such as sweet glutinous-rice sticks.Because she bought quite a lot of things, she bought a large wrap from the teller, then simply packed these things, and asked Zhou Dong to come in and carry it out.Don't underestimate Zhou Dong cause he was fifteen, his strength isn't little because he had been working as a farmer since young.Zhou Dong's mouth twitched, even if he didn't know what she bought inside, but he also knew that she definitely spent a lot of money.That was about it with the things she needed to buy from the supply and demand cooperative, Lin Qing He directly brought Zhou Dong to the county city's department store.Zhou Dong stayed outside to watch the cart and the things in it. Lin Qing He entered and bought two large quilt covers with the remaining cloth tickets.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23. Coal StoveAfter entering a corner of the store, she stashed away the two quilts and then continued to wander the department store.There were ready-to-wear clothes in the mall, both for adults and children.It was only three yuans for a bolt of cloth from the black market, and there was no need to use a coupon, but in the mall, an adult's clothing will cost five yuans!Children were cheaper, around three yuans.Even like this, a fabric coupon was necessary.With a bolt of cloth from the black market, one can make five or six sets of your own ready-made clothes, and not get rip off by department store.However, Lin Qing He still asked about the coal stove.\"It's not easy to get a coal stove at this time.\" The young salesperson saw that she was young, with good temperament and good looks as well as having no one coming around, she became willing to chatter with her.\"It's not easy, but if there is, I have something to exchanged it with.\" Lin Qing He casually mentioned.\"What can you exchange with?\" The salesperson stared at her.If it weren't for Lin Qing He's get up and temperament, the salesperson won't necessarily be willing to talk to her. At this time, the staff at this workplace were also extremely proud and looked down upon the rural people.\"I'll give what is needed,\" Lin Qing He frankly answered.\"Your tone is too brazen.\" The salesperson inspected her as she spoke.\"Meizi, do you have any channels? If there are, then I won't short you your effort fee. I won't hide it from you Meizi. My family lacks nothing, only lacks a stove. And it is for the convenience of boiling water in winter. Normally, won't use it for cooking. \u201dLin Qing He glanced at her and whispered.\"I do know someone, but he lacks a pot. If you can get a pot, I will ask him to exchange the stove with you and also get you some coal!\" The salesperson lowered her voice and whispered as well.\"Meizi, are you serious?\"Lin Qing He was initially thinking since she worked in her department store, she should have connections. So she promised a bit of benefit to prompt her to inquire. This was better than blindly searching by herself, after all.Unexpectedly, she hit the jackpot.\"That's on the premise that you can bring a pot. Do you really have a pot?\" The young salesperson looked at her.\"Would I lie to you? When can the exchange happen?\" Lin Qing He whispered.\"I'll ask someone to watch the shop for me, and fetch the person for you. It'll take less than two hours, but you still have to show me your pot first.\" The young salesperson was obviously clever, responded.\"Then wait here for me first.\" Lin Qing He uttered.Then she went out of the department store and brought Zhou Dong back to the door of the supply and demand cooperative. She let him wait for her here, as she went to handle her matter.When she found a place where no one was there, she took out the old-fashioned double-eared pot and packed it into a nylon polybag.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 Nothing LeftThe salesperson and her fianc\u00e9 were relieved to hear that she was willing to change.The two of them were indeed preparing for marriage and family separation.\"In the future, when the coal is used up, I will come to your wife. Make sure to get some good one.\" Lin Qing He said to the man.\"Don't let anyone else know about this.\" The man nodded and stated.\"This is for sure. My family still has three sons to raise. So I'm relying on your coal.\" Lin Qing He affirmed.Both sides said goodbye to each other. The man rode back with a pot and a nylon polybag. Lin Qing He asked the salesperson to watch the good, then went to call Zhou Dong.As soon as he saw that the coal stove and large half bag of coal, Zhou Dong was stunned again.His Shenzi was capable! She can even get a coal stove and coal, which were used by city folks.But this ... how much does it cost?After the successful exchange, the salesperson went back. Lin Qing He ran the black market again and walked around. While she was at it, she took out another old-fashioned double-eared pot from the space, wrapped it in a nylon polybag, and placed it in the cart.There were other things, such as the foot basin and the likes. She went to the department store again. She bought hats for each of her sons. The kind with long flaps that can cover and protect the ears from frostbite.It took three industrial coupons.However, there were still a few industrial coupons left. Zhou Qing Bai sent it back last time. So she looked at it and bought woolen yarn to knit sweaters for the children.Initially, she wanted to buy shoes and socks, however, socks required cloth coupons, and canvas shoes required industrial coupons. The remaining cloth coupon and industrial coupons were used for two large duvet covers, hats, and woolen yarn. All gone now.But with that bolt of cloth, socks and shoes can be made.\"Can little Xi make shoes and socks?\"She was mostly done, so Lin Qing He and Zhou Dong ate the white bun when they prepared to go home, Lin Qing He asked.This time, only one per person.\"She can.\" Zhou Dong nodded quickly after hearing this as he ate a big white bun that he might not have had the opportunity to eat again in the future.\"Then I might have to trouble Little Xi to help this time to make a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks for each of my boys.\" Lin Qing He said.\"That's no problem. Do you need to make clothes? My sister also knows how to make clothes.\" Zhou Dong voiced out.\"No need. It's enough to ask their Eldest Aunt to make clothes for them, she is idle.\" Lin Qing He replied. What's more, Eldest Sister-in-law was also willing to make it.After all, she will also be paid, and not let her work in vain.When they returned home, it was almost four o'clock. Lin Qing He was exhausted to death.Once things were unloaded, she let Zhou Dong enter the house to drink, and then let him go back first.Mother Zhou and the children weren't home. They should be over at old Zhou family's side. Today, the production team went to hand over the public ration, so no work to do.Tomorrow was the big day, food distribution.Although Lin Qing He was very tired, she still sorted the things out in one go. She also took the old-style casserole pot from the space.Now she had a coal stove, she can simply stew everything in the casserole.The quilt was placed in the room, and two mattresses were also taken out.Taking this opportunity, Lin Qing He can bring out a lot of things, such as a kitchen knife. She planned to ask Mother Zhou whether she wants to buy one back, and an industrial coupon wasn't needed.As for giving it to Mother Zhou directly, forget it. She may faint.If she remembered correctly, the old Zhou family should be missing a few knives.All the other supplies were put in her room. Things such as enamel or foot basin were all placed where they should go.So many things brought back, but truthfully, there was nothing much when spread out.However, many people saw her and Zhou Dong on the way back. They especially noticed those big and small bags, that was filling the whole cart.Afraid that even if several households group together to buy, won't reach half of hers!Everyone in the village marveled, but their eyes that were looking at her nearly screamed this wealth diminishing woman mostly likely used up all the money sent back by Zhou Qing Bai!At home, Mother Zhou soon heard the news. Her heart ached when she brought a cartload of goods back.\"Let's go, back to your house to see what good things your mom has bought!\" Mother Zhou returned with Er Wa and San Wa.The few sisters-in-law looked at each other. Now there's not much to do as it was idle, so Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law closely followed.As for Third Sister-in-law, she was not interested, since she won't have a share of the things.She currently wanted to swiftly finish the clothes, and then make one for her daughter. Last night, she felt a little cold when sleeping.Her speed was also extremely fast. It wasn't possible today, but tomorrow morning she will definitely be able to finish Er Wa's cotton coat.There was a sewing machine in the old Zhou's house. After Lin Qing He moved out, Mother Zhou used the remaining money and coupon to buy it back in a fit of anger and put it in old Zhou's house to use.So with a sewing machine, the speed was very fast. It just takes more time to process the cotton, otherwise, it can be faster.Back to Mother Zhou who brought back Er Wa and San Wa, and also Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law. When they arrived, Lin Qing He had already been tidied up most of the thing.\"Mother, Grandma heard that you bought a whole cartful back?\" Er Wa, the astute one, came over to hug her leg and said.As soon as she saw that Mother Zhou and her sisters-in-law came together, Lin Qing He knew what was up and said, \"A whole cartful? That's because they exaggerate too much. How can there be so many things.\"As soon as Mother Zhou inspected, she really didn't see much. So she was internally relieved.At this moment, Second Sister-in-law saw the coal stove in the kitchen and widened her eyes: \"My God, Fourth's wife, where did you get the coal stove? Why did you bring it back?\"\"I entrusted someone the last time I went, so I brought it back while I'm there this time as well as the more than half of the bag of coal. It is because of these things, it looked much.\" Lin Qing He explained like this.\"There is a hearth in the house!\" Mother Zhou's heart hurt and also felt pained on behalf of her son. This coal stove was used by people in the city. To give Fourth's wife, who knows how much money was used to exchange!\"The stove is inconvenient. It is much more convenient to have a coal stove in winter. What's more, when placed in the room, it can be warm the room,\" Lin Qing He said.How much does it cost?Mother Zhou did not say this out loud, while Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law understood.\"By the way, Eldest Sister-in-law, I think the clothes you made for Da Ni and Er Ni are pretty good. Are you free to make Da Wa and their brothers two warm vests and inner pants?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"You still have fabric?\" Eldest Sister-in-law halted and asked.\"I do.\" Lin Qing He nodded. Then she entered the room, cropped a bit in the room to reserve some for Zhou Xi to make shoes and socks for the children, and brought out the rest.\"Two sets for each of them. Just lengthen it a bit, don't need to be too long. The rest of the cloth will be an effort fee for you, Eldest Sister-in-law. It should be enough to make two warm innerwear for little Zhou Yang.\" Lin Qing He said.Warm innerwear and trousers can be worn on their own in the spring., meaning it wasn't necessary to make any in the spring. As for the summer, have to make two more pieces. But let's talk about it in the summer. It was too early now.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 The Best Mother in the VillageEldest Sister-in-law Lin examined it and mentally calculated it. She felt that it was enough to make two warm clothes for her two-year-old son and extend the length a bit, so it would be possible to wear it next year. (T/N: the Lin is a typo in the raw)\"Last time I requested Third Sister-in-law, I gave two jins of brown sugar because I had a good bit of brown sugar then. Now I don't have much left at home. This small bag of rock sugar is for Eldest Sister-in-law to bring back and treat Da Ni and Er Ni.\" Lin Qing He used oil paper to wrap the small package of rock sugar and stated.\"Leave it for Da Wa and his brothers to eat.\" Eldest Sister-in-law politely said.\"There's still some left at home, take it.\" Lin Qing He stuffed it to her.Eldest Sister-in-law accepted it, and then returned with the cloth to start working.Then Lin Qing He turned to ask, \"Mother, this time I saw a new kitchen knife in the black market. Exactly the same as the one I used in my kitchen. I recall that the old one in old Zhou's house has gaps and isn't efficient to use, so I bought it back. Five yuans and no coupon needed. Do you want it? I didn\u2019t profit a penny from you. \"\"Show me.\" Mother Zhou hesitated before uttering.The kitchen knife at home indeed had a few chips. It was really easy for her to chop the meat with Lin Qing He's knife for Da Wa's breakfast in the morning.Lin Qing He showed it to her. Mother Zhou took out five yuan to give it to her. Lin Qing He accepted it without embarrassment, and mentioned, \"It's because I have an acquaintance, otherwise I can't buy this knife for five yuans. I'm not boasting. The things in the county city are very expensive, but it\u2019s really good quality. Like, my pot and casserole pot.\"It was only then Second Sister-in-law noticed that there was a second pan in the kitchen, and it was a double-eared pot fully equipped with a spatula lid.The casserole was also brand new.\"How much money have you spent!\" Mother Zhou couldn't hold back.\"When the grain gets distributed tomorrow and I buy the grain from the production team, the family will wait for the next time our Da Wa's father to send money back.\" Lin Qing He's words made Mother Zhou turned around and returned steaming.She carried a kitchen knife like she wanted to chop someone.Second Sister-in-law secretly uttered, It goes without saying, no matter how able Fourth Brother-in-law is, and it can't withstand Fourth's wife, this family destroyer?She didn't think Lin Qing He would lie, because it was not necessary at all since they would not request to borrow money from her.A coal stove, coals, a new pot, a new casserole pot, and also fabric, which were all seen. What about those unseen things placed in her room?These all cost a lot of money.Second Sister-in-law's relationship with her was normally lacking. Since Mother Zhou went back, she didn't stay any longer. She returned in a prideful mood.What kind of eyesight Lin Qing He had? How could she not know what this Second Sister-in-law thinks?She let her be.Truthfully, this time she didn\u2019t spend much money. A coal stove this big including coal was exchanged with a pot. The double-eared pot and casserole didn\u2019t cost money. Just the bolt of cloth required money, which was gained from selling meat in the space. She didn't add much.The rest was food. The enamel and foot basin didn't cost much. Lin Qing He had tallied it up on the way back, she didn't spend more than 20 yuan.It was very worthwhile to buy so many things with this much money.\"Go call your elder brother back to eat apples.\" Lin Qing He said to Er Wa.Er Wa immediately went out to fetch him. This time Da Wa didn't run far, and soon came back with Er Wa.Lin Qing He cut the apple for them, each get a quarter.\"Mother, is there more in the cupboard?\" Er Wa asked.\"Yes, and others too. Pears, white rabbit candy, sweet glutinous-rice stick, malted milk powder, canned food, etc. If you are obedient, you will have a treat. If you run out every day and get your clothes dirty, then don't think about eating it. \"Lin Qing He gave a little meaningful glance at Da Wa as she spoke.Da Wa was dumbfounded. Same with Er Wa. No wonder they were born from the same father and mother. Their expressions were the exact replica.Not just saying this, Lin Qing He also took them into the room to tour.\"Mother, mother, you are so wonderful.\" Er Wa was anxious to hug Lin Qing He to act spoil.Er Wa blushed and uttered, \"Then ... I will play less in the future.\"\"Alright.\" Lin Qing He nodded. She wrapped an estimate of half a jin piece of big fatty meat in oil paper. The old Lin Family would like it: \"Send it over to your grandpa and grandma to eat.\" (T/N: Lin??? Another typo. Should be Zhou...)\"I will go there.\" Da Wa took the big fatty meat and delivered it to their grandpa and grandma.Afterward, he can't wait to go home and anticipate for food.Tonight, Mother was going to make them stewed pork belly and bean, it sounds very fragrant. And the soup poured over rice! He can eat two and a half bowls of rice!Sure enough, when he came back, his mother had soaked the rice.\"Da Wa, call your little Xi Jie Jie over,\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Da Wa did what she told him to do now. He had no objection at all when she ordered him around because his mother bought so many delicious things for them!Their mother was simply the best mother in the world. Adding all the mothers in the whole village together still can't be as good as their mother!Zhou Xi had heard from her elder brother, so Lin Qing He gave her the rest of the cloth: \"Make a pair of shoes for each of them, and then make two pairs of socks. The rest, make two pairs of big socks, around three sizes bigger than your brother. \"Naturally, it was prepared for Zhou Qing Bai.As for her, she didn't need it, the original owner's socks were good and there were five pairs.Zhou Xi confirmed.\"Around half-past eight in the evening, come over with your brother to take the quilt back,\" Lin Qing He asserted.Naturally, it was better to sneakily take the quilt back late at night.That quilt weighed almost four jins, which was also very good.\"Thank you Shenzi.\" Zhou Xi understood how important a quilt is this period. Even if one had money, one may still not be able to get it.\"No need to thank. Your brother has worked hard today. There's no rush on the shoes and socks. So you don't need to work and spend kerosene at night.\" Lin Qing He said.As for others, she didn\u2019t give more. Although she tired Zhou Dong for the whole day today, she did give him three white buns to eat. For Zhou Dong who hadn\u2019t eaten much white flour and meat in a year, this was enough reward.As for making shoes and socks, it wasn't counted. After all, she gave such a large quilt. Any more, it wasn't Lin Qing He's style.In the evening, Lin Qing He had dinner with her three sons. The two eldest ones bathed in delight eating the rice. The little one, San Wa, also had a mouthful of oil.After eating, she let the brothers play in the yard, while Lin Qing He ate by herself.At eight o'clock in the evening, Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi came over. Lin Qinghe gave the quilt that had been replaced to them and then closed the door and went to bed.Now the days are really chilling. Last night wasn't so bad, but tonight she can really feel it.The three children were called by her to sleep in her Kang because it was really cold tonight.There are two four-jin quilts at home, which remained from the time of marriage. Plus the one given to Zhou Dong siblings, it was a total of three. The original owner enjoyed what can be considered sufficient supplies.As for the two seven-jin large quilts, those were placed on kang head by Lin Qing He. They still don't need to use such a large quilt yet.For the four of them, it was enough to only use one large four-jin quilt.After all, the three boys are all like heaters. So their bodies were extremely warm.Jie Jie: Older Sister-don't have to be relatedIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 Food distribution, buying grain &amp; stewed yellow pearThe next day was the day of food distribution for the group.This kind of day had nothing to do with Lin Qing He and her three sons because her family had separated off and had no share of labor. Because there was no labor done, even she didn't get the most basic headcount share of grain.This was the rule of their community. Unless they were old, weak, sick, or disabled, they have to work in order to have a headcount portion in addition to the work points portion.The original owner, as a youth in her peak, she didn't work in the field, then there was nothing to say. Even Da Wa, Er Wa San Wa also didn't have the so-called headcount level of grains.But it didn\u2019t matter, without a share, she can still buy.There was no hurry, since buying food with the production team had to wait until the community finished getting their share first and there was leftover remaining.She knew that this year's production team got a hefty harvest, so naturally, there would be surplus grain.So no worries at all.While at old Zhou's side, they had already picked out a lot of grain back before nine in the morning. Of course, this was what Da Wa and Er Wa said when they came back.The whole village was very happy on a day like today. The children were running all over the street and Lin Qing He also didn't restrain the two brothers.Each got a big white rabbit candy and was sent away.Not mentioning that the two little brothers chewing big white rabbit toffee in their mouths received their little friends' envy and drooling appearances. Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi also came to transport their family's grain at approximately ten-thirty.Zhou Dong came over and said that in a while, the distribution would be all over.That is to say, it was alright to go now. Once she arrives, the whole group will mostly finish getting their shares.\"Then are you free now? If it's okay, push the cart and make a trip with Shenzi.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Now is no problem,\" Zhou Dong replied.So Lin Qing He let him bring the cart over while she grabbed the money. Then she carried San Wa and locked the door.Zhou Dong brought the cart over and Lin Qing He followed him to the team.A lot of women saw her heading over, and all were whispering. Who didn\u2019t know that she was going to buy food? That was to say, the days were good now. If she was like this in the past, then she would be waiting to starve to death!Back then, there was no such good life like now.But because of old Zhou family and Father Zhou's and Mother Zhou's good reputation in the village, they said nothing.The team leader had no prejudice against Lin Qing He. Although he felt that she didn't know how to live a life, it was someone else's business after all. What's more, she had money to buy and didn't want extra (like a freebie) from the team.Lin Qing He had it all planned out this time. Because there were so many goods in the space, she intends to do for appearance sake.After all, Zhou Qing Bai has no income in the future, and she can't really be so scrupulous.But in the eyes of the villagers, this time she was extremely wasteful with money because she didn't buy much of others. Just mostly wheat!They have long heard Da Wa openly brag about their mother making all kinds of food for them every day at home. Just by looking, how can they not tell?Lin Qing He bought a hundred jins of wheat. A jin of wheat cost more than three dimes. A hundred jins of wheat totaled to more than thirty yuan.Besides wheat, were corn kernels, which was used to grind into cornmeal. This was cheaper. She asked for eighty jins.There were fifty kilograms of millet. Next were mung beans, adzuki beans, soybeans, peanuts, sesame seeds. For these, she didn\u2019t require much. Mung beans, red beans, and yellow beans were ten jins each. Peanuts were a lot more, thirty jins. Also a good bit of sesame seeds, twenty jins.She got a sack of sweet potato, which was twenty jins.As for the cheaper dried sweet potato, she didn't need any. This stuff can be ground into sweet potato flour, but it was particularly unpalatable. This was something in the original owner's memory.But most people in the village were eating this right now.After asking for these things, Lin Qing He didn't intend to ask for coarse grain.But these things still spent a good chunk of fortune. Seeing her spending the money without blinking, some women in the village couldn't help but feel distressed for her!These things will cost about sixty yuans!Everyone else came to the team for their share of food and then wait for the team to divide the money. Even if there wasn't much, everyone can still have a sum of money throughout the year. Who would ever act like her?Others, they don't eat. just flour. And a big family received only a few jin of wheat ah!And if she was willing to work, not only will she get a headcount share, but three children too. What's more, she can also get work points to exchange for food. Even if it wasn't enough to eat, she can buy then. At most, she can spend a few yuans to buy it. Then would there be a need to throw out so much money?Lin Qing He was unfamiliar with everyone and didn't have any intention to talk to them because the generation gap was too big. There was no need to force herself. Anyway, the original owner had such a personality, she can just follow it.She asked Zhou Dong to transport the food and will sort it herself.Zhou Dong said: \"Shenzi, I will get you firewood in the afternoon. However, tomorrow the team will be busy planting winter wheat tomorrow and the day after. I won't have time to. Once this is over, I will have nothing to do then.\"\"OK.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Da Wa and Er Wa came in and their eyes lit up looking at the food in the house. With this food, they will not be short of food this winter!They didn't have much judgment now. So naturally, they didn't know that much. Truthfully, these foods weren't enough to eat.Especially once Zhou Qing Bai returned. However, Lin Qing He already made plans. This 100-jin wheat and 80-jin corn will wait until Zhou Qing Bai to come back and then grind it. Before that, she'll consume those in her space as much as possible.\"I'm going to prepare for lunch. You two brothers take good care of San Wa.\" Lin Qinghe instructed.After she finished eating in the morning, she set the dough aside to rise, and now it was ready. She will make noodles for noon.Eating noodles in scallion oil accompanied by bacon, the taste would be particularly fragrant. Even Lin Qing He liked to eat it.She had nothing to do now, so she wondered which day she'll try to cook braised meat.There was no rush at the moment, let's wait until the children\u2019s sweaters are knitted first. She will knit herself. There was one in the cabinet that was particularly new, which was newly knitted last year. However, the three children have none.Lin Qing He also knew how to knit sweaters. She had learned from her grandma in the country when she was a child. Although she was out of practice, she still had the original owner's memory. With the combination of the two, she can knit it for the boys. No need to let others do it.After eating noodles in the afternoon, Lin Qing He led Da Wa and Er Wa to twine the ball of yarn. This was for knitting sweaters for the two of them, so naturally, two of them were happy.With the help of the brothers, it goes without saying that the speed was very fast.At about one o'clock in the afternoon, she took the three boys to take a nap. When she woke from her nap, she stewed rock sugar and yellow pear for the boys.She sent them to wrap yarn balls. She was so bored that she dug out the flesh inside the pears for the brothers to eat. Then she poured cold water into the pear, put some rock sugar and red dates into it, and then cover over with the flat cut-off pear tops (like the picture above). It was put in a bowl, which was then placed in a pot on the stove to stew away.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 Sesame Pork Ribs CongeeIf Mother Zhou saw this, she will definitely nag how it wastes wood. But Mother Zhou had no time to come at the moment because the family had just got their share of food, and it goes without saying that it needed to be sorted out.When Mother Zhou heard that she had spent more than sixty yuan to buy food, her heart felt blocked.\"This is a lot less than last year.\" Second Sister-in-law commented.This was true. Last year the original owner bought about 80 yuan of food, which caused a huge disturbance in the village.Of course, wheat was also the most bought.\"It can't be that she bought the stove and coal and have no money left?\" Second Sister-in-law didn't need an answer and kept mumbling.As soon as this word came out, she felt that she found the truth. Last time, Fourth's wife said that she had no money in her pocket, so she didn't expect that she could still spend so much to buy food with the team.This year was much less than last year. Afraid that this time she was really a mountain running out of the water!Mother Zhou's expression was very dark and mentally suppressed a sigh. She had witnessed how Fourth's wife treated her three grandchildren a lot better and acted more attentive to them than before, sending large bone and fatty meat one after another. However, she was still so unreliable with money.But her son wasn't controlling the money. No matter how much money, it wasn't enough for the Fourth's wife to lose ah!Seeing that her mother-in-law's face wasn't pretty, Second Sister-in-law did not say anything, but she was still somewhat pleased.No matter how much Fourth Brother-in-law earned, it was useless. It can't stand against a wife in the family who spends money like running water and does not treat money as money.As for Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law, they did not have so much leisure time. Both were using sewing machines in turn, as they wanted to quickly make the clothes for the brothers so that they could do it for their own family.The Third Sister-in-law's speed was very fast. Er Wa's cold-resistant, cotton-padded clothes, and trousers were soon completed. Although Mother Zhou was angry, she still took it this opportunity to send it over.When she brought it over, she saw what her three grandchildren were drinking, something pear water. They had an expression full of satisfaction and comfort.\"Mother is here. I prepared rock sugar and pear water for the three brothers.\" Lin Qing He saw her come over and said.Mother Zhou asked, \"What is this? Rock sugar and pear water?\"\"Well, the humidity is pretty low these days. Yesterday I saw some pear in the county city, so I bought them back. Today I stew rock sugar and pear water for them.\" Lin Qing He explained.\"Dates too!\" Er Wa interjected.\"Delicious!\" Da Wa said.\"Mother, eat.\" San Wa was anxious to drink.Lin Qing He fed it to him. There was only one box of pears in her space, but when she bought it, she asked the wholesale manager to take out all the extra packaging for her, so the capacity of one box was equivalent to two boxes.Same for the two boxes of apples.These things were accumulated to be eaten, and her image of family destroying had long engraved into people's hearts. If one went out and said that she was a good wife of a thrifty family, no one would believe.Similarly, Mother Zhou also didn't believe it. But seeing that she made it for her three grandchildren, she didn't even comment.\"This is what your Third Sister-in-law made for Er Wa. Have a look.\" Mother Zhou took out the cotton-padded trousers in the basket.With one look, Lin Qing He knew it was suitable for Er Wa. He could even wear it next winter. Of course, she had to make another set for the kids next winter.But this set was enough this winter.\"It was hard on Third Sister-in-law. Once she finishes Da Wa, she can rest. When she gives birth, I will go to the slaughterhouse to see if there are any trotters and get two for her to stew with peanuts for more breastmilk.\" Said.Mother Zhou heard her words and remarked, \"How can trotters be easy to acquire?\"Naturally, Lin Qing He could tell that Mother Zhou wanted it. As she fed San Wa pear water, she stated: \"I know someone. She has acquaintances inside. If there is no coupon, the price will be higher. If there is a coupon, it won't be expensive.\"As for giving food coupons privately, she knew there was no need to say everything, only she knew was enough.Mother Zhou: \"!\"She knew that Fourth's wife wasn't principled, and she was always able to get meat. She didn't expect that she knew someone in the slaughterhouse!\"At that time, can you try to get trotters?\" Said Mother Zhou.They were all children of old Zhou Family. Although she loves Da Wa and his brothers more, the other children were not treated badly. Especially since Third's wife who injured her body when she gave birth to Wu Ni and took so many years to be pregnant again. If they have the condition, naturally they would want to raise the children well.\"Wait until she gives birth.\" Lin Qing He replied.However, things like trotters wasn't a rare thing. Just needed to go to the supply and demand cooperative to tell Mei Jie in advance and there should be no problem.Mother Zhou had initially planned to come here to admonish a sentence or two, but she got interrupted by this matter. It won't be good to mention it now. Before leaving, she said: \"If there isn't enough food at home, let the family know.\"Lin Qing He knew that she was cherishing her three grandsons, but still she was grateful. She refused, saying: \"No need, there are still many left at home. But if we really don't have any food, then I will definitely say.\" In the end, she left some leeway.Mother Zhou glanced at the three grandchildren who were being raised more and more properly, so she didn't say anything.After her three sons ate the rock sugar and pear water, she let them continue to wrap their wool. Da Wa and Er Wa had no objection being commanded at all. And that's because the rock sugar and pear water they drank today were so delicious!Almost in the evening, the yarn balls were completely twined for her. Lin Qing He stewed sesame ribs congee in the casserole pot on the stove.The sesame was the one bought today and was a bit difficult to wash. She was still able to wash it clean.The sesame ribs congee was served with pickles and bacon. She was too lazy to heat up the bacon anymore, so she directly threw it into the congee.However, even like this, Da Wa and Er Wa also ate happily and praised that sesame ribs congee was really delicious!After eating, Lin Qing He tidied up the bowls and chopsticks. Seeing that the sky still wasn't dark yet, she collected her clothes and let Da Wa and Er Wa take San Wa to play at the entrance for a while. She began to knit the sweaters.It was only five o'clock now. At this time, most people have just started cooking in the village, while her family had finished eating.The villagers saw Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa playing at the door, and asked them with a smile if they had eaten white flour.This was actually a kind of envy disease. There was no way. How much wheat and flour do the villagers get after having to work hard throughout the year?While Lin Qing He didn't have to do anything. She dared to buy a hundred jins of wheat with the team in one breath. Eighty percent of it becomes powder form, which was equivalent to approximately 80 jins of white flour!How can people in the village not be envious?\"Didn't have white flour. I ate sesame ribs congee.\" Da Wa raised his eyebrows and answered the man.The man was choked and resentful walked away.\"Haven't finished the rice at home yet?\" Someone asked when they heard the ribs congee.It was said that yesterday Lin Qing He took Zhou Dong to transport a truckload of goods back. Zhou Dong had a solid mouth and they could not pull anything out. Nobody knew what exactly Lin Qing He bought.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 Hoarding firewood &amp; remaining indoor during winterHowever, they have heard a bit from Second Sister-in-law Zhou, that there were a coal stove and coal, as well as a new pot!Last time Lin Qing He did to buy rice, but it was only a few jins, and it was very expensive. It also required a lot of food coupons. But it happened long time ago, how could there any left?Needless to say, she must have bought a lot from the county city yesterday.Putting aside the sesame seeds, there were ribs. This was too gluttonous. Their team had not divided meat yet!The last time they ate meat was when they finished the autumn harvest last year!Here, they divided the meat twice a year, once during this period, and again before the New Year.Then it will be next year.But look at Lin Qing He acting like this, this was obviously being rich and willful!\"There are still some at home, but not much.\" Zhou Da Wa's eyes spun before he answered.Nobody doubted that a five-year-old kid will tell lies. After all, such rice was not easy to buy. Many people eat it in the county city, while the villagers don't eat it.Because it was too expensive and can be compared with white flour. So who would have more spare money to buy it? And what's more, it needed food coupons!At the end of the year, the ration coupons get distributed. But these coupons do not include food coupons, only imported oil coupons, and cotton coupons.Around six o'clock, Zhou Dong was back with two bundles of firewood.Lin Qing He wanted to settle the firewood money, but Zhou Dong did not accept it.Last night the brother and sister duo brought the quilt home in the dark. It was really a good quilt, so warm and soft. It wasn't like their family's quilt. Not only were they old, but also dry and hard. Although they were better than nothing, it really didn't keep warm.The quilt Lin Qing He gave was obviously very new. At least with such a quilt, his sister didn't need to freeze this winter.As for him, it was okay. He was more resistant to cold.After taking Shenzi's quilt, how could he accept payment again? In fact, he planned not to accept money for the firewood he brought back.\"If you don't accept it, I don't want this firewood.\" Lin Qing He declared.\"Shenzi ...\"Before he finished speaking, Zhou Dong was interrupted by Lin Qing He: \"Shenzi's quilt can't be used. If I can use it, I won't have to give it. So no need to be concerned about it. And also you helped me transport my food back today and Little Xi is helping to make the boys' shoes and socks at home now. You don't need to get even with me. One matter for one matter.\"Then she stuffed him with three dimes: \"Remember, when winter wheat is planted, you have to gather firewood back.\"\"Shenzi ...\"\"Hurry back to get something to eat. You have been busy for a whole day.\" Lin Qing He said. Then she closed the door, not bothering with Zhou Dong.It was pretty late now. Just six o'clock and it was already cold. The sky also turned gray.There wasn't much kerosene left at home. Only a little more than half jin per month. How could that be enough?The next time she finds Mei Jie to buy meat, she must ask her if she had any channels. She must prepare more kerosene for her home.Lin Qing He took this opportunity to boil water for the boys at this time.Although the bath was once every three days, the hands and feet had to be washed every day.After washing, she shooed all three of them to go on the Kang.She lit the faint kerosene lamp and then continued to knit sweaters.Da Wa blurted out: \"Mother, earlier when playing at the entrance, someone asked me if there is any rice in my house. I said there's not much left at home.\"\"Smart.\" Lin Qing He gave him an admiring look.\"Hehe.\" Da Wa grinned.Only then Lin Qing He recalled it. Now the grain had been distributed, even if the atmosphere was very good nowadays and many people don't even need to close the door, Lin Qing He still felt that it was better to defend against the just in case.So after waiting three days, she told Zhou Xi her plans when she came over.Zhou Xi had hurriedly made shoes and socks for Da Wa and his brothers these three days just so she can go out with her elder brother to get firewood tomorrow.Lin Qing He said: \"Let your elder brother find some villagers to go together, like two more partners. When the time comes, let your elder brother give them some effort money and you don't have to go. You stay behind to guard the house.\"There were also some people in the village who have unclean hands and feet. The brother and sister relied on that food for the whole year.Zhou Xi froze: \"Shenzi, there shouldn't be any matter.\"\"Under normal circumstances, there aren't. But this kind of thing, there's always an in case. Let your elder brother find someone else. Others can sell up to two bundles of firewood at the end of the day. At that time, tell your elder brother to equally split. You don't need to go,\" Lin Qing He explained.Zhou Xi heeded her words and nodded when she said it so seriously.Once she got back, she told her brother. Hearing this, Zhou Dong also felt that it was better to leave one person at home, so he went out to find his partner.Zhou Dong was a hardworking and diligent person and had good partners in the village. In this kind of matter, he went to find his best partner. He found two and said that he'll evenly split.When the two partners heard that they were selling to Lin Qing He, they naturally had no objections.They also go find firewood and sell it. They gathered two bundles of firewood to sell in the county city and get almost three dimes. But the county city was very far away. They were very envious of Zhou Dong.He can directly carry back to the village and sell it to Fourth Shenzi Zhou. He didn't have to travel that far and stay in the county city for a long time. Sometimes, if they bump into in one or two stingy people, they may not be able to earn for three dimes.But Fourth Shenzi Zhou didn't want anyone else\u2019s. She was afraid that she labeled as someone using finance to make people slaves. Only wanting Zhou Dong's, was to let the brother and sister be able to have an extra meal. This way, nobody can talk about her.\"Shenzi requested me to get it, but I couldn't get it all by myself, so I found you. You better not talk nonsense, otherwise, I won't find you for such good matters in the future.\" Zhou Dong said.\"That's a must!\" His two partners immediately promised.Only fools would this kind of randomly wagging their tongues. Although Shenzi was a big spender, she didn't do anything to the villagers. She didn't go out much.The next day before sunrise, they dragged Zhou Dong's cart and headed out.They came back after three o'clock in the afternoon with a cart full of firewood. They were all bundled up properly. In total, thirteen bundles of firewood!The cart was piled high and transported to the door.Zhou Dong brought it over on his own. His two partners did not come, because this was Zhou Dong's work and they profit from it.Lin Qing He was a bit surprised. She had thought that it would seven or eight bundles at most. She did not expect them to bring that much back.She got Zhou Dong to move the thirteen bundles of firewood to the fire shed in the backyard. She went in and brew a cup of brown sugar water for Zhou Dong. Zhou Dong was embarrassed. Lin Qing He asked him to drink it before she settled the payment.Thirteen bundles of firewood totaled two yuans for Zhou Dong.The action displayed no stinginess, as this was the source for her family's firewood for isolating indoor during this year's winter.Knowing her temperament, Zhou Dong embarrassedly headed over to split up with his two partners.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 Acknowledged as the best meatBoth partners said that six dimes would be enough, and the remaining eight dimes would be given to Zhou Dong. After all, if it were not for him, they would not be able to partake.Earning six dimes in one go was a lot. It should be known that adults' one day worth was only about four dimes. This was the average and very few earn six or seven dimes.They, teens get at most two dimes.Now the winter wheat has already planted, they were about to enter the day of loafing. At this time, many hardworking people chose to find firewood to sell in the county city.This way can somehow financially support their family expense, without having to sit down and empty out their nest?Especially when they were teens, and have the largest appetite.After being busy for the whole day, they can't make much money. But today, they made six dimes, which is really a lot!Then they asked if they were needed tomorrow?Zhou Dong had checked. His Shenzi said yes. It was the same phrase, she'll take as much as possible.Zhou Dong replied to his two partners. Hearing the answer, both's eyes lit up and agreed on to start at the same time tomorrow. Tomorrow, they will gather more back!Each of their families was delighted when they heard about the money their son made today. They simultaneously settled on not say anything outside.What if Lin Qing He becomes dissatisfied when it gets out?Looking at the whole village, there was no one who can be generous like her. Even if they just got their share of food, winter isolation was soon. Once the winter was over, there would a period of temporary shortage. Now was the slack season, they would earn a little if they can, after all, there were not many days like this.A huge amount of firewoods was delivered every day. The firewood shed Zhou Qing Bai built for his family don't any space left. Lin Qing He asked Zhou Dong to put them in an empty place in the backyard and then covered them with bundles of straw. There was a heavy dew now and also needed to defend against rain. Covering was a must.Speaking of rain, when Zhou Dong returned with the fifth cart of firewood, autumn rain began.Everyone in the village said that this rain came at a perfect time because the wheat was planted and naturally, the rain was needed to moisturize it.After the autumn rain came, the day became completely cold.Lin Qing He estimated that it might only be seven or eight degrees, so she bundled up big Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa without hesitation.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law's finished cotton-padded clothes, shoes, and socks. She equipped them all on them.She has already woven Da Wa's sweater, so she puts on Da Wa first. Da Wa especially satisfied with this new set, and going out to boast was a must.The autumn rain stopped after five continuous days. Lin Qing He let him be. As for the firewood at home, these days Zhou Dong brought a maximum of 13 or 14 bundles of firewood when they had a lot that day, and 11 or 12 bundles when they had little. The teen boys were full of energy and that's because it was a rare opportunity. So they spared no effort to make use of the time to make money.After so many days in a row, enough firewood was accumulated at home.Even if she heated the kang and wasting wood for cooking at home, there was no worry about not having enough.Because even if she was a big wood burner, a bundle of firewood can be used for two days. There was also a half a bag of unused coal. The accumulated firewood was enough.There were food and firewood in the house. This winter was definitely going to be comfortable.Lin Qing He let Da Wa go out to play on the first day the autumn rain stop, but the next day they were required to stay back and watch the house. She told them that if the food at home was stolen, then they would have nothing to eat. At that time, don't blame her for not cooking.Da Wa and Er Wa naturally expressed their willingness to stay at home.Da Wa was six years old after the new year. And these days having been subtly influenced by Lin Qing He, he cared about family a lot more and no longer didn't care about anything.Now he knew that he need to protect food.So as soon as they heard that their mother was going to the supply and demand cooperative to see if there was any meat to buy, the two of them immediately said they would stay behind.Because they haven't eaten meat for a good few days, and the eggs were almost finished!Needless to say, Lin Qing He wouldn't use meat every day. Even if there was meat distribution before the autumn rain, it couldn't be justified as she didn't go buy any.So she planned to go around today. Of course, she called Mother Zhou over to her house.However, she had locked her own room door and asked Mother Zhou to watch the kids at home.Mother Zhou heard that she was going to buy meat and did not stop her. She thought she had no money, so she didn't expect her to buy meat. Why didn't she go over to buy when the team divided the meat?Mother Zhou didn't know that it was Lin Qing He spurning the meat from the team as they were leftovers, what's more, the community's remain. Only the original owner, who didn't have Mei Jie, would want it. She wouldn't.Leaving Mother Zhou looking after her three sons at home, Lin Qing He came over to the supply and demand cooperative to find Mei Jie.It just happened that Mei Jie was working today. She has also inquired about Lin Qing He, the identity she said wasn't false. But she also heard that Lin Qing He was infamous for her love to spend money and was a family ruining, gluttonous woman.However, this has nothing to do with Mei Jie. She won't interfere so much. It was enough as long as her identity was true and the military food coupons that were usable all over the country she given last time was from proper channel.As for others, it was take what she needed.Lin Qing He was naturally happy to see Chen Mei.\"Qing He Mei, what are you going to buy today? Yesterday, a new batch of shrimp skins and red dates arrived. Would you like to buy some back for nourishment?\" Mei Jie greeted.\"Of course, I want.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Ah Mei, is this your relative?\" The salesperson next to her asked Mei Jie.\"Yes, my sister,\" Mei Jie said with a smile.Lin Qing He heard the salesperson tell her: \"Got subsidiary food coupon? If not, it might be more expensive.\"Under normal circumstances, without a subsidiary food coupon, one can't buy anything. But if the salesperson was willing, one can buy a half a jin, because there was an internal share. This part didn't a coupon, but that required acquaintance.Toward this kind of calcium supplement, Lin Qing He naturally wanted it. Although there was some at home, she wouldn't disdain haven't too much. Throwing some in when cooking soup and congee, make it fresh and nourishing.So Lin Qing He got the red dates and the shrimp skin. After paying, she came out with Mei Jie to talk outside.\"Mei Jie, can I trouble you to set aside some meat for me tomorrow.\" Lin Qing He said.\"What kind? How much?\" Sister Mei whispered.\"Give me one jin of lean meat. Also, grab some ribs and big bones for me.\" Lin Qing He stuffed two yuans and a one-jin food coupon over as she spoke.\"No fatty meat?\" Mei Jie accepted without a trace and blurted.It was acknowledged that fatty meat was the best meat at this time.\"Will it be difficult?\" Lin Qinghe hesitated slightly.This indicated that she wants, but didn't want to make it difficult for her.Sister Mei grinned and said, \"I can get you half a jin.\"\"Then many thanks Jie.\" Lin Qing He responded immediately.\"No need. It's because of you that my kids at home can eat more.\" Mei Jie said.This time Lin Qing He gave her a universal coupon. It was good to use. It can be exchanged for whatever she needed, with additional of two yuan.Lin Qing He politely made small talks and then mentioned matter about Third Sister-in-law's breastfeeding after she gave birth.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 Pickled EggsMei Jie expressed: \"These two pig's trotters are nothing. If you tell me one day in advance, I will get it.\"\"Thank you, Jie.\" Lin Qing He nodded.The two chattered for a while, and Lin Qing He talked about the kerosene. Mei Jie told her to come over tomorrow and take it all back together. Seeing that there was a guest at Mei Jie's counter, she said goodbye.Lin Qing He wasn't in a hurry to go back. She covered the basket with a tablecloth at the bottom of the basket and wandered around a lot of places. She bought some peppers, dried ginger, garlic and the like, before returning home.When she almost reached Zhoujia Village, Lin Qing He took the eggs out of the space. Around three jin of it. As for the meat, she took out none.That was tomorrow's matter.However, two buns were brought out. The three kids had not eaten meat for several days, so got to give them some meat.In fact, this was her standard. If it was according to the village's standard, the brothers were undoubtedly living in a honey jar.One egg every day and occasionally white rabbit candies, apples, pears, and red dates.If this was suffering, then what was terrible?But Lin Qing He didn't have this awareness.After returning home, Lin Qing He told Mother Zhou about the trotters, saying that she needs to give a head up one day before she wants it.Mother Zhou saw that she really had a way, and she felt a surge of emotions inside. As expected, one who can eat can further one's own interest.She peeked into her basket. Lin Qing He was naturally not afraid of her looking. She took out two white buns.\"White buns!\" Both Da Wa's and Er Wa's eyes lit up.San Wa, who became more intelligent in recent days, immediately ran up and uttered 'eat, eat'.Although he hadn't eaten this white bun for a while, he still had the impression that it was delicious!\"Da Wa bring it in and cut it in half with a knife. Remember, you are the eldest brother. You have to be fair and just.\" Lin Qing He handed the two big buns to Da Wa as she instructed.Da Wa said: \"Of course I will be fair and just!\"Er Wa was worried and followed him into the kitchen.It was just cutting a bun. He'll be six years old after the New Year. So it wasn't a big deal. Lin Qing He was at ease letting him handle it. (T/N: without supervision, I wouldn't)Da Wa cut it, divided one half to Er Wa, and another half to San Wa. But he worried that San Wa will spill the oil all over his clothes and make it difficult to wash, so he didn't give it to him. Instead, he put it in a bowl and brought it out to his mother.\"Give that half to your grandma.\" Lin Qing He took the bowl and spoon-fed it to San Wa.Mother Zhou wanted to say no, but Lin Qing He had carried San Wa and the bowl inside to eat in the hall. It was too cold outside.\"Grandma, taste it. This white bun is very yummy!\" Zhou Da Wa gave it to his grandma and urged.\"Yummy!\" Er Wa nodded.Mother Zhou received the bun. This contained eggs and meat. What's more, the bun was made from flour. It'll be strange if it wasn't yummy.Seeing her daughter-in-law really doesn't mind her eating, Mother Zhou ate it too. Really must say ... It's so delicious that she was about to swallow her tongue.\"Mother, do you want to stay for lunch.\" Lin Qing He asked.\"No, I'll go home now that you're back,\" Mother Zhou responded.\"Da Wa, Er Wa, send your grandma back.\" Lin Qing He directed.\"Grandma, let's go, we will send you back.\" Da Wa and Er Wa said.Mother Zhou let the brothers sent her back since there was not much distance and the two of them were wearing much warmer this year.She saw that there was a lot of firewood in the house. This winter, they didn't need to be afraid of not having enough to burn. Also, Da Wa had a sweater on, and Er Wa's was already half woven.There were many yarn balls at home, it seems like San Wa also had a share.Once she reached home, Mother Zhou let Da Wa and Er Wa go back before she entered the old house.Father Zhou was dozing off. When he saw her coming back, he uttered, \"Why you're back?\"\"Fourth's wife is home.What's the point of staying.\" Mother Zhou said.Father Zhou's nose moved and voiced out, \"What's that smell?\"\"Had half a bun over there.\" Mother Zhou answered.There was meat at home, but when he thought about the bun, Father Zhou can't help but feel nostalgic.In his life, he had eaten white bun once. The taste was something that he would never forget in his life and still think about it even until now.\"Want to eat?\" Mother Zhou looked at him and knew what he was thinking and chuckled.\"What eat. Third's wife is about to give birth, no need to waste. Leave it for her to eat.\" Father Zhou waved his hand and said.The current days were much better than before. Everyone was full and satisfied. He was satisfied. As for the white bun, nothing bad will happen if he doesn't eat one.He never thought over at this side, Er Wa mentioned to his mother: \"Mother, Grandma has eaten, Grandpa hasn't eaten yet.\"Grandpa was usually very nice to them.Da Wa also nodded: \"Before we were hungry, Grandpa would call us to go over and eat.\"Although it wasn't delicious, it can fill their stomach.Because the original owner didn't pay much attention, they used to go to their grandpa and grandma when they were hungry, so they still remember these things.Lin Qing He understood and said: \"Then tomorrow when the mother goes to buy meat, I will bring a white bun back. You guys bring it over to your grandfather. However, you have to be stealthy when bringing it and must watch him eat it.\"Alright.\" Both Da Wa and Er Wa nodded.Lin Qing He beamed and rubbed their heads: \"Not bad.\"Both of their eyes shone.\"What do you want to eat at noon?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Eat egg dumplings,\" Da Wa responded.Er Wa nodded.This was made last night, and there was no problem to leave it out in this weather overnight.So Lin Qing He cooked dumplings for them. The dumpling soup also had some shrimp skin, and the taste was very good.Now that there was nothing to do at home every day, Lin Qing He wanted to pickle some salted eggs.She knew how to. What's more, she was using the soil method. She used to learn it from her grandmother. It oozed out a lot of oil.She preserved a small jar of salted eggs. Not much, just around two jins. She took it from the space again and also used the ones she brought back today from 'outside'.When marinating the eggs, she had to add some white wine. The pickling time was one month. Now it was marinated, it'll be next month before she can take it out to eat.When pickling eggs, she naturally called Da Wa and Er Wa to help out. For example, she handed the task of egg scrubbing to them.She had no intention to raise them delicately.After washing the eggs, she immediately rinsed their hands with warm water and smeared it with vanishing cream. With that, she sent them to the kang to eat apples.Putting the jar of pickled eggs in the corner, she came to Kang and squeezed in with the brothers. However, she was knitting a sweater.With the current temperature and sufficient firewood at home, she didn't need to save on her usage. The kang was burning, so it was very warm.The kang was relatively dry and they got to consume more moisturizing food like fruits. But there was no fruit in the supply and marketing cooperatives.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 Cooking pig fatShe saw tangerine over at the county city's supply and demand cooperative last time and none at the community's supply and demand cooperative. At that time, she did not think about this as there were apples, pears, and grapes in the space and end up not buy it.Now she regretted it.Since she was all day at home, the sweater knitting was naturally fast. At night they ate seaweed and shrimp congee. She worked overtime on the knitting for a while and finished knitting Er Wa's sweater.The next day, she got Da Wa and his brothers to stay at home. The Kang was heated and they were fully-fed. They just need to babysit San Wa. She will return as soon as possible.She walked faster because there were three children alone at home. Once she arrived, Mei Jie handed it over. She also gave Mei Jie a piece of soap.Her space contained a few boxes of it. There were ten pieces of soap in a box. She got both of the laundry and bath ones.At a glance, Mei Jie knew that the soap must have been bought from the county city, otherwise, it wouldn't be so pretty and fragrant.Naturally, she dare not accept such a good thing from her. Lin Qing He said to her: \"Jie, please accept it. Don't be polite with me. Just for the bones you got for me, I must thank you.\"For two yuans, Chen Mei brought her half a jin of fatty meat and half a jin of lean meat. On top of that, three ribs, two large bones, and a half pair of pig ears.This was definitely enough.In addition to these, she also gave two jins of kerosene.She did pay, but this quality soap was a token of goodwill for Chen Mei, because she could see that Chen Mei was a good person even though she was a little proud when she first met her.Seeing that she was really sincere in giving it, Mei Jie accepted it. This kind of soap was very good to use. Without two yuans, one can't buy it. She whispered: \"There isn't much kerosene this time. Next time, there's a new batch, I'll set aside more for you. \"\"Thank you, Mei Jie.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Bidding goodbye to Mei Jie, Lin Qing He put everything in the basket, covered it with a cloth, and returned home.Once she got home, she took out the fatty meat in the space as well to prepare for oil extraction.\"Send it over to your grandfather.\" Lin Qing He gave them a white bun. As for the brothers, she gave no more.The brothers showed no hesitation when they heard that they would send it to their grandfather.They wrapped it in oil paper, placed it in his arms, and delivered it to old Zhou's house.These days were too cold, Father Zhou had been on the kang. He smoked a big cigarette and felt comfortable.\"Grandpa, we came.\" Da Wa and Er Wa grinned.\"Why are you two brothers here?\" Father Zhou asked with a smile.\"Grandpa, this is for you to eat.\" Da Wa took out the oil paper from his arms and gave it to their grandpa.\"What is this?\" Father Zhou paused for a moment and asked.\"Grandpa will know when you look at it.\" Blinking, Er Wa declared.Father Zhou received it and then saw this was a hot white bun. Stunned, he blurted: \"Where did this come from?\"\"Our mother bought it,\" Da Wa said.\"Yesterday, Grandma ate it, but Grandpa hasn't eaten it yet. So Mother went to buy meat and bought it back. Grandpa, eat it,\" Er Wa explained.Father Zhou approximately understood. Because they had eaten yesterday and he hadn't, so his two grandsons brought it up. With that, their mother had bought it back for him.\"Grandpa doesn't need to eat, you guys can eat it.\" Father Zhou felt very comforted on inside. He thought that Fourth's wife was a good role-model.\"We have eaten.\" Da Wa shook his head.\"En, we ate yesterday.\" Er Wa nodded. Although he was also greedy, he never of eating their grandpa's.So Father Zhou ate his second white bun in his life.It was as delicious as he remembered. It was so delicious that after he finished eating it, he immersed himself in the aftertaste for a long time.When he regained his wits, he saw his two grandsons staring at him. Father Zhou was a little embarrassed. Such a big bun, he didn't leave any leftover.\"Grandpa, is it yummy?\" Zhou Da Wa asked.\"It must be very yummy,\" Er Wa said.\"It is.\" Father Zhou nodded. \"Thank you Da Wa and Er Wa for letting Grandpa eat such yummy white bun.\"Da Wa and Er Wa beamed, and the brothers went back in a very good mood.Father Zhou continued to reminisce about the taste. This white bun was more delicious than what he remembered. It was really flavourful.When Mother Zhou came in, she said, \"Eldest's wife said Da Wa and Er Wa came over.\"\"En, they sent me a white bun.\" Father Zhou replied.Mother Zhou froze for a moment: \"They really delivered it over?\"\"They said I didn't have one yesterday, so today their mother bought it to make it up.\" Father Zhou said.Hearing this, Mother Zhou was in a much better mood and said, \"Fourth's wife isn't so unreasonable.\"\"The white bun is really fragrant.\" Father Zhou felt a little sleepy, smacked his lips, and expressed.Mother Zhou had no comment because she had eaten one. It was so delicious that one swallowed their tongue.On this side, Lin Qing He started to cook pig fat.She took five pounds of pig fat out of the space, and with the ones brought back from Mei Jie, it was enough to extract a pot full of lard.In the current weather, it will solidify on its own and not go bad. Estimating the time, it shouldn't be long before Zhou Qing Bai comes back. He will come back at the end of the month. She naturally had to stock up more things at home.As soon as he comes back, she had to be cautious, otherwise, with his sensitivity, 8 or 9 out 10 times she would be caught. Once he comes back, she did not plan to take things out of the space.So extracting more oil was a must.Of course, the peanut oil jar at home was full, too. There was still a lot left in her space.Cooking pig fat had a strong fragrant odor. But it won't be conspicuous now, because meat distribution was not long ago and many people were cooking pig fat. So far, many people haven't finished their meat yet. They will consume it slowly. So it was normal to have a meaty smell.A full jar of lard was extracted from five jins of pig fat. And for the rest, Lin Qing He used another jar. It filled a small half of the jar.As for the fat residue, she put it away on a plate.When frying, she can add a little bit in. She can fry something fragrant, even without oil.The three kids also like to eat fat residues. Lin Qing He didn't stop them, but she also didn't let them eat too much. Each got three pieces. Even then, it was satisfying.They had millet porridge for noon. It was served with soy sauce ribs stewed by Lin Qing He, as well as fried vegetables mixed with fat residues. All three brothers were content. Lin Qing He was the same. She felt life was pretty good.Now the mother and sons only knew to eat all day, every day. What will they eat today? What will they eat tomorrow? The mother and sons were all foodies.The cheerful days didn't last a few days. After the last autumn rain, there was another autumn rain. This autumn rain also fell for a few days. This was really cold then. The temperature was probably around 4 or 5 degrees. Cold and icy.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32. Villains' father had returnedBecause it was too cold, Lin Qing He was too lazy to cook. She usually made congee- shrimp skin congee, pork rib congee, sesame congee. Or folded up some dumplings to eat. In one go, she made a lot and cook many times.Lin Qing He intended to make meat buns. The fat residue was a good filling ingredient, and there was cabbage in the backyard.She planned to make more in one go. Whenever she wants to eat it, then steam some. It won't go off at this kind of day.But she didn't make the buns immediately. She got to knit San Wa's sweater first. Only then she got the free time.And on this night, the snow began to fall. It was only October 18th. This snow was half a month earlier than the ones in her memory.But then again. It seems to be one night at the end of this month when Zhou Qing Bai returns home during heavy snow.Now only Zhou Qing Bai's sweater was left to knit. He wasn't back yet, so no rush. Lin Qing He was indeed a woman of action, said she'll make and did make.On October 19th, she started to make big buns stuffed with cabbage, egg, and fat residue with Da Wa Er Wa and also San Wa.The mother and son busied for the whole day and made more than thirty white buns.Because a lot of dough was made, there were still some left after thirty plus buns. So Lin Qing He made some fillings again. She grabbed some pork belly out of the space, then chopped it, and wrapped it with cabbage to make cabbage and pork belly stuffed dumplings.Since she was making it, she might as well make more. This weather was really cold. She didn\u2019t want to go anywhere except Kang. Cooking was also troublesome.So more than one hundred dumplings were made in one go.She felt it was too much.Her intake was average. She didn't have to go to the field to do farm work and the oil content was a lot, so there was no need to eat so much.As for Da Wa, he can consume eight dumplings in one meal. At most six for Er Wa. However, she didn't let them eat too full. So seven for Da Wa and five for Er Wa. As for San Wa, three was enough for him. For herself, an intake of seven or eight dumplings.With a bowl of shrimp skin soup made from cooking dumplings, then they'll be full. The children were still very young. She preferred to be a bit hungry rather than overstuffing them.A hundred dumplings can also be last for a day or two. After all, there were buns.It was all steamed, but still, needed to be taken out to let it cool. If she wants to eat it, she can just fry, steam or boil it.After making so much at one time, Lin Qing He became idle.Normally, it was some white porridge served with white buns or shrimp skin soup accompanied by dumplings.Lin Qing He started knitting a sweater for Zhou Qing Bai. This was who they depended on. She didn't plan to go to the field. It was definitely going to be Zhou Qing Bai who works in the field to earn work points.So she can treat anyone badly, but definitely not this person. Even if he didn't necessarily lack this sweater to keep warm, she must display her attitude (T/N: of gratitude? XD).She'll manage the inside, and let him handle the outside.She was the most afraid of farming. She was fine with managing the household. She wasn't going to work outside and don't even think about making her.This morning, the mother and sons were eating boiled sweet potatoes accompanied by salted pork and a plate of fried onion and fungus next to it on the Kang table. It was also delicious.\"Don't know when your father will be back.\" Lin Qing He commented.Counting the days, it was October 25th now. Zhou Qing Bai should be returning, which meant any day now. Somehow, she was still a little nervous.\"Is there no money more to spend?\" Da Wa asked.Lin Qing He: \"...\"\"Definitely no money left to spend. We have been eating good things for a while.\" Er Wa followed up.Lin Qing He: \"...\"When these two heard her mention their father, their first reaction was that she didn't have any money to spend. They were really ... clear-sighted. (T/N: These kids )The original owner was like this. Every time she missed their father, it was the day when the allowance was about to be sent back. She had not received the remittance form sent by post from that side in the middle of this month. This was within her expectation.\"Don't talk nonsense. Your father hasn't come back for a long time. I was thinking, will he come back this year for the New Year. When he's back, don't know if he can recognize you three brothers.\" Lin Qing He said.Da Wa was a lot sturdier. Er Wa's little face was rounder. As for San Wa, he was now completely fed by her into a little chubby.He became rounder. And because he was good looking, he looked so robust and adorable. No need to say how cute he was.Of course, Er Wa was also the same. It was only Da Wa, who looked sturdy. He didn't get fat at all, only his height increased a bit.Because all the three boys were treated well, even if she knew that she was a waster, Mother Zhou did not say anything.\"We are Father's son. How can Father not recognize us.\" Da Wa uttered without care.\"That's right.\" Er Wa also affirmed, but still continued: \"Will Father come back this year?\"\"I don't know. Mother also hopes your father will come back.\" Lin Qing He said it like this.\"I know. Mother must have missed Father, right?\" Zhou Da Wa grinned.\"She definitely misses him. I have forgotten what Father looked like,\" Er Wa nodded.Human ah, to discuss like this nonstop. During the day, the mother and sons were talking about the head of their family.Around ten o'clock in the evening, someone knocked on the door.Lin Qing He slept relatively lightly these past few days. There was no way. She knew the plot ah. She knew that Zhou Qing Bai\u2019s return was any day now, so she didn\u2019t dare to sleep too deep.As soon as the door sounded a bang, she almost instantly woke up.The three children were still asleep. Lin Qing He put on a cotton coat and came out. It was really cold these days, especially tonight. It was really freezing.\"Who's there? Is it a petty thief from somewhere? If you dare to come to my old Zhou's place to run wild, then you have to inquire about who my man is!\"Zhou Qing Bai, who was outside the door, estimated that the mother and sons had fallen asleep, so he planned to go over the wall to enter. At this time, these words came from inside.Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\"These words made him, who walked all the way and got stiff feet due to the cold, raised the corners of his mouth. Then he was a little gloomy. Had anyone ever harassed the mother and sons?\"I'm warning you thieves, my man is Zhou Qing Bai. He's outside keeping our country safe. If you dare to target his home, it wouldn't be a problem to be caught and receive a gun execution!\" The woman inside fiercely declared.\"It's me.\" Zhou Qing Bai said. Thinking that she might have forgotten his voice, he uttered: \"Zhou Qing Bai.\"\"Zhou Qing Bai?\" The woman inside was relieved as soon as she heard it was him.Lin Qing He wasn't pretending. She was the only one at home, and her three sons were still young. If she was not sure that it was Zhou Qing Bai outside the door, then she would never open the door.But when she heard his unique deep voice, which was registered in the original owner's memory, and he revealed his identity, it was clear that the villains' father had returned.Lin Qing He knew he had walked all the way. And the snow was so heavy tonight, it must have been particularly freezing.So she hurried over to open the door.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33. Let villains' father be well fed.She was ready. When she saw Zhou Qing Bai standing at the door, she can keep up her stance.Even if this one-meter-eight-five-year-old man's aura couldn't be underestimated.She voiced out: \"How come you come back at this time. Quickly come in, this weather is freezing to death. Go into my room and stay there. Kang at this side hasn't been heated.\"Zhou Qing Bai just darted a glance at her, and then came in. There was a big bag behind him.Lin Qing He got him to stay in her room and went to the kitchen to smash ginger. When the fire started in the stove, she boiled him a bowl of intense ginger soup.Inside the room, Zhou Qing Bai watched his three sons who were sleeping soundly. His three sons were obviously taken care of very well, especially San Wa. So round and chubby. Clean Too. Da Wa and Er Wa was the same.Completely different to what he saw when he came back last year.If he met them on the road outside, he may not be able to recognize them, even if Da Wa looked like him.What was more unexpected, was that she could cook ginger soup for him.Seeing the three sons who were taken care of very well, and listening to the sound from the kitchen, Zhou Qing Bai's cold brows finally softened thirty percent.Soon Lin Qing He finished cooking the ginger soup and brought it in. She urged, \"Quickly drink it while it's hot.\"After saying this, she went out again. When she re-entered, the ginger soup had been drunk by Zhou Qing Bai.Lin Qing He came in with a foot basin. Looking at Zhou Qing Bai, who was sitting on the kang, she said: \"What are you sitting there for? Quickly take off your shoes and soak your feet to fight the chill? Don't think because you are young and strong, you can be headstrong. That's how the root cause of the illness is gained. In such heavy snow, you can actually come back carrying the snow. \"Although she was nagging, Zhou Qing Bai wasn't bothered at all. When she was nagging, she looked very pleasing.Zhou Qing Bai didn't act shy. He took off his shoes and socks and started to soak in his feet.After a large bowl of ginger soup, he was almost better and sweated a little. As this was her good intention, he wouldn't refuse it.Soaking his feet, Zhou Qing Bai, who became warm all over, dropped his gaze on Lin Qing He.Even though he didn't say anything, he still made Lin Qing He a little uncomfortable. Her brain lit up, and asked, \"Are you hungry? There are ready-made dumplings and buns at home. What do you want to eat?\"Honestly, Zhou Qing Bai was hungry after walking all this way. If she had to make it from scratch, then forget it. However, if there were ready-made ones at home, he would readily accept.\"Bring some of each over.\" Zhou Qing Bai answered.\"Then wait a bit,\" Lin Qing He stated and turned around.Watching her figure that busied away from the moment he came back, somehow, Zhou Qing Bai's initially uneasy heart calmed down.In fact, he was a little worried before coming back, because he knew very well what she had always wanted to be an official wife. Otherwise, she wouldn't have married him, who stay outside and could not take care of his family all year round.But now he can't complete her dreams, how could she agree? He reckoned that she would quarrel with him once she knew the truth.But now it seems that there may be a chance of not arguing.Lin Qing He estimated that his appetite should not be pretty big. After all, his size was so big, and he was trained all year-round. He will definitely eat a lot.So she steamed four white buns and boiled a large bowl of dumplings in shrimp soup.Then brought it in together. Zhou Qing Bai had wiped the plate. Judging by his expression, it seemed that he still wasn't full.Lin Qing He: \"...\"Such a big size made her a little flustered. Is the food at home enough for him to eat?\"It's pretty late. Go brush your teeth and sleep.\" Lin Qing He tidied up the bowl and chopsticks. She didn't plan to wash them. Leave it for tomorrow.\"Ok.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Lin Qinghe poured some hot water from the thermos for him. Mixed with the cold water, it was just right, and then she called him to brush his teeth.Zhou Qing Bai silently went to brush his teeth. He knew that she always loved being clean, but he never noticed that cleaning teeth were a must at night.Because Kang next door wasn't heated, Lin Qing He did not intend to abuse the patient. If she remembered correctly, he still had injuries. Although it wasn't life-endangering, it still needed to be nurtured for a while.So she let him sleep on the Kang at side tonight.The Kang was pretty big. The three children slept in the middle, while she slept on the inner side. He can sleep on the outer side. She'll be separated from him by the three children. Although she felt self-conscious, she was still his wife. But like this, it was fine.\"This quilt is good.\" Zhou Qing Bai commented when he saw the seven-jin quilt.\"That goes without saying! I wasted a lot of money to buy it back.\" Lin Qing He responded as she raised her eyebrows.But for this weather, this seven-jin quilt wasn't enough. There was a four-jin quilt covering on the top. It was a total of two, and a new mattress underneath, which was also very warm.It can be said that it was very warm. They don't need to be afraid of freezing at all.Zhou Qing Bai, who traveled for a day, was indeed tired. So he got on the Kang and with his wife and children, he fell asleep.He never expected to be so comfortable when he returned tonight.Welcomed with ginger soup, ginger foot bath, big white buns, and shrimp skin dumpling soup. His whole body warmed up.He thought about finding a time tomorrow to tell her about his retirement. What kind of scene it be tomorrow, can be left for tomorrow.He didn't want to ponder so much tonight.Shortly after Zhou Qing Bai laid down, he drifted to sleep. The bed was too warm and too comfortable, and his wife and children were there, so he slept more deeply.As was anticipated, Lin Qing He had insomnia.Although she told Zhou Qing Bai to sleep on the kang, as his wife and having three children in the middle, she still wasn't able to adapt in the end.Zhou Qing Bai was obviously tired. Not long after lying down, she could feel that he was asleep, and slept really deeply.Lin Qing He didn't know when she fell asleep. In short, she slept in the next day.It was almost eight o'clock when she woke up.As for the children, none were there. Lin Qing He panicked for a while, and then remembered that Zhou Qing Bai was back.What's more, Zhou Qing Bai, Mother Zhou, and Da Wa could be heard from the outside.Lin Qing He was at ease then. She tidied up, and then she got off the Kang. It was pretty late at this time.Even in the winter. She didn't know if the three children had eaten or not.She assumed that after sleeping so late and Mother Zhou was her, she would get despised. Unexpectedly, she received a gaze of approval from Mother Zhou.\"Last night was hard on Fourth's wife,\" commented Mother Zhou.With this, Lin Qing He understood. Zhou Qing Bai had told her about the things she got up to take care of last night. She responded, \"It wasn't much. Have you eaten yet, Mother?\"\"I had,\" Mother Zhou answered: \"You should quickly go eat.\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34. Villains' Father retirementMother Zhou's tone rarely sounded so nice.Indeed, it was because she heard her youngest son said about last night's return. Naturally, she was worried, because of the heavy snow last night.How freezing it must be walking all this way?Her youngest son said that his wife got up and cooked ginger soup for him, and heated ginger foot bath to soak his feet. And also fed him steamed buns and dumpling soup, before letting him sleep.After listening to this, Mother Zhou felt much more at ease. This big spending daughter-in-law, Lin Qing He, looked more appealing to her eyes.At least she can take good care of her youngest son. This alone was enough to make Mother Zhou treat her with civility and cheerfulness.Lin Qing He swept a glance at Zhou Qing Bai. Zhou Qingbai was also looking at her and they meet each other's gaze. She was still a little shy, so she switched her gaze to Da Wa and his brothers. \"Have you eaten?\"\"Yes.\" Da Wa and Er Wa answered.Then Lin Qing He left them alone and entered the kitchen by herself. The pan was still hot in the kitchen. The father and sons had steamed buns.The buns were made a few days ago, because it was frozen in the snow, it won't go bad. If they want to eat it, they just need to take a few and steam it. Since they didn't always munch on the buns, there was some left.Of course, this was the last few.Lin Qing He wasn't starving, so one was enough for her. The quantity she made was sufficient.At this time, San Wa came in.Lin Qing He picked him up: \"San Wa, have you eaten enough?\"\"No eat.\" San Wa shook his head.This meant he had eaten. If you haven\u2019t eaten, he'll want to eat.Lin Qing He carried him out. Mother Zhou was still there, mainly because she hadn't seen her youngest son for so long. She missed him dearly.Out of the four sons, she favored her youngest son the most. In her heart, the youngest son was number one. All other sons and daughters can sit on the side.Lin Qing He brought San Wa back into the room. Both Da Wa and Er Wa followed.Zhou Qing Bai watched her back.Mother Zhou whispered: \"Da Wa's mother cares about these brothers more these days. Their clothes and footwear were all personally managed by her. She's afraid of freezing their brothers. She also bought meat and buns over for me and your Father.\"Last time she made white bun, Lin Qing He also got Da Wa and Er Wa to bring two over. Just said it was for Father Zhou and Mother Zhou. Nothing for the others.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou didn't give away Fourth's wife's filial piety toward them. If they did, what would Fourth's wife think when she find out?What's more, there were so many grandchildren in the old Zhou's house. Either all get it or none at all.How were they supposed to divide the two buns? So the old couple simply ate it themselves. That way no one can say anything. If they do say something, then it was Fourth's wife was showing filial piety toward them old couple.Zhou Qing Bai nodded, indicating that he knew.\"Other things, Mother won't say much. But your wife's habit of spending money must change. Da Wa and his brothers are growing. When the time comes, they will need money for everything. With her spurlging, not a penny will be saved,\" proclaimed Mother Zhou.Zhou Qing Bai had noticed this matter.The house gained a coal stove, half a bag of coal, and an iron pan made of stainless steel. And the two large quilts were brand new. Also the children's clothes.As for others, there were a lot. The food in the room was full. The rice and flour were all excellent quality.It must have cost a lot of money.However, Zhou Qing Bai didn't think this was a bad habit, because she took good care of the household and the children were very well raised.As long as she takes care of the household, he will be the one managing outside.\"I know.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Mother Zhou watched him constantly gazing at the inner room and knew that the couple hadn't seen each other for a long time. Although she wanted to say a few words to her youngest son, she didn't stay around to be a bother. \"Then Mother will return first.\"\"Ok.\" Zhou Qing Bai sent her out.With Mother Zhou gone, Zhou Qing Bai entered the room. Lin Qing He was applying vanishing cream onto her three sons and remarked: \"Don't you know to call your father if you don't apply it yourself? If it gets damaged by the cold, it'll be ugly to look at then. \"\"Mother, Dad is back,\" Da Wa uttered.Er Wa's eyes also shone.Judging how they act, Lin Qing He knew they were very satisfied with their father. She grinned and said, \"This morning your father called you out?\"\"En. When we woke up, Father told us to go out first after getting dressed and not disturb Mother.\" Da Wa bobbed his head.\"Father steamed the buns for us, one each!\" Er Wa affirmed.Usually, their mother gave half each and then accompanied with porridge. Never a whole.Lin Qing He mentally pointed out that their father used her buns to win people's hearts. She hoped the father and sons have a good relationship and declared: \"He is your father, of course, he is good to you. I am a stepmother, so each gets half.\"\"Mother is stepmother, then I am stepson.\" Er Wa giggled.\"Have you no embarrassment. Father only has Mother as a wife!\" Da Wa uttered in disdain to him.\"Finished applying. You can go out.\" Lin Qing He shooed them away.After saying this, Zhou Qing Bai came in. Lin Qing He subconsciously looked over and met his gaze. Lin Qing He felt it was weird to say nothing, just blurted: \"Mother has returned home?\"\"En.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Short and concise, no extra word.Lin Qing He: No wonder the can't receive the original owner's favor. With this kind of mouth, he can't please a woman.\"You two go out to play.\" Zhou Qing Bai ordered Da Wa and Er Wa.Da Wa and Er Wa looked at their mother. Lin Qing He mentally wondered why they were looking at her. She certainly didn't want them to leave!But she also knew that he had something to tell her.Lin Qing He urged: \"Listen to your father. Go play.\"So Da Wa and Er Wa went out. The two of them were going to boast that their dad returned to their friends!With Da Wa and Er Wa gone, it was only San Wa playing on the kang. Lin Qing He knowingly asked as she played with her younger son: \"How long can you stay this time?\"Zhou Qing Bai slightly halted. Although Lin Qing He had her back to him, she could feel that the man was obviously a little nervous. She continued to play with San Wa while she acts clueless. San Wa giggled from her teasing.After seeing his third son laughed so happily, Zhou Qing Bai turned his eyes to her back and announced, \"This time, I don't plan to go back.\"As soon as these words came out, he saw her figure paused like he anticipated, and immediately turned to look at him with incredulous eyes: \"What do you mean by not to going back?\"\"I retire.\" Zhou Qing Bai exhaled as he watched at her.Lin Qing He stared at him, waiting for him to continue talking. Like explaining the injuries he got on his body. But he didn't ...No wonder the original owner simply flipped out on him. He really didn't know how to express himself.Don\u2019t he know that \u2018her\u2019 dream was to be an official wife?If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35. Villains' father feeling relievedLin Qing He observed this man. She saw a kind of uneasiness in his eyes, which made her slightly startled. It turned out that he was not as undaunted as he showed.He was actually worried on the inside. It was just that he didn't know how to express these emotions, so he appeared to not care at all.Zhou Qing Bai also examined her. He saw the confusion in her eyes, disbelief, and a hint of undisguised loss. Not a single disappointment or despair.This made him stunned.What made him even more shocked was what Lin Qing He said next.\"Retire then. The house needs a man, otherwise, I will not be able to sleep peacefully at night.\" As if admitting her fate, her shoulders collapsed and uttered.This sentence successfully drew Zhou Qing Bai's attention. He remembered when he knocked on the door on his return last night, she voiced out harsh words at the door.\"Someone dare come to disturb at night?\" Zhou Qing Bai enquired in a deep voice.Lin Qing He looked like she had no reason to live. She powerlessly responded: \"No. It\u2019s just that one time, I felt someone hopped over the wall outside. At that time I wasn't asleep, so immediately yelled. You know we have neighbors everywhere, so the thieves ran away. There were no real losses.\"Zhou Qing Bai's face was gloomy: \"It's my fault.\"If something really happened, he dare not imagine the consequences.Lin Qing He directed an expressionless face at him: \"From this evening on, you will sleep on the Kang next door.\"She admired her intellect. Unintentionally, she found such a wonderful excuse to sleep separately?Zhou Qing Bai gave an odd look. Such a big matter, she didn't say anything else? She didn't scold him, or make him go back?\"What are you looking at!\" Lin Qing He glared at him.Zhou Qing Bai mentally exclaimed, 'that's the right reaction!'\"I'm telling you now, even if you retire, I won't go out and work. After marrying you, I have no plans to work on the field!\" Lin Qing He stated.\"Just me working is enough.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded. He never planned to let her work in the field. That was too exhausting. Just him was enough.\"Also the house chores. You also have to do your share!\" Lin Qing He continued.\"Ok.\" Zhou Qing Bai also agreed.\"The retirement fund, how much is there? I'm managing that too!\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Qing Bai took out the package he brought back last night. Opening the package, two sets of clothes and a water heater were revealed.At the sight of the water heater, Lin Qing He's eyes lit up. There was only one at home. Not enough to use. Now with an additional one, it was sufficient.There was also a backpack, footwear, and the like.The backpack was bulging. Zhou Qing Bai handed it over directly: \"It's all here.\"Lin Qing He was actually a little embarrassed, but she still took it. Afterward, she was stunned: \"So much money? How much is there?\"\"Three thousand.\" Zhou Qing Bai darted a glance at her.\"Why is there so much?\" Lin Qing He shocked.There were almost two hundred yuans left in her pocket, and this was also a huge sum of money. She never expected Zhou Qing Bai to bring back three thousand yuans this time. What does this mean?\"I made a huge contribution. My superior applied it for me.\" Zhou Qing Bai clarified. It can be regarded as compensation and consolation for him.\"There are so many coupons!\" Lin Qing He exclaimed in surprise.Industrial coupons, food coupons, and cloth coupons were all there. And they were nationally accepted ones that will not expire!Zhou Qing Bai noticed that her attention was all on these things, he wondered if he passed this hurdle?\"The matter last time scared me a lot. It's good that you are at home. However, I must still explain it clearly to you first. I won\u2019t do the work outside work. Too exhausting and I hate farming the most. At home, I will take care of the meals and three kids for you, so you don't have to worry. But from now, you will sleep in the kids' room. There's sufficient firewood at home, so you don't need to save. There's a lot stocked up in the backyard. \"Lin Qing He steadily looked at him.Zhou Qing Bai knew there was enough firewood in the house, and a lot were piled up in the firewood shed and the corner of the courtyard. When he asked Da Wa, he found out she requested Zhou Dong to transport them over for winter usage.The matter that pressing against his mind like a heavy stone on his way home, disappeared like that?After listening to her intention, it meant it was over, right?Zhou Qing Bai couldn't help but stare at Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He was in a very good mood, no matter what he thought. She took the entire backpack for her to manage into her hands and then remarked, \"Did you tell your mother about this?\"\"Not yet.\" Zhou Qing Bai still watched her.\"Then you go, say it yourself. I will not say such a shameful thing anyway.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand and said.Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her and responded with an 'En'. Since she didn't explode, he was truly relieved.He didn't ponder anymore and simply attributed her changes to the fact that she was scared by the thief.As for asking him to go to sleep next door, it didn't think of anything, because every time he returned in the past, she couldn't wait for him to leave quickly.Now that he had retired, she definitely would not let him stay in this room.This wasn't a big deal. As long as she didn't cause a ruckus, it made Zhou Qing Bai relax. He told her, \"I'm going over to my father and mother.\"There was no burden in telling his father and mother because his wife was the bigger problem here. And now the biggest problem was solved.\"Go then.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Zhou Qing Bai came to the old Zhou's home.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou hadn't had time to be happy about their youngest son's return as they were shocked by the news directly announced by their youngest son.\"What? You retired? Won't go anymore?\" Father Zhou froze.\"What happened? Out of nowhere, why retire?\" Mother Zhou was even more anxious.\"I reached the age, so I retired.\" Zhou Qing Bai was still concise with his answer.Eldest Brother Zhou, Second Brother Zhou, and Third Brother Zhou were all confused.\"How can you reach the age? You are only twenty-seven! Your future is limitless!\" Third Brother Zhou was first to react.Eldest Brother Zhou and Second Brother Zhou also asked him the reason.But Zhou Qing Bai didn't say anything. Not an extra word of explanation.\"If you retire, then you retired.\" Father Zhou voiced out after a long silence. \"Such a big man, you just need works hard. Da Wa ad his brothers will soon grow up. They will be able to work when the time comes. There are no worries about eating and drinking. \"The three Zhou brothers looked at each other.\"Old Fourth, you come in with Mother.\" Mother Zhou ordered.Zhou Qing Bai did not say anything and followed the sad Mother Zhou into the room.\"Old Fourth, tell your mother, what exactly is going on? Mother doesn't believe you reached the age for retirement.\" Zhou mother stared at her youngest son.Zhou Qing Bai knew that the usual excuses could not fool her, so he showed her the wound on his chest. Although it had healed, there was still a big scar.It was almost close to the heart. Mother Zhou's heartbeat slowed by half a beat at the sight of it. She understood without her son saying anymore.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36. Definitely withhold the ultimate moveThe old lady's eyes reddened and she talked non-stop, \"It's good that you retire. Although home isn't as good as there, at least eating won't be a problem. Also, it's not so dangerous. Da Wa and his brothers are still too young.\"It was really god's blessings. If he met misfortune, it was really unimaginable.Fourth's wife was definitely unreliable. If her youngest son met with misfortune outside, then she will definitely pack up and remarried.What will happen to those three grandsons then?\"That's right! Does Da Wa's mother know? She always wanted to be an official wife. If you retire now, she wouldn't let it go?\" The old lady recalled and her face changed quickly as she rushed to ask.Mother Zhou was very clear about the original owner's ambition, so after being angst, she began to worry about her youngest son's other half at home.\"I told her. Although she was a little disappointed, she understood that there was no room for turning around and have no objection.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.\"No objection?\" Mother Zhou froze: \"How is this possible?\"Fourth's wife had her eyes set high. She always wanted to be an official wife and considered herself as an official wife. She looked down all the women in the village and for so long she never converse with any of them.Of course, she showed disdain and never group into with the rural women.If her dream of becoming an official wife shattered, how terrible it'll be? The sky will be punctured by her, right?\"Old Fourth, your wife must be holding back her ultimate move. You must her carefully. If she wants to divorce you, you must not divorce. You must stand firm or Da Wa and his brothers have no mother. At that time, you can't lift your head! \" Mother Zhou rambled on.Zhou Qing Bai displayed a helpless expression. He wanted to tell his mother that it wasn't that serious. His wife thought it through.However, Mother Zhu wouldn't believe that.Even if she behaved well after transmigrated, the impression left by the original owner was deeply ingrained- not someone who settle things peacefully.It was apparent from the moment she dared use her pregnancy to forcefully split away from the family shortly after marrying in.But Zhou Qing Bai really didn't think his wife would make trouble. He was really unsettled before returning. He was worried that she wouldn't let it drop and there would be no peace in the house then. But he watched her reaction after finding out, she was indeed clearly dejected, as if the spiritual pillar that had always supported her had collapsed.But this state only maintained until he took out three thousand yuans and the bundle of coupons. All her displeasure disappeared then.He can see this emotion.Therefore, there was no such thing as withholding an ultimate move.But to be so open-minded, this should be the change brought by the thief scare.Thinking of this, Zhou Qing Bai's eyebrows condensed.Seeing his expression, Mother Zhou thought he kept her words in mind. Fearing he would aggravate the family conflicts when he returns, she quickly interjected: \"Your wife's temper is like a firecracker. If you have something to talk about, tell her slowly. It's not a big deal. You have to comfort her, understand? Don\u2019t remain silent and let her guess. The time she spent with you is less than a month, and she can\u2019t guess it right. \u201dZhou Qing Bai got up and said: \"Don't worry, Mother. It's okay.\"There was one phrase his mother said right. They have been married for so many years and Da Wa was five years old, six after the new year. But truthfully, the time they interacted with each other didn't reach a month.So he still didn't know her. He can't look at her with past observation. For example, this time when he came back, didn't she take good care of all three sons?Zhou Qing Bai came out to say goodbye to his father and three older brothers and went back.When Eldest Brother returned to his room, he talked about it with Eldest Sister-in-law. Eldest Sister-in-law was stunned: \"Not going anymore? Stay in the village in the future?\"\"En, it counts as retiring.\" Brother Zhou nodded.\"Would Fourth's wife agree?\" Eldest Sister-in-law blurted.Brother Zhou said: \u201cThere's no problem with old Fourth staying. What is there to not agree? Also, it's dangerous to be outside in the wind and rain. There's no danger to stay in the village. No need to be afraid of starving too. What reason is there to disagree?\"\"You don't know what Fourth's wife thinking?\" Eldest Sister-in-law rebutted.\"What?\" Brother Zhou responded.\"Not saying. You won't understand even if I did.\" Eldest Sister-in-law waved her hand.It wasn't only Eldest Sister-in-law who understood Lin Qing He\u2019s thoughts. Both Second Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law also knew.After hearing their men mention this, they were shocked.Their first reaction was the same as Eldest Sister-in-law, ask whether Fourth's wife agree? Did she stir trouble like crazy?Second Brother and Third Brother had understood.They expressed they didn't know. He got called by Mother into the room to have a good talk. She might not cause a ruckus, maybe?Not cause a ruckus?Second Sister-in-law did not believe it.She simply gathered Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law over to knit sweaters and chat.As expected, they also bought woolen yarn back to knit sweaters and trousers. Otherwise, how could they bear this freezing to death weather?\"Eldest Sister-in-law, Third Sister-in-law, you know about Fourth Brother-in-law's retirement, right?\" Asked Second Sister-in-law as she knitted.\"Yes.\" Eldest Sister-in-law replied.\"How can this be hidden?\" Third Sister-in-law also said.After all, Fourth Brother-in-law will stay in the village in the future. It wasn't possible to conceal.\"Don't know how bad Fourth Sister-in-law is quarreling at home now. You know what kind of thoughts she has. Her eyes were like they grew on the top of her head. Always thinking about flying up the branch and turn into a phoenix one day. Now she fell and turned into a grass chicken.\" Second Sister-in-law chattered.Naturally, there was a little bit of gloating in her tone.Eldest Sister-in-law had just made a piece of close-fitting clothing for her son from the fabric the other had given her. She gently chided: \"Don't say it like that. We are all one family. We gain nothing from Fourth Brother-in-law's retirement. I was initially thinking, if Fourth Brother-in-law gets promoted again, he can take care of the nephews of the old Zhou family in the future.\"Second Sister-in-law heard these words and couldn't help but sigh: \"True.\"Of course, she had the same thought, even if her son was only three years old this year. If his fourth uncle was successful, her son would be cared for as his nephew, right?It was also for such reason, Second Sister-in-law, who used to love nit-picking in front of the original owner, toned it down a lot over the years.As for Third Sister-in-law, her mind was still wondering whether Lin Qing He can get some trotters for her post-natal confinement. And also the leftover fabric from making Da Wa brothers' clothes last time, which were used to make her daughter's coat. That was warm. Let's not forget the brown sugar left in the jar, it was also sent from there.So on this matter, Third Sister-in-law would only mull over it in her mind and never say it out.Only Second Sister-in-law was someone who couldn't hold herself back. After the chat broke off with the two sisters-in-law, she came out.Like this, the news of Zhou Qing Bai's retirement and starting to work in the field was spread in the village. The village was small, and soon the leader of the team directed his grandson to call Zhou Qing Bai over.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37. To not throw a fit, isn't possibleNot long after Zhou Qing Bai returned from the old Zhou's house and finished drinking the ginger soup cooked by his wife, he had to visit the team leader's house.Lin Qing He didn't mind. She collected the bowl and rinsed it.It goes without saying, she needed to made him drink the ginger soup again. Last night, the snow was that heavy, so how could drinking one bowl be enough.So while he was in the old Zhou's house, she cooked some more.This time it wasn't just Zhou Qing Bai. Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa have a share too, but she added a little brown sugar for them. Otherwise, the three kids wouldn't drink.Lin Qing He drank it too.In such cold weather, drinking some ginger soup warmed one's body.Now that the coal stove was burning, it was very convenient to cook anything. She passed babysitting San Wa to Da Wa and Er Wa. She took out the potatoes and cut them.For lunch, stewed potato and pork belly and a shrimp skin soup were enough.The pork belly were the ones she bought from Mei Jie yesterday. This time she 'bought' a lot.Three jins of pork belly and a few jins of pork ribs. If she uses it frugally, they can eat it for a while.For example, this time when she stewed potatoes and pork belly, the pork belly was thinly cut. Although it looked like a lot, it was only a few bits of meat at best, and no more.But if it is fried with lard, it will be delicious.Shrimp soup was much simpler.She had prepared all the ingredients. After checking the time, it was too early. There was a clock hanging at home for time checking. The original owner saved a lot of industrial coupons to buy it. It took three months' worth of Zhou Qing Bai's salary and allowance.Now she was enjoying the benefit. Of course, it was inevitable to take over the reputation of a spendthrift woman.Lin Qing He returned to the room to inspect her various materials. Fortunately, she had a hunch and knew that he would be back in these few days. The rice and flour in the house were full. The eggs jar too. It was enough for a while.What satisfied Lin Qing He the most was the 3,000 yuan with the bundle of ticket coupons that Zhou Qing Bai brought back this time.Next year, Zhou Qing Bai will be working. At that time, there will be food per headcount. A man as big as Zhou Qingbai will certainly be able to get ten work points. So she didn\u2019t have to worry about spending any money.She acquired enough household tools, so there was no need to go shopping in the county city.So now with her remaining 200 yuan, all her family had a total of 3,200 yuan. This money must be saved!Save it for when the restrictions are dropped, and see if she can do business.Otherwise, when gold sprout everywhere and she didn't have the capital to do anything at that time, she'll really cry.When Lin Qing He was making such plans, Mother Zhou came over.Seeing Mother Zhou, Lin Qing He subconsciously made her face serious at once!Tha's right, she can muddle it through with Zhou Qingbai. But not with Mother Zhou. There was only so much time the original owner spent with Zhou Qing Bai.However, she lived in the same village as Mother Zhou. She was very clear about the original owner's temper.\"Fourth's wife, do you know that old Fourth has retired?\" Mother Zhou cautiously approached the matter.She really spoiled her daughter-in-law. If Lin Qing He was a bystander, she couldn't endure and let take out her mother-in-law's dignity.But now she was the one with authority. and simply declared: \"What does old madam want to say? Did you come to ridicule me? Then ridicule! Anyway, I can't stand this life anymore. It's a good time to prepare to pack up and go home!\"She didn't even call her 'mother'! Mother Zhou knew the seriousness of the matter and quickly interjected: \"Fourth's wife, don\u2019t be impulsive. Da Wa and his brothers are already this big. Can you bear to leave them all behind? Fourth already retired. And such a big man, he can still support you and the kids, right? I already urged him to come back and have a good talk with you. How you live in the past, is how you will live in the future. You don\u2019t have to go to the field. Fourth alone is enough! \"This was the rough draft she made without giving Zhou Qing Bai a head up, before coming here.\"How I live in the past? Marrying him for so many years, I acted like a widow. Why I'm doing this? I believe you all know very well. But now he just came back empty-handed like this. How can I let this matter drop? No way! \"Lin Qing He acted out.Such an act of wickedness ah!. She really didn't want to throw a fit, but she must.If she didn\u2019t have a tantrum, she would have to go to the field. If she goes, it would be treated that it was a natural thing. It's what she supposed to do.People ah, sometimes they have to be like this. Lazy people be diligent sometimes, and everyone will praise her. While diligent people be lazy occasionally, and everyone shakes their heads and never expected her to be such a person.This is reality.She didn't want to become the second kind, and she can't act like the second kind.So she must take this opportunity now to let Father Zhou and Mother Zhou have the impression that they can celebrate if she didn't throw a fit and stay behind to take care of Zhou Qing Bai and her sons. Then they won't nag behind her back how she didn't go work in the field and dump it all on their son and feel it was fortunate that she was still willing to stay.Of course, the most important thing was that this was in line with her personality.Mother Zhou knew that she will definitely persist, and she repeatedly persuaded: \"All one family, what is there to drop or not. Fourth is a good man. You have no loss from marrying him...\"\"It's your old Zhou's family who have no loss. I, by myself, gave you, Zhou Family, three grandsons. Adding up the three can't even match one of me. I married over at a young age. He, Zhou Qing Bai come home for so many years doesn't even amount to a month. What is the difference between me and a widow? Who is on the losing end here! \"Lin Qing He interrupted her and refuted.Mother Zhou quickly responded: \"Mother doesn't mean that. Now Fourth has retired, he will never let you suffer. Da Wa's Mother, don't do impulsive things!\"\"Not let me suffer. I 'm nearly suffering to death. This isn't suffering? He stepped down now, how can I still have face in the village? The villagers must be secretly laughing at me. Not mentioning the villagers, just my Second Sister-in-law only. She must have gloated in delight a lot. Who knows, how she'll pay attention to me behind my back! \"Lin Qing He's face flushed with embarrassment and uttered.\"No, she won't. Although your Second Sister-in-law has a nit-picking personality, she doesn't dare to do it to you,\" Mother Zhou denied quickly.After all, this fourth daughter-in-law was also a strong character. She never let Second's wife profit.\"What doesn\u2019t dare? She doesn't dare only because of looking at Da Wa's Father's face. She's thinking about whether her son will be able to get some benefits in the future, so she doesn't dare. Now he has retired, she won't be polite \"Lin Qing He said, and then turned the topic back:\" Old madam, you don't need to persuade me. I will not easily settle this matter with Zhou Qing Bai! \"\"Fourth got a wound. Please let him nurse it well sick and leave any illness root.\" Mother Zhou hurried coaxed.Lin Qing He heard these words and immediately spat out a vicious sentence: \"None of my damn business!\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38. Freaking outZhou Qing Bai, who returned at an unknown time, had clearly heard an earful from the door: \"...\"He didn't even know that his wife had this ability to say one thing and mean another.It was obvious that she was afraid he would get cold and be hungry. Forget last night, as she didn\u2019t know what happened and looked after him. But this morning, he showed his card and she still gave him a bowl after he got back from old Zhou \u2019s house. His three sons also received a share.But toward his mother, it was this ruthless appearance.She got two faces?He really didn't understand his wife.Inside, Mother Zhou choked. Her mind said, 'this is your man, how is it not your business?'. But she knew she was angry now and no words can reach her. What's more, she can only accede instead of going against her. Otherwise, once old Fourth return, life would be up-ended.\"Father, hold me!\" At this time, San Wa's voice sounded outside the door.The little guy wandered out to see his father, and directly headed over to hug his leg as he asked.Zhou Qing Bai picked up San Wa. At this time, Mother Zhou came out of the room.\"Mother, go back. There's no problem here.\" Holding San Wa, Zhou Qing Bai conveyed.Mother Zhou was filled with worry. Looking at her youngest son, whose wife was about to run, she urged, \"Old Fourth, come home with mum for a bit.\"Zhou Qing Bai followed her the door, carrying San Wa. Mother Zhou whispered: \"Old Fourth, you heard it just outside the door, right? You need to have a good talk your wife, understood? If you can't convince her to stay, then you really need to take care of Da Wa and his brothers by yourself.\"Even if her son divorced like this, it would never be a problem to find another. But the main point was that it wasn't possible now. With three sons, how can he get married again? Marry one back to abuse her three grandsons?Although Fourth's wife was like that, it was better than a stepmother, no matter how unreasonable the biological mother was.Without waiting for her son to speak, Mother Zhou continued: \"Go back and talk with your wife. Just promise her that she didn't have to work in the field. How she lived before is how it'll be in the future. It's enough that she can take care of your family. Next year, Da Wa will be able to gather pigweed to earn work points. The household putting in the effort can get headcount share, so even without her going to the field, you can still live well! \"Zhou Qing Bai nodded seriously: \"I'll listen to Mother. I will explain it clearly to her.\"He seemed to understand why his wife talked to his mother like that.Of course, he wouldn't be so stupid to say it. He knew everything about earning work points. He won't make the living conditions at home become bad.Only when she saw him agreed, did Mother Zhou go back. It just she was still worried.At home, Lin Qing He acted like nothing happened. Seeing that it wasn't ten o'clock yet, she directed at Zhou Qing Bai: \"I heard Mother said you have injuries. Come in and let me see.\"As she said this, she took San Wa into her embrace.Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her and said, \"It's no big deal.\"Lin Qing He just stared at him. Last night she was too shy. Now she can almost calmly face him. Her adaptability was very strong, especially when her commotion with Mother Zhou was witnessed by him. She felt that she could take the plungeHuman ah, as long as they were willing to take the plunge, anything was possible.Zhou Qing Bai saw that she won't accept any objection, he had no choice but to enter and take off his clothes to show her. Lin Qing He was a little embarrassed, but when she saw the scar on his wound, she couldn't help but feel heartache.\"Quickly put on your clothes, lie down on the Kang at once.\" Lin Qing He ordered.Zhou Qing Bai obediently put on his clothes. The weather was still quite cold. He uttered: \"Are there house chores left to do?\"\"Yes.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Zhou Qing Bai watched at her, obviously waiting for her instructions.\"Obediently, lie on the Kang for me, and completely nurse your wounds. We'll talk after that \" Said Lin Qing He.Zhou Qing Bai looked at her and persisted, \"The injuries on my body are fine.\"\"It's just fine. It doesn't mean it's completely healed. If you want to work, there's enough for you next year. And it'll be all done by you. Now quickly lie down. My temper isn't good, so don't add fire to it.\" Lin Qing He frowned.What fine? She can feel the ache just by looking at it!Zhou Qing Bai saw that she was really angry, he felt quite helpless. That easy to get angry. Resigned, he turned around to return to the kids' kang.Lin Qing He placed San Wa with him and let him watch over him. Then she went to heat up the Kang.At this moment, Da Wa and Er Wa returned from the outside. These two brothers had gone out and flaunted the fact that their father came back. It made them more euphoric than getting new clothes to wear.\"Your father risked coming back through the snowstorm last night. He's not feeling too well, you guys go to the Kang and talk with him.\" Lin Qing He suggested.Da Wa and Er Wa held high expectation and awe toward their father, Zhou Qing Bai. So hearing their mother say so, they all went.Zhou Qing Bai saw his two elder sons coming in, he gestured for them to come over with his eyes.Da Wa and Er Wa scrambled over and watched at him.Da Wa revealed: \"Mother said Father is sick. Then, Father, you need to rest more.\"\"En. Last time San Wa was sick, Mother had to take care of him for the whole night without sleeping,\" Er Wa nodded.San Wa had a cold just a few days ago. Lin Qing He had taken a lot of caution since she came, but he still caught a cold. That night she really didn\u2019t sleep for the whole night and took care of him. Da Wa and Er Wa only knew about it the next day.Zhou Qing Bai knew that it was not easy for his wife to take care of their three sons, but he thought when the kids get sick, she'll keep watch for one night.\"Father not leaving?\" Da Wa's eyes shone.Er Wa couldn't help looking expectantly at him.Just not their little friends mentioned it. They heard the adults say their father won't leave anymore and will stay in the village.\"Not leaving.\" Zhou Qing Bai affirmed.\"That's great!\" Da Wa and Er Wa were excited.Naturally, children won't think too much. Their minds were very simple. They want their father to stay at home. But they don't know that if their father stays at home, there will be no source of income for the family.Outside, Lin Qing He was thinking of making soup to nourish Zhou Qing Bai when she heard laughter from the room.Although the relationship between father and son will worsen in the future, the three little men in the family have natural worship for their father so far.After all, he was so tall and so big. He looked very strong and better than the fathers of other children in the village. So they were happy to recognize him.Lin Qing He cooked stewed seaweed ribs soup in the casserole pot. After all, she \u2018knew\u2019 he still had injuries on his body. She must express that.Then, she made stewed pork belly with potatoes and shrimp skin soup. The pork rib soup was specially made for villains' father. She and the children can have shrimp skin soup.At 11 o'clock around noon, her family can eat.The patient's soup was for Zhou Qing Bai to drink alone. Neither Da Wa nor Er Wa had the intention of wanting it. They expressed that they were fine with drinking shrimp soup.Zhou Qing Bai darted a glance at Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He explained: \"Their father is unwell, so needs nourishment. Both of our boys are filial and will not fight with their father.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39. You're in charge of the householdThese words made Da Wa puff out his little chest and got Er Wa to stop drooling and his eyes shone instead.But Zhou Qing Bai persisted on dividing the ribs between the mother and sons, and he drank the soup.Da Wa and Er Wa's expression displayed how touched they were.Father was reluctant to eat it and gave it to them!Lin Qing He: ... you really know how to dote them.This soup's rib meat was simply heavenly!Still, she accepted his goodwill. She shot him a glance. Zhou Qing Bai was also watching her.\"Quickly eat it. Once you finish, go to rest on the kang. The weather is pretty cold.\" Lin Qing He pretended to not mind and look away.After the whole family ate, Zhou Qing Bai was about to clean up the tableware, but Lin Qing He passed San Wa to him. She cleaned it up herself.It was still that phrase. There were so many days to work in the future, no need to be anxious about this moment.However, it was obvious that Zhou Qing Bai was someone who couldn't sit still. He couldn't stand it if he were to rest all day. After taking a nap, he went to sort the backyard.Seeing that he really didn't want to lie down, Lin Qing He decided not to stop him.In the afternoon, Mother Zhou came again. Lin Qing He had already thrown a tantrum when required. So naturally, she couldn\u2019t stay being in the right and not forgive. She declared, \u201cI can stay. But if I hear you guys ever pick on me, then I will pack up and leave immediately! \"Mother Zhou was in a bad mood today. Father Zhou was also in a low mood at home. Of course, Father Zhou didn\u2019t think Lin Qing He would leave. He was down cause of his son's retirement. But after listening to his wife saying that his son was injured, he couldn't care about that anymore. He instantly asked Mother Zhou to bring some money over.Mother Zhou had yet to take out the money when she heard her talk. She quickly reacted: \"You can rest assured. You have separated off now, meaning were two families. How you live here, old Zhou Family won't intervene. No one will say you are in the wrong! \u201d\"Judging by the injury on Da Wa's Father, if it's not properly maintained, it will probably leave a root of a recurring illness. I don't want to be widowed while I'm still young. And in the future, I'll need to boil medicine and serve him. Can you look around and see if anyone wants to sell chickens? If there is, help me buy two.\u201d Lin Qing He said. And then with a resentful face: \u201cI don\u2019t know what sin I committed in my last life. This life, I have to follow this kind of man. First, serve his sons, now wait on him. I'm born with a hard life! \"Although she was listening to her complaints, the stone pressing in Mother Zhou's heart was put down.Let her complain if she complains. In the end, she was still willing to catch chickens to nourish her son. Wasn't this good?\"But I don't want old Zhou's family's. Now Third Sister-in-law is about to give birth. Don't say that she can't even eat chicken during her post-natal confinement as it will be eaten by my family.\" Lin Qing He pointed out.Mother Zhou initially wanted to catch two from her family. Old Zhou family had eight big egg-laying hens. At this time, the chickens were raised per headcount, and one chicken per two-person.Old Zhou family, including grandchildren, had a total of 17 people. So they can raise eight chickens.Eight chickens seem a lot, but in fact, they were not enough to eat. And the eggs should be kept for selling to buy salt and the like.Therefore, eggs were precious to the old Zhou family, who lived so prudently.Mother Zhou, who planned to harden her heart to catch two old hen at first, threw it out of her mind after hearing Lin Qing He said that.Thankfully, Mother Zhou was very popular in the village. It was not a big deal to buy two hens. She quickly returned with two tied-up old hens.In order to not cause her character to fall apart, Lin Qing He didn't give Mother Zhou a penny. Zhou Mu didn't even say a word.Because she knew that these two chickens were just used to nourish her youngest son's body. And her three grandsons could eat it too. As for Lin Qing He, she was only one person. How much can she eat if she did eat?She secretly took two hundred yuans out of her pocket again, which were all in a big bundle of ten yuans.\"What are you doing?\" Lin Qing He froze before uttering.\"We saved this from the time when Fourth sent it over. After building two rooms for Eldest and Second, only this much was left. Please keep it. Later, when Da Wa and his brothers grow up, they'll need to spend money everywhere.\u201d Although Mother Zhou was reluctant, she still took out this small fortune of two hundred yuan.During the time, when Fourth's wife was separating off, they decided use Zhou Qing Bai's remaining money to build single rooms for the other three, so she can block their mouths.At that time, the bricks and tiles were much cheaper than now. The starting price of one square meter was four or five yuan then. And it wasn't big. Lin Qing He\u2019s two single rooms and a hall was only 50 square meters. No labor cost was spent then. Father Zhou had called people including the Zhou brothers to help, so it didn't cost much.But now it was almost ten yuans per square meter, which was more than doubled. It wasn't possible to build a spacious brick house without one to two thousand.At that time, only after using Zhou Qing Bai's money and let the other three have their own single room, did they have no objection.This was what is left now.The two old couples still have their own retirement fund, which they won't touch no matter what.Other benefits have been claimed by Lin Qing He. So this two hundred yuan, Lin Qing He decided to leave it.\"If Da Wa's father knew I took both of you old people's money, he'll have a big argument with me.\" Lin Qing He came up with this.\"This was originally earned by old Fourth. I was keeping it for him back in those years. Now he's back, the money should naturally be returned to him. No one can say anything. These two chickens were also bought with this money.\" Mother Zhou pressed on.Lin Qing He have no intention of accepting it. But Mother Zhou insisted on giving it to her, so she hesitated a little and then received it. She promised, \"I won't take it back to my maternal family. I will keep it for our living expenses.\"Mother Zhou was satisfied with her statement. She wanted to advise a few other things like living more prudently and don't be act so extravagantly. She estimated that she wouldn't listen, so she made no comment.When Mother Zhou went back, she told her other daughters-in-law that Fourth's wife paid the chickens.She couldn't hide the fact that she helped catch the chickens. It would be better to say it openly.Eldest Sister Zhou and Third Sister-in-law said nothing. Actually, the two of them were a little relieved, especially Third Sister-in-law. She roughly calculated the baby was to be born next month. The family could only give one chicken for her to supplement her body. If it was gifted to Fourth Brother-in-law's house, she was most likely going to eat some eggs.Eldest Sister-in-law was the same. She was due to give birth in March next year. She also wanted to keep the chickens for nourishment.Second Sister-in-law pouted. Her mind wondered how much money the old madam shelled ut to Fourth's family!She kept it locked in her heart, not daring to say it out loud. The old madam can really tolerate Fourth's wife. As for them, the old madam was so strict.At Lin Qing He's side, she went to the backyard at once to confess to Zhou Qing Bai.\"I didn't want to accept old madam's money at the start but judging by her appearance if I didn't take it, who knows what she would think in her mind. I was thinking about how the future would be long, so I collected the money.\" Lin Qing He admitted.Zhou Qing Bai was setting up a chicken shed. Responding to her, he looked at her and said, \"You're in charge of the household.\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40. Sesame Stewed ChickenFrom his serious attitude, Lin Qing He saw he really had no objection.\"There's no rush in making the chicken shed. When you're ready, come over and kill the chicken. It's really delicious to stew chicken until the evening.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Qing Bai nodded: \"Leave it to me.\"After finishing the work in his hand, he came to the front yard to kill the chicken. It was perfect to pass this work to him.Lin Qing He boiled the water for him to remove the feathers. She lit the stove. A casserole pot was the best for stewing chicken. Starting now and stew until around 7pm in the evening, it'll be so soft and tender.There weren't any special ingredients for the stewed chicken, just a handful of sesame seeds. No red dates were thrown in.The sesame stewed chicken was very flavorful and nourishing. Perfect for Zhou Qing Bai's current state.\"Have some apple.\" Lin Qing He scooped hot water for him to wash his hands, and then grabbed an apple for him.Zhou Qing Bai stared at her.\"What are you looking at?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Nothing.\" Zhou Qing Bai took the apple and cut out half for her to eat.Although Lin Qing He gave him an eye-roll, she was satisfied in her heart. This man was selfless. She accepted it as she spoke, \"This is for you, the patient. I will only eat this time for you.\"\"No need to be like,\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Lin Qing He knew what he meant and was too lazy to bother with him. It was no wonder that this tough-acting man would be maltreated by the original owner into going to the woods during the cold weather and carry with firewood. He didn't know how to be lazy when he was injured.She turned around and returned to the room, so she didn't catch Zhou Qing Bai's soften gaze falling on her.Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa were all up in the room, but the brothers were lolling on the kang, unwilling to get down as it was very warm.\"Mother!\" Seeing Lin Qing He walked in munching on an apple, all three's eyes lit up.\"Once you get down and wears clothes, I'll give you each an apple.\" Lin Qing He declared.\"This apple isn't as big as before. Nor as sweet as before.\" Da Wa pointed out as he dressed.\"That's right.\" Er Wa bobbed his head.\"So what? The previous ones were bought in the county city, and these were bought from the community's supply and demand cooperative.\" Lin Qinghe bit into the apple and directed San Wa to dress by himself and replied.There were apples as big as her space's one sold in the county city, but the quantity was too small to buy. As long as there was a source and she had been to the city, she didn't have to worry.The apples at home were not big, as they were locally produced. The taste was also not as good as the ones she took out of her space.Da Wa and Er Wa finished dressing. Each went to get an apple to eat. San Wa imperfectly wore his clothes but still, Lin Qing He didn't fix it for him. After more practice, he'll be able to. It'll be fine as long as he was bundled up.San Wa's apple was turned into apple puree by Lin Qing He. The little guy had a great appetite and was able to eat it all.Probably because of eating solidly and being in good health, his fever quickly receded the other day.Da Wa and Er Wa knew that their father was in the backyard, and they all ran over there.They helped with fetching things. the brothers were happily busied away.Lin Qing He also passed San Wa to them. Seeing the time, she prepared for dinner.Because there was also chicken for tonight, Lin Qing He made it relatively simple. She made dumplings with half a jin of pork belly. Tonight, just dumplings were enough. Simple and delicious.After simmering on the coal stove for an hour, the aromatic smell of chicken broth came out.The three brothers smelled it and went to stand watch in front of the coal stove. Lin Qing He didn't pay any mind to them either.Got to say, she hadn't made any chicken dishes for them to eat ever since she arrived here. Only one yuan for a chicken. Any farmer family wasn't willing to sell it, because it was necessary to keep eggs, which was one of the few protein ingredients the farmer family had.Lin Qing He did not chance upon any when she went to the county city.So she hadn't stewed chicken them until now. It was normal to be greedy now.Zhou Qing Bai worked agilely. In a day, the chicken shed at home looked very proper. Their family can raise three chickens.It was also said that if there are no more than ten people in the family, such as nine people, then five chickens can be raised. But if it was eleven people, still only five chickens can be raised. (T/N: basically: Under ten p, evenly divide = amount of chicken e.g. 2p=1c, 4p=2c. non-even divide, half and round up remainder e.g. 3p=2c 5p=3c. Over ten, the non-even divide is reversed. 11p=5c 13p=6c)So ten was the dividing line for rounding down.\"Do you want to raise pigs at home?\" Lin Qing He looked at the still empty yard and asked.\"Can we?\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her with some surprise.He knew she loved the cleanliness and this was a virtue. He also liked that his home was clean. That's why she didn\u2019t even raise chickens before.This time she permitted him to build a chicken shed, had him shocked. He thought she was also willing to raise pigs.\"Yes. However, you are responsible for cleaning up.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Okay!\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Lin Qing He spoke no more.This year the pig raised wasn't owned by them. They had to apply with the team. Although it was raised at their home, it was owned by the team. So not private property. There will be work points though, especially for well-raised pigs. The work points can be worth half an adult.This was a good way of generating income.In particular, their feces. It can also be exchanged into work points. Of course, their vegetable garden in the backyard also needed it.Zhou Qing Bai also had plans of raising pigs. He knew she loved cleanliness and did not intend to raise it at home in the beginning. He was going to set up a pig shed over at the production team to keep pigs. He won't raise too much, just two.It was going to be inconvenient to take care of it. Now that she agreed to raise it at home, he was delighted.\"Now it can't be the same as before. Can't even eat well, so why care about the smell.\" Lin Qing He explained like this.If his wife had such feelings in the past, he wouldn't necessarily keep it at heart. But for some reason, now his wife said it like this, he felt bad.He felt that he did not let her live a good life.\"How about raising it the outside?\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Lin Qing He knew what he meant when she heard these words. With a 'are you a fool?' look, she stared at him: \"With such a large backyard, you raise it outside? And also, can you be at ease when raising it the outside? If someone with bad intention, spiked their food, a whole year's effort will be wasted.\"Then she continued: \"I'm just saying it. You don't have to take it seriously. However, I won't clean up the pig's nest for you. You have to keep this in mind.\"When she was a child, she did a lot of farm work with her grandma. Although she can do it, she was sick of it. It wasn't a matter of being dramatic. Whoever done it, knows.\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.They had dumplings soup for dinner. The whole family was content.After eating, Zhou Qing Bai went out. Lin Qing He knew that he going to discuss raising piglets. No need to govern him.They had dinner early, at four o'clock. So around six thirty, Lin Qing He brought out the chicken broth for the father and sons to drink.The chicken soup stewed with sesame seeds was very fragrant. Lin Qing He decided a bit of soup was enough for her. However, Zhou Qing Bai stuffed a chicken leg over. She changed it to two chicken wings. The chicken leg was divided between the three boys.As for the rest, it was Zhou Qingbai's responsibility to demolish it.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41. Brothers helping outThe whole family was content after the meal.Then they brushed my teeth, wash their face, hands, and feet before getting into the land to sleep.\"You sleep by yourself. I'll sleep with the three boys.\" Lin Qing He said and brought her sons back into the room.Zhou Qing Bai watched her slim back depart with a pursed lip. He hadn't care this morning, but only after a day of effort, he pondered if he agreed too early?Lying in the warm blanket, Zhou Qing Bai was a bit unable to sleep. This day was a bit different from what he expected before he returned.He thought she would make a lot of ruckuses, but she didn't.Not only did she not, but she had also taken care of the food aspect well. The food was particularly good.He never knew her culinary skills were so good. Although she would cook when he returned previously, she only gave him a bowl of noodles for the whole day. Nothing else.Don't know if he was overthinking, but she seemed enthusiastic about him returning home.At this time, the sound of children's playing transmitted from the next room. And also her peals of laughter. Zhou Qing Bai's expression eased. He believed that even though she was a little angry, she probably wasn't repulsed by him.Cluelessly to the man's pondering in the next room, Lin Qing He played with her three sons for a while and then dozed off with them.Sleeping early at night, she would wake up early in the morning without anyone waking her. It's just that, the bed was too warm, she doesn't want to get out.But the thought of a wounded next door needed nutrition bugged her. Last night's chicken soup should have been long digested and such a big guy, his appetite was really large.So Lin Qing He got up. Now it was only about 6:30. When she got up, she found him just returning from the outside. It seems like he had gone out for a morning jog.\"Gone for a run?\" After a pause, Lin Qing He enquired.\"En.\" Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her: \"Go to sleep some more. I will make breakfast.\"\"No need. If you don't want to rest, go fix up a pig shed. The earlier its built, the earlier we can pick up piglets.\" Lin Qinghe said.Zhou Qing Bai nodded, then went to work in the backyard, Lin Qing He cooked millet porridge, and a plate of cold fungus as a side dish, which was soaked last night. Perfect to eat today.It was almost time, so she roused up the three boys. She poured hot water out for them to wash their faces and applied the vanishing cream on them before coming out.She fried five sunny sides up eggs, one per person. This one should be eaten while it is hot, otherwise, it won't be tasty.Zhou Qing Bai said nothing about her using oil to fried eggs. After eating a simple and nutritious breakfast, Zhou Qing Bai continued to work in the backyard. Today he can complete the pig shed.Lin Qing He said to Da Wa: \"Go call your Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle and Third Uncle to come and help your father.\"Zhou Qing Bai insisted there was no need. Lin Qing He brushed it off: \"You still have injuries. It's no deal to call them to help. In two days, I plan to make buns. I'll give them a few then.\"With this, Zhou Qing Bai had nothing to say.The three Zhou brothers came over. There was a lot of friction between the women, but there was not so much between the brothers.Naturally, they would come over to give a hand especially now that Zhou Qing Bai, this younger brother who needs help.Moreover, the single room they live in now used the allowance that Zhou Qing Bai had previously sent home, otherwise everyone would have to squeeze together.Especially since a single room needed a lot of money now. It used to be cheaper when they hadn't had enough to eat, so they have benefited a lot.Many people in the village currently had their first branch, second branch, and third branch stuffed into one room. Normally, their days were lively and noisy, and a lot of siblings turned against each other.Because of the contrast, even Second Sister-in-law's mind felt comforted. At least it was one family in one room for them.The few brothers came to help, so Lin Qing He had them stay for lunch.Lunch was boiled sweet potatoes. Although the main dish was a little simpler, the side dishes were still okay. A bowl fried egg and shredded potatoes, a plate of stewed pork belly with starch noodles, stewed ribs and mushrooms, and a pot of seaweed rib soup.Even Second Brother and Third Brother were extremely satisfied with their food. They concluded that they haven't worked for nothing today.Eldest Brother was kind-hearted, said repeatedly: \"We're brothers. No need to treat us like this! It's only a small matter.\"\"It's okay. Eldest Brother, eat ba.\" Lin Qing He responded.Eldest Brother was a little worried about the Fourth's family's living condition. How much money was required to eat like this?While Zhou Qing Bai didn't say anything. The gaze toward his wife had a hint of appreciation. Lin Qing He secretly shot a glare at him- What are you looking at? Eat!They came to work, of course, she had to make some food. Do they think she was so petty?She ignored him and busied away feeding San Wa.This meal was contained some careful planning. Although every dish seems to have meat, the actual amount put in wasn't much. She only put four eggs in the pot of fried egg and potatoes. It was fried with lard, making it delicious. The plate of stewed pork belly with starch noodles had at most three jin. Stewed pork ribs and mushrooms, and seaweed ribs soup was made with one portion of pork ribs.With this, it looked like the oil content was sufficient.At least the three Zhou brothers were very satisfied. It was adequate for Zhou Qing Bai and the children.Because the three Zhou brothers came over to help, the pig shed was built in a day. In the evening, Lin Qing He did not keep the three for dinner. She settled it by giving three apples each to bring home.\"Sent you away with only three apples?\" Once Second Brother returned, Second Sister-in-law's response was dissatisfaction.After a day of work, there wasn't any brown sugar. Just apples? Was this how you send someone away?\"Noon meal was pretty good.\" Second Brother didn't say anything. After all, the meal at noon was enough compensation.And because the three brothers went over, how much work can each one do? With Fourth's wife's temperament, to not create trouble this time and still cook these dishes, Second Brother felt it was worth it.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law had no comment after learning about the lunch. They were delighted about the apples as both of them were pregnant with their children.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou were relieved. From the look of it, the youngest son's wife can be considered to be settling down and will no longer act up.\"Fortunately, we gave her two hundred yuans, otherwise she wouldn't calm down so quickly,\" Mother Zhou remarked.\"Don't talk about this. As long as they can live well, it's enough. Since Fourth's family will raise pigs, their future won't be bad.\" Father Zhou said.Mother Zhou sighed, but said nothing.She just hoped that Fourth's wife can be more prudent with their living style.Not even two days, Fourth's family got Da Wa and Er Wa to deliver eight buns.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou each got one. While the other three families had two. It was filled with pork, fungus, and mushrooms. So tasty that one can nearly swallow their tongue.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42. Got misledEldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law remarked that Fourth Sister-in-law was too polite. Between brothers, there was no need for so many gifts.This move of Lin Qing He had shut Second Sister-in-law up as she had murmured the other day about her dissatisfaction with the three apples.Now she got face slapped. Lin Qing He sent two buns, which wasn't a light gift.\"Once Fourth Brother-in-law retired, she knows how to behave. However, her life is soon going to go bad, why pretend to be a big bad wolf (like from red riding hood?)! Using buns for human relations!\" At night, Second Sister-in-law grumbled to her Second Brother.\"If there is anything they need help with in the future, I'll still go.\" Second Brother couldn't care less about the women's thoughts as he indulged in the aftertaste.This bun was so delicious that he can have a good dream at night.\"I had thought when Fourth Brother-in-law retired, she will cause a lot of trouble. But there's nothing at all. Say, how much much money did Fourth Brother-in-law bring back?\" asked Second Sister-in-law.\"It doesn't matter how much money he brings back, it got nothing to do with us,\" Second Brother stated.Second Sister-in-law shoved him: \"I'm not eyeing it. I just want to ask. Wonder if there are five hundred?\"\"Five hundred? You think too much. The last guy in the outer village who retired only got three hundred.\" Second Brother pointed out.\"Doesn't Fourth Brother-in-law often gain merits? So they can give him more?\" Second Sister-in-law said.\"I say you shouldn't care about these things. I believe no amount of money is not enough for Fourth's wife to waste.\" Second Brother waved his hand.Even though he was satisfied with the lunch from two days back, he was even more satisfied with today's two big white buns. But still, no matter how you look at it, Fourth's wife doesn't know how to live.\"And no matter how much money old Fourth brings back, with a swoop of a shopping trip, there'll be no income in the future.\" Second Brother declared.Hearing this, Second Sister-in-law finally dropped it. This was indeed true. The old saying was right. A mountain of treasure at home can't beat daily entry of penny. With Lin Qing He's prodigal nature, how much was enough for her?Even if a lot of money was brought back this time, it certainly wasn't enough to use.\"She used to love cleanliness so much and disdain this and that. Now, isn't she raising pigs in the backyard?\" Second Sister gloated in delight.It wasn't easy to tidy up after two piglets. It was physically taxing. And also stunk like hell.In the future, arrogant Lin Qing He had to face the pressure of real life, which caused Second Sister-in-law to have a thrilling feeling of trampling down the phoenix.Third Sister-in-law was pretty far along with her pregnancy, so she didn't go out. Eldest Sister-in-law came over.Although their relationship wasn't great in the past, she was still her sister-in-law. So Eldest Sister-in-law came over to persuade her, telling her that with family, there's no need to be polite. If they need help with something, it was fine to just let them know in the future. She doesn't have to make these resource-consuming food.Lin Qing He's impression of Eldest Sister-in-law was still pretty good. As she was an understanding person, naturally Lin Qing He was willing to get closer to her.Third Sister-in-law was also the same. Among the sisters-in-law, it was only Second Sister-in-law she doesn't want to interact with.\"I promised Mother that I would get Third Sister-in-law two pig's trotters for breastfeeding during her post-natal confinement. When Eldest Sister-in-law gives birth, I will also grab two for you to stewed with peanuts.\" Staring at Eldest Sister-in-law's obvious baby bump, Lin Qing He said.\"Then I won't be shy with you.\" At these words, Eldest Sister-in-law's heart moved and felt Fourth's wife was very nice.\"During this stage, you should eat more apples, Eldest Sister-in-law. Don't be reluctant to. Wait for when the baby is born, then you'll be delighted.\" Lin Qing He advised.\"What do you say this?\" Eldest Sister-in-law paused.\"Look at my boys. How do they look like? Pretty, right?.\" Lin Qing He said while knitting the sweater.This sweater was for Zhou Qing Bai. He doesn't have a lot of clothes. She had to step up the pace for him. This weather was really chilling to the bones.Fortunately, she got Zhou Dong to bring so much firewood, otherwise, the Kang doesn't have enough to burn.\"Da Wa and his brothers are really pretty.\" Eldest Sister-in-law couldn't help but say. This was not flattery.Zhou Qing Bai grew up quite well. He was tall and handsome, let alone Lin Qing He. She was a flower within and outside the village when she was still at her maternal home. And it hadn\u2019t changed much since she was married. Going out now, and say she was unmarried, people would believe it.Don\u2019t know if she was seeing things, but Eldest Sister-in-law felt Fourth's wife had become more good-looking. Especially in recent days. She can\u2019t pinpoint which part looks good. It was just a feeling.Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa all picked up their parents' best features. It can be said that they couldn't find such good-looking brothers out of the whole village.And because of this, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou extremely doted on them.Especially now that Fourth's wife gave them special care. All of them look so handsome, her eyes could drool.\"Pretty is right. Then do you know what I ate when I was pregnant with them?\" Lin Qing He said.\"What did you eat?\" Eldest Sister reacted.\"The thing that I have eaten the most was this apple. One a day. Buy more after finishing it. That's why the brothers are born with very good skin. Immunity system. This immunity system is their physical fitness. It's also very good. The brothers rarely catch a cold or fever.\" Lin Qing He explained.\"This cost a lot.\" Eldest Sister-in-law heard the words, exclaimed.\"It does. But why do we work so diligently in our life? It's all for the sake of the children. Can we possibly let our children lose at the starting line? At this time, one person eats, two people get nourished. And you serve the whole family. Now, what's wrong with you eating some apples while pregnant?\" Lin Qing He continued.Now that she mentioned, the words spun around Eldest Sister-in-law's mind. How difficult pregnancy is? Even if the people in this era are strong, they basically do not take this matter seriously. But if they can, who wouldn\u2019t want to take advantage of this time to live a good life?But Sister Zhou didn't have the courage to spend her money. She felt pained for every penny she spent and couldn't spend so much money on food like she did without blinking.\"Apple doesn't cost much money. One coin can buy a lot back. You have worked hard for so long. It's no problem to give yourself a treat.\" Lin Qing He coaxed: \"You can go back and explain to Third Sister-in-law about eating more apples during pregnancy.\"She had said what needed to be said. As for whether she listened or not, it was up to them.After Eldest Sister-in-law went back, Mother Zhou came over and asked her: \"Did you tell the Fourth's wife?\"Elder Sister-in-law had been instructed by Mother Zhou to go over. Zhou Mu felt that if she went over, she would definitely annoy Fourth's wife. So she could only send Eldest Sister-in-law.\"Mother, don't worry. Fourth Sister-in-law knows.\" Eldest Sister-in-law said.\"If she had kept it in mind, would I have to worry about it? Now that old Fourth has retired, there's no income at home. If she keeps eating like this, how can it be possible?\" Mother Zhou lamented.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43. Stick to her when there's nothing to do\"I had told Fourth Sister-in-law. Fourth Sister-in-law said she understood and won't do it anymore.\" Eldest Sister-in-law said.Of course, Eldest Sister-in-law didn't say it she felt that Lin Qing He was giving her a perfunctory response. As a sister-in-law, she couldn't really teach her how to manage the family. She said what was need to be said and can't overstep with her persuasionAfter Mother Zhou departed, Eldest Sister-in-law went over to Third Sister-in-law and discuss the matter of buying apples to eat. Should they group together to buy it?Once Third Sister-in-law heard about Lin Qing He's personal experience and recalled how cute the brothers, she agreed without a second thought.So the two of them threw in five dimes each. When they gathered the fund, they asked Eldest Brother to buy a bag of apples. The two equally split it.Once Mother Zhou found out, she grumbled. Why did they buy this thing back? It's not like there's not enough to eat.Brother Zhou didn't think too much. He smiled and said, \"They heard from Fourth Sister-in-law that eating apples is good for the baby in her belly. She used to frequently eat it when had the boys. Now they grew up wonderfully right?\"As soon as she heard it, Mother Zhou almost missed and broke the eggs she had just took out to fry for tonight.She sent Eldest's wife over to dissuade Fourth's wife. But not only did she fail, she and Third's wife got misled by Fourth's wife!Does eating apples really let them become like Da Wa and his brothers? Don't think she doesn't know, when Fourth's wife was pregnant with Da Wa, she was gluttonous. She ate everything, so how can it just be apples?It just happened that Mother Zhou couldn't say that. What can she say? Her two daughters-in-law were pregnant, so they weren't allowed to eat some apples?They didn't come to her for money and used their own private fund.Since this year's harvest was good, she gave each family two yuans pocket money, so they did not come to ask her for money.The truth, Lin Qing He wasn't pulling their legs with the matter of eating apples during pregnancy. This was the best fruit during pregnancy, as it was nutritional for both the baby and mother.What's more, it wasn't expensive, why can't they eat it?A yuan can buy a bag-full back.When the original owner was pregnant with the boys, she really liked eating apples. Not just apples, but everything else she could buy.Because of the fear of giving birth would damage the mother's body, the original owner went all out.It was for this reason, that the boys' had more nourishment in the mother's body than their peers of the same age.They were indeed very white and tender when they were just born. Not wrinkled at all.According to memory, Da Wa was born at about seven jins. Both Er Wa and San Wa were approximately six jins. These were very proper weights.Many children in the village were born with around five jins. More than six jins were very few, so these quite adequate.Lin Qing He doesn't care what the old Zhou family thinks. She was busy knitting a sweater for Zhou Qing Bai.As for Zhou Qing Bai, he couldn't stay idle. Today he went out with the leader to bring back the piggies.Lin Qing He saw that he could not sit still and didn't bother with him. But she still stewed a rib soup for him to drink. As for the other things, she would not interfere too much.At noon, Zhou Qing Bai brought two little piglets back.The two little piglets were warmly welcomed by the three boys as soon as they got home. All three huddled over to touch and pet.Zhou Qing Bai was clearly in a good mood.After lunch, he scrubbed the pot to cook pig food. It was still small, so not much to cook. When it gets bigger later, the portion will increase a lot. It'll be really busy at that time.\"Next year plant some more in the backyards.\" Zhou Qing Bai just told her.\"Fine, you manage it accordingly.\" Lin Qing He responded, and then compared the sweater in her hand with his body. Although she used visual inspection, she felt that her craft was great after the comparison. After a look, there was basically no discrepancy. It'll definitely fit.Zhou Qing Bai's gaze toward her was soft. In the past few days, he really felt that his wife's impression was completely different from what she had given him in the past.Whether she was willing to live with him, he could still tell.These few days, she was meticulous about caring for him. She definitely held a spot for him in her heart.Unknown to Lin Qing He, knitting a sweater made him have such a beautiful misunderstanding. As soon as she finished comparing, she looked up and found him staring at her. His eyes were very focused. Instantly she coughed in embarrassment and shifted the topic. \"It's great that it's fit. You can busy away. \"\"Are there any more chores to do at home?\" Zhou Qing Bai didn't budge and remained looking at her.He didn't understand that his wife had become a bit shy at the sight of him, but that didn't prevent him from watching his wife more.He did think she was pretty before. But now, when he looked at her, he felt his wife was really attractive.She looked white and tender. When she spoke, it was gentle. Even the educated urban youths in the countryside weren't as pretty as his wife.Lin Qing He pondered, what's wrong with this man? When he first came back, it was neither cold or warm treatment. Starting from two days back, she kept feeling that once he was idle, he will come and stick to her?\"There's nothing to do. This winter is days of winter isolation.\" Lin Qing He rummaged through her mind. There was really nothing to do at home and answered.Zhou Qing Bai gave her a final glance, and could only withdraw.It seems that his wife still hadn't forgiven him. She did not plan on letting him go back to the room to sleep tonight.Lin Qing He continued to knit the sweater. Zhou Qing Bai headed next door to watch his three sons naping. Since there was nothing to do now, he decided to take an afternoon nap for a while as well.Two old hens bought by Mother Zhou a few days ago, one was stewed and the other was still kept in the chicken shed.She planned to stew it again after a while. For now, it can live.The two piglets in the pig shed settled down in their new home. Now they have nothing to do. Zhou Qing Bai took care of them carefully and the two piglets quickly adapted.In a blink of an eye, more than half a month passed.It was now mid-November.During this period of time, the villagers had different opinions about Zhou Qing Bai's permanent stay in the village.Of course, because of the presence of Father Zhou and Mother Zhou, there were very few gossips about Zhou Qing Bai in the village. Besides, Zhou Qing Bai wasn't freeloading from them when he returned, so it got nothing to with them.However, there were some sayings about Lin Qing He. Especially among young women in the village who were displeased with her young miss attitude. They made a lot of ridicule in private.In the future, won't she still head the field like them? See if she can still dress herself up as a voluptuous fox.Because Lin Qing He had no interaction with the people in the village, Lin Qing He doesn't even know these claims outside.Maybe it should be said she had some inkling in her mind. Due to the generation gap between them, she didn't care at all.Lin Qing He went out this morning. Yesterday she called Zhou Qing Bai to go over to pre-order stuff with Mei Jie. Today, she came here to get it.\"That was your man yesterday?\" Mei Jie asked with a grin.\"En.\" Although Lin Qing He verbally accepted Zhou Qing Bai as her 'husband', she was still a bit embarrassed saying that.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44. Barred from the roomSister Mei smiled: \"You are so lucky. You didn't see it. After he came yesterday, many people were enquiring about him.\"With that appearance as well as the upright temperament, not any average girl can match up to him. Must say, she saw Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai, and they were really compatible.A talented man and beautiful woman, no wonder they can come together.Lin Qing He didn't care about this stuff and changed the topic. She said, \"The sap I gave you last time, is it good?\"\"It's very efficient. My eldest Guzi asked me where I bought it. I said the county city. She also said that the county city did not sell such a good soap.\" Mei Jie whispered.Lin Qing He also lowered her voice: \"I bought it last time after circling around the black market in the city. That person said that it came from the city. I didn't believe it. Now I hear this, it might be true.\"\"That's no wonder.\" Mei Jie nodded.That piece of soap was really good to use. She didn't want to waste it, so now around half of it was left.Then she gave pork and ribs and so on to Lin Qing He. And also three jins of kerosene. Although it was spending money, it didn't cost much. Altogether cost three yuan or so.However, Lin Qing He bought two jins of apples with the subsidiary food coupon. As for the rest, she didn't buy anymore. There was still a lot left at home.Mei Jie asked: \"A few jars of honey arrived a few days ago. Now there is one jar left. Do you want it? No subsidiary coupons required.\"\"What does it look like?\" Lin Qing He's eyes lit up. She knew that the honey at this time was 100% pure honey. The benefits of honey were plentiful.Sister Mei took it out and showed it to her. The honey was naturally of good quality. A jar was about three jins, but the price was not cheap. Such a jar of honey cost five yuan.Lin Qing He bought it with no hesitation.She bid goodbye to Mei Jie and came to the small street again to buy a jin of eggs. They were all sold by a rural person. The eggs were not expensive. She bought a jin for three dimes.The rest was poured out of the space. Then she went home.After returning home, Lin Qing He passed the crystallized honey to Zhou Qing Bai: \"Put it in the room.\"\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai put the honey in the room, and then came out to wait for her arrangement.Lin Qing He had an urge to laugh a little. Did this man treat her as his boss? She took out the meat, bones, and ribs from the basket, and give him the basket: \"You put it with the rest.\"Zhou Qing Bai did as told.The reason why she got him to go to Mei Jie yesterday was to display a known source for the meat.This way he knows where the meat came from in the future.Lin Qing He chopped the big bone herself, and then put it in the casserole pot. The big bone was stewed with soybeans. This was also very nourishing.Da Wa and his brothers were over at the old Zhou's house. There were more siblings over there, so the three brothers usually go there to play. Or they would go to another villager's house in the village to play.Lin Qing He didn't stop them. It was all in her own village, and such a big child should not be kept in restraint. It was good for them to go out and play.\"What are you standing there for? Grab an apple to eat.\" Lin Qing He saw Zhou Qingbai as soon as she turned around and spoke.\"You, go eat. Whatever needs to be done, I will do it.\" Zhou Qing Bai came over and said.Male pheromones radiated from the man, making Lin Qing He's heart couldn't help but jumped fast.\"No need to treat me like a wounded person. It's completely recovered.\" Zhou Qing Bai stared at her as he spoke.This gaze was a bit dangerous. Although Lin Qing He doesn't have much experience, but in the modern social environment, even if she hadn't eaten big trotters before, how could she not watch the big trotters act on TV?Lin Qing He chose to ignore his fully suggestive words, turned to start chopping ribs, and said: \"Go grab some dry beans and soak them.\"\"You get it, I'll handle this.\" Zhou Qing Bai took the knife in her hand and insisted.Lin Qing He's hand was held by him. She was a little nervous and almost struggled, but she forcibly restrained herself.Putting her effort to fix a relaxed and calm expression, she said: \"OK. You do it.\"Zhou Qing Bai started chopping the pork ribs. Lin Qing He went into the room, and then patted her chest. What's happening ah? How can she act like she never saw a man before? Just getting her hand touched by him, made her heartbeat speed up so much!Maybe it was so long without a man, made her athirst!After reprimanding herself for a while, Lin Qing He took the dried beans out. These were left after sun-drying last time.She came over and saw that Zhou Qing Bai was chopping ribs. Must say this man was actually very attractive and manly.His appearance and figure are impeccable. He was also very attentive to the family. At least Da Wa and his brothers like him very much ...Wait, why was she thinking about this? She didn't plan for anything to happen with him.It was fine to be so peaceful with each other. There was a difference of many years between her and him. Don't know how many generation gaps there are!Lin Qing He walked over to soak the dried beans and saw Zhou Qing Bai wanted to chop the other two portions of ribs and fan bones. Lin Qing He blurted: \"Don't chop. Wait until we eat it, then chop it. Otherwise, it will not that fresh.\"\"Call me when you need it cut.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Lin Qing He saw that he didn't have any intention to go out. In her mind, she said, the kitchen was only so big, why are you, such a big fellow, blocking around for?Once her eyes clashed with his, she felt shy and said, \"Why are you looking at me like this?\"\"The injury is recovered.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated as he gazed at her.And?\"Da Wa and San Wa aren't small anymore. They can sleep on their own.\" Zhou Qing Bai continued.Lin Qing He knew what it meant, but it was impossible to return to her room to sleep. She was not the original owner. Nominally she was his wife, and it was only nominal.Turning around, she started to busy herself: \"What not small. Da Wa is only six years old now, and only seven years old after New Year. Now the weather is freezing. I won't feel reassured to let them sleep by themselves.\"Then she began to question herself. Did she overnourished him this recently and let him have sperm swimming to his brain?She had known him for only so long and he wanted to enter her kang. No door. Even the window was barred.Zhou Qing Bai knew that this meant he banned from the room and was a bit dejected. He thought she had completely let go of her intolerances, but now it seems that it was far from it.Lin Qing He doesn't care what he thinks. At noon, there were two dishes. The stewed big bone with soybeans and the stewed ribs and dried beans were very tasty.After eating, was an afternoon nap.Zhou Qing Bai went back to his own room for a nap. Next door, the mother and sons dozed off.In the next room, Zhou Qing Bai took off the newly-knitted sweater his wife had given him. He wanted to sigh.Eat, drink, and shelter. These were all managed perfectly by his wife for him.But the only thing was that his wife would not let him go back to the room, which made him a bit distressed. Although she was polite to him, he always had a feeling that she was taking care of a guest.Zhou Qing Bai was lying on the kang, and remained silent for a while before taking a nap.Guzi: in-law family's daughter a.k.a sister-in-law.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45. No patient's treatmentLin Qinghe wasn't as carefree as she appeared. She couldn't sleep at all. She was disturbed by the man next door. What was happening?Didn\u2019t they come into an agreement when he returned? Everyone sleeps in separate rooms. The three boys sleep with her and he can sleep next door by himself. Why was he acting like this? He obviously wanted to return to here to sleep.She must hold on. She cannot comply with everything according to his desire, otherwise, he would really think she was kind-hearted!After secretly deciding, Lin Qing He dozed off.The winter nap was also very comfortable. Lin Qing He slept until 2:30 in the afternoon. When she woke up, she saw Zhou Qing Bai sitting there on the edge of Kang. As for the sons, she didn\u2019t know where they ran off to.In this snowy weather, the three brothers can still mess about. Lin Qing He was prevailed by them. Their energy was like it was limitless.\"Where're the boys?\" Although she knew it in her heart, Lin Qing He couldn't find anything else to talk about on the surface, so she asked.Zhou Qing Bai sat next to her and at her words, he spoke: \"Grab an apple and went to their grandparent's side.\"Lin Qing He nodded and said, \"Is the injury on your body completely healed?\" If it's healed, then it's time to go to the mountain to see if there are rabbits or pheasants. Don't think about how to get back to my room at home all day.\"You check.\" Zhou Qing Bai said and started to undressed.Lin Qing He: \"...\" On such cold day, you undress out of nowhere. What kind of flirty process is this?Zhou Qing Bai only had three pieces on him. One was close-fitting top, one was the sweater knitted by Lin Qing He, and lastly was a military coat.He came over and sat on her kang. Without the military coat, he only had two pieces, and they soon came off.Lin Qing He saw that his injury was basically fine, and uttered: \"It looks fine, but I don't know about the inside. Let's nurture it so more.\"\"Wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai just stared at her without putting on his clothes.\"On this cold day, are you not cold? Hurry up and dress. Don't catch a cold and need me to wait on you.\" Lin Qing He didn't dare to meet his eyes and waved her hand.\"I'll go back to the room tonight.\" Zhou Qing Bai put on his clothes and announced lightly.This held no room for discussion with her. It felt like it was just letting her know.Lin Qing He was still muddled even after he left. Then she snorted and mentally voiced out, you can try returning the room tonight!After resting on the bed for a while, Lin Qing He took some grapes out of the space and secretly snacked on them.She occasionally fed San Wa the grapes. Only Sanwa. No one else gets it. There was no other choice. They were too big. Too expressive. They can accidentally expose this.Then she examined the supplies in the space again.Have to say, the materials in the space were consumed a good chunk during this time. There were half of the apples left. The pears was also half. This was consumed relatively less. The most she took out was the apples for the three children to snack on.More than half a box of grapes was left. She ate this by herself occasionally, and then fed San Wa once in a while. Not much got depleted.This was fruit. As for the supplies, four bags of rice was consumed. One bag equivalent to 20 jins.Flour was used more, almost ten bags.One large bag of pork had eaten and there were seven bags left. Over a dozen jin of eggs were consumed and there were still many left.The others were rock sugar, brown sugar and the like, most of them still remained.After inventorying these materials in her own space, Lin Qing He was in a good mood. She suddenly remembered that she had to collect some stamps and the likes and keep it for its value increase in the future. As for which specific set, she had forgotten. In short, just collect them.Wait until which day, when she go to the county city, she'll go to the post office to buy it.Lin Qing He got off the Kang, started dinner preparation. Pumpkin rice for tonight.Stir-fry the pumpkin with the meat, and then add the steamed rice to it. Stir it together to make the pumpkin rice. For soup, just stew seaweed soup.Simple and nutritious.Zhou Qing Bai was boxing in the yard. Lin Qing He saw it but act like she didn't. She directly headed over to the kitchen and busied around. After washing the rice, she soaked it. It was still too early, so there's time.Lin Qing He soaked the rice and went back to the room to continue knitting pants.Although their brothers have sweaters, but they still don't have woolen pants. The weather was too cold, that she can't stand it. Although the children are full of vitality, they still need to be kept warm.After Zhou Qing Bai practiced boxing, he sweated a lot. He planned to take a bath.Lin Qing He said to him when she knew it: \"During this weather, what bath? There's no bathroom. If you aren't afraid of freezing, you should go!\"Really thinking too much. Finding matters out of no matter.\"Wait for spring! At that time, we'll build a bathroom.\" Hearing this, Zhou Qing Bai decided.\"En, you'll figure it out at that time. As for how much money, talk then.\" Lin Qing He supported this.Without taking a bath, she can only wipe himself. Which was really unbearable for her. Fortunately, she doesn't sweat in the winter, otherwise, she can't live.\"Just heat some water and wipe yourself.\" Lin Qing He saw that he sweated and uttered.\"I have to change my clothes.\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her.Want to change, then change. Why tell me?\"After you changed out of your clothes, go heat some water. There's soap at home. Wash it yourself.\" Lin Qing He won't baby him. Simply said.Zhou Qing Bai looked at her helplessly. When he first came back, she took good care of everything. Saying everything won't be an overstatement. Now there was no such treatment.He had to wash his clothes by himself.Of course, he knew how to. He washed his own when he was alone. But bothered him a little was her uncaring attitude.Lin Qing He pretended to not notice. Men, these creatures can't be pampered. They can only be used, otherwise, they'll be worst the more you spoil.After standing for a while, Zhou Qing Bai witnessed that she had no other gesture and knew that his wife was a hard-hearted.Probably because his injuries were better, so there was no special treatment for the wounded?Zhou Qing Bai felt that he found the truth. He began to boil water.\"Wife, do you want to wipe yourself as well?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked when he finished heating the water.Lin Qing He, who was knitting, thought it was good to wipe herself, and responded: \"OK, you can use my washbasin and scoop some for me.\"Zhou Qing Bai was delighted to serve his wife. He scooped a pot of hot water in. The temperature was just right.After putting it down, he said: \"Wife, wipe yourself while it's hot. It'll be cold in a bit and become easier to catch the chill.\"\"En, you go out.\" Lin Qing He put down the one-third finished wool pants and nodded.Zhou Qing Bai came out and filled a washbasin. Then he went to the next door to wipe his body.Although it was just a body wipe, she must say that her whole person felt comfortable after the wipedown. Lin Qing He wiped herself every day, otherwise, she can\u2019t sleep.Lin Qing He also wanted to wash her hair. After counting, it seemed to half a month since she last washed her hair... This cold weather was such a pain.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46. Studying is uselessAfter an enjoyable wipedown, Lin Qing He felt comfier. As for her hair, she'll wash it after dinner. She had to cook dinner later.Zhou Qing Bai knocked on the door and came in to dump the water. He wiped himself and felt refreshed from top to toe.After pouring out the water, he came in. Lin Qing He looked at him: \"If it's okay, how about going to the county city tomorrow?\"\"What are you going to buy?\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded and asked.\"Nothing much. Just go and see if there any snacks like red dates. You can buy some cloth back. I will take it to Eldest Sister-in-law to make two more pieces for you.\" Lin Qing He responded.\"You make.\" Zhou Qing Bai stared at her.\"I don't know how to. All of the boys are made by Eldest Sister-in-law, Third Sister-in-law and Zhou Xi.\" Lin Qing He said.\"I'll teach you.\" Zhou Qing Bai persisted.\"You know how to make clothes?\" Lin Qing He uttered in shock.Zhou Qing Bai shook his head: \"No.\"Lin Qing He retorted in displeasure: \"How can you teach me if you don't know?\"\"I know my size, I can guide you. I will wear it whether it's good or bad.\" Zhou Qing Bai's eyes remained on her as he spoke.Why did Lin Qing He hear such flirty flavor from these normal words?But listening to him saying this, she won't be polite and said: \"If you won't disdain and not be afraid of me wasting cloth, then I can give it a go.\"The original owner can make clothes and she molded to his size, it should be possible to try.Last time with the boys', she was worried that it'll be ruined in her hand. Since there were no cloth coupons, it would have been ruined in vain.But now there were a lot of coupons at home, she naturally does not worry about it. And he said it himself, it was for her to practice.They had pumpkin rice in the evening.Da Wa and his brothers ware especially satisfied with the food at home. When their grandpa and grandma wanted to keep them for a meal at old Zhou's house, they ran faster than anyone else.After dinner, Zhou Qing Bai consciously collected the dishes and washed the dishes. Lin Qing He was quite satisfied with his performance, and instructed him: \"Boil another pot of water later and wipe the three boys.\"\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai agreed.Da Wa whispered to his mother, \"Mother, why is Father washing the dishes?\"\"Why can't your father wash the dishes?\" Lin Qing He directed an unsmiling smile at him.\"Because other people's fathers don't wash the dishes. My uncles never did it either.\" Da Wa responded.\"That's them. Your father is happy to do it. You are still young. Wait until next year, and dishwashing will be your job.\" Lin Qing He declared.\"Mother, you want me to wash the dishes?\" Da Wa's face was filled with shock.\"What's wrong with telling you to wash the dishes? A big man doesn't even know how to wash a bowl. Did you not see your father?\" Lin Qing He spoke with strong reason despite being lazy herself.\"No one else does it.\" Zhou Da Wa couldn't help utter.\"Other people don't have food like our family. If you want to be their son, then go. Our family has our own rules. Besides, your father knows how to. Of course, you also have to.\" Lin Qing He stood firm.\"It's the girls' work. If they knew it, they would laugh at elder brother.\" Er Wa interjected.Even he would be included.\"Your father help Mother to wash the dishes. That proves that he is a good man. Knowing that it's not easy for Mother to manage the whole family, he willingly helps Mother to do some household chores. You helping Mother wash dishes shows that are being filial to Mother. You know Mother only gave birth to you three boys and no girl. So you are willing to wash the dishes for the mother to make it easier Mother. Why should they laugh at you? \"Lin Qing He said.Zhou Da Wa was stunned by what she said, and could not refute back at all.\"If there is any opposition, you can refute. I'll accept the debate and argue back. But if you can't beat me, then you will take turns washing.\" Lin Qing He stated.\"Mother, I'm only four years old!\" Zhou Er Wa immediately responded.\"After the new year, you will be five years old. When you are six years old, you will wash with your elder brother. Mother knows that you are good filial children and will continue to give you yummy food in the future.\" Lin Qing He pronounced.Instantly, Er Wa looked bitter.\"It's still a long time before you're were six years old. What's the worry?\" Lin Qing He poked his little face.\"Mother, don't need me to wash the dishes.\" Er Wa leaned over and planned to act cute.\"Mother makes delicious stuff, and you aren't willing to wash a few dishes for Mother?\" Lin Qing He looked at him in surprise, as if she was a little disappointed.This frightened Er Wa to hurriedly said: \"Then I'll wash for Mother when I grow up.\"\"I knew my Er Wa is very obedient.\" Lin Qing He voiced in satisfaction.Da Wa sighed: \"Mother, no matter how you look, you're like a stepmother?\"\"Yeah. Stepmother would make new clothes and cotton coats for you brothers. Stepmother would buy new hats for you brothers. One per person. Stepmother would cook for you every day in different ways. I don\u2019t know who in the village who wants me to be their stepmother.\u201d Lin Qing He retorted.\"Hee hee, I'm kidding.\" Zhou Da Wa immediately said.San Wa dashed over. His mouth called for candy.This meant he wants to eat white rabbit candy.Lin Qing He pointed out: \"Can't eat candy just after eating. Wait until tomorrow.\"The three packs of white rabbit candy that she bought last time, only two packs were left at home. The three brothers have already gobbled up one pack.San Wa was still clamoring to eat, and Lin Qing He went to cut an apple for him to nibble. He settled down once something was stuffed in his mouth.Lin Qing He let the brothers play on the Kang, as she continued to knit.Zhou Qing Bai, who was doing the dishes, heard the laughter of the children in the room, as well as her occasional jokes. His heart couldn't be any warmer.After washing the dishes, he scooped up hot water and came in to wipe them. Each time he wiped down one, he sat them on a small chair to soak their feet.They were all tidied up by Zhou Qing Bai. Lin Qing He watched as she knitted woolen pants. She didn't intervene.But she did pay attention to them. Although Zhou Qing Bai didn't talk much, he still had the potential of a stay-at-home dad. He took meticulous care of kids.After washing their feet and drying them, he drove them all up the Kang.Then he brought in Lin Qing He's private footbath and let her soak her feet. Lin Qing He showed no hesitation. As she soaked, she mentioned: \"Tomorrow when you're at the county city, check if there are any pens and papers. Buy some for Da Wa. He's seven after the new year and can be sent to the team to study. \"\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai acceded.Da Wa yelled out from that side: \"Study? Why study? I plan to go to collect work points with my father next year!\"\"It's not a problem to earn work points while studying.\" Lin Qing He said.\"I'm not going!\" Da Wa immediately maintained.\"Why not?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Studying is useless!\" Da Wa groaned.\"Studying is useless? Where did you hear that from?\" Lin Qing He stared at him.\"My Second Aunt. She said that studying is useless. Didn't those urban educated youth also study? They still end up working in the countryside.\" Da Wa said.\"His father, go fetch the pen and paper.\" Lin Qing He ordered Zhou Qing Bai.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47. Let him taste honeyZhou Qing Bai heard the two words 'his father', and his face softened by two points. Although he didn't understand her intention, he still complied.He went to the cabinet and grabbed a pen and paper for her. Lin Qing He soaked her feet while writing what Zhou Qing Bai would buy tomorrow on it.In general, there were a good bit of things to buy.After completion, she showed it to Da Wa: \"Do you understand?\"Da Wa frowned. Without a doubt, he couldn't understand.\"This is what your father is going to buy in the county city tomorrow. If you don\u2019t study, you can\u2019t understand it. None of the decent jobs will be yours. Because if you don\u2019t study, it's like half opening eyes and be blind. Only with culture and knowledge, you won't be afraid of being overlooked wherever you go. Otherwise, you will only be able to work in this tiny village for your whole life. Look at the men in the village. They start a family at seventeen or eighteen and begin farming to raise the kids. Each and every one of them looked like 47/8 at the age of 27/8. Now, look at your father. If he had worked in the village in the past, he would have definitely been like the villagers. No escape.\" Lin Qing He spelled out.Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\" Suddenly have a sense of crisis. What should I do? Wife seems to judge by face?\"I'm not afraid!\" Zhou Da Wa declared in a daring spirit.\"Not bad. Have some manliness. It's okay if you don't study. Thinking how that you will carry a hoe like your friends' father in the future and feel that you can survive, then from tomorrow on, you get a separate meal. I should let you adapt in advance to what a life without studying is like. So that way you won't be used to a good life, and be unable to endure hardship at that time.\u201d Lin Qing He pronounced.\"Make me a separate meal tomorrow?\" Zhou Da Wa froze.\"What? Are you afraid?\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.\"Make it then! I'm not afraid of suffering!\" Zhou Da Wa maintained.\"Good spirit! I hope you can perserve. Oh right, let's eat lean pork congee tomorrow.\" Lin Qing He told Zhou Qing Bai.\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded seriously.He had no complaint with the way she educated their son. But his wife's word was written elegantly. So pretty to look at.It's been so many years, and she had never written a letter to him.Lin Qing He wasn't worried about being exposed because the original owner did not write any letters to Zhou Qing Bai. The original owner had been to primary school for three years, which the original owner finally won after much difficulty.Therefore, it was normal to be able to read and recognize words. At that time of the marriage proposal, the Zhou family said it was a plus to be able to read and write.That night Zhou Qing Bai didn't leave. No matter how much Lin Qing He glared at him, it was useless. So she arranged for him to sleep at the head of the Kang. Zhou Qing Bai wasn't dismayed about the Kang head.One step at a time.\"Father, are you sleeping with us tonight?\" Da Wa had forgotten the life of tomorrow. His eyes brightened.\"En, save some firewood. Don't need to heat the kang next door.\" Zhou Qing Bai's reason was so upright.Lin Qing He was too lazy to comment. As if she didn't know about his thoughts but she didn't care. She cuddled San Wa as the mother and sons dozed off.Seeing how far she was away from him, Zhou Qing Bai was very helpless. Fortunately, he was allowed to enter the room.The next morning, Zhou Qing Bai went out for a morning run like usual. Lin Qing He got up and cooked sesame lean pork congee. As for Da Wa, it was just a few pieces of cornmeal pancake and that was it.She won't be soft-hearted at all. Let him experience his future life and see if he'll study then.While Zhou Da Wa, he felt like he was picked on. He chewed on cornmeal pancake in the morning, which was accompanied by water as a drink. His father, mother, and younger brothers ate sesame lean pork congee with sunny-side-up!He had only a few cornmeal pancakes. The rest was a few pickles and nothing else!\"Don\u2019t be dissatisfied. Many people in the village eat sweet potato noodles. You need to be content with cornmeal pancakes. When you grow up and get married later, you won\u2019t be living with us. You'll live by yourself,\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Da Wa felt that his future days were dark without any daylight.Zhou Er Wa didn't dare to say anything. He certainly wouldn't want to live that kind of day. When he grows up later, he must listen to his mother and study hard!\"I'm heading to the leader's house to borrow a bicycle.\" Zhou Qing Bai told her.\"Shall we buy one too?\" Lin Qing He smoothly followed up.Zhou Qing Bai nodded solemnly: \"We must have one at home.\"\"Then wait a bit, I'll get you money and coupons!\" Lin Qing He quickly uttered.She doesn't feel it was a loss when it comes to buying a bicycle, even if a bicycle requires more than a hundred yuans and many industrial coupons. It wasn't like they can't afford now.The most important thing was that she can go to Mei Jie to get pork in the future. She was familiar with Mei Jie now and knew that Mei Jie's man killed the pigs in the pork farm.She can discuss with Mei Jie and Mei Jie will definitely be willing. The max price of a jin of meat was almost six dimes and let Mei Jie profit one dime. It wasn't a big problem to take three or four jins. When she goes to the county city and sell it, she will get about five yuan.Although it wasn't much money, it was just one day of work, which was almost equivalent to other's one month's salary.After buying the bike and use it for a few months, she'll get the money back. So there was no need to worry about losing money at all.Da Wa heard this and his eyes lit up: \"Our family is going to buy a bicycle?\"\"Yeah.\" Lin Qing He put the money and coupons in a parcel and handed it to Zhou Qing Bai.\"Can I ride it in the future?\" Da Wa asked.\"If you go to school in the county city in the future, I can buy one for yourself.\" Lin Qing He replied.Da Wa widened his eyes in surprise, but soon his face frowned in dilemma.Lin Qing He didn't mind it anymore. Toward the Zhou Qing Bai who halted there, waiting for her farewell, she said, \"Be careful on the road.\"Forget it, let him taste honey.Not only did she advised him to be careful on the way, but she also gave him a sweet smile.Satisfied, Zhou Qing Bai head out with a bag and a basket.Lin Qing He directed to Da Wa: \"You eat maize mash at noon.\"\"Then what are you eating?\" Da Wa couldn't resist saying.\"We will wait for your father to come back before eating dumplings at noon.\" Lin Qing He responded.Da Wa's small face collapsed. Recently, he became spoiled from Lin Qing He's care. When he was with his biological mother, he wasn't picky about maize mash. And sometimes he had to eat dried sweet potatoes. That was disgusting.If he doesn't want to study, Lin Qing He won't act considerately. She gave Er Wa and San Wa a white rabbit candy each. None for Da Wa.\"Why don't I get one!\" Da Wa angrily burst out.\"Why else? Do you recall your little friends ever eating a white rabbit candy? Their father didn't study when he was a kid, so your son doesn't get white rabbit candy either. So you have to get used to this kind of life. Don't argue with me.\" Lin Qing He stood firm.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48. Ginger, date and brown sugar soup\"Fine, not eating!\" Da Wa ran out in exasperation.Lin Qing He wouldn't call him back. She told Er Wa to quietly follow. Er Wa understood without being explicitly told. She took out a white rabbit candy and let him find his brother.Lin Qing He was idle, so she led San Wa to the entrance to make a snowman. The snow fell really heavily last night. Zhou Qing Bai got up early in the morning to clear the snow. After he returned, she didn\u2019t have to do any of this work. He done it.Including cooking pig food and the likes. They were all handled by him.She will certainly help in the future when he goes off to work. But for now, she really had no plans to. Let him busy away on his own.The mother and son were having a good time when Chen Daniang from next door came by.Seeing Chen Daniang, Lin Qing He greeted: \"Where is Chen Daniang going?\"And got San Wa to greet her.The reason why she didn't mind chatting was mainly that Chen Daniang was pretty nice. Her husband's family was also from the old Zhou family, although they are a little distantly related.The ancestors of Zhoujia Village were more or less related. There weren't any other surnames. But after living in the village for so long, it made no difference.\"My second son's wife just gave birth last night. Only when I went over, did I know there's no more brown sugar at home. So I thought I would go over to the supply and demand cooperative and look around.\" Chen Daniang said.\"Better let Chen Daniang be on your way. One thing, at this time, most of the things in the supply and demand cooperatives are sold out. If you can't buy it, come over to me for some. I bought some back last time. You can use it to solve the emergency.\"\"Then Daniang thank you first.\" Chen Daniang didn't act bashful and readily responded.Lin Qing He nodded.This Chen Daniang had helped the original owner to take care of her boys because the original owner was rarely looked after them. Sometimes she could leave the boys at home alone and would spend the whole day as outside.This Chen Daniang came over to help out twice. The original owner treated it as nothing. While Lin Qing He, who inherited the memory of the original owner, mentally kept count.Chen Daniang had two sons. She currently lived with her eldest son\u2019s family. The second son moved once he married.It was the first family to split in the village, and it was also a peaceful split. Neither Father Zhou nor Mother Zhou had Chen Daniang couple's courage.But now it was clear that life was very good. Since Chen Daniang's second son had their first child.Speaking of this, Lin Qing He's emotion surged.In fact, many people in the village gave birth one after another ever since the autumn rush.Counting the time, almost all of them were conceived around winter isolation last year.People in this era were like this. Because there was basically no other pastime. The only exercise was the couple's matter on the kang. Otherwise, how can there be so many children at this time?Not mentioning others, just take Zhou Qing Bai who had received a national education. After returning, he saw that she was in line with his image of an ideal wife. Didn't he still want to squeeze into her quilt on her Kang every day?Don\u2019t assume she doesn\u2019t know that when he first came back, he didn\u2019t have any thoughts about her.Later on, don't know what happened and he changed his mind. She didn't do anything special. She cooked three meals and boiled him a bowl of ginger and date soup before going to bed at night. Oh right, for the first few days, she insisted on boiling ginger water to soak his feet to drive off the chill every day.Other than that, there was nothing. As long as he was idle these days, he would approach her to find a sense of existence, even if he didn't say anything.Lin Qing He continued to push a snowman with San Wa. The mother and son became so delighted from playing. Da Wa and Er Wa returned after half an hour. The mother and son duo's big snowman was almost piled up.\"You two come over and check it out. What do you think of our snowman?\" Lin Qing He greeted the two of them.Da Wa saw that his mother didn't remember what happened in the morning, and cheerfully came over.At the sight, Er Wa uttered, \"Mother, why didn't you call me as well!\"\"The snowman had no nose and eyes. Think about what you can do to give it a nose and eyes. It'll count as you taking part.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Elder Brother, quickly go in the house and get the walnuts. It can be eyes for the snowman!\" Er Wa responded immediately.Da Wa ran in to grab it. He also went to the kitchen to get two firewood out and plugged them on both sides of the snowman. Then he stuffed the walnuts. Like this snowman was mostly completed.\"Great work! Your imagination is very good.\" Lin Qing He encouraged.Da Wa stared at her and said nothing.\"Study hard and learn many skills in the future. Mother will depend on you.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Our custom here is that parents live with their eldest son.\" Da Wa blurted out.Lin Qing He glared: \"So, you don't intend to be filial to me and your father in the future?\"\"That's definitely not possible. When you and Father get old, I will let you eat buns and dumplings every day!\" Da Wa declared.Lin Qing He recalled then. The custom from this place was that the parents live with their youngest son. Meaning, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou will live with her family in the future.For now, that was not necessary, as Father Zhou and Mother Zhou were still young.As for the future, let's talk about it then. It was too early to discuss caring for the old.Though she said that, Lin Qing He still hopes that the two will take care of their bodies. Otherwise, when they live with her in the future, and their health is bad, the burden will fall on her shoulder.So she asked the brothers to play outside. She went in and cooked the ginger, date and brown sugar soup. She stored it in the insulated lunch box brought back by Zhou Qing Bai and got Da Wa to send it to their grandparents.Of course, she let all three boys drink a bowl each. Lin Qing He had one too. It couldn't be more wonderful to drink this in such cold weather. It's really body warming.Lin Qing He was going to make sticky bean paste buns. It was troublesome to make this sticky bean paste bun, but now Lin Qing He got so much free time.Although the wool pant wasn't finished yet, it does not affect her making more food for the children.While she busied away at home, the brothers came back from their grandparent\u2019s house. They clustered over to help. Lin Qing He didn\u2019t shoo them away. If they were capable to do it, then she would command them to help. Besides being busy, they also gain a sense of accomplishment.At old Zhou's house, Father Zhou was drinking ginger, date and brown sugar soup. Have to say, this was really delicious.In the mind of these people in this era, two things that mean good. One was having oil content and the other was sweet stuff.Stored in the insulated lunch box, was about two bowls worth. Father Zhou poured it out and drank his own portion. And the remaining portion was poured out for his wife.\"Drink it while it's hot. What are you sitting there for?\" Father Zhou said to her.\"I never expected this. The two of us can still enjoy the filial piety from Fourth's wife.\" Mother Zhou emotionally expressed.\"It's enough that Fourth's wife is willing to live peacefully. As for other things, don't mind it.\" Father Zhou stated.If she can bring something to show filial piety, then eat it. If she doesn't, then don\u2019t demand for it. That was what Father Zhou meant.Da Niang: father's elder brother's wife; unrelated: aunt or grannyIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49. Phoenix Brand BikeInitially, Mother Zhou was still a bit worried. But after these days, her heart settled down. It seems that Fourth's wife had accepted Fourth's retirement.So she listened to Father Zhou and decide not to govern too much.After drinking the sweet and nourishing ginger, date and brown sugar soup, Mother Zhou washed the bowls and the insulated lunch box and then returned the insulated over.She found the mother and sons engaged in making sticky bean paste buns.Mother Zhou asked, \"Where's old Fourth?\"\"He went to the county city.\" Lin Qing He replied.\"Why go to the county city?\" Mother Zhou was taken aback.\"Had him go buy some cloth. He doesn't have many clothes. Later on, I have to borrow the sewing machine from the house and make him two sets.\" Lin Qing He answered with reluctance.Hearing this, Mother Zhou said nothing.\"When will Xiaogu get her holiday and come back?\" Lin Qing He asked casually.It was impossible to say that the original owner had no friends in the village. She had a very good relationship with Zhou Xiao Mei, the younger sister of Zhou Qing Bai. The two had similar temperaments. They especially love to be smug and vanity.The difference was that the original owner relied on the husband, Zhou Qing Bai, while Zhou Xiao Mei relied on herself. She was a worker in the food factory over at the county city, which was particularly decent.But her temperament was too spoiled and had compatible offensiveness with the original owner.Why? The original owner was pretty. Her speech was more superior, which got a flair of city folks. According to Zhou Xiao Mei's words, it was probably only Fourth Sister-in-law who was worth to show-off out of the whole family.The other three weren't good enough.Most importantly, was that when Zhou Xiao Mei went to apply for this job, the original owner bought two tins with a wave of her sleeve. She told her to secretly give it to her director.With this, she got the job and deepened Zhou Xiao Mei's relationship with the original owner. She often stood up for the original owner, saying that a beauty like original owner, a beauty, stayed home like a widow for her Fourth Brother. Her Fourth Brother must have accumulated eight lifetime worth of good fortune.Mother Zhou was so close to breaking her lackey legs when she heard this.But these words entered the original owner's heart. The sister-in-law duo was like two snake-rats were in a nest. Their relationship was close-knitted.Zhou Xiao Mei was Mother Zhou's youngest daughter, but her status was far inferior to Zhou Qing Bai. There was basically no doubt about this.What's more, she wasn't the only girl in the family. Before Zhou Qing Mu, the eldest brother, was two elder sisters. This meant, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou have a total of four sons and three daughters. Whether it was a daughter or a son, neither was rare.The most doted one was still the youngest son Zhou Qingbai, who was also the most outstanding one. The rest can sit on the side.Mother Zhou responded: \"Last time, I entrusted someone to bring words back. Said that she would come back next month. I don't know when she'll plan to marry. The sooner she does, the sooner she can marry off.\"Truthfully, she was a little annoyed by this youngest daughter. Her monthly salary was 16 yuan, but she was only able to send home 3 yuan. The rest 13 yuan was wasted by her.And also, every time she comes back, she had to come over and run off at the mouth about how her Fourth Brother mistreated her Fourth Sister-in-law. Clearly, a person who stirs trouble. She had enough of her.\"I guess it's almost time. Xiaogu is twenty-two this year.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Twenty-three after the New Year. She's not small anymore.\" Mother Zhou stated.\"Did Mother keep an eye out for her?\" Lin Qing He's hands kept moving as she asked.\"How could she fancy a rural guy? Every day, she thinks about eating commercial grain.\" Mother Zhou Mu grumbled.\"With this kind of mentality, Xiaogu is being ambitious.\" Lin Qing He said.Mother Zhou thought, 'Pursue what ambition ah? Is it that easy to marry a city guy?'Even if her daughter had a real job and it was decent to be in the city, but Mother Zhou still doesn't think her daughter can marry into the city.Lin Qing He didn't discuss any more with her on this. Chen Daniang came back at this time and knocked at the door.\"Chen Daniang, we're home. Come in.\" Lin Qing He shouted.Chen Daniang entered. When she saw Mother Zhou, she greeted with a smile. Mother Zhou politely made small talks.\"You're right, Qing He. There was no brown sugar in the supply and demand cooperatives. Old Second is a blockhead. He made no preparation. Can you see how much you have and share some with Daniang? Daniang will pay for it.\" Chen Daniang spoke.\"Okay, just go according to the supply and demand cooperative's price. How much do you want Chen Daniang.\" Lin Qing He affirmed.\"Are there two jins?\" Chen Daniang asked.\"Yes.\" Lin Qing He went in, portioned out two jins of brown sugar, and put it in the jar brought by Chen Daniang.The quality of the brown sugar was satisfactory to Chen Daniang. Lin Qing He said: \"It's only because it's you, Chen Daniang. If it was another, I might not necessarily give it. This is what I brought back from the long journey to the county city last time. \"Chen Daniang beamed and said that when she need help in the future, just ask. No need to be shy. And then she hurried back.Mother Zhou made no comment. She just thought that Fourth's wife really wants to live well now. She knows to sell favors and the like.It was normal to give brown sugar out in exchange for money. It counted as a favor for willingly exchange it to deal with an emergency.\"It's almost time for Third Sister-in-law, right?.\" Lin Qing He mentioned.\"This time next month.\" Mother Zhou nodded.Lin Qing He nodded. Zhou Qing Bai went to the county city in the morning. Because of the bike, the journey back and forth was quick. He arrived home at eleven.He brought back a bolt of earthen cloth. This earthen cloth doesn't require a coupon. Usually, it wasn't available in supply and demand cooperatives. One can only go to the black market and the price was slightly more expensive.If it was bought from a supply and demand cooperative, it can be a lot cheaper.A piece of earthen cloth, red dates, ginger, shrimp skin, seaweed, and the like. Besides those, were several jins of rice. More importantly, he brought back a jin of lamb!Overall, a lot of products were bought back this time.But the most important of these things was Zhou Qing Bai's bike.He didn't go to the county city today by himself. He went with the leader's elder son, as he also needed to go to the county town to buy things there. So they went together.This time, Zhou Qing Bai rode his own bike back. A brand new, Phoenix brand one. Lin Qing He gave him 300 yuan. This one cost around 250 yuan as well as 32 industrial coupons. It was expensive as hell.However, Lin Qing He didn't feel distressed at all. She grilled Zhou Qing Bai in high spirit: \"Why is it available now? I thought it would be next year.\"\"I got special permission.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.Lin Qing He understood. He had his channels. Although she saw that his expression was cold, there was a hint of 'praise me' from his eyes.Lin Qing He could tell without him saying, said, \"This whole must be freezing. Hurry in and wash your face with hot water. Then moisturize with little vanishing cream.\"\"You help me.\" Zhou Qing Bai stared at her.\"OK!\" For the sake of starting her own business next year, Lin Qing He will serve him.She scooped hot water for him to wash his face and then smeared him with vanishing cream.Got to say, when she was applying the cream on him, his intense gaze focusing on her made her heart beat faster.Xiao Gu: her husband's younger sister, so sister-in-law as well.

    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50. Youngest son &amp; eldest grandson\"You can do the rest yourself.\"Being stared like that, Lin Qing He felt like having a heart attack, so she stuffed the cream to him and let him apply it by himself.Zhou Qing Bai grabbed her waist: \"Wife...\"Lin Qing He almost nearly exploded like an angry cat. She immediately tore his hand off and voiced to him: \"If you have something to say, speak. Don't be touchy!\"With this, she ignored him and ran away immediately like there was a wolf chasing her.Zhou Qing Bai watched her slightly flustered figure. A slight smile crept on his face.Although he didn't understand what was wrong with him, he felt that it was reasonable for him to be close to his wife.But obviously, his wife had not adapted to his existence yet.The revolution had yet to succeed, the comrades still need to work hard.Zhou Qing Bai put on the vanishing cream. Initially, he didn't want to apply these things but remembering what she said about 27/8 looking like 47/8, he decided to let her smear it on him.The matter about Zhou Qing Bai buying a Phoenix brand bicycle spread through the village at once.In this era, buying a bike would be the same as buying an advanced X car in the future.One can imagine how many people were outside the courtyard.Lin Qing He had no interest in dealing with the villagers. And all of them that came over were men, including three Zhou brothers.Leave it for Zhou Qing Bai to handle. She began to prepare lunch.Everyone outside was asking questions around the bicycle, with obvious envy in their eyes.Soon Mother Zhou heard the news and came with Second Sister-in-law.While Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law didn't go out very much. The whole ground was snow and ice and they were pregnant. One can't be sure of accidents.\"Old Fourth, you don't have much use for bicycles here. Why buy such a big bicycle back? How much does it cost?\" Mother Zhou was so distress. Not a hint of joy could be seen.Such a brand-new bicycle, how much had to be spent? Since he was retired, there was no allowance. There were so many expenditures in the future, why can't he save!\"It's more convenient to go to the county city when owning a bicycle.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.\"It's only so far. Is there any difference between having a bicycle and not? And it's not like you need to frequently go!\" Said Mother Zhou as she suppressed her temper.In the end, she dotes her son and didn't say anything heavy in front of so many people.\"It's already bought not and cannot be refunded.\" Zhou Qing Bai shook his head.Mother Zhou became speechless from anger. She pondered, was this Fourth's wife's request?She thought she had changed for better, but actually, she was waiting!But thinking how they separated now, Mother Zhou didn't say much about it. Zhou Qing Bai dispersed the other people and let Mother Zhou, his three brothers and Second Sister-in-law into the courtyard.\"Old Fourth, you have bought this bike. Don't buy anything else in the future. Da Wa and his brothers will soon grow up. This yard will have to be readjusted.\" Eldest Brother Zhou said.Second Brother and Third Brother did not say anything.Second Sister-in-law eyed the bicycle enviously. Bicycle ah! This is a bicycle ah!It was the real deal. Not worse than the sewing machine at home.Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa continued to circle around the bicycle. They rubbed here and petted there. It was really rare.Lin Qing He was busy in the kitchen. They were having dumpling today. She was in the midst of wrapping up the filling. Zhou Qing Bai's appetite was pretty big. In one meal, he can eat an ocean-big bowl quantity.Eating so much, it was no wonder he had so much energy with nowhere to vent and always looked for opportunities to flirt with her.As for the outsiders coming over, she did not go out as Zhou Qing Bai was here.Only after a conversation, did Eldest Brother and the others return. Mother Zhou hadn't left yet. She asked privately how much was this bike?Zhou Qing Bai simply stated the truth. It made Mother Zhou agonized. She whispered: \"Is your wife who wants to buy it?\"\"Mother, this is what I want to buy. I will use it for whatever I do. We need a bicycle. It' got nothing to do with my wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai answered.With this, Mother Zhou didn't say anything. Youngest son always tells the truth and wouldn't lie.\"Mother, do you want to stay for lunch? We're having dumplings at noon.\" Lin Qing He casually asked, when she came out and saw her.It was a special day, why eat dumpling ah? Just spent more than two hundred yuans, and still eat dumplings! Really don't know how to live!Mother Zhou didn't want to eat and returned not long later.Lin Qing He didn't mind her. So she and her family clustered together for a meal of dumplings made with flour and pork. Ah, so tasty.After eating, Da Wa and their brothers were still hyped up about the bicycles.She got Zhou Qing Bai to take the brothers out for a lap.However, Zhou Qing Bai found them bothersome and did not really want to take them. What's more, he was looking at her. It was obvious that he wanted to take her out for a lap.Lin Qing He: \"...\" Such a cold day, she doesn't want to go out and suffer from the cold wind.Seeing that she did not want to go out, Zhou Qing Bai turned to his three sons: \"Waiting for spring, then I'll take you out.\"Although he didn't satisfy his sons' desire to go out and show off, Zhou Qing Bai still placed them on the bicycle together. They can count as a child who sat on a bicycle before.Their feet were gliding. (or floating in cloud nine)While at Old Zhou's House, Mother Zhou lamented to Father Zhou how the whole Fourth's family doesn't know how to live. This bicycle costed so much money, why did they buy it back?Father Zhou ignored it, let his wife complain. Once she finished, he voiced out: \"Now we are two families. They live their lives. Why are you being so concerned? Old Fourth is not one to be unreasonable. He won't impulsively spend money.\"Toward his youngest son, Father Zhou was proud and trusting. He was clear what kind of temper and what kind of person he was. So he didn't criticize.Mother Zhou frowned in displeasure and said, \"What do you men understand? If you don't spend prudently, even with a mountain of gold and silver, it isn't enough to feed the family!\"\"Haven't you went over and seen it? You said the piglets there are well-nurtured? By that time, there will be four or five work points. It can't be bad.\" Father Zhou mentioned.Mother Zhou sighed deeply: \"I hope for them to have a good life, and not sort out what they have and not have.\"Then she continued: \"This year when Xiao Mei come back, I must get her to bring more money home. When Da Wa gets married, he'll have to rely on us grandfather and grandmother. His parents are unreliable! \"\"Then ask Xiao Mei to bring more back.\" Father Zhou was in agreement and nodded.After all, Da Wa was the eldest grandson of their old Zhou family.The youngest son and eldest grandson was the lifeblood of the elderly. These two lifebloods were both occupied by Lin Qing He's family.At home, Second Sister-in-law was very unsettled.She believed that Lin Qing He's life would be worse in the future. Who would have known that they bought a bicycle out of nowhere?If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51. Perplexing behaviorIn total, there were two bikes in the village. One was the leader family's and the other was Lin Qing He family's.It was conceivable how much respect Lin Qing He's family get for owning such a bicycle.Second Sister-in-law was extremely upset, and also very discontent.She wanted to see the joke, but instead, the other person showed off. Which really tore down her spirit.When cooking lunch, Second Sister-in-law was like someone had owed her money.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law exchanged glances, and they knew what was up.After the meal, they each went back to their room. What was great about Old Zhou Family, was that each family had their own room instead of squeezing together.Toward Second Sister-in-law's thoughts, Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law was pretty clear about it. After all, they have been sisters-in-law for so many years, who doesn't know what the other was like.She was envious.Second Brother also caught on. When he returned to the room, he coaxed her: \"What are you doing? Fourth didn't spend your money to buy the bike. Who are you giving that look to?\"What? I can't be angry in this house anymore!\" Like she was ignited, Second Sister exploded at once. She angrily roared.\"Be quieter!\" Second Brother immediately said.\"Why should I be quieter? Have I said anything? I can't speak, is it?\" Second Sister-in-law yelledThe couple quarreled for no reason, and Second Sister-in-law angrily packed her things and stormed back to her maternal family.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou didn't say anything. They acted like they didn't know.Second Brother didn't go bring her back and let her live at her maternal house. If he brought her back now, her fire will definitely be burning.Lin Qing He found out Second Sister-in-law had returned to her maternal family when she came to borrow the sewing machine.Perfect timing. The only person she didn't want to interact with in the old Zhou's house was this Second Sister-in-law. Let's all comply with 'Well water does not violate river water'. Why must she speak and act so obscure each time they meet. It was great that she wasn't home. (T/N: idiom, basically mean I live my life, you live yours. Don't intrude into another's territory)She brought some white rabbit candy over and gave Eldest Sister-in-law's three daughters one each. Then shared one to Eldest Sister-in-law's only son at the moment.\"Fourth Auntie, I want two.\" Little Zhou Yang, Eldest Sister-in-law uttered.\"No more. Fourth Auntie only brought four. Yang Yang and your sisters get one each.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Da Ni wanted to give her share to her brother when Lin Qing He stated: \"He already has his. You girls got to have a taste.\"\"Listen to your Fourth Auntie,\" Eldest Sister-in-law added.Zhou Da Hi ate hers. The white rabbit candy was so sweet that everyone was in a good mood.Lin Qing He asked Eldest Sister-in-law to guide on the detailed part of making clothes for Zhou Qing Bai. Eldest Sister-in-law saw that she was really getting involved now, so naturally, she was willing to connect with her. She diligently taught her.Lin Qing He's comprehension skill was high because the original owner knew how to. She just had to adjust it and it wasn't difficult to make two sets of clothes for Zhou Qingbai.\"I can see that Eldest Sister-in-law had a much better complexion now.\" Lin Qing He quickly improved and conversed with Eldest Sister-in-law.\"Is that so? I have recently felt a lot more comfortable in my body. The benefits of eating apple aren't little.\" Eldest Sister-in-law remarked.\"If it's not good, I won't have told you. That's right, if Eldest Brother needs to do something in the county city in the future, you can tell him to come over and ride the bicycle.\" Lin Qing He.\"That would be very nice.\" Eldest Sister-in-law smiled.Although they might not necessarily use it, it made her feel at ease when Lin Qing He gave her the go-ahead.Now it came up, Eldest Sister-in-law couldn't understand what Second Sister-in-law was angry about.This bicycle didn't spend a cent of her money. They definitely used Fourth Brother-in-law's retirement fund. Fourth Brother-in-law bought it back, so in future, if the family ever needs it, he will definitely lend it.This meant the three families can use Brother-in-law's bike for free. It counts as taking advantage. What was Second Sister-in-law mad about?\"During this period of time, it is the highest peak for development in your belly. Eat more nutritious things, and the baby will be very smart after birth.\" Lin Qing He advised.Although she had never given birth, but her colleagues in her previous life had. She heard an earful of the pregnancy experience.With the current condition at home, it was better than most people in the village. At least because of their pregnancy, she and Third's wife can still have an egg for nourishment each day.Second Sister-in-law did not receive this treatment.Of course, when Second Sister-in-law was pregnant, she had it.However, Eldest Sister-in-law made no comment. She instructed her on making clothes. The stitches and the likes were taught clearly.After coming a few days, Lin Qing He almost completed Zhou Qing Bai's first set of clothes.It was a close-fitting one. It had both the top and the trousers. As it was made with earthen cloth, so it was very warm.Zhou Qing Bai was in a very good mood, receiving his new clothes. He implied that it was fine to casually make it. Apparently, she put in the effort. Her stitches were impeccable.And it was also very close-fitting, just his size.\"It was hard on wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her.Lin Qinghe didn't know if she was the suspected neighbor for robbing the ax. She always felt that his gaze was slightly hot. Wasn't it just a set of clothes, what's up with you?There was no need to make any for Da Wa and his brothers. This year a set of cotton coats was made for them. They also have two sets of clothes inside. Shoes and socks were complete. No need for tomorrow and the slightly cold spring. Autumn was also fine. Just need to make the summer set.It goes without saying that Zhou Qing Bai's summer clothes also need to be made.The preserved eggs marinated last month were ready to be eaten this month. After coming over for few days to continuously borrow old Zhou Family's sewing machine, Lin Qing He brought two salted eggs over for Father Zhou and Mother Zhou.As soon as she entered the door, she saw Second Sister-in-law. When Second Sister-in-law saw her, she smiled and said, \"Fourth Sister-in-law had come. Is this cloth brought to show filial to Father and Mother?\"\"No, I'm going to make clothes for Qing Bai with this. These two salted eggs were personally pickled by me are for Father and Mother. By the way, Second sister-in-law, what are you going give to Father and Mother as filial piety?\" Lin Qing He threw back.Second Sister-in-law laughed it off, \"With my family condition, how can I compare with yours?\"\"That's true. It really can't be compared.\" Lin Qing He nodded.This enraged Second Sister-in-law a lot and she turned around and left.Lin Qinghe snorted. Eldest Sister-in-law gave her a wink. Lin Qing He nodded and went over to Mother Zhou's room. She gave her the salty pickled eggs: \"I marinated it myself. Mother, you and Father have a taste. If you like it, I'll bring some more. \"\"Keep them for Da Wa and his brothers, no need to bring them.\" Mother Zhou responded.\"There's still some at home.\" Lin Qing He left the egg and came to the storeroom.Old Zhou Family's storeroom was where the sewing machine was placed.She began to sew clothes. In the past few days, she was already thoroughly familiar with the process. Not long later, Eldest Sister-in-law also came over.\"What happened just now?\" Eldest Sister-in-law asked.\"Who knows. She behaved perplexingly when I enter the door. It's becoming a habit.\" Lin Qing He couldn't care less.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52. Lamb and goji berry soup\"Nobody would deny that. She came back yesterday evening and talked like that.\" Eldest Sister-in-law's lip twitched as she spoke.\"Don't quarrel with her. You're pregnant, don't make yourself angry.\" Lin Qing He coaxed.Eldest Sister-in-law burst into a smile when she comforted her instead: \"I wouldn't keep it on my chest.\"Then she looked at the cloth in her hand and pointed out, \"After making another winter innerwear for Fourth Brother-in-law, I estimate there's enough leftover to make two sets of summer clothes for him.\"\"One summer set is enough. The rest will be for the three boys'. They don't any to wear.\" Lin Qing He responded.Zhou Qing Bai didn't bring many clothes back, but there were two sets. According to Lin Qing He's perspective, he didn't have enough to wear. In the mind of this era, it was definitely enough. But making an extra set isn't a bad idea.The three boys definitely needed it.Lin Qing He's speed was now very fast because she became skilled in using the sewing machine. Plus she was irritated from seeing Second Sister-in-law's face. So it took two and a half days to complete Zhou Qing Bai's second winter clothes.The rest was summerwear. Lin Qing He also spent a few days to finish these and packed it in the closet.She doesn't need to go to the old Zhou's house and run into Second Sister-in-law anymore.In the morning, they had millet porridge with salted eggs. Lin Qing He announced: \"Today I have to pickle another batch. You guys eat too fast.\"It was only that long before the pickled eggs were almost devoured up. She had brought over the eggs twice to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou. Each time two, so four in total.Now there were only a few left. The rest was eaten by the father and sons.\"I will go out and buy some eggs later.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.\"Is there no lamb sold here?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Not here.\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her and said, \"Want to eat?\"Lin Qing He shook her head and replied: \"Don't torment yourself, going so far to the county city in this weather.\"The last time he bought a bicycle, he also brought a jin of lamb back. She had added goji berry and stewed a lamb and goji berry soup. The taste was really delicious.Although it was only a jin, the whole family was extremely content.Zhou Qing Bai nodded and said nothing. After taking care of the two little piglets after breakfast, he pushed the bicycle and carried the basket out.Lin Qing He continued to knit the woolen trousers at home. It was for the kids. She also wanted one. This weather was extremely freezing.She assumed Zhou Qing Bai had gone to the community's supply and demand cooperative. To her surprise, he only returned from this trip at 11:30. He also brought back three jin of mutton!\"The snow and wind are so big, why did you go to the county city?\" Lin Qing He couldn't help saying when she saw his cheeks were flushed.\"It's not cold riding a bicycle.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.Not only did he brought back the lamb, but also five jins of eggs.Lin Qing He quickly sent him to go to Kang and wait. First, she boiled him a bowl of ginger soup for him to down. Then she nagged: \"You better let up a bit next time!\"\"Mother, Father knows that you want to eat lamb, so specially bought it for you.\" Er Wa interjected.Lin Qing He looked at Zhou Qing Bai, saw Zhou Qing Bai rubbed Er Wa's head and his gaze that met her eyes carried obvious indulgence.\"Only you know to speak eloquently!\" Lin Qing He was a little embarrassed and glared at Er Wa.Er Wa giggled. Lin Qing He picked up San Wa and put him in Zhou Qing Bai's arms: \"Hug your son, he is warm all over.\"San Wa stayed in his father's arms and blinked at his mother with big eyes, which expressed that he is very obedient and be his father's body warmer.\"Instead of bean paste bun for lunch, we're having lump soup.\" Lin Qing He harrumphed and stated.Previously a lot of sticky bean paste buns were made, and there were still leftovers. A lot of leftovers.She initially planned to eat this for lunch, but now she changed her mind.The lump soup was the kids' favorite, especially the lump soup made by their mother, which was really yummy.Lump soup was very easy to make. Lin Qing He used a lot of ingredients, including chopped mushrooms, minced meat, and eggs. There were no delicious vegetables during this season, otherwise, the taste will be better after adding green vegetables and tomatoes.Zhou Qing Bai had no complaints about what his wife makes. He eats whatever she cooks.After the children had their fill, they went to Kang. At this time, it was still snowing outside. It just was too cold.Lin Qing He chopped the mutton by herself.Including the skin and bone, it was three jins. Lin Qing He put in a half. The other half was left for tomorrow to eat. In this weather, it won't turn bad from leaving it out.She placed it on the coal stove and stewed it. It'll be ready to eat at night.\"It's too cold. You brothers better bundle up for me. And you're not allowed to drink cold water. If I find out you drank cold water, you won't get anything to eat then!\" Lin Qing He strictly instructed. She especially looked at Da Wa.Da Wa cried out in injustice: \"I don't do it now!\" What's more, the winter was so freezing. Only fool would drink cold water!Lin Qing He nodded: \"It's fine if you don't. Tonight you get an extra piece of lamb.\"\"Me too,\" Er Wa said.\"Okay, give you extra,\" Lin Qing He responded.Zhou Qing Bai watched the mother and sons interact. His gaze mostly focused on Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He raised her eyes to glance at him. She coughed dryly and said: \"You must be exhausted from this morning, sleep a bit.\"\"You sleep too.\" Zhou Qing Bai steadily looked at her.The woolen pant in Lin Qing He's hand was almost ready, so she put them away first. The whole family took a nap on the kang. When she got up, Lin Qing He continued to knit the woolen pants.Zhou Qingbai was no longer on the kang. At this time, he had to make pig food for the piglets, so he was preoccupied.Lin Qing He was thankful that there was still some wool at home that would allow her to pass the time. Otherwise, there was no way to pass the days. It was really boring.At around four o'clock in the afternoon, she completed the woolen pant.Then she started knitting the second one, because there was really nothing to do. The speed of knitting pants wasn't slow at all.It was really idle on these snowy days.The smell of mutton and goji berry soup in the pot was already fragrant. Lin Qing He saw that it was cooked and scooped some. for Zhou Qing Bai to deliver to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou.Da Wa? Forget it. The snow outside was pretty hefty. It was better to stay in the room on this freezing day.\"Mutton soup? Keep it for yourself. You don't need to bring it over.\" Mother Zhou refused.\"My wife said to bring it.\" Zhou Qing Bai maintained, then went to the kitchen to get the bowls. He poured it out. Just perfect, two bowl full and two pieces of lamb, one for each.Zhou Qing Bai didn't stay any longer. He went back after distributing it.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou didn't act reserved, so they drank the warm mutton soup.\"Fourth's wife's cooking skill is really good,\" Mother Zhou remarked while drinking soup.Whether it was pickled eggs or this mutton soup or the occasional ginger date soup that was sent over, the taste was superb.Moreover, Mother Zhou felt that her body had been warmed a lot this year. Don\u2019t know if it was linked to these soups.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53. Looking for fault.It wasn't just Mother Zhou who thought so. Father Zhou was the same.It was only once every three or five days, but in the past, there was no such treatment.Got to say, even though the soup doesn't fill the hunger, the body felt a bit different after drinking it for a while.\"There are benefits from youngest's retirement,\" Father Zhou remarked.\"As long as she can take care of old Fourth and the boys, we don't need her to send stuff over.\" Mother Zhou also commented.Judging by Lin Qing He's current performance, Mother Zhou was quite satisfied. Of course, that was on the premise that she doesn't spend money.Otherwise, Mother Zhou would have a hard time reining in her temper because she couldn't stand it anymore.While on Lin Qing He's side, she doesn't care what the old couple thinks. The reason why she would get the soup sent over is because it's what they should be doing. In the end, they were the boys' grandparents and they treated the brothers well.If it were someone who treated the brothers terribly, she would definitely not go through so much trouble.Zhou Qing Bai was back. Her steamed mantou was ready. So the family ate the mutton soup with mixed grain mantou, which was also tasty.Although there were still a lot of materials in the space, Lin Qing He did not follow modern standards. She would still make it with other grains for the children to eat.For example, this mantou was a combination of cornflour and wheat flour. Lin Qing He got Zhou Qing Bai to make it. He did it and stored a lot at home.When not eating other foods, she'll steam mantou and then make soup. With this, the meal was complete.Even so, if the guys' food was the second-best in the village, and no one dares to label themselves as first.After Zhou Qing Bai returned, he didn't seem to get thinner. Not only did he not lose weight, Lin Qing He obviously felt that he had too much energy with nowhere to vent. Otherwise, why would he get up in the morning to run and not afraid of the cold?Running wasn't enough. He would go back to the yard to practice boxing. If Lin Qing He didn't stop him by saying Da Wa was still young, afraid he would pull him in to box together.For such a dinner, one steamed mantou and a bowl of mutton soup were enough for Lin Qing He. Her current figure was just right because the oil content at home was sufficient. She was afraid that she would get fat.In Zhou Qing Bai's eyes, her standard was clearly thin. When he saw her finished, he stuffed another one to her and used his eyes to tell her to eat instead of retaining it for them, father and sons.Lin Qinghe: \"...\" Silently broke a small piece to eat and the bigger one was given to him.Zhou Qing Bai didn't receive it, uttered: \"Eat more.\"He found that her intake quantity was too small. This size mantou, he can eat five before he's full, but she actually ate only one.\"Can't eat anymore,\" Lin Qing He maintained.Zhou Qing Bai saw that she really didn't want to eat anymore and accepted it with no other choice. He stated, \"You are too thin.\"\"That's right. Mother, you are too thin.\" Da Wa also nodded: \"You only ate one, while I have eaten two!\"\"Mother eats less than me.\" Er Wa had one and a half.\"Mother.\" San Wa hugged his mother. Mother ate one just like him. He felt he was the closest to Mother.\"Quick eat, let's go walk around after eating.\" Lin Qing He smiled.Zhou Qing Bai told her to drink more mutton soup. This time Lin Qing He did not refuse his good intentions and scooped up a small bowl to drink.Afterward, when coaxed her again, she ignored him. Really, was it easy for her to maintain such a good figure?Zhou Qing Bai didn't make her eat anymore. The children were full, and the rest was eaten by him alone. His appetite was enormous.Lin Qing He wiped the boys' mouths and washed their hands. Then they got fully armed and went out to continue making a snowman.All the brothers have gloves. This was what she entrusted Mei Jie to keep an eye out for at the cooperative. If there were some, set them aside for her. And Mei Jie did.Three gloves cost six yuans. So one required two yuans. It also needed a coupon.It wasn't cheap at all. But Lin Qing He still bought it. She didn't want the kids to freeze their hands and get damaged. The current winter can't be compared with the future greenhouse effect. It was extremely freezing to death.Lin Qing He took the three brothers out to play for half an hour before gathering them back to the room. The Kang was already heating. After washing their feet, they were allowed to go on the Kang.Da Wa began to recite numbers. Lin Qing He started training him half a month ago, and now he can count from one to twenty without errors. He can also add and subtract up to ten, which indicated relatively high in IQ.Otherwise, he won't be able to mix so well in the future.Lin Qing He gave him a book for him to start writing. As for Er Wa and San Wa, whether the two write or draw, it was up to them. Anyway, teaching one or teaching two, it was still teaching.\"Are you going back home before New Year?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked her when he brought her foot bath.At first, Lin Qing He hadn't caught on. Only after a pause did she understand he was talking about her maternal family. Then she nodded and said, \"I'll see which day I'm free to go back.\"\"I'll go with you.\" Zhou Qing Bai gazed at her.Lin Qing He shook her head: \"No, just me going back is enough.\"This time she went back, she didn\u2019t plan to go back during the New Year. She wasn't visiting relatives. She was going to find fault, so it was better not to take him with her.She will not allow those from old Lin family to destroy her present life. She had no guilt for mysteriously becoming the original owner, so she won't have any guilt toward the old Lin family. It wasn't possible.Old Lin Family can extinguish their hope of wanting her to supplement them like she was the original owner.Both old Lin Family's Father Lin and Mother Lin were still alive. They were older than Father Zhou and Mother Zhou. She had two elder brothers and two elder sisters above, and a younger brother below.This younger brother was pretty nice. He used to be summoned by the original owner to find firewood. He didn't accept any money given. And if he did, he used it to buy candy for Da Wa and his brothers.But after he got married, there was less contact. After all, he had to take care of his own family.As for siblings above, the relationship with the original owner was mostly good. Even so, it was the original owner being beneficial to them a lot.For example, a new military coat sent back by Zhou Qing Bai. It was given by the original owner to her second brother, this lazy bum.Not even her younger brother had a share.Moreover, the current one on Zhou Qing Bai was old. He only sent it back because he was worried about the family's bed wasn't warm enough.Such a big set, it can be used as a quilt. These words weren't a cover-up.\"What's the matter?\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her. Why did he get the slight feeling that his wife was approaching the pigs and sheep with a sharpened knife?Lin Qing He stated, \"Nothing, It's just that I felt 'I' was pretty stupid before.\"Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\"\"I'll make a trip back tomorrow.\" Lin Qing He couldn't stay put from the thought of picking fault. She simply declared: \"After finishing breakfast, I'll head out. I will come back for lunch at noon. Watch the home for me.\"Zhou Qing Bai stared at her and expressed, \"No need for me to go with you?\"\"No need.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54. Stealing grainIn the evening, Lin Qing He supervised Da Wa over his writing practice and math before letting the three brothers sleep.Zhou Qing Bai moved the three sleeping brothers in a row at the end of the Kang and freed up space for the two of them.Lin Qing He 's heart leaped out. Then she remembered her menstrual period and became calm.Zhou Qing Bai said quietly, \"It's time to sleep.\"Lin Qing He nodded: \"Sleep.\"As for sleeping, Zhou Qing Bai had eaten mutton today. So sure enough, he was restless. Lin Qing He indifferently pointed out: \"My period is here. Behave and sleep properly.\"Zhou Qing Bai was disappointed when he heard that.Lin Qing He slept comfortably. The kang burned was heated at dusk, so they could sleep warmly all night. After all, her seven-jin quilt wasn't covered for nothing.And also a four jin was added on top.\"Sleep.\" Even Zhou Qing Bai was disappointed, at least he could still hold his wife to sleep.Lin Qing He was cuddled in his arms. Feeling that her heartbeat speeding too fast, she uttered, \"I can't sleep if you hold me!\"\"You can.\" Zhou Qing Bai spoke sulkily.Lin Qing He mentally refuted, 'Then you wear a pair of pants. You ate lamb again tonight and had abstinence for so long, so at this moment, that spot is very spirited. With that against me, how can I sleep?'\"Wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai called out.Lin Qing He felt the man's voice was pleasing, deep, sexy, and magnetic.However, Lin Qing He chose to pretend to be dead. Tonight, she made a mistake. She thought he couldn\u2019t do anything, so she ignored him and forgot that she had to sleep with him!The three brothers' sleeping quality was excellent. At this moment, they were asleep. They will wake up in the middle of the night to pee and drink a glass of water before snoozing to the next morning.Zhou Qing Bai didn't get a response from his wife, so he didn't say anything. After all, holding his soft wife was also a very enjoyable thing.\"Still not sleeping?\" Lin Qing He pretended for a while and could still feel that he hadn't dozed off. The hand resting on her waist was extremely hot.\"Wife, when does that go away?\" Zhou Qing Bai said sullenly without answering the question.\"I don't know.\" Lin Qing He uttered in a displeased mood.\"Wife, you don't want me?\" Zhou Qing Bai sighed.Lin Qing He mentally answered, 'I don't. Not one bit! Quickly go to sleep!'She directly turned her body to face the same direction as the children. Zhou Qing Bai huddled over from behind. Lin Qing He could still feel his enthusiasm for her very clearly.After the New Year, Zhou Qing Bai was only 28 years old. While she was 24 after New Year. She was 4 years old younger than him.But whether it was twenty-eight or twenty-four, it was the period of young people's passion ah.After being provoked by him, Lin Qing He's heart became erratic. However, she paid no mind to him.Before she thought it through, don't even think about touching her, no matter how fervent he was.Lin Qing He didn't fall asleep until about 9:30 that night. Only when Zhou Qing Bai felt that his wife was sleeping, did he dozed off with regret.Forget it. Let's take it slowly. It seems that his wife hadn't completely put down her prejudice toward him.However, she was willing to share the same quilt with him, which was also a good start.Lin Qing He slept very warmly that night. She felt like she was holding a big stove, it was very comfortable.It was still snowing outside in the morning, so Zhou Qing Bai didn't go out. Most importantly, his wife held him as she slept so soundly. How could he push her away?When Lin Qing He woke up, it was almost seven o'clock. Seeing that he was still on the kang, she froze: \"You didn't go out for a run?\"\"It's snowing outside.\" Zhou Qing Bai gazed at her as he spoke warmly.Lin Qing He nodded and then felt their position was a bit intimate.She was hugging his waist and buried her entire face in his arms. While his long arm wrapped around her waist. Their posture was almost the same as the posture of a couple who were in love!\"I slept too comfortably, don't take offense.\" Lin Qing He laughed dryly and got out of his embrace.Zhou Qing Bai didn't press in on her too tightly and said: \"Sleep some more. I will steam the buns.\"Breakfast was steamed bun and shrimp soup. All made by Zhou Qing Bai. He also brought in hot water to wash up.Because the snow was too heavy in the morning, Lin Qing He didn't plan to go back to the old Lin's House and find fault anymore. No need to risk through this heavy snowstorm.She brought her three sons to breakfast, while Zhou Qing Bai went to take care of two piglets.Now there was no more chicken in the chicken pen. The last chicken was stewed by Lin Qing He. It can no longer lay eggs, why keep it? Waste grain? Better to stew it for nourishment.Today's snow kept going all the way until ten o'clock in the morning. It was a substantial amount.The snow stopped, and Lin Qing He stopped knitting trousers. She took Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa, out to walk around. They couldn\u2019t keep staying isolated at home all winter. Bundling up and wander around wasn't a bad idea.While strolling, they came to Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi sibling's home.Zhou Dong was shoveling the snow. The clothes on his body did not seem to be cold resistant. His cheeks were a little bit red.\"Shen!\" Zhou Dong immediately shouted when he saw Lin Qing He.Inside, Zhou Xi heard the voice, and happily chirped: \"How come Shen have free time to come over? It's cold outside, hurry into the house. The Kang is heating, it's really warm.\"\"Shenzi, quickly bring the kids in.\" Zhou Dong said.Lin Qing He noticed the kids didn\u2019t want to enter the house, so she let them be. She stomped through the snow and came in. She directed to Zhou Xi: \"Is there enough food this year?\"\"Enough.\" Zhou Xi nodded and smiled.This year, a lot of food was distributed to their household. And because they had money in their hands, they also bought some from the team. It can be said that this year's winter was better than the previous years' winter.Although they eat two meals a day, they can eat half-full with each meal.In fact, not only Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi were like this, everyone else tightened their belts during the days of winter isolation. From the usual three meals a day to two meals a day.Because after the food distribution, the next food distribution will be at the time of the summer harvest.Once it was spring, it was a period of temporary shortage. At that time, some people in the village had to go to exchange food coupons and then go to the supply and demand cooperatives to buy commodity food.If they don\u2019t want to spend money to exchange food coupons and then spend more money to buy food, then they have to frugally eat now. They have to hold it up to summer harvest.\"Under normal circumstances, someone must always stay home. I heard that someone in the neighboring village seems to have their food stolen,\" Lin Qing He warned.This wasn't a joke. She heard it from Chen Daniang. Chen Daniang was the most informed about the latest news. It was an orphan and widow, who had their food stolen. At this time, getting their food stolen was like taking their life.Fortunately, the neighboring team had a small hefty harvest this year and still had food left. So they were sent, otherwise, the pair wouldn't be able to live.\"I know, there will definitely be someone at home!\" Zhou Xi confirmed quickly.\"It's enough to see you, brother and sister, be able to get through. But if there is any difficulty, just come over and tell Shenzi.\" Lin Qing He said, and then took out a handful of red dates from her pocket: \"I brought this for you. Keep it.\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55. Reselling Pork\"Shenzi, no need. Leave them for Da Wa and his brothers to eat.\" Zhou Xi responded quickly.\"It's just a handful of red dates. What is there to push around for?\" Lin Qing He said: \"And girls got to eat more red dates, it's good for the body and replenish blood.\"Zhou Xi bashfully accepted it.This year her eldest brother got a share of 34 yuan. From her Shenzi's firewood, he earned nearly ten yuan.Don't underestimate the ten yuans. It can let them siblings eat more.\"These two days are really cold, don't save the firewood at home. Your brother brought so much firewood back for Shenzi. Even til next year, it won't be used up. If you guys are short, come over and take some back. Wait until next for your brother to make it up.\" Lin Qing He expressed.\"There is enough firewood at home.\" Zhou Xi answered at once.Because their family put in the effort, it was possible for them to go to the team and get a share of corn stalks, wheat stalks, cotton stubble, beanstalks, and sweet potato stem.There were only two of them in the family. It was enough to burn the Kang twice a day. After all, there was also firewood collected by her elder brother.Lin Qing He chatted with her for a while, and then took the boys back house.\"Brother, here. Shenzi gave it.\" Zhou Xi shared some red dates with her brother as she spoke.\"No need. You can it yourself.\" Zhou Dong shook his head.Zhou Xi remarked: \"Shenzi is so nice.\"This year's winter was much warmer because there was a new quilt. In the middle of the night, they don't have to wake from the cold.Zhou Dong nodded.There was no doubt that Shenzi did take care of them.Lin Qing He, who returned home, was planning to make bacon.It had already entered the twelfth lunar month, and it was the best time to make bacon.So in the afternoon, she came to find Mei Jie.Mei Jie received her. Lin Qing He saw that no one was around, lowered her voice, and told Mei Jie her plan about the meat she got.Mei Jie shook her head repeatedly: \"No, it can't do. If this got found out, we will be in trouble!\"\"Mei Jie, don't worry. If I got caught, I certainly won't say that Chen Ge is involved. We have known each other for so long, you know what kind of person I am. I dare not be careless on important matters. Besides, I have no choice. There're three kids in the family to raise. Now my man has retired, if I don\u2019t find other methods to supplement the family expenses, my whole family can't keep on living.\"Chen Mei's man was also surnamed Chen, the exact same surname as her.\"This is too risky.\" Mei Jie opposed.\"Mei Jie, don't worry. I won't do it often. Only once every three or five days. A few jins at a time. Any meat will do. I'll pay a dime extra for each jin, more or less can help with the household expenses. It\u2019s not easy to raise children during this time. I don\u2019t want them to live the kind of days we had when we were kids.\u201d Lin Qing He persuaded.The phrase 'a dime extra for each jin' made Mei Jie's heart moved.Of course, this was also because her impression of Lin Qing He was indeed very good. In addition, she had seen Zhou Qing Bai, the husband. If the husband and wife weren't living in a rural area, she can't tell that they are rural people from their aura. They seem more city-folk than everyone in the city.It was obviously dependable. After all, no one wants to get into trouble, right?\"But the county city is pretty far, especially now it is snowing.\" Mei Jie pointed out with hesitation.Although she wanted to use her husband's position to make extra money, honestly, she made none over the many years, other than what she benefitted from Lin Qing He.\"Not doing it now.\" Lin Qing He shook her head. It was too cold these days. In order to make that little money, there was no need to suffer. She came to give a heads up first.\"When it's spring, I will ride a bicycle to take the meat from Chen Ge in the morning, and then go directly to the county city.\" Lin Qing He whispered.\"There's a bicycle at home?\" Mei Jie surprised.\"Specially prepared for this.\" Lin Qing He said with a wink.With this, Mei Jie felt that she could give it a try.\"Mei Jie, go back and discuss with Chen Ge. It's no problem if he doesn't agree. If he agrees, then I can assure you now if anything happens, I will never pull anyone into it. I take whole responsibility for my own matter!\" Lin Qing He declared.\"Then I will go back to discuss with your Chen Ge.\" Mei Jie nodded hesitantly, then whispered.\"Alright then. Tomorrow I'll buy pork belly and loin. Mei Jie, how many jin can you get for me? I want to buy it back to make bacon.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Making bacon, then I can get three or four jins for you. As for the particular part, I'll have to see. Come around at 5:30 in the morning, I will wait for you over there.\" Mei Jie stated.\"Okay.\" Lin Qing He nodded.But she was in a slight dilemma in her heart. Five thirty, that was too early!What she didn't know was that the slaughterhouse got up to work at one or two in the middle of the night. 5:30 was very late. It was because the sunrise was later now. Otherwise, they can't go that late to get the meat. It'll be too eye-catching.Lin Qing He returned, while Mei Jie absentmindedly went back to work. Once she got off work, she headed home immediately.Then she woke her man, who was catching on sleep, to talk about this.\"Old Chen, do you think we should do this?\" Mei Jie went over it again before asking.Mei Jie was willing. Them, husband and wife, certainly have a workplace but in fact her job was not guaranteed. That's because the old director's daughter-in-law was about to give birth, and only then did she get this position. Once the baby is born, her being able to continue was another matter.She used to be a temporary worker, and that related on connections.Only after she officially went to work, did the living pressure eased a lot. Let's not mention how tightened their belt was in the past.At present, her salary was 14 yuan, while her old Chen was more than her. He got 16 yuan and can still get some oil content back home on most days.The two add up to thirty yuan, which wasn't little. But the family got three children studying now. Although they have moved out, they still give three yuan each month to her parents-in-law.Waking up every day, they have to eat. Those who aren't heading the family do not know how hard life at home was.\"Are you sure she is reliable?\" old Chen was solemn for a bit before voicing out.\"Reliable, otherwise I won't be taking her food coupons and stay in communication with her. Her man has retired, so now she wants to supplement the family. I think she is a smart one.\" Mei Jie said.\"Then wait until spring and let her come and try. If it doesn't work out, then immediately stop.\" old Chen stated.Hearing this, Mei Jie became relieved.Each time take a few jin of meat, so a few jins of meat equal to a few dimes. This can buy them a jin or two of eggs back home to nourish the children!\"She ordered a few jins of pork belly and loin. How much do you think you can get?\" mentioned Mei Jie.\"I can give her five pounds.\" old Chen said.He was somewhat stunned. To be still able to buy meat to make bacon during this time, they definitely know how to eat.\"That's enough,\" Mei Jie nodded.Ge: BrotherIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56. Raising dogs to guard homeLin Qing He wasn't worried about Mei Jie disagreeing. Even though the transaction was a bit risky, the current movement was not as severe as it was in the early 1960s.Then there was Mei Jie, who had to support the elderly and half-grown children who can eat their old man to poverty. This period was the time of the middle-aged crisis.It was truly having old above and young below. As long as one wasn't stupid, they would be willing to give it a try.Both husband and wife have employment, so obviously they weren't stupid. Lin Qing He anticipated as long as there's no problem on her side, it'll be fine.With a space in her hand, buying and selling some stuff was like playing for her.Now the only problem for her was that she had to get up so early in the future!Would she be able to conceal getting up early from Zhou Qing Bai? Lin Qing He felt that she couldn't hide this matter. With his character, he most likely would ask her to not do it.When Lin Qing He came back, she chanced upon someone from other villages carrying their eggs to sell. So she bought two jins of eggs on the way home.As Lin Qing He went back, she hadn't been able to come up with anything.Zhou Qing Bai was a little puzzled. Why did his wife look like she had something to say but stopped for some reason?He didn't ask immediately.It was already past three o'clock. Tonight she intended to eat bean paste bun, so Lin Qing He didn't plan to cook.But because of the dry weather in winter, she stewed seaweed and ribs soup.There weren't many spare ribs remaining. Lin Qing He added It all.In the evening, the family was quite satisfied with the food. After eating, they routinely went to wash and sleep.But because of this bean paste bun, she was worried that the children were too small to digest well, so she played with them for a while before sleeping.\"What's the matter?\" Zhou Qing Bai said as he hugged her.That's right, the children were moved by him to one side tonight again. He shared the quilt with her again.\"I ordered meat with my Mei Jie as I planned to make some bacon. Mei Jie told me to go over at 5:30 tomorrow morning.\" Lin Qing He mentioned.\"Slaughterhouse?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked.\"En.\" Lin Qing He nodded.\"You sleep. I will go tomorrow, Mei Jie recognize me.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.\"The children are still asleep at half past five. You stay at home, I will go on my own.\" Lin Qing He shook her head.Zhou Qing Bai didn't speak and patted her on the back to signal her to sleep.Early the next morning, Zhou Qing Bai got up quietly. But as soon as he moved, Lin Qing He woke up.\"Sleep, I can get it.\" Zhou Qing Bai coaxed.\"I will go with you. We can come back before the children wake up.\" Lin Qing He shook her head.Seeing that he couldn't dissuade her, Zhou Qing Bai didn't stop her. So he wrapped her up tightly. Lin Qing He had a black thread hanging over her (T/N: basically this \u56e7). However, once she stepped out, she felt a gust of cold air. She felt that she was quite noble, to make such a big sacrifice for this family!\"If you dare to let me down in the future, I will definitely be able to live better than you!\" Lin Qing He harrumphed as she sat behind him, hugging his waist.Zhou Qing Bai: \"... I will not let you down.\" You are my wife. In this life, I'm your most loyal partner and will never betray you.But he wasn't the kind to say love words. These were what he silently vowed in his heart.Zhou Qing Bai's feet were fast. Even with her, the cycling speed was fast and stable. With Lin Qing He, it took him half an hour to reach the slaughterhouse.The departed at 5 o'clock, so it was 5.30 on the dot.Mei Jie was already waiting when they arrived.Lin Qing He got off the bike and quickly uttered, \"Jie, how long have you been waiting here?\"\"Nt long, I just arrived.\" Mei Jie smiled. At the sight of the couple coming, she automatically assumed that both of them were aware of the matter: \"Old Chen said he could get five jins. Both pork belly and loin.\"\"Many thanks, Jie.\" Lin Qing He responded at once. Then she continued: \"Jie, go in and get the meat to show me. Pigtail, pig leg, pork ribs, and the likes, can you see if you can give me some?\"As she spoke, she passed seven yuans.\"OK, wait a bit.\" Mei Jie took her basket and went in. Soon she brought it out.Lin Qing He didn't give many glimpses to it. She accepted it and said, \"Jie, then we'll go back first. The children are still sleeping at home.\"\"Hurry back.\" Mei Jie nodded.Zhou Qing Bai also carried her back.\"You have a good relationship.\" Zhou Qing Bai mentioned.\"It is,\" Lin Qing He replied. She gave Mei Jie a two-jin national food coupon yesterday.A thing like national food coupons was very precious. But they weren't much use to her family. Zhou Qingbai brought a lot of them back. These were the smaller ones. She hadn't taken out the five jin and ten jin ones yet.She'll keep those. She didn\u2019t plan to take them out easily. She wondered if she should open the letter of recommendation and go to the old capital.Why go to the old capital?Naturally for cleaning out her treasure.But now it was too early to talk about this. The children were still young. It was inconvenient to take them for traveling. Wait until they are bigger.\"Do you think what I did was crooked?\" Lin Qing He asked.Zhou Qing Bai shook his head and expressed: \"There is nothing lawless here. It's not like it was reselling.\"Both the kids and adults in the family need to consume oil content. They bought it with money, so how was it unruly.Lin Qing He didn't get comforted by this because she planned to resell in spring next year!\"Let's head back quickly. Don't know if the children at home woke up yet,\" Lin Qing He said.Although he didn't say it, Zhou Qing Bai still felt that his wife had something to worry about.It was only six o'clock when they got home. This season was for winter isolating. Every family didn't get up so early. So the village was completely quiet.\"Were there any dogs retired from your previous work?\" Suddenly, it came to Lin Qing He that the family needed a dog to watch the house.\"We can raise?\" Zhou Qing Bai gazed at her.Lin Qing He felt that he was a little happy. She didn't know what he was happy about, it was only raising a dog. The children were still small, so it was a pretty good idea to raise one.\"Of course, but only if it came from that place. Ordinary dogs don't do anything. I don't plan on getting them.\" Lin Qing He declared.\"There is. Before I came back, Head asked me, but I thought you wouldn't want to raise it and refused. Although it retired due to injury and the leg was a little lame, it is a good hand at guarding home. What's more, it is also loyal to the owner.\" Zhou Qing Bai affirmed.\"Seem like you raised this dog before,\" Lin Qing He struck home with her words.Zhou Qing Bai stared at his wife, he did not expect his wife to be so keen.The dog was indeed his former partner, but like him, he got injured and retired. He should be still there.\"After breakfast, go to the commune to make a call and ask.\" Lin Qing He instructed.She tossed out some pork belly and loin from the space. Some ribs were also taken out. Because it was from Mei Jie, she doesn't have to worry as long as it wasn't too excessive since it came from a known source.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57. The way to raise pigsDon't assumption from how her family seems to eat meat and egg every day. Actually, they didn't.Each time she bought meat, it was only so much. Even if she took out a bit more again, the amount was limited. There was a big man like Zhou Qing Bai at home. How was the meat bought from Mei Jie enough?The same was true for eggs. Every day, she takes out up to six eggs a day to eat.Even like this, the consumption rate was also extremely fast.But compared to the guys in the village, who ate meat a few times a year, her family's life was indeed heavenly.In addition to pork belly and loin, this time she bought a pig's tail, which was stewed with soybeans.There were also three portions of ribs. Knowing that she likes big bones, she was given two.Altogether, these spent seven yuan, which wasn't expensive.Lin Qing He was still very skilled at making bacon. It's been four days after marinating the bacon and the flavor had submerged. She then hung it in the backyard.Da Wa said: \"Mother, is this bacon you made delicious?\"\"Is there anything your mother made that isn't tasty?\" Lin Qing He fired back with raised her eyebrows.Da Wa grinned: \"Everything made by Mother is delicious!\"At least no one in the village had more delicious food than his family!Er Wa started to fixate on this bacon: \"Mother, when can we eat it?\"They all witnessed it. In order to make this meat called bacon, their mother put a lot of ingredients, including sugar!\"It still takes about ten days. So wait.\" Lin Qing He said.In the past few days, the wind and snow have not been small. Lin Qing He answered and picked up San Wa, who was hugging her leg. San Wa uttered: \"Eat meat.\"\"Every day eat meat. Look how much fat you gained, little guy?\" Lin Qing He said with a smile.The pig's tail was stewed a few days ago. These two days were ribs and big bones.Every day there was at least one meal with oil content.Speaking of this, Lin Qing He, who had never married, was really good at raising kids. Look at the three brothers of old Zhou family. Who wouldn't give second look when they go out? They were raised so well by her that no can pick fault.Even more so with Zhou Qing Bai. After returning, Lin Qing He can feel that he seems to be a little fatter, right?Even if he goes out for a run every day, Lin Qing He could still feel that he was really well fed by her. Of course, if he didn\u2019t flirt with her at night, she would have no complaints.From the day before yesterday, when her thing left, she tactfully slept holding San Wa. This made Zhou Qing Bai unable to find an opportunity.This had Zhou Qing Bai feeling powerless.\"Mother, I'm heading over to grandma's place. Grandma said that it would be Laba in a few days. It was time to drink Laba congee.\" Zhou Da Wa announced.\"I know. I'm already preparing. There are all kinds of food at home. I will make you a delicious Laba congee then.\" Lin Qing He said.She carried San Wa back to the room. Now it was warm. The Kang was more comfortable.\"Get on the Kang. Time to write and study,\" Lin Qing He ordered.It was snowing outside now. It had been falling every day for the past few days. It really made people shiver.Zhou Da Wa swiftly went to Kang to study. Zhou Er Wa followed and grabbed the pen and paper to write and draw pictures. As for San Wa, he messed with his eldest brother, then switched to his second brother. He had great pleasure from it.Lin Qing He continued to knit the woolen pant. This woolen pant was knitted for San Wa. Ther elder two had theirs. and weren't afraid of the cold.Once she knitted San Wa's, she will knit one for herself. Although it was certainly not very beautiful, the key point was to keep warm!This weather really made her wish to stay in bed and not get out every day. It was impossible to imagine what kind of courage she had to summon up to cook for the father and sons.\"What is Father doing?\" When he finished his mother's homework and brought it over for his mother to inspect, Zhou Da Wa asked.Lin Qing He examined it once and pointed out two errors. She got him to copy five times before answering: \"I don't know what your father is doing.\"Actually, she knew that Zhou Qing Bai went to the community's Tofu Workshop to get soybean dregs.He was bringing it back to raise pigs. After feeding them for a while, the two little piglets were raised very well and grew a lot.Lin Qing He also had the experience. When she lived with her grandmother before, she heard the neighbor say that raising pig used this. Of course, they had to add cornflour and rice bran and cooked it. The pig loves to eat it very much.So she asked Zhou Qing Bai to get some to try.At this time, there was no such so-called feeding method. Soybean dregs from the Tofu Workshop were used as fertilizer. It was enough for Zhou Qing Bai to bring eggs over.He brought back two sacks of soybean dregs.\"That jin of eggs were exchanged so much soybean dregs?\" Lin Qing He was a little surprised. This can be fed for ten days to half a month.Because they were still piglets, it was time yet for them to gorge.\"They told me to exchange next time.\" Zhou Qing Bai explained like this.This meant that other person was delighted to. But he doesn\u2019t know if the soybean dreg can feed the pigs well. His wife said that she had read it in the book. Zhou Qing Bai trusts her now, so he went to buy a little to try.It was just trying. There won't be any major problems. If it doesn't work out, he can go back to the usual.\"Then exchange it next time,\" Lin Qing He nodded, and then continued, \"Don't let anyone know about this method, otherwise it won't be easy to get food for our pigs!\"\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai was helpless, he didn't know if the piggy would like to eat it.Lin Qing He didn't mind him. This time he also brought two jins of tofu back. Tonight, they'll eat corn mantou and bone and tofu soup.Zhou Qing Bai started experimenting with soybean dregs, rice bran and corn as a feed.Lin Qing He had given him a method of proportion and fermentation, as for the rest, she didn't care. Her method was great, the pig could grow to two hundred jins.In a year, how many jins could the village nurture the pigs to?It can be regarded as an excellent fat pig if it can reach one hundred and twenty or thirty jins. And that took a whole year of effort.If the pigs in her family were raised her way, they can certainly grow to two hundred jins a year. Most importantly was that the piglets don't get sick easily if they ate well.Others in the village also had pigs at home. A while ago, some people had no piglets at all.The two piglets of her family were raised until it was really smooth and glossy.From time to time, Lin Qing He used her memories from her previous life to look at things, so she felt it was normal. But Zhou Qing Bai, a native man, didn't even think it was such a wasteful thing to raise pigs with corn at this time.Although it was only a little scoop, cornmeal was also good grain.Farmers raised pigs by scrubbing the pot with water. Only when they were about to send to the slaughterhouse, they will give a few meals of cornmeal in hope for them to grow meat. As for other times, how can they get such good treatment?However, at Zhou Qing Bai's previous place, there were pigs raise behind their kitchens for their own consumption. They would feed them like this, so Zhou Qing Bai did not feel Lin Qing He being wasteful at all. Instead, he thought her method from the book could be tested.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58. Flying EagleOnce Zhou Qing Bai had finished serving the two piglets and returned inside, Lin Qing He poured him ginger date tea to warm his body and asked, \"When will the dog arrive?\"But when she saw his face, she immediately exclaimed \"You didn't apply the vanishing cream in the morning? \"Zhou Qing Bai said: \"Forgot.\"\"The one day I don't apply it, you forgot? Do you know that your face is like a monkey's butt now!\" Lin Qing He grumbled in irk.\"Monkey's butt.\" Er Wa gave a toothy grin.\"Father's face is a monkey's butt.\" Da Wa laughed out loud.However, with one indifferent glance from Zhou Qing Bai, Da Wa's laughter came to an abrupt halt. Like a duck pinched by its neck, he tottered back into the room.Lin Qing He went to pour some hot water to wipe his face and then smeared the cream on him again\"Let the kids sleep by themselves at night.\" Zhou Qing Bai waited for her to finish and grasped her hand.Meeting his undisguised, heated gaze, Lin Qing He uneasily pretended to be dumb. \"They are only that small. And the weather is too freezing. Let's talk about it in the spring.\"Zhou Qing Bai stared at her, his eyes were serious.Lin Qing He said: \"Can't you think about something besides that every day?\"Zhou Qing Bai let go of her. When Lin Qing He thought he was probably injured by her, she heard him say, \"Then it's settled.\"Lin Qing He's mind, 'Settled? Who agreed with you? Wants to enter my bed? Let alone the door, there are no door seams at all!''\"The dog should be here in two days.\" Zhou Qing Bai replied as he drank the warm ginger date tea.\"Can they recognize this side?\" Lin Qing He said.\"They can ask. It's not difficult to find here.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.ZhouJia Village was certainly easy to find. Zhou Qing Bai's old pal arrived in the evening on the next day.The first dog brought to the house. Lin Qing He asked Zhou Qing Bai what his name was. Zhou Qing Bai said that he was called Fei Ying (Flying Eagle). Although his feet were a bit lame now, in the past he was the fastest, so he lived up to its name.Lin Qing He liked him very much., while the three brothers adored it even more.Fei Ying was so excited when he saw Zhou Qing Bai, whom he was familiar with. He felt the same scent as Zhou Qing Bai on the kids and also displayed care toward them.Yes, it was care. Lin Qing He can feel this word from Fei Ying's attitude towards Da Wa and his brothers.This was a specially trained, very spiritual wolfhound.\"It must have been a lot of trouble for Wang Dage. You can't go tonight. You have to stay and rest for one night. The snow is too heavy. I will ask Qing Bai to take you to the county city to catch the bus tomorrow morning.\" Lin Qing He expressed.Wang Chuan agreed with a smile. He felt that Lin Qing He sincerely wanted to keep him, so he didn't act reserved.He had a life and death bond with Zhou Qing Bai. This time he heard the phone call he made and volunteered to come over.In fact, he was worried that his brother was having a bad time at home, so he wanted to take this opportunity to come and check.But now it seems that he's suspicion was pointless. There was no complaint with Old Zhou's wife.Lin Qing He made three solid dishes that night. She came over to the next room, the kids' room to eat. It was very warm with the Kang burning.One was stewed pork loin with potatoes, stewed pork belly and starch noodle, and a plate of braised pork. This was pre-ordered. This morning Zhou Qing Bai headed over to collect from Mei Jie\u2019s husband, Chen Dage. His old friend was expected to be almost here, so they had to prepare meat .Not only meat but also wine. Lin Qing He took the sated kids and left the table to Zhou Qing Bai and his brother.\"Seeing my sister-in-law this virtuous, I feel relieved. You don't know how much we worry about you.\" After Lin Qing He left, Wang Chuan dared to speak his mind.Zhou Qing Bai shook his head: \"Don't worry about me. Everything is fine at home.\"\"Now that I have seen it, what am I still worried about? Haha, come and have a drink with me!\" Wang Chuan grinned broadly.The two men clinked glasses and toasted. Then they ate up all the remaining dishes. The two demolished the whole bottle of liquor.Lin Qing He made two cups of honey water, and then told them each to sleep. That night Zhou Qing Bai slept with Wang Chuan next door. Lin Qing He was disgusted with his body full of alcohol smell and drove him out, not giving him a chance to drunkenly make an advance on her.Early the next morning, Lin Qing He got up and steamed the mantou and cooked a shrimp soup. She then let Zhou Qing Bai and Wang Chuan eat before allowing Zhou Qing Bai to send Wang Chuan away.Heading out so early in the morning, he came back after nine o'clock.When Zhou Qing Bai came back, he saw that the pigs in his family had been fed. Fei Ying was sated too and was in the middle of being touched and played by the kids. Once he saw Zhou Qing Bai returned, Fei Ying wagged his tail.\"Dad, is Fei Ying adapted to his nest?\" Er Wa asked.\"Er Wa wanted to take Fei Ying into the room to sleep.\" Da Wa frankly stated.Er Wa didn't speak, only touched Fei Ying, and looked at his father with his small eyes.\"Sleep with me!\" San Wa simply overbearingly announced.\"You wish.\" Er Wa rolled his eyes in response.\"Hit you!\" San Wa said as he intended to beat him. But he wasn't Er Wa's opponent. With one push from Er Wa, he fell.This kid was also resilient. After falling, he climbed back up without crying.\"Got on the bus?\" Lin Qing He turned to Zhou Qing Bai, unconcerned about the brothers. It was normal for boys and brothers to fight and play among themselves. And she would not interfere as long as it was not out of line.\"En.\" Zhou Qing Bai's eyes were locked on her.Lin Qing He can read the meaning from his eyes. This man was expressing his gratitude to her. What gratitude? Maybe it was her respectful performance last night, or her getting up early this morning to make breakfast for them?\"Continue to sleep next door tonight.\" Lin Qing He rebuffed as she lifted her chin.Zhou Qing Bai paid no heeds to her and took Fei Ying with the boys to the village and walked around.Don't be mislead by Fei Ying's lame, he was a first-class home watcher. An adult man may not be as alert as he was. With him here, Lin Qing He can sleep peacefully if Zhou Qing Bai wasn't at home.Old Zhou family soon received the news. They heard that a big wolfhound was being raised. Eldest Brother and his brother all came over to take a look.Having one more child in the family was already difficult to raise during this time, let alone a dog.\"This dog is really good.\" Eldest Brother examined and couldn't help sing praise.Second Brother and Third Brother were in agreement. With this dog here, would anyone dare to act presumptuously?Just by his look, all of them felt a bit panic, because this dog's gaze directed at them wasn't friendly.\"He's called Fei Ying!\" Da Wa announced.\"That's right. Don't call him dog. That's a scolding word. Fei Ying has a name!\" Er Wa added.\"Fei Ying.\" This was San Wa, who held onto Fei Ying without intention to let go.The three brothers took Fei Ying out for a stroll, which attracted the envy of the children in the village. Not to mention the children, the teens also fell in love at sight.Even if the leg is a bit lame, Fei Ying was still very strong. Only because the frontline forbade any flaw, so Fei Ying had no chance to go back into action again.Da Ge: Big brotherIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59. Who's bullying whoEldest Brother, Second Brother, and Third Brother had seen it for themselves, so they went back.Mother Zhou didn't come over in person. She inquired about it from them.\"That dog is top-notch. If there is one, our family should also raise a one. It's superb at watching the house.\" Third Brother honestly stated.The dog was so astute that it seems to understand human words.\"Raise what dog in our home? It sounds good to have a dog at Fourth's side,\" said Mother Zhou after hearing that dog was really up to the mark.Although keeping dogs costs food, the key point was that it's able to guard the home.Old Fourth was the only man in his house. No one dared to go wild before he retired, but now that he had retired, men can't be lacking in the family.Although Da Wa and his brothers were all sons, they were still very young and can't help out much. As for Fourth's wife, can't really count on her. So it was a good idea to keep a dog at home.Mother Zhou concurred on this point.For this reason, she visited it in person after having lunch. With Fei Ying, Mother Zhou couldn't even enter the door. She shouted for Da Wa and Er Wa as she was internally satisfied with Fei Ying's performance.\"Grandma is here.\"Da Wa came out with a mouthful of oil.At noon, sweet potatoes were cooked, accompanied by stewed meat and starch flour. He was very content with his meal.\"Fei Ying, this is grandma. Own family.\" Da Wa said to Fei Ying. Only then Fei Ying retreated to let Mother Zhou go in.\"Quite excellent.\" Mother Zhou was very satisfied.\"That's of course, Fei Ying is very smart.\" Da Wa puffed out, then turned to Fei Ying: \"Fei Ying, go back and eat.\"Mother Zhou saw that Fei Ying's bowl turned out to be a new porcelain bowl, and what's more, contained meat congee!Mother Zhou's eyes widened at once: \"Fei Ying eating this?\"\"Yeah, Fei Ying just arrived. He got to have a good meal.\" Da Wa didn't care.He was delighted to give Fei Ying a good meal.Mother Zhou mentally remarked, 'good meal? People don't get to eat as well as a dog!'Rice and lean meat congee!Mother Zhou came in. Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai were eating sweet potatoes with Er Wa and San Wa. Served with the sweet potatoes, was a plate of stewed meat and starch noodle, which tasted very good.\"Mother, have you eaten yet?\" Lin Qing He greeted.\"I came here after eating.\" Mother Zhou said.\"Da Wa, go fetch a stool for your grandma to sit.\" Lin Qing He instructed.Da Wa brought over a stool: \"Grandma, please sit down.\"Mother Zhou sat down and mentioned, \"Is Feiying eating rice and lean meat congee?\"Lin Qing He said: \"Mother, ask your son. He gave it. I didn't get to eat it myself.\"With this, she reflected Mother Zhou's words. Obviously, she was the one who cooked it, but when pushing the blame, she had no pressure.Zhou Qing Bai looked at his mother and said, \"When Fei Ying was followed me, he saved me twice. Mother, don't feel remorse for this rice.\"How could Mother Zhou know about this reason?Even if she knew now, she still doesn't think a dog needs to be fed meat.\"I don't feed him meat often. It's just one or two meats.\" Zhou Qingbai said.Isn't one or two meat still meat? Your Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law are currently pregnant and they still don't get meat!But toward her youngest old son, Mother Zhou said nothing. Just uttered: \"You need to be more prudent to live life. Future days will be long.\"\"I know, Mother. Don't worry.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Mother Zhou didn't stay long. After a while, she left.Only then Zhou Qing Bai directed his gaze to his wife.Lin Qing He felt it was natural: \"You will have to deal with such things in the future. Unless you don't want to have peaceful days.\"Once again, Zhou Qing Bai realized that another side of his wife, clever and cunning, like a fox that had been refined into a fine one.Lin Qing He was full after eating three sweet potatoes and drank some congee soup. The tableware and chopsticks were handed over to him to wash. She continued to go back to knitting trousers.At the same time, she was slightly depressed. There was no way. She hadn't confessed to Zhou Qing Bai about selling meat. According to her understanding of Zhou Qing Bai, he will never let her do this.But she had a space. How can she be willing to let go of such a good opportunity to make money? And she was idle, might as well find something for herself to do, right?It was a good distance away, but with a bicycle, it was more convenient now. Also, it won't hinder her cooking too.However, Zhou Qing Bai's temperament will certainly not allow it.This made Lin Qing He troubled.Unknown to her entanglement, Zhou Qing Bai returned from scrubbing the tableware. Now the kids have Fei Ying, they are eager to play with Fei Ying. So they won't come to disturb them.Lin Qing He watched him come over and sit next to her like he wanted to have a good chat with her.\"Tell me if something is up.\" Lin Qing He glanced at him and harrumphed.Zhou Qing Bai actually wanted to nurture feeling with his wife. Although she took good care of his clothes, food, housing, and transportation, he always felt that there was something missing.She seemed to be hiding from him. He didn't understand why she was hiding. At the end of the day, they got three children.Although the days of his return in the past few years don't add up to a month, there was no barrier between husband and wife. He will definitely make it up to her in the future.\"Wife, you are worried about something.\" Zhou Qing Bai gazed at her.Lin Qing He threw a glance at him, thinking, 'my worry is because of you.'While her mouth said: \"I eat and drink well now. My sons are sensible and my man got tenacity. What do I have to worry about\"These were angry words.\"Don't direct your irritation toward yourself, you can blow it up at me,\" Zhou Qing Bai stated seriously.Lin Qing He denied: \"There's no irritation. Don't disturb me. Go busy yourself. If you have nothing to do, then go up the mountain to see if you can hunt a wild rabbit.\"\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai sighed and headed out.Lin Qing He glimpsed at him. Zhou Qing Bai stood there unmoving, waiting for her to speak. Lin Qing He stared at him, her expression saying 'why are you standing there for? Weren't you leaving?'Then Zhou Qing Bai went out. Judging by his back, he was a bit depressed.Lin Qing He remarked in exasperation: \"Acting like I was bullying you. Don't know who bullied who!\"He probably knew that she was in a bad mood because of him. Although he didn't know where he made a mistake, Zhou Qing Bai went up the mountain in the hope to bring something good back home.Probably it was heaven's doing, as he actually caught a big rabbit.It was about four jins. This weight was really heavy for a rabbit in this era. But if it were caught in the wheat field during the summer or autumn harvest, the rabbit can weigh about six or seven jins. That's what they call a fat rabbit!But they weren't easy to catch.This rabbit was made into a pot of braised rabbit meat by Lin Qing He. The whole family had eaten until their heart's content.Lin Qing He's depression was also eaten into her stomach, so her mood improve.Well, when she was sleeping at night, she still didn't plan to stick with him.She held San Wa as she slept on the other side. Clearly indicating to him to sleep with Da Wa and Er Wa.Zhou Qing Bai sighed in his heart. His wife still wasn't going to let it drop.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60. Behave like the family headIn a flash, it was Laba festival.Lin Qing He was prepared to cook Laba congee. She got up early in the morning to make it. Once the kids were up, a large pot of Laba congee was ready.Fragant and sweet glutinous.But the sweetness was only moderate. She doesn't like to eat sweetness too much, so she didn't put much sugar.Once the Laba congee was ready, Lin Qing He immediately scooped out a large bowl and got Zhou Qing Bai to deliver it to the old Zhou's house.She dared to guarantee that the Laba congee she made was the most delicious. There were lots of ingredients as well as sweet. So how can it not taste good?Old Zhou's house also cooked theirs on that side, but it was casually made. It was enough to go through the motion. So naturally, it couldn't be compared to the one sent by Lin Qing He.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou didn't have a bite. They shared a mouthful between the grandsons below. As for the granddaughters, they got none.\"There's really no words for how Fourth Sister-in-law live.\" Second Sister-in-law remarked at the smell of sweet Laba congee eaten by the children.It goes without saying, her tone was a little sour.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law made no comment. That was because Third Sister-in-law currently had no son, so her daughter also had some. After eating the other's Laba congee and talked bad about the other. That was something Thrid Sister-in-law couldn't do.The same goes for Eldest Sister-in-law. She looked at Third Sister-in-law's belly and said, \"How are you feeling?\"Third Sister-in-law's stomach was already very big. It should be due any day now.\"Should be soon,\" replied Third Sister-in-law.She can feel it herself. She should be about to give birth soon.Mother Zhou had Laba congee before coming over to talk to Lin Qing He about it. When she came, Lin Qing He was eating with Zhou Qing Bai and the kids.The boys were clearly overjoyed. This Laba congee was really delicious.Inside were coarse rice, sticky rice, white polished rice, millet, peanuts, red beans, chestnuts and red dates, with white sugar and brown sugar added. It was especially yummy.The brothers were satisfied after drinking it up.Even Zhou Qing Bai also liked his wife's craft.In fact, since he came back, Lin Qing He had never let him ate terribly during the three meals a day. Which meal didn't leave him fulfilled?The only thing that made him helpless was that his wife barred him from joining her in the quilt. This was torture. He hoped that one day he would be free from his sentence.\"Mother, have you eaten yet?\" Lin Qing He greeted.\"I have. Don't mind me. Enjoy your meal,\" said Mother Zhou.Even so, Lin Qing He went in and brought another bowl out. She scooped a bowl for Zhou Mother and had let her sit down and eat together.Mother Zhou was pleased with Fourth's wife's current attitude. Although her habit of spending money can't be corrected, it had to be said that her care towards her man and children beat everyone else.Mother Zhou sat down and ate with them. She brought up Third Sister-in-law's matter.\"There's no problem on my side. I'll just go and give a head up.\" Lin Qing He confirmed.\"I'll give you the money first,\" Mother Zhou said.Lin Qing He darted a glance at Zhou Qingbai and saw him say nothing, so she accepted it, \"Trotters don't need that much. When the time comes, I will buy some meat for Third Sister-in-law as well. Got to ea some meat during post-natal confinement.\"Mother Zhou gave five yuan.\"Up to you.\" Mother Zhou nodded.Originally, the meat will be divided again at the end of the year. But that wasn't definite. If her diet was bad now, she may not be able to have breastmilk even if she eats meat after giving birth.Lin Qing He gets it, so on the morning of La Shi(two days later) when the sun had yet to rise, Zhou Qing Bai hopped on the bike and brought five jins of fatty meat, six trotters and three jins of pork belly back. There were a few pork ribs and a pigtail as well.As for Lin Qing He, she was still snoozing.In the beginning, she wanted to go, but Zhou Qing Bai refused and had her sleep a little longer. Lin Qing He didn't act demure and naturally let him go alone.The things that were brought back was up to Lin Qing He to distribute.Lin Qing He divided old Zhou Family's share according to the quantity of five yuans. She arranged two pounds of fatty meat and two trotters with the remaining four were kept by her own children. She also set aside one jin of pork belly and one position of rib for them.This was in line with five yuans worth.And this was in the countryside standard. If it was a black market in the city, you can't buy so much for five dollars.Lin Qing He packed these things into a basket and grabbed some seaweed. Then she delivered them to the old Zhou's house. She'll check on Third Sister-in-law on the way as well.Third Sister-in-law's stomach was really big. Lin Qing He became a little bit terrified from the sight. Fortunately, she didn't need to give birth again, otherwise she couldn't imagine it.\"The two pig trotters I brought will be eaten after birth. The fatty meat and pork belly are also bought according to the money given by Mother. Ask Eldest Sister-in-law to stew rib with the seaweed into a soup for you. This is what I given you. You can eat it all by yourself.\" Lin Qing He clarified.Then to Eldest Sister-in-law, who was present, she continued: \"When Eldest Sister-in-law is about to give birth, I will buy it for you too.\"She still had a lot of affinity for these two Sisters-in-law. So she expressed it to them at a time like this. It was also a display of handling relationships, right?\"No need. It's quite expensive.\" Eldest Sister-in-law smiled.\"It's only just this one time, so it won't cost much.\" Lin Qing He insisted.When Lin Qing He went back, Third Sister-in-law expressed: \"Da Wa's mother is becoming more and more like a family head.\"\"It's wonderful.\" Eldest Sister-in-law nodded in agreement.Eldest Sister-in-law mentioned Lin Qing He's additional rib for Third Sister-in-law in front of everyone during breakfast. Mainly for Second Sister-in-law, to prevent her from nagging about Third Sister-in-law having a private stove.Second Sister-in-law was verbally silent, but her face was pretty twisted. When she was pregnant before, why didn't she see Lin Qing He do anything?Now she sends a rib to Third's wife. Although the ribs don't have much meat, still there's a saying that anything with oil is a good thing. Who doesn't want a free rib?But the rest of the old Zhou family didn't say anything, same for the Zhou brothers. They just felt that Fourth's wife know how to behave now.Lin Qing He doesn't want to get involved with old Zhou Family's matter too much. She had no idea that Zhou Qing Bai likes to eat pigtails?Lin Qing He stewed the pigtails with soybeans. She drank some soup and ate nothing else.The boys never refuse what was given. They chewed quite joyously. Zhou Qing Bai ate most of it.As for the big fatty meat, she cut it into small pieces and cooked it into lard. The remaining oil residue ended up becoming a filling. Mixed with fried eggs and cabbage as a filling, it was wrapped within a bun dough.Because there was a big eater like Zhou Qing Bai at home, Lin Qing He went all out. The weather was still freezing, she won\u2019t be afraid of spoiling even when she made a lot. It was really convenient, whenever they want to eat, they can just steam up and make some soup on the stove.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61. White-eyed wolfDuring this kind of winter day, there was basically nothing to do.Lin Qing He had already knitted pants for the kids and herself. As for Zhou Qing Bai, there was no need. He said he wasn't used to wearing it, so Lin Qing He didn't knit one for him.Taking advantage of the good weather, Lin Qing He decided to return to old Lin Family for fault finding and put San Wa under Zhou Qing Bai's care.She planned for this day for so long.Once she reached old Lin's House, Lin Qing He bumped into her Second Sister-in-law.\"Yo, younger Guzi is finally willing to come back ah. I thought younger Guzi wasn't going to come back to the maternal family this year!\" Second Sister-in-law Lin enigmatically remarked.\"Why won't I come back to my own maternal family? This maternal family is my root. No matter where I go I won't forget it ah!\" Lin Qing He cheerfully responded.\"Younger Guzi, why are you coming back to maternal family empty-handed this time?\" Second Sister-in-law Lin gave a quick scan and snorted.\"What? So when you return to your maternal family, you carry big and small packages? Believe me, my mother would break your leg if she found out.\" Lin Qing He unsmilingly smiled.Second Sister-in-law Lin's face sank. She harrumphed before storming back in.Lin Qing He won't nurture her bad habits. Mother Lin came out due to voices outside. Eldest Sister-in-law Lin and Third Sister-in-law Lin also followed her out.Shouldn't have called her Third older sister-in-law, as she was younger sister-in-law. (T/N: younger in rank as she was her younger brother's wife)\"No peace once you returned. What are you coming back for?\" Mother Lin grumpily muttered.\"Oh, I must say, Mother, are you displeased that I'm empty-handed and no big and small packages at sight? The last time I returned, you didn't have this tone.\" Lin Qing He straightforwardly pointed out.No need to suspect. Today, she came here to pick faults, so her speech won't be reserved.Mother Lin felt she lost face, scolded: \"What are you saying? Did I tell you to bring things back? You did it willingly. So why are you resenting me for?\"\"Enough. I won't squabble with you over other matters. Zhou Qing Bai has retired from the army, so in the future, we have no income. Our family still has three kids to raise. It's fine if the adult starves but the kids have to eat. Since I brought so much money and things back home, shouldn't my maternal family support me a bit now that the family situation turned bad?\" Lin Qing He simply stated.These words had Mother Lin, Eldest Sister-in-law Lin, and Third Sister-in-law Lin were taken aback.They weren't shocked by Zhou Qing Bai's retirement, but by Lin Qing He, this daughter/Guzi, actually daring to request this.Old Lin Family had long received news about Zhou Qing Bai's retirement. They thought Lin Qing He would have already caused a scene but there was no message about her for a while now.Putting aside this, she actually came back this time to take back the thing she gave her maternal family.Doesn't she want face the most?She actually dared to open her mouth on this kind of matter?\"I say, Guzi, you know what kind of situation old Lin Family is in. Our family can't even fill our stomachs. So what can we give you?\" Second Sister-in-law Lin stepped out of the room after hearing her words and responded at once.\"Second Sister-in-law is really funny. You clearly knew that Qing Bai retired and you still ask me why I bought nothing back just now. Also, how are you unable to fill your stomach? Old Lin Family is well off, while my family is at the brink of falling apart. Mother, I'm your and father's biological daughter. Now life is getting worse, can't you give me some money?\" Lin Qing He pleaded.\"How can you have no money? Guzhang got retirement fund after he retired!\" Second Sister-in-law gritted her teeth.\"That's right Guzi. Guzhang retired due to injury, he can still bring money home.\" Eldest Sister-in-law threw in.In the past, when things were brought back, she didn't much of a share. Now she wants to take it from the family, she won't agree as it was related to her.Third Sister-in-law Lin remained silent.\"Money? What money? Do you know what Zhou Qing Bai did? He gave his money to his friend, whose family condition was worse. Do you know how strained our relationship after we argued? He's not willing to take back. And you know what kind of temperament I have. If our family condition really wasn't terrible, I wouldn't come back to ask for money!\" Lin Qing He uttered.\"What terrible family condition? You even bought a bike and it's completely new!\" Second Brother Lin came out. On him was Zhou Qing Bai's new military coat.At this glimpse of this, Lin Qing He wished she could whip the original owner. Such a good quality military coat was given to a white-eyed wolf, how blind can she be?\"The bike was bought for me with the last bit of money Zhou Qing Bai had. Why else do you think I stopped fighting with him?\" Lin Qing He sneered.She didn't put any hope on the bicycle being concealed. After all, having a bicycle in the house in these days was comparable to having a modern sports car in the modern house.She didn't cycle here today, she came on foot!Everyone came to a realization. No wonder there was no trouble, it turned out that he bought her such a bicycle with the last sum of money at home.\"You have money to buy a bicycle, but no money to raise children?\" Mother Lin said with a blackened face.It was indeed a dark expression. This girl was always ignorant. She had always been picky about this and that. But Mother Lin never expected her to waste money like this.It was the last sum of money. Instead of saving it, she bought a bicycle. Can this be bought back for dinner?\"Ain't that right. At this time, you're still dead set on keeping face. In this case, why do you come back to maternal family for money? With so many people in the maternal family, don't we still need to live?\"In the past, she sucked up to this Guzi. But now the feng shui turns, her man got demoted and the family's money was spent. From now on, she'll be facing the earth with her back toward the sky. Who was nobler than the other?\"I used to treat old Lin Family so well. Now that my life isn't working out, you are doing this to me?\" Lin Qing He stared in disbelief at these relatives and uttered.\"Hurry back and live your life.\" Second Brother Lin dismissively waved his hand.\"Lin Qing Xi, isn't it time for you to return the military coat to me!\" Lin Qing He fixated at him.\"This is what you gave to your second brother. Is there any logic in taking back what you have given?\" Second Sister-in-law Lin immediately stepped in.\"I couldn't bear your fanaticism at that time, so gave it to him, Lin Qing Xi. I had intended to give it to my younger brother!\" Lin Qing He snorted coldly: \"I really didn't see it before. My own maternal family what has this kind of virtue. Alright, I have fallen down. Not only do you not give a lending hand but also spectate with cold eyes? From now on, I don't want this maternal family. Don't ask me to come back for the funeral when you die in the future! \"With this, she angrily stormed away.It had Mother Lin enraged: \"This wretched mouth! She wants to curse me and her father!\"Eldest Sister-in-law Lin and Third Sister-in-law Lin act like mute. Third Sister-in-law Lin looked at Second Brother Lin's military coat before turning to go back in.Father Lin had not come out of the house, but apparently, he heard it all.As for Eldest Brother Lin and Third Brother Lin, they had gone up the mountain with the intention to see if there were any wild animals to catch.When Eldest Brother Lin got back and heard that this, he had nothing to say.

    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62. Inflexible Stinky Man\"I'm warning you, we can't provoke this sister of yours, better to hide. You can't intervene in her matters, you hear?\" Third Sister-in-law Lin immediately commanded.In the past, her man had carried firewood or whatnot for her, but the military coat still ended up in the second branch's possession and not her man. Third Brother Lin didn't mind about this, while Third Sister-in-law Lin was mad.\"How can I intervene? I have no money.\" Third Brother Lin expressed.\"Some time ago you went to work as a small worker, that wages should be paid?\" Third Sister-in-law brought up.\"The day after tomorrow.\" Third Brother Lin replied.Third Sister-in-law Lin counted the days. Once Third Brother Lin gets the money, she'll take it straight away.\"Are you sure there are only two yuans?\" Third Sister-in-law eyed him.\"It included lunch. If not, then it won't be two yuans.\" Third Brother Lin retorted grumpily.Third Sister-in-law Lin didn't say anything. Third Brother Lin said he wanted to go to the mountains to test his luck. Now he was idle at home, his wife didn't stop him.Third Brother Lin came to find Lin Qing He. Lin Qing He had already thrown the trip to the old Lin family two days ago to settle the accounts to the back of her mind.She didn't plan to go back and make a large fuss. That was just a reminder to let old Lin's family know they can't make any demand from her. There was no way now.When she came back, she tossed this matter to the side and never thought about it.She didn't anticipate that Third Brother Lin would come over.Lin Qing He came out and saw him. She blandly spoke: \"Why are you here? Did you not hear from your wife? Now my family is poorly off, aren't you afraid of being clutched onto by us, poor relatives by coming here?\"\"This was earned by me as a small worker some time ago. Sister, please take it and use it sparingly. Don't be as extravagant as before.\" Third Brother Lin took two yuans out of his pocket, paying no heeds to her words.A total of four yuans. He gave his wife two dollars and the rest were here.Lin Qing He was taken aback from the two yuans given by him. Then she put it away. Looking at him, she remarked, \"I haven't dote you before for nothing.\"Although the original owner's dote was only verbally, the actual thing was benefitted by the white-eyed wolf, Second Brother Lin.Third Brother Lin coaxed: \"Jiefu is a good man. Sister, you got to harmoniously live with Jiefu. He can support you.\"\"I know. I will. Come in and drink some ginger soup to warm your body.\" Lin Qing He said.\"No need. I'm going back now.\" Third Brother Lin shook his head. He left without entering the house.When Lin Qing He sent him out, only Er Wa and San Wa were in the house. Da Wa and his father went up the mountain to see if they can chance upon any wild game.But this time, he didn't catch anything. When the father and son returned, their hands were empty.Er Wa told his father that Xiaojiu had just come by and stuffed money over to his mother. That's right, he saw it.Zhou Qing Bai nodded in acknowledgment. That night during bedtime, he waited for the children to fall asleep before he asked Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He gave a brief recount of old Lin family's reaction, \"I never expected that my only younger brother has a conscience.\"Zhou Qing Bai felt powerless. What exactly does his wife want to do by doing this? Will she still connect with her maternal family in the future?\"I used to have my head submerged in pig oil. That's why I help out that group of white-eyed wolves. Not happening anymore. It's useless to have such relatives. I am too lazy to bother about them.\" Lin Qing He declared.\"Don't become angry because of these matters.\" Zhou Qing Bai coaxed.\"I'm not angry,\" Lin Qing He turned to him. \"What is there to be angry about. I did it intentionally. They're lucky if they didn't get angered by me.\"Zhou Qing Bai perceived that his wife wasn't affected by this, otherwise, she wouldn't have said nothing after returning.\"Wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai put his hand on her waist and lowered his voice.The underlying invitation was obvious. In the last few days, she slept with him like this. The children had slept on one side, which was his doing after she dozed off. She saw that he didn't do anything and let him be.And she hadn't solved the problem of reselling pork. At the thought of this, she felt like suffocating from agitation. This inflexible man, don't even think about it.\"If you can't sleep, go to one side to sleep.\" Lin Qing He harrumphed.\"Oh.\" Zhou Qing Bai just hugged her, and his sigh sounded out above her head.\"What are you sighing for!\" Lin Qing He uttered.Now they have a good life, he should be content. When the original owner was here, there were no peaceful days. Why was he sighing with her?\"Wife, we are husband and wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.There was a hint of grievance in his voice.He was a grown man holding his wife and can't do anything. If it wasn't torture, then what was? He was a normal man. How can he sit still when a warm jade(soft, delicate woman) was in his embrace. Impossible.This person in his arms wasn't anyone else, it was his wife, who had three sons with him. Wasn't it normal for him to want to know more about her?But she refused.\"If we weren't, do you think you could hold me to sleep?\" Lin Qing He retorted.She did have feelings for Zhou Qing Bai and also had husband and wife status. But so what? Can't she be unconventional and not give herself to him?For each day her pork resale hadn't been settled, he doesn't get to eat meat one more day.\"It's just holding.\" Zhou Qing Bai said sullenly.\"Do you want to hold your son to sleep?\" Lin Qing He responded.Zhou Qing Bai didn't speak anymore and hugged her even tighter. Lin Qing He ignored him and planned to sleep. Zhou Qing Bai said: \"When?\"\"What when?\" Lin Qing He found it was quite comfortable in his arms. Warm, and extraordinarily muscular. His body smelled good. It was probably the smell of so-called male pheromones.\"When will you agree.\" Zhou Qing Bai uttered hoarsely.Can't keep him waiting limitless. He won't be able to stand it, so he had to ask for a deadline. If it keeps on going, it'll be inhumane life.\"I say, why you are pinned on this matter all the time? Can't you think about other things?\" Lin Qing He voiced out.\"The pigs at home are nurtured well. In the spring of next year, we'll get some chicks. Next year, I will work to earn points. Our family will be fine.\" Zhou Qing Bai remarked.This meant that they don't have to be anxious about their family's future. It will be great.So if he doesn't focus on bed matter, what does he think about?Lin Qing He took the opportunity to say: \"What can we do with just your work points and these two pigs? Think of something else to make money.\"\"Do you have an idea?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked.Lin Qing He hesitated before blurting out, \"I have something to discuss with you.\" It should be time.\"Speak.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Lin Qing He threw light on the matter of getting meat from Mei Jie while paying her commission and she goes to the black market in the county town for resale. As anticipated, once the plan was out of the bag, it was rejected by Zhou Qing Bai without hesitation.Lin Qing He flipped over in frustration and ignored the inflexible, stinky man.Jie Fu: Elder Sister's husbandXiao Jiu: Mother's younger brotherIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63. Seeking Trouble\"There's still a lot of money at home. Coupons too. Sufficient to use is enough. Don't take the risk.\" It dawned on Zhou Qing Bai why his wife always seems to be in a dilemma for a while now.He hadn't known was that she was planning such a matter like fraudulent purchase and resale.\"I didn\u2019t say our family\u2019s money wasn't enough. Since I'm idle, I might as well. And also I would bring a basket. If someone asked me, I would say I'm going to the city to visit relatives and brought some meat over. It\u2019s not a long-term job. Only once every few days. I'm just earning one or two yuans to help out with the family expenses. Is this still not alright?\" Since Lin Qing He had brought it out into the open, she didn't plan to tuck it.\"Three thousand yuans is enough to spend,\" Zhou Qing Bai assured.That's right, it meant he still wasn't agreeing.Lin Qing He kicked him angrily and declared, \"You sleep more outside. The sight of you makes me annoyed!\"Don't expect her to be virtuous and virtuous. She was such a woman, can't stop acting up. Discontent? Well, bear it!Zhou Qing Bai didn\u2019t move, he still hugged her like that. Frustrated, Lin Qing He pulled on his face, stating: \"I have said it already. I can implement this confidently. What's more, you have connections in the city. If something happens to me, you can pull me out. \"Zhou Qing Bai raised an eyebrow. Although he didn't speak, Lin Qing He understood what he meant. How did she know?\"Such a big bicycle like can't be bought without a reservation for a year and a half. Zhou Qing Bai, are you treating me as a fool, or do you think I'm stupid?\" Lin Qing He said flatly as she pulled his cheek.Zhou Qing Bai allowed her to pull but maintained his stance.Of course, he knows people. Over at the county city, he got an old buddy who had power. The bicycle was also sorted out with his help.As she said, if something really was to happen, he could indeed get her out in a whole piece.But still, how could he allow her to do this?Lin Qing He saw that he still didn't budge despite what she said. Finally, she angrily carried Er Wa over to sleep with him, while she joined Da Wa and San Wa.The next day, Er Wa woke up and found out that he was sleeping with his father. He was sure he slept with San Wa in his arms last night.\"From now on, you will sleep with your father. Your brother too. Both of you will sleep with him.\" Lin Qing He harrumphed and brought San Wa over to herself.Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her. Lin Qing He felt it, turned to him, and then glared back.Obviously, Zhou Qing Bai wasn't going to compromise so easily on this matter, even if it meant he couldn't eat his wife's juicy meat.Zhou Qing Bai saw nothing wrong with buying meat for his own family because as it was reasonable.But if his wife wants to make fraudulent purchases and resale, how can Zhou Qing Bai agree?As for eating his wife's meat, he'll plan again. Anyway, he will not fall for the beauty trap.Lin Qing He snorted when she saw through him. Let's see how long you can hold back!Offending Lin Qing He was obviously a bad idea because Lin Qing He does not punish, she will be more ruthless. What ruthless method?She started to ask around where to buy mutton. She wanted to buy mutton back to give him a big supplement! (T/N: Rely on its aphrodisiac effect)During this time, mutton wasn't so easy to procure. Zhou Qing Bai had connections in the county city, so he was able to buy those muttons last time. While for her, it wasn't possible to buy it.Lin Qing He didn\u2019t give up. She went all out when cooking for Zhou Qing Bai at home. In addition to the oil residue, egg, and cabbage buns, there were trotters stewed with peanuts, braised pork accompanied by rice, and various soups. She also dressed herself beautifully and fragrantly.Even San Wa couldn't help but hug her to express that mother was sweet-smelling!Da Wa and Er Wa bobbed their head in agreement, their mother was really fragrant.The fragrance on Lin Qing He's body was indeed fragrant, but it was a faint fragrance. Not overpowering. It was a refreshing kind.The children could sense it, so how could Zhou Qing Bai not smell it. He knew that his wife was deliberately seducing him and purposely gave him delicacies so that he would yearn for her at night. On the surface, he was able to withstand and not express anything at all.If she hadn't seen him fumbled up late at night and changed his underwear, she would have thought that her charm had dropped.Lin Qing He almost laughed out loud when she saw him get up to change his underwear. Somehow, she refrained and continued to pretend to be asleep. Then she felt his movement.He immediately placed Er Wa who slept like a pig to the inside. Afterward, he came to share the quilt with her and hugged her to continue sleeping.Because he was just sleeping and did nothing else, Lin Qing He pretended to not know.The next day, before anything can be said, she heard that Third Sister-in-law gave birth.\"That fast?\"Surprised, Lin Qing He blurted.It was only one night.\"It was quite fast.\" Mother Zhou, who came to report joyous news, grinned. This time Third Sister-in-law gave birth to a son. The whole family was thrilled.\"Is the trotters I bought last time still frozen?\" Lin Qing He mentioned.\"It's still frozen,\" Zhou Mother nodded.They had their customs here. There was no rule that the mother can't have visitors after giving birth. Currently, the air was cold and the ground was freezing, Lin Qing He felt it wasn't suitable to go over and disturb. So she gave Mother Zhou a jin of brown sugar and stated: \"Mother, bring this over to Third Sister-in-law. \"Mother Zhou persuaded her to keep it: \"There's still some at home. Third Sister-in-law hadn't consumed much of what you gave last time. Keep it, there's enough.\"\"I don't have anything else to give. Mother, take it.\" Lin Qing He handed it to her.Mother Zhou stopped refusing then.Once the first three days passed, Lin Qing He went over.She chatted with Third Sister-in-law. This time, Third Sister-in-law's milk was more adequate. What's more, she gave birth to a son. Fourth Sister-in-law gifted brown sugar again, which displayed enough well-wishing.\"Look, aren't I right? Dong Dong's skin will definitely be better when he grows up. It's beneficial to eat more apples.\" Lin Qing He peeked at the sleeping child and pointed out.\"It is whiter than his sister at that time.\" Third Sister-in-law grinned.Now this one had a son, everything looked merry.Having a son, she'll be able to stand straight in the future and never feel shorter than others.It was like this in rural areas. Ten daughters can't be compared to one son, even though daughters were often more sensible and obedient than their sons.But it was still that phrase, giving birth to a son means continuing the surname.Lin Qing He conversed with her for a while before she wanted to go home.However, when she came out, she bumped into Second Sister-in-law. Second Sister-in-law laughed: \"Fourth Sister-in-law if you have a way, you have to get good stuff to nourish your Third Sister-in-law.\"Eldest Sister-in-law was cooking congee in the kitchen. She frowned when she heard this. Why was Second's wife always looking for trouble?\"I have. I gave Third Sister-in-law another jin of brown sugar. What did you give?\" Lin Qing He stared at her.\"It's not like you don't know my family's condition. What can I possibly give? Brown sugar is not enough for breastmilk. If there are good meats to eat, it'll be wonderful.\" Second Sister-in-law smirked.Don't you have money? Then let have you bleed a good bit out.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64. Meatballs\"Speaking of meat, it's almost time to divide the meat. Must say, Dong Dong is blessed, to be able to make it in time.\" Eldest Sister-in-law came out of the kitchen with egg congee at this time and interjected with a smile.\"That's true.\" Lin Qing He chuckled.\"Previously when Da Wa saw his Third Aunt, he asked when will younger brother come out to play with him. The child's eyes are quite discerning. Once his gaze landed on his Third Aunt's belly, he knew that it was a younger brother.\" Eldest Sister-in-law mentioned.\"For the past two days, he has always pestered to come to see younger brother. I said 'you monkeys don't bump around and carry in the coldness' and stopped them from coming over. Wait until later, I'll let them head over to see their younger brother.\" Lin Qing He said. Glimpsing at the egg congee, she ushered: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, bring it in. I'll go back first.\"\"Alright.\" Eldest Sister-in-law responded.Lin Qing He returned. Eldest Sister-in-law ignored Second Sister-in-law and carried in the congee to Third Sister-in-law.\"Seeking trouble again?\" Third Sister-in-law asked in a low voice.\"Ain't that right. Fourth's wife didn't do anything. She had to stir things up every day. What is she planning.\" Eldest Sister-in-law whispered.\"Her heart holds animosity,\" Third Sister-in-law uttered in scorn.As for why she had animosity, Eldest Sister-in-law also knew. She didn't witness Fourth's wife's downfall, so she felt uncomfortable.Really, they were one family. If Fourth's wife lived terribly, then they have to reach out, no?Who was the one who suffers this?Now Fourth's wife changed. She was doing well and can take care of this side a bit. Although they don't get anything, the children can still get a bite from time to time.For example, the previous Laba congee was very delicious. Her son, Zhou Yang munched it very happily.So why does she wish for Fourth's wife to be worse off? Eldest Sister-in-law didn't understand.Same with Third Sister-in-law.The two sisters-in-law spoke no more.The team was distributing meat on December 20th.When Zhou Qing Bai came forward, it goes without saying that they were able to buy good meat. He had already returned and would be working next year, so the team did not say anything about him coming to buy meat.Zhou Qing Bai bought lean meat as well as ribs and big bones. As for current popular and well recognized as the best- fatty meat, he didn't fight with anyone for it. After all, he still had no work points. The others, who worked through the year, longed for this.His family had no shortage. At the moment, there were two cans of white lard in the house. So he doesn\u2019t need to buy those.Five jins for lean meat. Two jins for pork belly. A little more ribs. Same for the big bones.After all, it had to last from now until after the New Year.These things cost a good bit of money. Zhou Qing Bai took home without blinking his eyes. Da Wa and Er Wa was tagging along behind him. San Wa? He was watched by Lin Qing He and not coming out in this freezing to death weather. Why go out?Da Wa and Er Wa won't stop pestering, so she let them go out.\"Mother said that she'll deep-fry pork ribs for us for New Year. It'll be very fragrant!\" Da Wa was ecstatically following behind.Er Wa was also delighted. His eyes were bright and shiny.After the brothers experienced this winter's nurturing, it can be said that their body was healthier. They didn't catch a cold and became chubbier.Zhou Qing Bai brought the meat back and announced to Lin Qing He, \"We're going to the old Zhou's house for New Year.\"\"Okay. At that time, I'll fry a pot of spare ribs.\" Lin Qing He had no objection.She hadn't gone over in the past years. But wasn't that because he might not be at home during the New Year? Since he was here this year, then they'll go to old Zhou's house.\"You have minced these meats. I will make some meatballs for them.\" Lin Qing He began ordering Zhou Qing Bai to work.She cut out one jin of the five jins lean meat. Then she divided the two jins of pork belly in half. The remaining four jins of lean meat and one jin of pork belly were all minced.Just lean meat wasn't adequate to make meatballs. Adding some pork belly's white meat in, it will taste better and more fragrant.Salt, chopped scallion, minced ginger, eggs, flour, and starch. Although the ingredients were simple, the meatballs will obviously come out very fragrant and delicious.One jin of 16g meatball was almost thirty meatballs. The mixture of lean pork and the pork belly was a total of five jins, which turned into a large pot of pork meatballs.Lin Qing He found the taste was okay, while Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa were amazed. They felt the meatballs made by their parents were the most delicious thing in the world.\"We need to keep it for the New Year. Sparingly eat them now.\" Lin Qing He stated.After giving them two each, it was over. Initially, she planned to give one, but when they bargained, the amount increases by one.Even like this, the three brothers still wanted to negotiate with their mother for more.Zhou Qing Bai felt that his wife was so creative. The meatballs were delicious as well but he had lower requirements in the eating department. He'll comply with whatever arrangement she made. As for other stuff, he doesn't have much to say.Did he think he could eat Lin Qing He's meat like this? Obviously not.Banning her from doing her business? Then he can stay single.That day, when Zhou Qing Bai returned from the county city, he brought her stamps back. Lin Qing He planned to collect them, but she never had time to buy them.Before Zhou Qing Bai headed out, she brought it up. On his way back, buy all the stamps for her and it had to be one of each.\"Mother, why did you buy these?\" Zhou Da Wa asked in puzzlement, holding a stamp.\"It can't be eaten too.\" Er Wa swept a glance and sighed.It was clearly saying that his mother wasted her money. He couldn't help but glance at his father. As the father, he actually didn't control Mother. How much better it would have been if the money was left to buy edible?\"Scoot to one side.\" Lin Qing He picked up all the stamps and harrumphed.\"Mother, I want to play.\" San Wa uttered with his gaze on the stamps in her hand.\"Mother wants to keep it to play by myself.\" Lin Qing He grinned from ear to ear. Then she glared at the future good-for-nothing counselor, Er Wa: \"Er Wa, what did you mean just? Your mother, me, waited upon you, father and sons, every day. I can't use the money to buy something I like, is it? \"\"Mother, you can buy whatever you want. Ask my father to give you money.\" Er Wa immediately hugged her and declared.Only then Lin Qing He snorted, expressing a little satisfaction.Speaking of this, Zhou Qing Bai was the kind to spoil his wife. Without limit. With so many stamps, it must have cost a lot of money. He bought it without blinking his eyes.As Lin Qing He said, she served the father and sons every day. Three full meals a day and boil water for a foot bath in the evening, which was a must every night. Why can't she be wayward?Still not giving, was it?Zhou Qing Bai watched his lively wife. He found that he got to know her only after he returned. He had to say he liked this kind of wife very much. He was happy for her to stay like this and would continue to live with him.Lin Qing He accepted the other's boon, so her tone toward him was a little better. She chirped, \"What do you want for dinner?\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65. Younger Guzi had returned\"You can do as you like.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.Lin Qing He made a simple meal. Steamed mantou and then cooked a bone seaweed soup. Needless to say, she gave the three brothers a meatball each.And that was it for dinner. Simple, but filling.If her family's food was second place, no one in the village dared to claim they are first.Zhou's younger Guzi, Zhou Xiao Mei, came back on the 25th in a pair of white plastic-soled cloth shoes.Instead of heading straight home, she came to Lin Qing He's place first.Even though she was working in the food factory in the county city, she still heard about her fourth brother's retirement.She had long wanted to return, but there was no way as they were approaching the end of the year and the factory was too busy for her to get out.So she restrained herself until now when she got her holiday.\"Younger Guzi is back! Hey, these shoes are awesome.\" When Lin Qing He saw her, her eyes were attracted by the shoes at her feet, exclaimed.\"I asked a relative of my colleague to bring it from Hai City.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said and then stuffed a handful of milk candy to Da Wa and his brothers to get rid of them. She pulled Lin Qing He into the room.\"What's up?\" Lin Qing He looked at her.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, my fourth brother has retired just like that? You didn't make a scene?\" Zhou Xiao Mei whispered.\"He already backed down. What use is there for me to make trouble?\" Lin Qing He laughed.That's the original owner's bestie for sure. She really understood the original owner.Zhou Xiao Mei halted for a moment. She looked at her fourth sister-in-law suspiciously and observed how her fourth sister-in-law's skin was really great. She couldn't help saying: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, what kind of skincare products do you use? Your skin is all white and translucent.\"The topic deviated in one go.\"There is no skin care product. Just the usual vanishing cream.\" Lin Qing He said.There weren't many skin care products in her space, she will never share those with others.\"Vanishing cream is quite good, but how can it have this excellent effect? Your skin's quality is much higher than before. Don't hide it from me and not tell me.\" Zhou Xiao Mei persisted. And in a quieter voice, she continued: \"This time I brought a lot of good things back for Fourth Sister-in-law. Enough for you to take to your maternal home to show off. \"\"What goodies did you bring? Let me see.\" Lin Qing He focused on her bag.\"Tell me how you maintain your skin first. In this winter, you can still make yourself so white and rosy and have a scent on you. What did you use?\" Zhou Xiao Mei stood firm.\"You show first, otherwise I won't say it.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Xiao Mei reluctantly took it out first. This time she brought back a lot of food-related stacks; cooking oil coupons, subsidiary coupons for buying dates, canned food, fungus and other non-staple food, as well as food coupons. Cloth coupons and cotton coupons too!\"I exchanged for these cloth coupons and cotton coupons with other people. I know you want it so I especially got it for you.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said with pride.\"These coupons are certainly useful. Have you left some for Mother?\" Lin Qing He asked.The reason why the original owner would support Zhou Xiao Mei to go to the food factory and not hesitate to pay to buy gifts for her to go through the back door, was so she can obtain Zhou Xiao Mei's help in getting coupons.Otherwise, why would the original owner give up her money in vain? Not possible.\"I have set aside a little bit.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded: \"Can you say it now?\"\"I won\u2019t take your things for free. This is what your sister-in-law, I, bought from the black market before. It spent a lot of your Sister-in-law's money. I heard that it came from the capital city. It's the only piece left. For you.\" Lin Qing He went to the cabinet and passed a piece of soap to Zhou Xiao Mei.Zhou Xiao Mei's eyes were nearly popped out at the sight of this soap. This fragrance wasn't a typical one. It was also pretty.\"Don't you take it out to show off. I only have this piece to give to you. I heard that it was smuggled over to our side. If something happens when you show it around like losing your job or something, please don't come to me.\" Lin Qing He warned.\"This kind of good stuff, I'll hide it for my own usage!\" Zhou Xiao Mei vowed immediately.It'll be apparent just by washing herself with it and become fragrant. No need to take it out to make people jealous. If they wanted it and she can\u2019t give it, won't she gain grudges?Zhou Xiao Mei, who had gone to the factory and gained a little IQ, thought of this.Lin Qing He's conscience was at ease by exchanging these coupons with soap. After all, she didn't take a freebie from her. Additionally, she added: \"You're not allowed to say bad things about your fourth brother in the future. I have decided to peacefully live with him.\"Zhou Xiao Mei's lip pouted: \"Who said anything? Didn't you say it before? I was just sympathizing with you.\"\"What is there sympathize? Your fourth brother treats me well.\" Lin Qing He glanced at her.Zhou Xiao Mei said: \"You still haven't said how you maintained yourself so well.\"\"You really want to know?\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.Zhou Xiao Mei nodded at once. Her fourth sister-in-law's appearance was more eye-catching than the popular lady in the city. It was really siren-like.She also wants to be a siren!Lin Qing He closed in and whispered: \"If you want good skin, then you should also find a man to moisturize you.\"With these words, Zhou Xiao Mei's face flamed up: \"I'm going to die, I'm going to die!\"Then she picked up her bag and hurried away. Lin Qing He laughed: \"Remember. Keep your eyes wide open. At that time, find Fourth Sister-in-law to check him out for you.\"Zhou Xiao Mei left like she was fleeing.Zhou Qing Bai just happened to return at that moment. Zhou Xiao Mei stomped her feet and cried, \"Fourth brother, you need to control your wife!\" It's embarrassing to death.With this, she ran off.Zhou Qing Bai was baffled. When he entered the room, he saw his wife had a faint smirk. She seemed to be in a good mood.\"Father, do you want to eat candy? Younger Gu gave it.\" Da Wa said. (T/N: Guzi= husband's sister Gu=father's sister)As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Qing He reached out: \"Hurry up and act conscientiously.\"Just now Zhou Xiao Mei's handful of white rabbit candy was a lot. Eating too many will cause tooth decay.\"Mother, this is what our younger Gu gave us!\" Da Wa knew what she meant, immediately pointed out.\"Younger Gu gave it!\" Er Wa nodded.San Wa had one in his mouth. Although this boy was very young, he wasn't foolish when it comes to eating sweets. He ate one in his mouth and had one more peeled in his hand, ready to stuff in his mouth.It was cut off by Lin Qing He and then placed into Zhou Qing Bai's mouth.Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\"Lin Qing He turned to the kids and asserted: \"Each of you handed over two. The rest can be given to you.\"Although they weren't willing, Da Wa surrendered two. While Er Wa uttered: \"Eldest Brother got the most. I only have three!\"\"Three.\" San Wa bobbed his head.\"Then you two surrender one each.\" Lin Qing He said.Da Wa's eyes bulged from anger, but it was useless. Lin Qing He confiscated four of them.Er Wa stood up for his little brother: \"Little brother has the one in his mouth, and Father just ate one of his.\"\"I will give your little brother's share tomorrow. For now, I'll keep it for him.\" Lin Qing He said casually.She wasn't against the brothers eating a few white rabbit candy. But they can't have too much.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66. Have a match yet?Now there was a heavy New Year feel in the air. Every family was blooming with merriment. The children were also overjoyed.Lin Qing He didn't restrain Da Wa and Er Wa and let them go out to play. But they had to bundle up before going out.She didn\u2019t stop them from playing with firecrackers, but she had forbidden them from destroying other's belonging.She got Fei Ying to follow and watch the brothers. As for Sanwa, forget it. The little thing was only so big, he'll stay with her at home.Zhou Xiao Mei was a frequent visitor to their home. She came over every day and also had her meal here.Naturally, Lin Qing He wanted to exploit her. She had her pay the food expenses, or go back to old Zhou's house to eat.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, for some reason during this return, I feel that you have changed a lot?\" Zhou Xiao Mei honestly paid two yuan for food and remarked.Lin Qing He chuckled: \"Where have I changed?\"She received the money unreservedly. It must be accepted. Zhou Xiao Mei's appetite was pretty big and workers have a fixed income. Her family had two pigs in the backyard and Zhou Qing Bai, the only labor force. She won't act politely with Zhou Xiao Mei.\"In the past, you wouldn't revolve around men and children like this.\" Zhou Xiao Mei pointed out.Now, look at her fourth sister-in-law and what she does all day. Managing the three meals a day and have no time to go out. Nothing like this before. Simply become a different person from before, no?\"You probably don't know what I experienced during this time.\" Lin Qing He sighed and uttered.\"What?\" Zhou Xiao Mei immediately perked up with interest.\"I broke it off with my maternal family. I don't plan to go back this New Year.\" Lin Qing He said.\"What happened?\" Zhou Xiao Mei was taken aback.\"Do you know how white-eyed wolves they are? Your fourth brother and I can't survive anymore, so I went back and borrow some money first. But do you know what they say?\" Lin Qinghe scornfully smiled.Without adding oil and vinegar, she recounted what happened. Zhou Xiao Mei reached her limit and lashed out angrily: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, you used to treat them so well. If you get any good things, you always remember them. And this is how they reward you?\"\"That's why I realized it. Except for my man and sons, all my brothers and sisters can scoot aside for me. All of them are powered by realism. Of course, it's just my old Lin family. I feel old Zhou family is quite alright, they are quite united.\" Lin Qing He expressed.Zhou Xiao Mei nodded in agreement: \"Except for the Second Sister-in-law's competitiveness, Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law are pretty nice.\"At least not as heartless and ruthless as her fourth sister-in-law's maternal family's sister-in-law.\"So, I'm not going back to my maternal family anymore. What else can I do? Naturally, it's to live my life better, then I will let old Lin's family regret it. They better not think about benefitting a single bit from me from now on. As for the past, I'll treat it as feeding it to the dogs, \"Lin Qing He snorted.\"There no point in having this kind of maternal family.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded.\"Have a match yet at the factory?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"No.\" Zhou Xiao Mei immediately said.The reaction was too fast and too exaggerated. Lin Qing He narrowed her eyes as stared at Zhou Xiao Mei, declaring: \"Still not telling the truth? How big? How tall? How many people in his family? At what ages? What does he do?\"Zhou Xiao Mei's mouth twitched: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, are you doing an investigation?\"\"He wants to pursue my younger Guzi, of course, I have to ask clearly. You know what my temper is like. It's because I treat you as my biological sister that I care, otherwise, I will ignore you.\" Lin Qing He raised her eyebrows.Zhou Xiao Mei's face flushed with shyness: \"He is a worker too. Works in a shoe factory. Twenty-four years old.\"Not bad. Lin Qing He continued to interrogate: \"The other questions.\"\"Quite tall. Shorter than Fourth Brother, and almost the same as Third Brother.\" Zhou Xiao Mei's cheeks were completely red.Similar to Third Brother, then it should be about one meter seventy-five. Not short.According to Lin Qing He's thoughts, in old Zhou family, Zhou Qing was the tallest and he was about one meter eighty-five. Next was Third Brother. Then followed by Eldest Brother and Second Brother, who were slightly shorter but not too much.\"And.\" Lin Qing He uttered.\"He's the eldest of the family. His parents are alive. His father is also a worker, while his mother isn't. He got two younger brothers and two younger sisters.\" Zhou Xiao Mei continued.Lin Qing He frowned.Zhou Xiao Mei stared at her, \"Fourth Sister-in-law, what's wrong?\"\"Do you think such conditions are good?\" Lin Qing He watched her.\"It's still alright?\" Zhou Xiao Mei paused for a moment and looked at her questioningly.\"Then did he tell you that if you guys get married, how will his salary be handled?\" Lin Qing He smiled.At once, Zhou Xiao Mei declared: \"Once married, of course it'll be me my care.\"Lin Qing He chuckled: \"Is this what he told you, or what you assumed? And how spacious is his home and where will you live after marriage?\"\"He didn't say. We should be living in his home after marriage. His home isn't very spacious.\" Zhou Xiao Mei replied.\"You been there already?\" Lin Qing He uttered in surprise.\"Just ... took the opportunity to visit while his father and mother weren't at home.\" Zhou Xiao Mei's face reddened.\"It's okay to go and see. But how was it not spacious?\" Lin Qing He kept firing away.\"I don't like his home. Once marry over, there will be a lot of inconveniences.\" Zhou Xiao Mei answered this question like this.\"Do you want me to analyze and break it down it for you?\" Lin Qing He directed at her.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, say it.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded, and she was in a dilemma.\"Then Fourth Sister-in-law will tell you honestly.\" Lin Qing He looked at her and announced: \"I think this man is not for you.\"Zhou Xiaomei pursed her lips and uttered, \"In fact, he's a very good man.\"\"It's great that he's a good person, or you won't like him. But Fourth Sister-in-law has to tell you that your like won't feed you. Think about it. If you were to marry him, then you can only live in his home. You work in the city, so you don't need me to explain how tight the housing conditions in the city are, right?\u201d Lin Qing He clarified.Zhou Xiao Mei didn't speak.Lin Qing He continued: \"Even you said it's small, then his home must be really small. And there are siblings below him. Number one, it is inconvenient for the whole family to be crowded together. Number two is the problem with you two's salary. In his family, only he and his dad work, and the rest are dependent on them. Do you think that after you marry over, your partner can still give you his salary? If your partner doesn\u2019t give you his salary, you'll definitely be dissatisfied. Inevitably, fights happen at that time. How long can your love endure this before it withers away?\"Zhou Xiao Mei was going to speak. Lin Qing He signaled her to listen to her first: \"Or maybe you are willing to let him give his salary to his family. Do you think it's over like this? In addition to his salary, there is also your own salary. When the time comes, your salary may not be able to keep it. \"\"How can I not keep my own salary!\" Zhou Xiao Mei couldn't help it but utter.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67. New Year's EveLin Qing He raised an eyebrow and said, \"If your mother-in-law is unwell, don't you have to dish out money?\"Zhou Xiao Mei froze for a moment.\"From the start, you count as increasing your status by marrying into the city. At least in the eyes of them, city folks, it is marrying above your station. Since you get a social status increase, then you have to be deeply grateful, serve your parents-in-law properly, and treat your husband's siblings nicely. If not, you are mannerless and insensible. Younger Guzi, do you understand what I mean?\" Lin Qing He spelled out.Zhou Xiaomei gritted her teeth, bit out, \"They dare!\"\"Silly.\" Lin Qing He said solemnly: \"At that time, you already married over. Can you even reason against it? There is divorce now, but can you afford the consequence of divorce?\"Zhou Xiao Mei declared: \"Then I will break it off with him as soon as possible once I go back!\"\"Think about it when you go back. You got to observe more on your own. I'm just analyzing it for you. It's up to you, whether it's staying or giving up. But in my opinion, Younger Guzi, you deserve better.\" Lin Qing He said.\"With my background, how can I find better.\" Zhou Xiao Mei lamented at once.\"What's wrong with your background? Poor peasant, the best status nowadays. Who would dare to touch you when you go out?\" Lin Qing He grinned and said: \"You got the looks. You got a career. Currently, you're at the peak youth. Why should you wrong yourself by choosing such a family? \"Zhou Xiao Mei was comforted by her, and her spirit was restored a lot.\"Tell me about how the boy chased you.\" Lin Qing He poured a cup of warm water to drink. She was a little thirsty from talking so much.\"He gifted me a hairpin.\" Zhou Xiao Mei admitted.\"Then what?\" Lin Qing He nodded and motioned her to continue.Zhou Xiao Mei looked at her and stated, \"No more.\"Lin Qing He stared at her: \"That's your courtship. He just gave you a hairpin? Then you matched with him?\"Her tone was clearly shocked.Zhou Xiao Mei's face remained calm as she found nothing strange: \"Gift me a hairpin and that's it.\"\"My God.\" Lin Qing He couldn't believe it.Initially, Zhou Xiao Mei didn't think there was anything but seeing her fourth sister-in-law being so surprised, it dawned on her. She exclaimed, \"He hasn't taken me to the movies!\"Lin Qing He snorted: \"Gifting you a dime worth of hairpin during courtship and then planned to marry a youthful girl with such a high salary like you to be a slave away in serving him and his whole family. What a good scheme he has.\"Then she continued: \"You don't need to think about it. You can basically kick him away. Why keep for the New Year?\"Although this era was poor, it was pure and simple. Outrageously simple!Both were workers, gifting a hairpin was enough during courtship? What a joke! Like this, he wants to marry a wife. Will she be able live a good life when entered the house?\"At that time, Fourth Sister-in-law, you married your eldest brother, it seems to start with a blind date.\" Zhou Xiao Mei mentioned.\"How can you compare it with me? I live in this house now. Will you when you marry over?\" Lin Qing He said: \"You have to live with his family. At that time, it'll noisy every day. Enough, I'm not talking with you anymore. If you want to marry you, then marry. Don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you then. What I said today has done justice to our relationship of many years. The future is your own, you decide.\u201dBefore departing, Zhou Xiao Mei reminded: \"Don't tell Mother about this.\"\"Why would I talk about this? Quickly go back. Seeing your useless appearance makes me heart suffocate.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand.Zhou Xiao Mei couldn't help saying: \"How could you be like this, Fourth Sister-in-law ah!\"\"Be like what?\" Lin Qing He snorted, \"If you live well, you really have to keep up with me. I'm not boasting with you. In this family, I say one, no one dares to say two. If you want to be well, you have to learn a little bit. For example, the guy you are dating. If it\u2019s me. who knows which corner I already kicked him to. With a hairpin, he wants to marry. Is he treating you like a cabbage! \"Zhou Xiao Mei knew that her fourth sister-in-law had her best in mind. But they were all on vacation now. Wait until she goes back to work, she'll explain to him.After being reminded by her fourth sister-in-law like this, she also felt quite disinterested.Lin Qing He still couldn't hold back and mumbled this to Zhou Qing Bai: \"Really, I haven't seen such a thing. One hairpin and he wants to marry a person back to serve a family. Is his hairpin made of gold?\"Zhou Qing Bai didn't care much about these things, but it was obvious that his wife treated Xiao Mei well. Otherwise, would she check it out for her?\"In the end, it\u2019s that man who thinks he\u2019s superior for being city folk, or else would he dare to do this to Xiao Mei? City folk, it only sounds good. Everyone is crowded in a room and when one farts, it stinks up the whole house. What is there to be proud of? \"Lin Qing He continued to mock.\"Certainly isn't as spacious as the countryside.\" Zhou Qing Bai echoed.In fact, the situation in the countryside was similar. It wasn't easy to build another house. One had to accumulate half a lifetime money before one can make a new one.However, this does not affect his bottom line and followed along with his wife's complaints.\"Not only is the accommodation bad, but you also can't eat like us. They need coupons for everything. The black market is very expensive. It's not as good as our countryside.\" Lin Qing He continued.Only after she grumbled with Zhou Qing Bai did she feel it was enough. At this time, the dumplings were almost finished folding up.\"Not going back this year?\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her.\"Not going. I won't go back in the future. Except for my third brother, I have broken relations with all of them.\" Lin Qing He maintained relentlessly.From the start, she wasn't the original owner. Seeing how the old Lin family were, she won't b masochist and stay connected with them. They can all scram far away from her.Zhou Qing Bai knew her temperament. Maybe it was just joking and it'll be fine once her anger died down after a while.But apparently, it wasn't a matter of Lin Qing He's anger dissipating or not. She just doesn't want to have any ties with the white-eyed wolves of the old Lin family. So she won't go visit them herself.As for what other people will say, it doesn't matter. Since Zhou Qing Bai was at home. No evil wind will blow-by. As a woman, why can't she be a bit selfish?On New Year\u2019s Eve, Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai brought Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa over to the old Zhou family during dinner to join their table.They didn't come over to make dinner, so Lin Qing He got Zhou Qing Bai to carry two solid dishes. One was pork meatballs and the other was tiger skin eggs.Both were very delicious. These two solid dishes added a lot of color to old Zhou's New Year's Eve dinner.The eyes of adults can't help but float up, let alone the children.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, you made these? When did your cooking get so good?\" During dinner, Zhou Xiao Mei ate the meatballs and was full of praises.\"I didn't make it by yourself. Your fourth brother also helped.\" Lin Qing He said and then turned to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou: \"Father, Mother, try them. It tastes pretty good.\"Father Zhou and Mother Zhou responded okay. Seeing that this family was reunited now, the two elder was clearly in a good mood. Especially now that Lin Qing He, the \u2018most ignorant\u2019 daughter-in-law had a record of changing for better.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68. New Year's DayDa Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa were all very well nurtured. Zhou Qing Bai, the youngest son, had also returned home. So they were overjoyed to have this dinner party this evening.Even Second Sister-in-law didn't act out and attract disdain at this time.The truth was she didn't have time to. It was so rare to have such a delicious meal. She couldn't wait to eat more, so why would she pick on people?After eating the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner, conversing as they wait for the countdown was left.However, Lin Qing He didn't want to stay for this tradition. She chatted for a while before she took her kids back home around nine o'clock to sleep.As for the countdown, there was Zhou Qing Bai. He was enough.Mother Zhou pulled her youngest son into the room to speak, mainly to ask Lin Qing He's current thoughts.\"Don't worry, Mother. my wife is very good.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Mother Zhou advised: \"Mother knows that your wife has proved to change for better. But you should still pay attention. She still has a thorn in her heart from your retirement. If there's a problem, yield to her. \"Zhou Qing Bai nodded.It was not easy for his wife to manage the whole family's food and clothing, so he will naturally go along with her.Mother Zhou didn\u2019t want her younger son to lower himself in front of another's daughter, but it couldn\u2019t help it. Now he had grown up and had his own family. How could she not know that the household won't be at peace if the female head of the family doesn't perform properly?The power of women had that much effect. It was undoubtedly the truth.Therefore, Mother Zhou would rather have her son compromise. At least for now, Fourth's wife did not make trouble because of his retirement, right?This is great. In the beginning, she was worried to death because she was afraid of the endless troubles from Fourth's wife.The current attitude was still good.After the countdown, Zhou Qing Bai went back.Zhou Xiao Mei spoke with her mother: \"Mother, what did you call Fourth brother in for?\"\"Nothing much.\" Mother Zhou didn't want to elaborate too much toward this daughter, otherwise, she could go to her fourth sister-in-law and pass it on.\"I know even without you saying. Must be telling him to have a good relationship with Fourth Sister-in-law?\" Zhou Xiao Mei said.Mother Zhou shot a glance at her: \"Aren't you clever(monkey spirit)?\"\"I'm being clever. I'm telling the truth. Mother, you should really have a good talk with Fourth Brother. A guy like him, to be able to marry my fourth sister-in-law, it can only be said that he has good fortune. He must cherish it\" Zhou Xiao Mei stated.Mother Zhou was displeased: \"Which part of your fourth brother is bad?\"\"Fourth Brother isn't bad. But to match my fourth sister-in-law, he's slightly not good enough. I know Mother knows that well without me saying. That body full of style and knowledge, even the girls who grew up in the city can\u2019t compare to her.\" Zhou Xiao Mei sang.Mother Zhou said: \"Can it be eaten?\"\"Ma'am, you're so vulgar. I'm discussing something serious with you and you veer off.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said: \"Mother, did you notice? Fourth Sister-in-law is now more beautiful than before.\"Mother Zhou glanced at her and said nothing.How could she not see? There were no words for this youngest daughter-in-law's appearance. The female educated urban youth were pretty, but still, they can't be compared with Fourth's wife.In contrast to the past, the current Fourth's wife was more comprehensible, whether it was her speech or actions. For example, when the whole family came over for dinner, she brought two solid dishes. Even Second's wife, who was prepared to criticize, became mute. She can be considered as being generous and decent.No matter what, her son was worthy of her. How could it be incompatible like her daughter said?\"I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad match. I just wanted to say that you have to make Fourth Brother coax her well. This time I came back, I notice Fourth Sister-in-law\u2019s affection for the kids. With her personality, if she\u2019s not happy, she might really cleanly separate from Fourth Brother. Don't say it's not possible. You're clear on how well I understand Fourth Sister-in-law.\"Zhou Xiao Mei stated.Mother Zhou wanted to pinch her and scolded: \"It's New Year, speak less of those unlucky words. I think she is fine now.\"\"It is fine ah. Then don't let her suffer a grievance. Otherwise, it's possible for her to break away from her in-law family since she already disowned her maternal family. With Fourth Sister-in-law's looks, it's possible for her to marry into the city. She is so powerful, she can definitely have a firm footing. Speaking about it, Fourth Brother benefitted at the beginning because she had a beautiful dream. Now that her dream is broken, it is really rare for her to not make a scene.\" Zhou Xiao Mei remarked.After hearing the news of her fourth brother's retirement in the food factory, she had expected that her fourth sister-in-law would not give up easily.\"Okay, quickly go to bed.\" Mother Zhou uttered impatiently.Mother Zhou brought it up to Father Zhou when she came back. Father Zhou said: \"Don't worry about that much. No need to govern that side. I think Qing Bai and his wife have a good relationship.\"The most important thing was that Fourth's wife was now devoted to Da Wa and his brothers. Looking at the three grandchildren, Father Zhou was delighted at the sight.Have to say, the father and mother was an important factor. When the parents are good looking, the children below can't be too bad.\"When I saw Da Wa and his brothers today, and I feel that the children in the city are like this.\" Father Zhou merrily remarked.Mother Zhou did not say anything about this point. When talking about the third generation of descendants, first, second, and third branches cannot be compared with fourth's.Not just old Zhou's family., even in other families in the village, there was no one that could beat them.This was really thanks to having beautiful parents.While Old Zhou's house spoke, at Lin Qing He's little family.After Zhou Qing Bai returned to the house, he saw that the mother and sons were sleeping soundly. He took off his clothes and got on the kang.Probably after getting to used to it for a while, Lin Qing He no longer resisted his embrace. Sensing his presence, she automatically approached, hugged his waist, and found a comfortable position in his arms to continue to sleep.In the dark, Zhou Qing Bai's stiff face alleviated. He held her willow waist, smelled the fragrance of her hair, and soon fell asleep.When Lin Qing He got up early the next morning, Zhou Qing Bai had already made breakfast.Although it was New Year's Day, they don't have to eat too special. Millet porridge served with buns was enough.Lin Qing He got the kids to get up. The brothers didn't want to get up. The bed in winter was so warm that they wished to stay there.Especially with such a big quilt that Lin Qing He got this year. So comfy.There was another one in the next room, which hadn't been used yet. On top of that, there's a four jin one here, it was sufficient.In fact, Lin Qing He also didn't want to get up, but today was New Year's Day. She had to let the children go give New Year's greeting.After dressing them up, she let them have breakfast. Once they finished, she gave them candy and let them go out to play.As for the New Year's money, they did get it. Two dimes for each person. The usual rule for San Wa, she keeps it. The other two don't need her to keep it.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69. Go to the city with Father and MotherLin Qing He didn't remain at home during New Year's Day. She took San Wa over to the old Zhou's house.She came to chat Eldest Sister-in-law, Third Sister-in-law, and Zhou Xiao Mei. As for Second Sister-in-law, she wasn't included in her list.Although Third Sister-in-law hadn't completed her post-natal confinement yet, her body was now much better. And it was New Year, she was happy to chat.Lin Qing He didn't plan to be a bother. She left after talking for almost an hour.As for Second Sister-in-law, she happened to be not home. She went out to converse with other women in the village.Lin Qing He brought San Wa home. Zhou Xiao Mei followed her back too. When they returned, Zhou Qing Bai was feeding the pigs.Zhou Qing Bai was still in charge of these things. Lin Qing He occasionally lent a hand, however, it was impossible to dump the whole responsibility all to her.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, you have changed a lot. You can bear having the pigs at home.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said a surge of emotion.\"Come on.\" Lin Qing He tossed a glance at her.Zhou Xiao Mei grinned: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, what kind of person do you think I should find?\"\"Have no parents and own a car and a house.\" Lin Qing He casually replied.Zhou Xiao Mei burst into laughter, chuckling: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, I say, what you said is too interesting.\"\"Why? It doesn't make sense?\" Lin Qing He uttered.\"It does. It's not easy to find this type. And if something happens, there's no one to seek help from.\" Zhou Xiao Mei pointed out.\"What kind of help do you need? You got so many brothers in your maternal family. If needed, just give us a shout. Who won't support you?\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Xiao Mei said with a smile: \"Still won't chance upon this type.\"\"If you don't meet one, you can only retreat and take the second place. But you can basically kick that guy of yours, no need to think about it.\" Lin Qing He advised.\"I'll kick him once I'm back after the New Year.\" Zhou Xiao Mei concurred.\"Find a reliable person, like your fourth brother. He has to have a sense of responsibility. His shoulders can hold things up. He can go out to protect his wife and children at home. Also, have good looks.\" Lin Qing He listed.Zhou Xiao Mei uttered in shock: \"Didn't you used to say that my fourth brother is bad here and there? How long ago was it before you changed?\"She really didn't see that many good points from her fourth brother. In her eyes, her fourth brother was a rough man.\"A woman's heart is a needle in the sea, can say wind one second and rain the next. Not just me, even you know.\" Lin Qing He stated.Of course, Zhou Xiao Mei knew. But still, she changed too fast.\"I used to spend too little time with your fourth brother. Each time, he couldn't stay for more than a few days. What can I see with this? Now that I have interacted with him. I think he is really good. At least, as the head of the family, he can support my family's front.\" Lin Qing He clarified.Although he hadn't approved of her pork resale until now and was too rigid, she had no complaints in other aspects.To put it simply, the person was handsome, had a lot of gold, and was vigorous with a big device.Cough. Although she hadn't experienced the last part personally, she wasn't stupid. From the cuddling in bed, how can she not feel his amazing size?Actually, she was a little scared. Afraid that she couldn't bear.She had deviated too much.Anyway, Zhou Qing Bai's condition was quite in line with her taste. The only bad point was his inflexibility. She still had to continue to train him.Zhou Xiao Mei also had lunch here. Once she finished, she returned. Lin Qing He told her that their family was going to the county city tomorrow and would leave Feiying to watch the house, so there was no need to come and find her.Zhou Xiao Mei immediately responded: \"I will go with you!\"\"The bicycle has no space. And it's a rare chance for us to have a family trip. Are you sure you want to join?\" Lin Qing He said.\"Forget it then.\" Zhou Xiao Mei waved her hand.\"What do you want to eat? I will bring it back for you.\" Lin Qing He asked.\"No need. I will come to your house tomorrow night to eat?\" Zhou Xiao Mei checked.\"Sure.\" Lin Qing He gave her the answer.Zhou Xiao Mei happily went back.The New Year\u2019s Day passed like this. Overall it was filled with happiness. Only on the night of New Year\u2019s Day, Zhou Qing Bai was obviously not behaving.\"Wife, your anger should be gone.\" Zhou Qing Bai hoarsely voiced out.Must say, it was quite tempting. It was still useless, Lin Qing He's heart hardened: \"Don't touch me, go to sleep by yourself.\"\"Wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai dropped a kiss on her neck.Lin Qing He immediately reacted: \"If you go too far, don't blame me for flipping on you!\"Zhou Qing Bai maintained: \"Your business is a bad idea. If an accident happened, it'll be bad for your reputation.\"\"I did say I have a way. If I get into trouble once, then I won't wash my hands in the golden basin. But only on the premise that you let me try it once. It's just selling some pork. What the big deal? Believe it or not, this situation is only for the time being. It will be the world of merchants in the future. \"Lin Qing He persisted.\"The future is the future. Now it's not allowed.\" Zhou Qing Bai stood firm.\"Qing Bai, let me try. Just let me try it once. If it doesn't work, then I'll be ruly. If you can, will you let me give it a go?\" Lin Qing He pleaded softly.Her hands were on his cheeks and touched his chin, which was full of hard stubble. It felt quite comfortable and simulating to feel.It was a rare opportunity for Zhou Qing Bai to see her acting as obedient as a cat. So he enjoyed her coquetry a bit and then refused firmly.Angrily Lin Qing He's hand went down and unknowingly caught his fatal point. It made Zhou Qing Bai was all tense, but still couldn't help but want more.Lin Qing He fulfilled his wish. When it was halfway through, she let go and stopped. Then she changed position with Er Wa and ignored him.A hardened man like Zhou Qing Bai was close to exploding from the punishment his unsparing wife gave.In the middle of the night, he inevitably got up and changed his underwear.Early the next morning, the family ate breakfast and headed to the county city.They gave Mother Zhou a key and told her to come over to cook some food for the pig when it was time. They were fed before they went out.Zhou Da Wa, Zhou Er Wa, and little San Wa were all overjoyed, to be able to go to the city with Father and Mother.Zhou Da Wa was at the front. Lin Qing He held Er Wa and San Wa at the back. Like this, the whole family came to the county city.The family took a family portrait. Narcissistically, Lin Qing He also took two more individual photos. Zhou Qing Bai was forced by her to take one as well. As for Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa, they grouped together for one and then separate for an individual one.Then it was the movie.The family watched a movie. Even though it wasn't good, Da Wa and Er Wa still enjoyed it deeply. San Wa fell asleep after watching half.Zhou Qing Bai held him, as Lin Qing He continued to watch with two big ones.After watching the movie, the family came out and went to the restaurant.After coming out of the restaurant, Da Wa expressed: \"The dumplings aren't as good as our family's.\"\"The taste can't beat homemade ones.\" Er Wa nodded.\"Be satisfied that you got something to eat and don't be picky.\" Lin Qing He uttered. She bought some little apples and nothing else. She spent a lot of money today. The photos will be ready for pick up in a week.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70. Third Brother LinPlay, eat, and movie, it was all done. Now, it was time for the family to head home.On the way, Da Wa and Er Wa expressed that they will watch the movie in next year's New Year!\"Sure, as long as you study well every day, I can fulfill your desire to watch movies.\" Lin Qing He generously declared.Zhou Qing Bai didn't say anything. He took his wife and children back home on a bicycle but still listened to the laughter of his wife and children. His usual cold expression on his face had a rare softness.It's almost three o'clock in the afternoon when they get home. The whole family was tired after a day out.Da Wa and Er Wa were so energetic, so Lin Qing He didn't stop them from going out. She took San Wa with her to relax.At this hour, it was almost time for dinner. Napping wasn't possible.Lin Qing He washed the apples to snack on. Zhou Qing Bai bit into one, while San Wa was spoon-fed apple puree that was scraped out by her.Although he counts as two years old, the real age was still too small.Zhou Qing Bai took over this job once he finished his and let her eat her own one.\"In this freezing weather, what should we eat tonight?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Dumplings is enough.\" Zhou Qing Bai uttered.\"How about cornmeal mantou?\" Lin Qing He was sick of eating dumplings and suggested: \"I'll steam another piece of bacon and cook a seaweed soup?\"\"OK.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Zhou Xiao Mei came over to eat during the evening. It was amazing to eat bacon. She felt that her fourth brother seemed to be a lot fatter since returning home. At least, he looked sturdier than before. She believed this was all thanks to her fourth sister-in-law.Look at this bacon. It was so fragrant and delicious that she could almost swallow her tongue.Lin Qing He's bacon was indeed delicious. This was without a doubt. Just looking at Zhou Qing Bai and the kids and you'll know.Stir-fried bacon and pickled vegetables with a little sprinkle of crushed chili. So aromatic and tasty.There was also a big bone and seaweed soup. Even though it was mainly simple cornmeal mantou, as a guest, Zhou Xiao Mei was still satisfied.She cleaned the tableware, Lin Qing He didn't stop her. Her own Guzi came to scrouge dinner, so why stop her from helping with the tableware clean up.The second day of the new year was also very fulfilling.However, the old Lin family apparently had their own thoughts.Initially, they thought Lin Qing He was throwing a tantrum and said she won't come back during the New Year. She only had this one maternal family, how can she not come back?Like this, her in-law family would look down on her.But who would have known, she really didn't visit today, on the second day of New Year.\"Old man, do you think this girl really won't visit?\" Mother Lin asked.\"Well, it's just a matter of temper. No need to care whether she comes to visit her maiden's home. With her temper, she will come back crying to her maternal house someday.\" Father Lin snorted.Mother Lin nodded: \"This girl is too head-strong, she deserves to suffer.\"It wasn't just Father Lin and Mother Lin who talked about Lin Qing He. Eldest Brother Lin and Eldest Sister-in-law Lin mentioned her, but it was only a brief sentence or two.Second Brother Lin and Second Sister-in-law Lin had more words to say.\"She actually not coming back? Do she think she was the same as before, where everyone had to coax her?\" Second Sister-in-law Lin sneered.Second Brother Lin also remarked: \"She didn't grow up.\"\"I can tell you, her life is definitely not going well now, otherwise, it will not be like this. If you bump into, pretend she's not there!\" Second Sister-in-law Lin said.\"In the end, we're brother and sister. She did give me my coat.\" Second Brother Lin pointed out.\"What gives? I said so much flattery that I nearly worshipped how fragrant her stinky feet were for this coat. This is what our family deserves!\" Second Sister-in-law Lin sneered coldly.Third Branch also had their talk.Third Sister-in-law Lin was really surprised: \"I thought your third sister wasn't serious with what she said. Never expect her to not come back today.\"Today, only the First Guzi and Second Guzi have returned. Only Third Guzi didn't.She was pregnant with her second child. The first one was a girl. Now she was more than a month along, so she did not go back to her maternal house on the icy road. Going back after the new year was the same.\"My sister is really angry this time. Can't believe, Father and Mother. In the past, Third Sister brought back a lot of things to honor them. Now Third Sister's life isn't easy, they don't help out.\" Third Brother Lin frowned.\"You don't have to be upset. Maybe it will be better after a while. Which daughter would really disown her maternal family.\" Third Sister-in-law Lin didn't care.\"You don't know my third sister. When she said disown, she would never come again if my father and mother don't go and invite her over,.\" Third Brother Lin sighed.\"Get Father and Mother to go invite? Then don't think about coming back this lifetime.\" Third Sister-in-law Lin stated.\"I'm going to see Third Sister tomorrow.\" Third Brother Lin decided.\"It's fine if you go, but those courtesy gifts aren't necessary.\" Third Sister-in-law Lin immediately responded.Brother San Lin hummed an 'En'. Currently, he had no money. It would be nice to go over and see his third sister.After breakfast on the third, he headed over. When he arrived, Zhu Qing Bai was home, in the middle of feeding the pigs in the backyard. Now the pigs were getting bigger and bigger. He got up at six in the morning to feed and then feed again at nine.\"Third brother, you have come.\" Zhou Qing Bai greeted him when he saw him.\"Jiefu, is my sister home?\" Third Brother Lin smiled when he saw him and scanned the courtyard.\"Your third sister is out, should be back in a while.\" Zhou Qing Bai answered.Zhou Qing Bai brought him over to the backyard. When Brother Lin saw the two piglets, he couldn't help but feel sad. His third sister loved cleanliness. At home, she used to scold people for raising pigs, and swore never have them in her own family.Not to mention the pig, was it not the same with the chicken?But look at the present, because the family became so terribly off that the family had to raise pigs.If raised well, the two pigs can earn them a lot of work points. It was definitely not easy for his third sister now.Lin Qing He carried San Wa home and at the sight of this third brother, she was delighted. She had no interest in the other people in the old Lin family, but she still likes this third brother.\"Don't rush back at noon, stay here for a meal.\" Lin Qing He implored him.\"No need. I'll go home and eat.\" Third Brother Lin shook his head.\"Such a long trip on New Year, how can I let you go back on an empty stomach?\" Lin Qing He said.\"Sister, there's really no need. It's fine for me to eat at home. Now Jiefu has retired, don't be temperamental in the future. Just live well with Jiefu.\" Third Brother Lin urged.\"I still need you to teach me how to live? Look at San Wa. How well I have raised him?\" Lin Qing He hugged San Wa over to show him, \"Call Jiujiu.\"\"Jiujiu.\" San Wa greeted.Brother Third Brother Lin grinned a response and touched his pockets with the intention to give New Year's money before he recalled he had no money.\"I'm content that you can still visit me, this sister. Now I only acknowledged you from the old Lin family.\" Lin Qing He stated.\"Sister, don't say words of anger ...\"Lin Qing He interrupted Third Brother Lin before he finished speaking: \"You know what kind of character I am. I didn't talk in anger. I had seen through those people now.\"Jiu Jiu: Another way to call mother's brotherIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71. Hard-hearted WifeThird Brother Lin knew that she was still blinded in anger, just sighed, and said nothing.Since he came here, Lin Qing He naturally kept him for lunch and not let him go back on an empty stomach.Lunch was simple, stewed pork and starch noodles, stir-fried bacon and pickled vegetables, and a mix of edible fungi. The central dish was plain mantou.\"Sister, you don't need to make so many delicious foods. Leave them for Da Wa and his brothers to eat.\" Third Brother Lin caught sight of what was cooking on the coal stove and quickly interjected.Lin Qing He maintained: \"Even if you're not here, we will eat like this. Your sister's life is not as good as before, but it hasn't drop down to that level yet. Relax and eat. I, your sister is willing to give you to eat. But those in the old Lin family, don't even think about it. Don\u2019t say it when you go back. \"Third Brother Lin turned to Da Wa. Da Wa confirmed: \"We do eat like this.\"\"Tasty.\" Er Wa nodded.Third Brother Lin mentally exclaimed, 'Of course, it's tasty. It got meat, starch noodles, bacon, and flour bun. Which one isn't good stuff?'Third Brother Lin went back after a satisfying meal.When he came over, he was worried but now on the way back, Third Brother Lin felt a lot more relieved. Although his sister\u2019s life wasn't as great as before, it won't be too bad with a hardworking Jiefu there.\"Third brother is nice.\" Zhou Qing Bai remarked.\"Out of the entire old Lin family, only he hasn't become crooked.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Qing Bai just looked at her: \"Neither have you.\"Lin Qing He mentally retorted that she was not from old Lin family, and the former wasn't something good either.However, she didn't speak out.The first days of New Year had passed, the New Year feeling began to fade. On the seventh, Zhou Xiao Mei returned to the county city, because on the eighth day, work will officially begin.Lin Qing He left the kids for Zhou Qing Bai to take care. She took Zhou Xiao Mei to the county city on the bicycle. Mainly because she hadn't come out for a long time. After all, she needed an excuse to take something out?She took turns cycling with Zhou Xiao Mei. It would very be tiring for her to bring her all the way.But Zhou Xiao Mei, returning to the county city this time was much easier than before.She was quite happy when waving goodbye to Lin Qing He.At this time a colleague of her came over and asked, \"Who is that? A relative in the city?\"\"It's my sister-in-law, Fourth Sister-in-law.\" Zhou Xiao Mei replied.\"Your fourth sister-in-law is so beautiful. I thought she was a city folk.\" The colleague said.\"Even though my fourth sister-in-law is not from the city, she is the most beautiful in our area. My fourth brother got lucky.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said.The colleague smiled, then frowned, \"When are you planning to marry?\"\"I came back this time just to break it off with him. I really can't afford to climb into his family. My family is a rural background.\" Zhou Xiao Mei pressed down her temper.This was taught by her fourth sister-in-law. If it was her, she would definitely explain it like this.When she said this, it made her colleague respect her and said: \"What's wrong in the countryside? There's no worry about eating and drinking in the countryside!\"\"Forget it. I can't afford to socially climb. Help me give this hairpin back to him for me.\" Zhou Xiao Mei requested and took a hairpin out.\"This hairpin is absolutely beautiful,\" the colleague uttered.\"Since it's pretty, then go over and get him to give it to you.\" Zhou Xiao Mei finished and went back to the dormitory.Her colleague blushed, and then whispered: \"I didn't steal him from you, it's you, who don't want him.\"So less than three days later, Zhou Xiao Mei witnessed her former match grabbing and eating dinner with that colleague. The two appeared quite intimate.Some other colleagues came over to mention it, Zhou Xiao Mei gave the same explanation- she can't match up to the other, and the other deserved better. Although she, Zhou Xiao Mei was not sensible, she still had self-awareness!This invoked sympathy from many colleagues for her, but it was also because of this matter that they had high regard toward Zhou Xiao Mei and felt that she can be a good friend, unlike some people. In the past, they thought she a good person. Never thought she would actually steal a colleague's match. Really got no standards!Zhou Xiao Mei didn't care about this, because after the split, others pursued her due to her noble quality.Zhou Xiao Mei followed what her fourth sister-in-law told her. After considering them one by one, she found that none of them meet what her fourth sister-in-law said.Either the family was counting on his salary, or he was too unsightly, or his home was too small.In short, no one met the criteria.In the end, Zhou Xiao Mei can only continue to be single. She currently trusted her fourth sister-in-law deeply and felt what remained was the best.Rather than being picked by others, it was her not wanting others. It wasn't that she wasn't desired, she was very popular.This was indeed the case.Zhou Xiao Mei's family composition need not be questioned. She got many brothers in her family. Her circumstance was fine. If one marries her, one doesn't need to worry about her maternal family needing relief from the son-in-law's family.Maybe instead, they will be able to help the son-in-law's family in the city.Many maternal families of the daughters-in-law from the rural who have joined the city will give some food after the food distributionWhat's more, Zhou Xiao Mei still had own income. It can't get any better.Therefore, it wasn't false to say that Zhou Xiao Mei was in demand. But Zhou Xiao Mei doesn't have that intention now.In the countryside, Lin Qing He knew about this because after Zhou Xiao Mei kicked that guy, she had come back once or twice a month and heard all about it from Zhou Xiao Mei.In a blink of an eye, it was already March, the season of recovery of all things.\"You check around and see who in the village has chicks. Buy a few to raise.\" Lin Qing He said.\"There are five people in our family, up to three.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.Only then Lin Qing He remembered this. During this period, there were restrictions. One chicken per two people. Her family of five can have three maximum.\"You go to catch six. Chicks die easily.\" Lin Qing He decided.Zhou Qing Bai did not object to this. It was indeed the case. Lin Qing He's plan was if they all survived, then she'll wait until they grow up and slaughter them to nourish the whole family.At this time, it was easy to raise chicks. Zhou Qing Bai went to buy six.When they were still chicks, more are raised. This was the usual practice. After all, it is necessary to consider that the chicks may die halfway. So no one will say anything.If they grow up and live, then it wasn't allowed.Better to be a socialist grass than a capitalist country seedling. If she raised more, then she was latter.It wasn't easy.\"Our pigs should be able to be slaughtered this year. By then I guess it should be about two hundred jins.\" Lin Qing He inspected the two well-raised pigs and stated.\"Approximately that.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.\"Er Wa, come and dig wild vegetables with me.\" Lin Qing He shouted.She called for Er Wa, and San Wa also tagged along. The trio went out carrying the basket.Zhou Qing Bai looked at the mother and sons with softened brows but immediately sighed again.He wouldn't let his wife do the business, so his wife wouldn't let him get close to her. From the looks of it, there was no sign of softening from that hardened heart.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72. Sleep next doorDoes she want him to be a monk forever?At the thought of this, Zhou Qing Bai frowned. This was definitely not acceptable. It wasn't normal for the husband and wife to not have intercourse.No need doubt it, it was abnormal!But he unable to get his wife's approval.Zhou Qing Bai stared at the two well-developed pigs and became a little worried.It wasn't just Zhou Qing Bai fretting, Lin Qinghe was even more anxious. Now they have reached this season, where all was rejuvenated. The day before yesterday, when she went to collect meat, Mei Jie inquired with her when she'll start to take the meat. That side was ready but Zhou Qing Bai won't agree to let her do it.Speaking of this, Lin Qing He admired Zhou Qing Bai in this aspect greatly. He endured all that suffering and still could maintain his position. This was a skill.However, she doesn't have any time to waste with him, so Lin Qing He intends to give him a little taste of carrot tonight and force him to nod in agreement!That's right. Since ancient times, the sensual vale leads to the hero's grave as the honey-trap scheme never fails.* She gave him some benefit and if he refuses to agree, she will turn on him!Lin Qing He, who had made up her mind, filled a basket full of wild vegetables with the kids.These wild vegetables were particularly good for eating or feeding pigs.Later on, they can forage wild pigweed, which was an excellent feed for the pigs.It was for her own ones, even if the team owned it, so Lin Qing He was willing to gather pigweed. Mainly to save the grains.After digging a basket of wild vegetables, Lin Qing He led the kids back home. It was just a little past nine o'clock. Zhou Qing Bai had already gone to work at this time.Lin Qinghe wrapped pork and shepherd's purse dumplings and set aside some for dinner tonight. The rest was fed to the pig, gotta let the pigs consume some inorganic salt.Only she, Er Wa, and San Wa were home now. And Da Wa? Once school opened in spring, off he went. Zhou Qing Bai personally took him to the team's elementary school.After Lin Qing He's training over the winter, Da Wa can keep up with the progression with his current knowledge. Lin Qing He wasn't worried.In order to get the kid to peacefully go to school, she sewed him a school bag. As for his father's military bag, Lin Qing He was unwilling to let him ruin it.The newly sewed schoolbag had Da Wa overjoyed. Without his mother's nagging, he happily when to register with his father.From the beginning of spring to now, he had adapted very well.At noon, Da Wa returns from school. At the same, Zhou Qing Bai get off work.During this period, it was very exhausting. Lin Qing He paid no heed to Da Wa, but she was considerate to Zhou Qing Bai, who supported the whole family.She had prepared a cool face wash, as well as warm water.Zhou Qing Bai had got to know his wife's temper since he came back, really proud. If he wants her to bow her head, it was very unlikely.It was evident that she wanted something, judging by her thoughtful action today.Was she aiming to give him the last attack? Can he bear the gentle knife of his wife?But no matter what the man thought, he was very calm and enjoying the meticulous care from his wife.Pork and shepherd's purse dumplings were for lunch. The taste was really delicious and fresh.At this time, shepherd's purse was really fragrant and tender. Lin Qing He also liked to eat it.After the family was full, they began their noon break. Lin Qing He began to assess what Da Wa had learned in the morning, then reinforce the knowledge into him, and lastly gave him a few questions to do.\"Mother, why do I feel that you better at making questions than our teacher.\" Zhou Da Wa sighed at the sight of these difficult questions.Lin Qing He mentally answered, 'This was an important part of, I, your mother's life. My total score for the college entrance examination was more than six hundred. During college, I was a top scholar, who received a scholarship while under the work-study program.'However, Lin Qing He said: \"Treasure your chance to study now. You don't know how much your mother, I wanted to study back then but your grandpa and granny refused to let me. This bit was what I learned after many difficulties, so I'm not blind with my eyes open.\"Hearing this, Zhou Qingbai couldn\u2019t help but look at her. He had always known that his wife recognized the word. When they just matched up, she had mentioned this, but for so many years, she had never written a single letter to him.He had seen it, her words were very beautiful. An average college student may not necessarily be as beautiful as her words.Although Zhou Qing Bai didn't say anything, Lin Qing He understood what his gaze meant.Lin Qing He just caught a glimpse and then removed her eyes to express that she didn't know anything. She didn't do it, so why should she take the blame.But the man's gaze behind her was too strong, making her nervous and uneasy.\"It's getting pretty warm now, you brothers will sleep next door.\" Lin Qing He coughed and said.As soon as these words came out, she felt the man's gaze become more unsettling.Da Wa was first to protest: \"I want to sleep here!\"\"I heard Yang Yang said that he sleeps with his father and mother.\" This was Er Wa's response.Yang Yang was Zhou Yang, Eldest Sister-in-law's son.\"Yang Yang have no choice. There is only one Kang. Our family got two. We can't let next door's one collect dust.\" Lin Qing He said rightly.\"What about San Wa?\" Da Wa pointed out.\"You're comparing yourself with a little brother who can't speak smoothly. Really?\" Lin Qing He expressed to him in contempt.At once Da Wa had nothing to say. He kicked Er Wa, motioning him to say a few words.\"Mother, you can't bias toward San Wa. You gave birth to all of us,\" Er Wa said.\"Fine, San Wa sleeps with you over there, If he wet the bed and you dare to hit him, I will hit you!\" Lin Qing He snorted.Since she came, San Wa had wet the bed twice. It was just two times and it had got on Da Wa's pants and stained Er Wa as well. The brothers were so angry that they wanted to hit San Wa.Da Wa hadn't forgotten about that matter and uttered: \"Forget it. Let him sleep here.\"\"It's fine for San Wa to sleep here. My elder brother and I will go to bed next door.\" Er Wa nodded.San Wa hugged his mother, expressing that he doesn't want to sleep with his two brothers. He wanted to sleep with his mother.\"Alright, then it's settled happily.\" Lin Qing He declared.Then as soon as she looked up, she met Zhou Qing Bai's deep gaze. Lin Qinghe's heartbeat was somewhat accelerated. Wit a calm face, she said: \"What are you looking at? Haven't you seen it before?\"\"Do your homework next door.\" Zhou Qing Bai ordered Da Wa.Da Wa observed his father. He felt that he couldn't get his way this time and immediately took his homework with him. Er Wa saw his father looking over. He discerningly planned to retreat out of the room, when he heard his father spoke. \"Bring your little brother over.\"\"No, he'll pester me!\" Da Wa shouted from his side.However, no matter he protested, Er Wa brought San Wa over. Sure enough, San Wa demanded pen and copybook from him so he could write and draw by himself, otherwise, he would cry!\"I remembered now. My pot has not been scrubbed yet.\" Lin Qing He wanted to escape. The man's gaze was burning, so much it can burn people!\"I scrubbed it.\" Zhou Qing Bai pulled her hand, Lin Qing He spun and landed in his arms.*I'm not sure if I translate the meaning right, \u6e29\u67d4\u4e61\u82f1\u96c4\u51a2\uff0c\u7f8e\u4eba\u8ba1\u767e\u8bd5\u4e0d\u723d.

    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73. Claim a kissLin Qing He was sitting in Zhou Qing Bai's arms. The forever calm her blushed slightly from this. She wanted to get but was restrained by Zhou Qing Bai.\"What are you doing? It's broad daylight. They will come in later!\" Lin Qing He said.\"Letting the children sleep by themselves, huh?\" Zhou Qing Bai ignored that and stared at her.The slightly emphasized \"huh\" made Lin Qing He felt a slight overbearing CEO feel.\"They have grown up, it's natural to sleep on their own. That's right, you are sleeping with them tonight.\" Lin Qing He mouth uttered the opposite intention of her heart.\"Wife, I want you.\" Zhou Qing Bai dropped a kiss between her necks and said in a hoarse voice.\"You can save it. It's not dark yet,\" Lin Qing He quickly blurted.Sitting in his arms, she could feel the man's enthusiasm for her very clearly. But, what time was it ah! There were three little ones in the next room, who can come in at any time!Zhou Qing Bai said nothing, but his hands lingered around her waist.Lin Qing He acted composed as she patted his shoulder: \"Release me quickly. Your sweaty body will soon suffocate me.\"Zhou Qing Bai sniffed himself. He certainly smelled sweaty, so he could only reluctantly let go of her.Still, he was delighted. His wife said, wait until tonight.\"Go wash yourself, change clothes, and nap.\" Lin Qing He usheredKnowing he'll have meat tonight, Zhou Qing Bai naturally did not object. He went to the yard, took a cold wash up, and changed his clothes. Instead of Lin Qing He washing it for him, he washed it himself and then basked it in the sun.He wanted to go back to his room to get intimate with his wife again. Even if he didn't do anything during the day, it was still very good.But as soon as he returned to the room, he saw his wife had simply hidden in the next room.\"Quickly go to sleep. You'll have to head to work soon,\" Lin Qing He waved her hand to send him away.Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her rather grudgingly. Lin Qing He expressed she didn't see it. So Zhou Qing Bai could only go back to rest on his own.Er Wa, the smarty-pant, grinned: \"Mother, Father wants you to accompany him.\"\"Father is that big and why accompany him?\" Da Wa exclaimed.\"Want company.\" San Wa looked up and seriously repeated.Lin Qing He became \u56e7. Then her eyes twinkled as she spoke: \"Should Mother accompany you guys or your Father? Choose for yourself.\"\"With me!\" San Wa looked at her.\"I also want Mother to accompany us.\" Er Wa smiled.Da Wa declared that he grew up and don't need Mother's company.\"Hurry up and do your questions. Not allowed to sleep if you don't do it.\" Lin Qing He glared.Da Wa racked his brains to answer the questions. Even if he got three out of the five questions right, he still dared to complain that her question was harder than his teacher. Lin Qing He taught him once, and then he corrected it.\"I plan to go to the county city this week. If you study hard, then you will get a share of the malted milk powder I bought for your brothers. If not, then you can watch them drink.\" Lin Qing He pushed.\"I study every day, and I am the class's study committee member!\" Da Wa pointed out.\"Next semester strives to become the class monitor. A study committee member is enough to make you proud?.\" Lin Qing He said.\"What's the benefit of being the class monitor?\" Dawa said.\"Being the class monitor, you get a lot of respect in the class. But that doesn't benefit me. You decide whether you want to be one. I will not lose anything if you aren't.\" Lin Qing He smirked.Da Wa felt that it wasn't easy to fool his mother.\"But seeing you like this, I also plan to study and see if there is any chance to continue my education.\" Lin Qing He remarked.\"As a mother, you still want to study?\" Da Wa looked at her in surprise.Er Wa too. San Wa continued to doodle his own thing.\"People live till they're old and learn till they're old. If not, they will be eliminated by society, Not only will one continue to learn in life, it will become one's own ability when learned. They can be used wherever they go. Even if you three aren't filial to me in the future, I still have the ability to feed myself.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand.\"You won't take care of Father?\" Da Wa immediately mentioned.\"Your father, let him continue doing farm work. Doesn't he like to do farm work? Then let him do it all his life. At that time, I'm still a youthful flower, while he is like an old man. He would feel ashamed when going out. Maybe then, people assume I'm his daughter.\u201d Lin Qing He waved her hand.Zhou Qing Bai, who could not sleep on his own and was planning to come to accompany his wife and children, heard such words. (T/N: Somehow he eavesdrop at... the right time)At once, he became dumbfounded.\"And Zhou Dawa, aren't you paying attention to the wrong point?\" Lin Qing He uttered as she pinched Da Wa's ear.Da Wa threw his homework and screamed: \"It hurts, it hurts. Mother, I'm in pain!\"\"Do you know you're wrong?\" Lin Qing He questioned.\"I know.\" Da Wa immediately said.\"Where are you wrong? Tell me.\" Lin Qinghe said indifferently.\"I don't know if my little brothers are filial or not, but I will definitely be filial!\" Da Wa swore.\"Eldest Brother, don't talk nonsense. I will definitely display filial piety in the future.\" Er Wa shot a glance at him.\"I dote Mother.\" San Wa also gave a mouthful of flattery.Lin Qing He let Da Wa off. She then hugged Sanwa and kissed him: \"This is Mother's good son.\"Zhou Qing Bai did not enter, instead, he went back to lie down and rested for a while. On this side, Lin Qing He napped with her three sons. She dared not go over to his side and provoke him. Otherwise, the security of the daylight may not guarantee that this man, who had abstained for so long, won't do something.Once he woke up, Zhou Qing Bai went to work. Before leaving, he claimed a kiss from Lin Qing He before going out.Lin Qing He was a little dissatisfied with herself, as her legs had actually buckled!As soon as she turned her head, she saw Er Wa staring at her with wide eyes. Then he ran over and demanded a kiss.\"Cough cough.\" Lin Qing He coughed dryly before kissing on Er Wa's forehead. She pervasively said: \"One each.\"Er Wa bobbed his head in satisfaction, and uttered, \"It's the first time I see Father kissing Mother.\"\"Your father kissing Mother, indicates we have a good relationship. You can't go outside and say it, understand?\" Lin Qing He warned.\"Of course, I won't. I heard Gang Tie tell people that his parents were building a human pyramid on the kang, and people laughed at him for a long time.\" Er Wa nodded in understanding.Lin Qing He rewarded him with head petting and said: \"Then I allow you to order a dish tonight if we got the stuff at home.\"\"I want to eat soup noodle!\" Er Wa's eyes lit up.\"How about adding a sweet and sour sauerkraut and a fragrant poached egg?\" Lin Qing He suggested.\"OK.\" Er Wa nodded in satisfaction.Having noodles wasn't a big issue. Tonight they'll eat noodles tonight.Lin Qing He went to the kitchen and busied away. After forming the dough, she let it rest. She came over to the backyard and checked around.In the garden, the planting area can be expanded this year, including leeks, celery, onion root, green beans, green cucumbers, and the likes.The most planted was the tomato in her yard. It was really a lot, as her family likes to eat it.The tomatoes at this time were also pure organic tomatoes. It was particularly delicious, not only as a vegetable but also as fruits. Perfectly sour and sweet.Not long after planting, it will take about two or three months to get some fruit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74. Drifting off courseThe current season was of a variety of wild vegetables. Besides this, there wasn't much good to eat. The recorded temporary shortage was this current time period.In the evening, they had noodles as requested by Er Wa.Diced sauerkraut with minced meat leftover that was fried in oil, which then was sprinkled on the noodles. And finally served with a fragrant poached egg.This bowl of noodles was really fragrant.At least four men in the family have no doubt about her culinary skill.After eating and drinking to their content, Lin Qing He sent Da Wa to wash the dishes.Since the cold began to fade, this chore was Da Wa's responsibility. At the start, Da Wa had quite a resentment, but now he got used to it.Er Wa wasn't left idle either. He cleaned the room and the yard. These were his jobs.As for San Wa, he was still small. As long as he doesn't make trouble, she temporarily didn't count on him.After the work was done, Lin Qing He took them out to eat and wander. Zhou Qing Bai was at home, feeding pigs.At this time, they get fed once before they get fed again after 9 o'clock. Then the next feed was at 4 or 5 the next day.When Mother Zhou came over, Lin Qing He and her three sons had gone to visit Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi.When she saw that her son was feeding pigs, she asked, \"Your wife doesn't do the feeding?\"\"I'm can do it.\" Zhou Qing Bai said, \"Mother, have you eaten yet?\"\"I have.\" Seeing her youngest son like this, it was impossible for Mother Zhou to not be distressed. She voiced out: \"You worked all day. Go home and rest well.\"\"This is nothing. My wife has no free time at home.\" She watched Er Wa and San Wa, prepared all kinds of delicious food, and made sure that everything was clean at home. Once exhausted Zhou Qing Bai returned home from work, he no longer felt tired.As for these, it was like what he said, he can do it.What's more, his wife had clearly stated it at the beginning of raising them, she would occasionally help out and for the most part, she won't intervene.In fact, this smell was quite strong. It was fine for him to manage it by himself. If he really let his wife do it then he won't be pleased.He would rather do more than want his wife to get hands-on.After feeding the pigs, Zhou Qing Bai cleaned the pigpen and then sprinkled lime powder again. This was requested by his wife. She said it was used for disinfection.After sorting out the pigpen, he moved onto cleaning the chicken shed.Although the chicks were still small, he changed the straw every day as his wife love cleanliness. He also needed to sprinkle lime powder for disinfection.Although Mother Zhou couldn't bear for her son to undergo such stress, she didn't say anything. She also knew Fourth's wife's temper.She just asked: \"What are these?\"\"Lime powder. My wife read in the book and said that it has a disinfecting effect. Mother, do you want to take some back. At this time, the chicken gets sick easily.\" Zhou Qing Bai replied.Mother Zhou nodded. It was just a little lime powder.\"Are you getting used to it lately?\" Mother Zhou watched her youngest son.Her youngest son hadn't done any farm work in his life. At a young age, he went to work as a soldier. Now he had retired, which made people feel distressed for him.Of course, this was what Mother Zhou thought. Zhou Qing Bai had strong adaptability: \"Everything is fine. Mother, you don't need to worry about me.\"After talking with her youngest son for a while, Mother Zhou went back.Lin Qing He walked around with her three sons before going home when it was almost time.\"It's getting late. Wash up and get ready to sleep.\" Zhou Qing Bai directed this at the kids. However, Lin Qing He had a feeling that this was intended for her.When she thought of this, she looked at Zhou Qing Bai. As anticipated, she saw his pair of deep eyes staring at her.That gaze was full of aggression and wildness, which makes one's legs soften.\"What time is it now?\" Lin Qing He uttered.Even though she said this, she still sent the kids to wash up.At the sight of the small wash basin, Lin Qinghe enquired: \"Are there any carpenters near here? We need to make a big one for the brothers. One pot full and finish up, that way they don't need to do it one by one.\"\"I'll find one.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Lin Qing He nodded in response and washed the brothers one by one. Da Wa was six and knew to be embarrassed. Lin Qing He said: \"Then do it yourself. Wash cleanly, or I will ask your father to come and rub off a layer of skin. \"The customs here weren't so diligent in tidiness. But her family was subject to her rules. Since it wasn't cold anymore, they got to do it once a day.Da Wa happily washed himself. After washing, it was Er Wa's turn. Lastly was San Wa. After the brothers come out refresh from the wash-up, it was Lin Qing He's turn.Then these clothes were washed by Zhou Qing Bai.That's right. Lin Qing He, the ruthless woman, mercilessly got the man, who had a busy day outside, to wash the clothes.Zhou Qing Bai didn't have any objection at all.After washing the clothes, he washed up. If he had it his way, he wouldn't use hot water. However, he listened to his wife and added a little bit, so the temperature wasn't cool.After washing up, he wore a pair of pants, the ones Lin Qing He made it for him. He washed his clothes and hung them up. Once done, he came to the children's room.Da Wa was doing homework, Er Wa was learning to count, and San Wa was holding a pen as he continued drawing.Lin Qing He didn't mind that he was small, she taught him to draw. Must say, San Wa made decent progress, but what he drew was a bit abstract.\"I will buy two vests for you to wear, the next time I go to the county city?\" Lin Qing He looked at him.\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai gave a casual response. He actually had enough clothes. Within the first two months of the New Year, his wife made a few set for him when she was idle.It was also convenient for him to change. She had said he couldn't lie on the kang sweaty.So he had a lot of clothes. If she wants to buy more for him, he wouldn't refuse.\"I also want to study, but those learning materials aren't easy to get. Do you have a way?\" Lin Qing He looked at him.\"What kinds do you want?\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.\"I want everything from elementary school to middle school to high school. I have nothing else to do at home. Once you bring it back, I can study by myself.\" Lin Qing He answered.\"I'll find some time to get it for you.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.\"Thank you.\" Lin Qing He smiled.\"It's pretty late.\" Zhou Qing Bai's gaze secretly hinted to her, and very suggestively spoke.Lin Qing He's mind said, 'It's just after six o'clock. What late?'While she voiced out: \"Da Wa's homework has not been completed. Er Wa has not recited to seventy. And San Wa has not been finished drawing Fei Ying yet.Soon, Da Wa's homework was finished, and it was all correct. Plus, he passed all the questions she had given.Da Wa was smug, making Lin Qing He have the urge to hit someone. Usually, he was wrong and at this critical moment, he can do it all. Not helping her delaying time at all!\"Er Wa can make it up tomorrow. Now go to bed with your elder brother. San Wa, come to bed with Father.\" Zhou Qing Bai gave the final decree and carried San Wa.Da Wa and Er Wa expressed that it was too early, they can't fall asleep. But a gaze from their father had them behave and honestly agreed to go to bed now.Lin Qing He was led back by Zhou Qing Bai. Her heart was slightly unsettled. She did not intend to come at him with real guns, just giving some sweet sample. Why did she feel like it was drifting off course?If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75. Can't be provokedShe won't go into detail on how her plan went astray.In short, Lin Qing He seized to the last trace of reason to resist Zhou Qing Bai at the crucial moment and force Zhou Qing Bai to agree to her pork reselling.Zhou Qing Bai was sweating at the time. His wife won't let him succeed. At such a time, she forced him to nod and promise to let her do her stuff.Can you name any hero who can withstand the beauty's torture at the most critical moment?None exist.Zhou Qing Bai was an ordinary mortal as well, he can't resist his wife's attack.Although he was forced to agree, the following punishment had Lin Qing He regretting to provoke this man.She didn't know how many times she repeatedly woke up and fallen asleep in exhaustion during the night. In short, he didn't stop. It was only when it was well into the night, did he rest.The next day Lin Qing He woke up after eight o'clock. When she woke up and thought last night's battle, she was slightly frightened.Sure enough, can't afford to provoke a man, who hadn't been close to the female for too long.At this time, there was the voice of Er Wa and Mother Zhou outside. During this time, Da Wa had already gone to school and Zhou Qing Bai had gone to work.Lin Qing He quickly got off the Kang.Last night, she fell asleep straight away from exhaustion. It was Zhou Qing Bai, who helped her tidy up. Butt after getting off the Kang, she found that her legs were a little weak!Lin Qing He's face flushed when she recalled Zhou Qing Bai doing this and that last night.She had to admit that there's no worry about happiness (a.k.a sex) for the rest of her life. Her own man was really strong and fierce.After a spring-ish pondering, Lin Qing He refreshed herself.Mother Zhou peeled peanuts in the yard as she talked to Er Wa and San Wa.\"Mother had come.\" Lin Qing He wasn't embarrassed. Why did she sleep in so late? It was all thanks to Zhou Qing Bai's doing last night. Go blame Zhou Qing Bai, it had nothing to do with her.\"You woke up ah.\" Apparently, Mother Zhou was a little angry. Her man had to go to work and the children were still young. She only got up at this hour now. Was there such behavior?\"En, San Wa's father was uncomfortable last night. I had to serve him all night. Only slept after twelve o'clock, so I woke up late.\" Lin Qing He explained without blushing and jitters.Mother Zhou halted for a while before her tone subsided: \"Then it was hard on you. Old Fourth was much better in the morning.\"Like she said, it turned out that there was this reason. It was fine to sleep in during the winter. So why did she wake so late at this time?\"It should that he hasn't adapted to farm work yet. I told him not to work today and take a day off, but he didn't listen to me.\" Lin Qing He remarked.\"It's not easy to support a family,\" Mother Zhou said.\"It really isn't, so I allowed him to raise pigs and chickens at home.\" Lin Qing He nodded.Mother Zhou choked.\"Have you both eaten?\" Lin Qing He turned to Er Wa and San Wa.\"We have. Mother, go eat.\" Er Wa bobbed.The breakfast was obviously made by Zhou Qing Bai. He cooked millet porridge. The side dish was much simpler, just pickled veg.Sure enough, if she didn't get up to make breakfast, everything was simple.Lin Qing He didn't mind. As she had the millet porridge with pickled veg, she couldn't wonder about Zhou Qingbai. Last night, he used a lot of energy and he just had this for breakfast. How can he have the endurance?\"Mother, there's no meat at home. I will go and check if I can buy some meat to nourish the kids' father. You look after Er Wa and San Wa.\" Lin Qing He swiftly finished up, washed the dishes, and voiced out.\"Go.\" Mother Zhou was also distressed her youngest son and concurred with this.Today, Mother Zhou didn't head out to work. After all, she got so many sons and daughters-in-law. No one dared to say anything if this old bone rest.Lin Qing He rode the bicycle over to Mei Jie.The main thing was to pass the fact that she'll begin to take the meat tomorrow. Lin Qing He had it all planned out. She'll collect the meat, store it in her space, and save a bit before she takes it to the county city for in one go. With just a few jin every time to the county city, she really didn't want to go so far.Mei Jie was ecstatic to see her coming here. Her side was already prepared. She whispered, \"I thought it was your man didn't agree.\"\"Actually, he didn't. He's too upright. I finally got him to approve. Once he did, I immediately came to find you, Mei Jie.\" Lin Qing He explained.\"He didn't approve?\" Sister Mei couldn't help utter.\"Now he does. As long as there's no problem on your side, there will be no problem on my side.\" Lin Qing He quietly spoke.\"You can rest assured.\" Mei Jie nodded.\"When will I drop by tomorrow?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"Come by at three o'clock in the morning. Old Lao Chen will wait for you over there.\" Mei Jie immediately responded.Three o'clock in the morning?Lin Qing He mentally muttered, it was really a pain.But she still agreed. When she gets back to the village after picking up the meat at three o'clock in the morning, it'll be almost four o'clock. It's pretty safe.Lin Qing He bought some stuff and then cycled back. Halfway there, she dumped some pork, ribs, and eggs out when no one was at sight.There weren't many eggs at home.Once she carried these things back home, Mother Zhou said: \"Then I will go home first.\"Lin Qing He nodded and handed Mother Zhou a piece of meat about 200g. Mother Zhou refused: \"Keep it for yourselves.\"\"Mother, take it. You occasionally come to help me watch the boys, this way no one at old Zhou's house will say nonsense.\" Lin Qing He insisted.Mother Zhou said: \"I watch at my own grandsons, who dares to say anything?\"\"That's hard to tell. Take it, mother. I still have some here.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand.Mother Zhou had the intention to persuade her to save a little money, but now, she dropped it. It was always bought back for her son and her three grandsons.\"Mother, there are so many things to do at home. Where have you been?\" Second Sister-in-law couldn't help but uttered when she saw her coming back.Eldest Sister-in-law's pregnancy was pretty far along, she should be about to give birth in this period. So she was at home instead of working.Third Sister-in-law had gone to work. Although Little Zhou Dong was still young, he was left at home under Eldest Sister-in-law's care. She took time out to come back and breastfeed him.Second Sister-in-law did not work today. As her period was very painful, she did not go.Second sister-in-law had not planned to do chores since her mother-in-law was also home and she could leave it to her mother-in-law. Unexpectedly, her mother-in-law went to Fourth's house to help watch the children.\"This is from Fourth's wife.\" Initially, Mother Zhou felt Fourth's wife was overthinking, not anymore at this moment.Looking at Second's wife's reaction, was this not discontent?Seeing this piece of meat, Second Sister-in-law had no complaints. Beaming, she expressed: \"Fourth Sister-in-law is generous, to give such a large piece of meat.\"\"She said that I helped out in watching Er Wa and San Wa and let me bring this back.\" Mother Zhou clarified.That was for Second Sister-in-law to hear. Second Sister-in-law just twitched her lip.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76. SarcasmAs for whatever happened in old Zhou's house, Lin Qing He had no interest at all.Those meats were to show filial piety to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou, as well as blocking Second Sister-in-law's mouth. Killing two birds with one stone.For noon, she planned to eat steamed rice. Lin Qing He boiled eight-nine eggs and then peeled the eggshell. Followed by, chopping pork ribs and cutting pork belly. Which was then placed in a casserole and stewed with soy sauce.Then there was oil countering stir-fried vegetable and a light shrimp skin and seaweed soup.Of course, these were timed to when Zhou Qing Bai got home. Before this, Lin Qing He had a lot of things to do since Zhou Qing Bai was not at home. Although he had fed it once in the morning, she had to feed it again.As the two pigs' appetites become larger and larger, the food requirement also increased.Lin Qing He planned to take an afternoon nap, so she took Er Wa and San Wa to dig wild vegetables.Zhou Qing Bai came back at noon. His cheeks turned red from the sun. Lin Qing He felt displeased at the sight of it. She fetched water for him to wash his face, and then let him bathe himself and change his clothes. Only then did the whole family eat.Pork belly, ribs, and boiled eggs stewed in soy sauce. Soup sprinkled on top go well with the rice.Lin Qing He urged Zhou Qing Bai to eat more. Zhou Qing Bai's eyes twinkled when he looked at her. Lin Qing He didn't understand what he was delighted about, so she ushered him to eat and go nap after eating.As anticipated, Zhou Qing Bai was content with his lunch. Needless to say how good his wife's culinary was.\"Da Wa cleans up the dishes. Er Wa tidy up.\" Lin Qing He finished eating and sent them to work.The brothers had already gotten used to it and began to busy away. San Wa went to play with Fei Ying, while Lin Qing He returned to her room.Zhou Qing Bai was waiting for her. When she came in, his gaze followed her. Lin Qing He coughed and stated, \"I have already set things up with Mei Jie, you can't go back on your words.\"Zhou Qing Bai pulled her into his arms and said, \"I will only give you one chance. If one mishap happens, you will end it.\"\"OK.\" Lin Qing He cheerfully concurred.With the space, nothing will happen in this life.\"I hurt you last night. Is it better?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked in a muffled tone.Lin Qing He's face was slightly embarrassed. Was she injured? She didn't feel it.But to prevent the wolf from coming again at night, she said: \"It's not better yet.\"\"I'll check.\" Zhou Qing Bai intended to inspect her.Lin Qing He blushed: \"What are you doing in broad daylight? The kids are outside.\"\"The door is closed, they can't come in.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.But still, how could Lin Qing He let him check it? Definitely won't allow it ah! In the end, she got pressed down by Zhou Qing Bai on the bed and kissed until she was dizzy and gasping.\"Wife.\" Zhou Qing Bai lowly called.Lin Qing He saw the hidden fire in his eyes and blurted: \"Last night you been doing for so long, and you have been working all morning today. You still got energy?\"\"I do.\" Zhou Qing Bai gazed passionately at her.\"Even if you do, I order you to rest.\" Lin Qing He glared.It was undoubted that this rough guy had good physical strength. Just by looking at his physique, one can tell. No man in the village had a figure like him.Don\u2019t assume she didn\u2019t know that those big girls and young wives out there look looked at him with starry eyes and their hostility toward her was huge.So what if the hostility was huge? This man isn't someone they can covet, he's Lin Qing He's!\"I'm fine without a rest.\" Zhou Qing Bai kissed her and wanted to get on top.\"I haven't rested enough. Last night, you were like you haven't seen meat for hundreds of years. I'm not well yet.\" Lin Qing He expressed with a weak face.At this, Zhou Qing Bai could only give up and said, \"Then take a good rest.\"Thinking of what happened last night, Zhou Qing Bai was also a bit guilty. He was indeed rash last night, but he couldn't help it either. His wife was so tempting that he couldn't help wanting it again and again.Lin Qing He was relieved and then leaned softly into his arms.After the two were becoming husband and wife for real last night, she truly possessed a feeling this guy was her man.\"Although you're earning work points, you don't have to drain your mind and bones. You can be lazy if you can be lazy. Our family won't starve. You don't have to work that hard.\" Lin Qing He voiced.\"Not hard.\" Zhou Qing Bai shook his head.For a strong man like him, doing farm work was really nothing.\"What is not hard? It's not wrong to call those laborious work. I can tell you now, if you do not protect your body and become incapable in the future, I may kick you away.\" Lin Qing He snapped.\"Then you can try and see if you can kick me.\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her.Lin Qing He raised her hand to caress his face again: \"You're still young, so it's not yet. But Zhou Qing Bai, how years of youth will your face have when it's beaten by the wind and glared by the sun outside?\"\"It's enough for man to be able to shoulder the responsibility, his face is not important.\" Zhou Qing Bai maintained.He said this so manly. Lin Qing He gave in to the impulse, dived in for a kiss. Zhou Qing Bai was ignited by her.But knowing that she was still uncomfortable, he was not willing to touch her.\"I based on looks, so don't turn yourself into an old man. I don't like that.\" Lin Qing He expressed.Zhou Qing Bai uttered an 'En', it was considered as a promise.What's more, he knew it in his mind. The reason why his wife likes him was probably that he was good-looking.Because from time to time, she would sometimes look at him in a daze, and occasionally her eyes would glow at the sight of his figure.So he knew how to attract his wife.\"Sleep.\" Zhou Qing Bai hugged her waist and whispered.Lin Qing He let him nap by himself. She came out to supervise Da Wa on his homework. Er Wa had to make up for yesterday's counting and San Wa needed to wash his hands and face to prepare for a nap.Zhou Qingbai was indeed tired, so he slept in the room with the lingering fragrance of his wife.Work began again at one in the afternoon.Lin Qing He was frustrated. Fortunately, the weather was good. and the sun was not so strong. But if they reach June or July, it won't be easy. It'll be simply exhausting to death.When Da Wa went to school, Lin Qing He brought Er Wa and San Wa out to dig wild vegetables and left the house to Fei Ying's care.Must say, with such an excellent home watcher like Fei Ying, Lin Qing He was more reassured to go out.Although all the majority of important valuables in the family were stored in her space, there were still other things.At this time, many people came out to forage wild vegetables. Lin Qing He led Er Wa and San Wa and ran into several other women who came out to dig wild vegetables.\"Oh, Qing Bai's wife has also come out to dig wild vegetables. You used to look down on these wild vegetables and never eat them.\" One of the women, who was about the same age as Lin Qing He but had a much older face than Lin Qinghe, spoke.This was clearly sarcastically remarking that Lin Qing He was now a fallen phoenix.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77. It'll be strange if you're not tired.\"The past is the past. Now is now. The time has changed, right? People need to be discerning, be proud when you should be proud, but once the proud moment is over, it's time to scale back.\" Lin Qing He laughed lightly.\"Yeah. Now You can't be proud.\" Woman sniggered.\"It's better than some people have never been proud before.\" Lin Qing He unsmilingly smiled at her.These words had the woman called Wang Ling changed her complexion: \"What do you mean by that?\"\"You don't have a brain? Is that why you can't understand? Just you are only is worthy to ridicule me? Even if my family Qing Bai retires, I don't have to do farm work. He did everything to let me enjoy the happiness at home. Do you have my kind of days? \"Lin Qing He sneered.Wang Ling was reduced to speechlessly due to anger.\"With your life, if it was me, I couldn\u2019t live long ago. You still have face to chirp in front of me? Since your family can't afford a mirror, don't you know to piss and look at your old face with that? Near my age, you look more than ten years older than me and still have the face to come to mock me in my face. Who gave you the courage? Er Wa, tell her, what our family ate for noon.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Stewed pork belly and eggs accompanied by white rice. Especially tasty!\" Er Wa immediately responded.\"Did you hear?\" Lin Qing He threw Wang Ling a glance.Wang Ling was already trembling with anger, but she also knew that Lin Qing He was not easy to bully. If she kept arguing, she was the one to suffer. So she turned away and left.Several other women were also a little embarrassed. Lin Qing He didn't make trouble for them and took Er Wa and San Wa away to dig wild vegetables.This made them breathe out in relief.\"What was Wang Ling thinking? Didn't she think twice about who to pick on for no reason? Is this person a good target to provoke.\" One of them muttered.\"Isn't it cause of jealousy and want to make a fool of Lin Qing He?\" Another's lip twitched.\"What is there to laugh at? Even though Zhou Qing Bai retired, which woman in the village can compare with her, she has never been to the field since marrying Zhou Qing Bai.\" A third also interjected.\"Who could deny that? I heard that she bought meat back to eat every three days or so. She can really bear to.\"\"Looking at Da Wa and his brothers, you can tell. This year they have grown a lot. San Wa is almost a little fatty, like the blessed baby in the painting.\"\"...\"Several women were talking, as they were digging wild vegetables in this area.As for Lin Qing He, she brought Er Wa and San Wa to forage on the other side. She dismissed Wang Ling from her mind. This person had a good relationship with Second Sister-in-law and often gossiped. As long as she didn't jab out in front of her, she won't care. This time, her guts got bigger and dare to come at her. Naturally, she won't be polite.The mother and sons gathered wild vegetables as they played. Because the spring rain fell a few days ago and it was a light rain that fell for four-five days, Lin Qing He went up the mountain to pick mushrooms.With Er Wa and San Wa with her, naturally, they will not go deep. They just searched for them on the edge. Still, they have found a lot.The mother and sons came out for more than an hour, and it can be considered a hefty harvest back.The unbroken mushrooms were put on the sieve to dry and act as spare. Those scattered and crushed, she'll fry the mushrooms tonight's dinner. They were very fresh and delicious.The wild vegetables just need to be washed and fried. There was still some pork, ribs, and eggs leftover in the pot from lunch. At night, she'll fry two dishes. Then steam some cornmeal mantou, add a bowl of soup and it should be enough.Lin Qing He took Er Wa and San Wa home, let them pour the water for themselves to drink, and gave them milk candy each before they run off to play.She started cooking the pig food.The majority of the wild vegetables were for the pigs. The pigs in her family were really well-breeded. By the end of the year on slaughter day, two hundred jins was definitely not a problem.If they can produce two hundred jins of meat, it was definitely a big fat pig in this era, and get extra points.And when the time comes to divide the meat, it'll be distributed to their own family.Although the smell was a little pungent, Lin Qing He can still bear it. After all, she was only responsible for feeding. It was Zhou Qing Bai's job to clean up.In fact, she fed them twice a day, once in the morning and once at noon. The rest was fed by Zhou Qing Bai.Moreover, raising pigs wasn't the only source of points. If pig manure was given to the team, it will be counted as points. These were all handled by Zhou Qing Bai. Lin Qing He will never participate.She got a man to rely on, so she won't do it. She was such a hypocritical person, needless to say she knew that in her own heart.Otherwise, why she would care about Zhou Qing Bai, this poor man.After feeding the pigs and watering the vegetable garden, the jobs were mostly done.Lin Qing He washed her hands and face before entering the kitchen to see if the dough rise. It was almost there, so she didn't touch it. She took out the remaining fabric at home and made a pair of slippers for Zhou Qing Bai to wear at home.At four o'clock, Da Wa came back from school. When he got home, he drank water and ran out to play. Lin Qing He didn't mind about the brothers heading out from time to time. As long as they finished what was assigned to them, whatever they play, she rarely interferes as long as it wasn't dangerous.When it was almost time, Lin Qing He put all the half-complete fabric, needle, thread, and scissors away.She headed to the kitchen and started to work on the family's dinner.Cornmeal buns.Lin Qing He also intends to make whole wheat bran mantou. Apparently, the kids don't like it very much. She was okay, while Zhou Qing Bai had no objection.As the kids didn\u2019t like it, she only made it once. But she still had to make it a few times next month. That way, they'll know how great it is to eat white mantou and cornmeal mantou.And prevent spoiling them, and be unable to eat any bitterness.Stepmother Lin Qing He planned it this way, while her hand swiftly prepare the ingredients for the evening.Mushrooms don't need any pork. Just stir in a little leftover soup and it was good to eat. The wild vegetables were also very fresh. In addition, another soup was made.It was easy to make two or three dishes. All done in a few moments.Zhou Qing Bai didn't return until about six o'clock. Although the man suffered hardship, he never said anything. Lin Qing He could still sense a little tiredness from his eyebrows.It'll be strange to not be tired after working for so long.\"Clean up and prepare to eat dinner.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai was indeed hungry.After washing his face, hands, and feet, he came to sit down. The brothers came back according to dinner time.After dinner, Lin Qing He told Zhou Qing Bai: \"Will you find some time to go over and buy those books for me?\"\"The team asked me to buy pesticides two days later. I'll bring them back to you then.\" Zhou Qing Bai replied.\"OK.\" Lin Qing He acknowledged.She won't be young when the college entrance examination resumes, but so what? The first batch had no age limit. She will participate in the exam once when the time comes!\"You're tired. Take a rest after taking a bath. I will feed the two pigs later. The pigsty can be cleaned up tomorrow.\" Lin Qing He spoke in consideration for him.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78. RosyApparently, Zhou Qing Bai had not reached that level.Farm work was hard work, but he can still do it and he recovered a lot after returning home for a meal.However, pig food was still cooked by Lin Qing He. Zhou Qing Bai carried it over and fed it, and then cleaned the pigsty and chicken coop as well. This was what he had to do every day.Witnessing his uncomplaining attitude, Lin Qing He felt that she was unconscientious, as she only took charge of three meals a day and ignored the rest.But what can she do? She got a fortunate life.Unconscionable women generally had a good life. She was almost like that.Of course, the hard-working and capable women were the same, but they just had it harder. People were different and their existence was for a reason.The existence of a woman like her meant that it was reasonable.The husband and wife were preoccupied till seven o'clock, very fast.It was getting dark later now. At this time, the lights were just turned on and Zhou Qing Bai went out.The three children studied, Lin Qing He worked on the shoes while keeping supervision. It was only around 7:30 when Zhou Qing Bai came back. He had something to discuss with the branch secretary.Lin Qing He motioned to him to rest first. Zhou Qing Bai stood there unmoving, obviously waiting for her.Da Wa and Er Wa started to wiggle their eyebrows. Lin Qing He glared: \"You two are drawing your eyes? Hurry, do your homework. Once done, blow out the light and go to sleep. To do your homework when it's not bright outside, don't you know that foreign oil is expensive?\"\"From tomorrow onward, do it once you get off from school. Don't eat until you finish.\" Zhou Qing Bai felt that his elder son had disturbed his private time for two, so he said solemnly.Da Wa's face turned bitter. He wanted to say something but couldn't beat this couple and could only say that he would write it earlier tomorrow.After writing, he memorized another poem. Only then Lin Qing He let him off.She had him and Er Wa to prepare to sleep.Lin Qing He came back with San Wa and chatted with San Wa for a while. The kid spoke very smoothly now and was also a chatterbox.Zhou Qing Bai didn't find his youngest son bothersome. Sure enough, after playing for almost half an hour, San Wa began to yawn. When he yawned, he immediately fell asleep.Lin Qing He got pulled over by Zhou Qing Bai.\"Don't mess, you've been busy all day. Go to bed early.\" Lin Qing He whispered.\"Not tired.\" Zhou Qing Bai flipped to the top.Lin Qing He could only make another excuse and uttered, \"I'm not better yet.\"\"Just once, I'll be gentler.\" Zhou Qing Bai maintained.What happened proved that when a man says this, it was just as unreliable as saying 'I would rub, won't enter'.In the end, Lin Qing He ended up sleeping due to exhaustion.A satisfied Zhou Qingbai cleaned up his wife's body. At this time, it was almost ten o'clock, so it was from eight o'clock, when they got on the Kang, until now.Zhou Qing Bai went to the kitchen to scoop the pig food to feed the pig.This was the last meal of the day. He had to get up and cook for them at five o'clock the next morning.Although it was only two, still can't get idle.Even Lin Qing He dozed off in exhaustion, she did not forget the agreement with Mei Jie. She got up when it was nearly three o'clock.\"It's still early.\" Zhou Qing Bi woke up at once and hugged her.\"I have to get the pork.\" Lin Qing He explained.\"Now?\" Zhou Qing Bai frowned.\"When else? It's better to go now.\" Lin Qing He said.Although it was a little early, it was the time of deep nightly stillness. Perfect to go to the slaughterhouse to get the meat.Zhou Qing Bai declared: \"I will go with you.\"\"No need. I can go by myself.\" Lin Qing He refused: \"Quickly sleep, and you have to head to work tomorrow morning.\"But Zhou Qing Bai had risen to get dressed.No matter what Lin Qing He said, it was useless. She could only let him follow.The truth was, it was a little scary for her to come out at night alone.Zhou Qing Bai brought her over. Lin Qing He carried a basket over to handle the transaction with Mei Jie's man Old Chen Ge, and then came back.\"Not going to the county city?\" Zhou Qing Bai gave her an inquisitive look.\"Don't need to. I have another plan.\" Lin Qing He casually answered.Zhou Qing Bai stared at her. Lin Qing He responded: \"You can rest assured, I won't take risks. A couple should have more trust, you know?\"Zhou Qing Bai chuckled. His bold woman can justify everything. When he took her home, it was only after four o'clock.Zhou Qing Bai did not plan to go back to bed anymore. He wanted to go to cook the pig food, but he went to bed so late last night and got up at three. Now it was only what time?\"I'll feed the pigs tomorrow morning. Hurry back to sleep.\" Lin Qing He ordered.\"Can't sleep,\" Zhou Qing Bai shook his head.\"You have to sleep for me even if you can't,\" Lin Qing He glared.Zhou Qing Bai pulled her to sleep together. Then the restless man came again. This time was a little long. The sky started to brighten up outside. Lin Qing He couldn't help pinching him: \"Look what good deed you have done!\"\"Sleep.\" Zhou Qing Bai kissed her in content and got up to cook pig food by himself.Lin Qing He washed the sesame seeds and cooked the ribs and sesame congee on the stove. Last night, there was some cornmeal mantou left. She'll steam it in a bit to eat as well.It went without saying, she went to the backyard to pick the vegetables.But even so, in the end, he was sleep-deprived. When Zhou Qing Bai returned at noon, his looks obviously displayed excess exertion.\"Serve you right.\" Lin Qing He didn't feel distressed. She snorted before ignoring him. She took her three sons to sleep next door and left him alone.Zhou Qing Bai was a bit helpless, but he did feel strained when working this morning.So this time he wasn't going to be cocky. After taking a shower and eating lunch, he went back to the room to rest.It was a lie to say Lin Qing He wasn't distressed. But she had to let him know that he couldn't do whatever he wants with his young physical strength. It wasn't just demanding, every day he had so much work to do, so how can he do as he like?But fortunately, she arranged with Mei Jie to get the meat once every three days, so it wasn't necessary to get up in the middle of the night tonight.Lin Qing He still made a good meal for him in the evening. She had him finish with the pigsty and go to bed early.Zhou Qing Bai was not the kind to easily admit defeat. He finally grasped the meat, how can he be satisfied so quickly?Lin Qing He was unable to rein him in. Fortunately, he didn't go too far tonight, it was finished in an hour.Even so, Lin Qing He still sweated.Since she was with Zhou Qing Bai, Lin Qing He found that her skin improved again.It was truly rosiness from yin and yang harmonization from the inside to outside.Lin Qing He was very satisfied when she saw it.When she headed to the county city to rid of the pork, she passed by the food factory on the way to see Zhou Xiao Mei. Zhou Xiao Mei couldn't be anymore envious when she saw it: \"Sister-in-law, your skin is too good!\"\"Actually, it's okay.\" Lin Qing He coughed dryly, and then diverted: \"How have you been recently?\"Initially, she was just asking, but Zhou Xiao Mei unexpectedly became shy as soon as she said this, looks like there was something up.\"Got a match?\" Lin Qing He asked with raised eyebrows.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79. Slight stutterTruth to be told, Zhou Xiao Mei found a match in this while.\"He's just a little bit older. Twenty-nine this year. The only children in his family. His parents are gone and owned a house. He's quite honest, but only got a little stutter.\"\"A little stuttering?\" Lin Qing He looked at her.\"En, it's just a little stuttering, it's not very severe. His uncle is the director of the textile factory, while he is the leader of a group in the textile factory.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded.\"Twenty-nine is not too big, and his condition isn't bad. How come he hasn't married yet?\" Lin Qinghe looked at her.\"He's healthy, no illness at all. It's just because of his stutter and people believed his life is hexed as his parents are both dead. What's more, he got no brother and sister to back him up, just an uncle.\" Zhou Xiao Mei explained.Even though this era was worn out, there are still some beliefs.He stuttered, parentless, and was the only son at home. So even if he had a house and a job, the girls in the city would show disdain.As for the rural girl, he didn't really fancy the other side, so it was like this until now.\"How did you two met?\" Lin Qing He asked.The food factory was a bit away from the textile factory.\"I had a day off, right? I went out shopping when I was idle. At the park, I bump into two dirty men and he intervened and scared them away.\" Zhou Xiao Mei confessed a little embarrassedly.Lin Qing He nodded and said, \"How long have you known him?\"\"Half a month. I went to see a movie with him yesterday. On the way back to the dormitory, he told me that he wanted to match up with me and hope I agree.\" Zhou Xiao Mei's cheek slightly flushed.Lin Qing He checked if he knew about her rural background?Zhou Xiao Mei said she had mentioned it. The other said that he did not care about these and liked her for who she was.\"At this current time, he should be off work. Let's go, take me over to have a look.\" Lin Qing He directed.Feeling extremely shy, Zhou Xiao Mei still agreed to.She trusted her fourth sister-in-law, so they went over.It was about half an hour's journey. What a coincidence it was. When the two came over, they happened to meet Su Da Lin on a bike as he had just got off work and intend to head home.Lin Qing He's appearance was naturally eye-catching. Many people couldn't resist glimpsing at her. The reactions weren't small, but still, Lin Qing He didn't bat an eyelid.Zhou Xiao Mei whispered: \"When I go back next time, I will tell my fourth brother that he needs to keep a good eye on you, Fourth sister-in-law.\" She had told her mother-in-law before. With her Fourth Sister-in-law's appearance, a lot of city folks want to marry her. Her mother didn't believe that.\"Look, that one has been watching you. Is that the one the guy you called Su Da Lin.\" Lin Qing He ignored that and only remarked.Zhou Xiao Mei followed her line of sight, and it was Su Da Lin. She waved at him with a little bit of excitement as well as shyness.Su Da Lin came over.\"Su Da Lin, this is my fourth sister-in-law.\" Zhou Xiao Mei introduced, and then reintroduced again to Lin Qing He: \"Fourth Sister-in-law, this is Su Da Lin.\"Hearing this, Su Da Lin understood at once what was going on. Even though he was 29, he felt still a little embarrassed. He nodded to Lin Qing He: \"Fourth ... Fourth Sister-in-law.\"\"Oi, who are you calling?\" Zhou Xiao Mei's face burst into redness.Lin Qing He was also stunned.Then Su Da Lin recognized what he did. Instantly, he flushed in embarrassment and quickly clarified: \"I ... I did not... do it intentionally, I ... I just ... just ...\"When he became nervous, he stuttered even more. For a long time, he couldn't explain it properly.\"It's okay. I heard my Guzi mention about you and specifically came over to thank you for your righteous intervention last time. I had told my Guzi to go out alone less.\" Lin Qing He nimbly responded.Su Da Lin nodded.\"There's nothing else. I will take my Guzi away first. She will have a day off tomorrow.\" Lin Qing He finished and led Zhou Xiao Mei away.Su Da Lin saw how she spoke a few words and left with Zhou Xiao Mei, became downcast at once.His performance was terrible just now. He felt that Xiao Mei's Fourth Sister-in-law must be discontent with himself.He headed straight to his uncle's house.\"Da Lin, you're here. You got a day off tomorrow. Aren't you going to take your match to the movie tonight? Aunt can tell you, your match is a good catch. She got many brothers and sisters, so she's suitable for you.\" His aunt grinned.His Uncle nodded too. He was quite satisfied with Zhou Xiao Mei.\"Aunt, I ... might have blown... blown it.\" Su Da Lin uttered in frustration.Both his uncle and his aunt were shocked: \"What?\"Su Da Lin sighed. So he stuttered as he recalled Lin Qing He bringing Zhou Xiao Mei over to thank him. After a few words, she took Zhou Xiao Mei away.His uncle and his aunt exchanged a glance and asked, \"Was there anything else said?\"\"No ... no.\" Su Da Lin shook his head. When his uncle and his aunt couldn't help but show their regrets, he remembered: \"Said ... Said Xiao Mei will have a day off ...tomorrow\"\"What's the point of saying that,\" his uncle responded.While his aunt was delighted as soon as she heard it: \"Da Lin, you still have hope. I think her sister-in-law is quite satisfied with you.\"\"What ... what?\" Su Da Lin froze.\"Yeah, what does that mean?\" His uncle followed up.\"If she's not satisfied, how can her sister-in-law mention that her Guzi doesn't have to go to work tomorrow. Isn't this hinting you to go find her when you have time?\" His aunt explained.\"Really ... really?\" Su Da Lin couldn't help uttering.\"How can you two men understand us, women's thoughts? There's no mistake in listening to me. Take a leave tomorrow and take Xiao Mei around for fun. In addition, you got to promise to Xiao Mei, that us three won't be short a single thing on the wedding present and guarantee to let her marry you in a magnificent style, \" his aunt said.\"Okay ... Okay.\" Su Da Lin, as a big man, was a bit abashed at the mention of this matter.As this side conversed, Lin Qing He had also talked to Zhou Xiao Mei about it on the other side.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, are you dissatisfied with Su Da Lin? He's usually not this bad. It's probably because he saw me bring my family over and got too nervous to speak.\" Zhou Xiao Mei uttered.\"Look how anxious you are.\" Lin Qing He chuckled and said to her.Zhou Xiao Mei was taken aback: \"Fourth Sister-in-law didn't look down on him?\"\"Did I tell you, the first criterion for choosing a spouse is that their parents are dead and have a car and a house. Sure, he's not a smooth talker. But I've checked him for you. This person isn't bad. It's your problem now. Have you considered that after marrying him, you have to be prepared for some long-tongue women who will talk about you marrying such a stutter?\" Lin Qing He observed her.\"Whoever dares to criticize Da Lin, I'll tear her mouth!\" Zhou Xiao Mei reacted immediately.Lin Qing He grinned and spoke, \"You have to consider these carefully. Dress up pretty tomorrow. He will probably ask for leave to take you out to play.\"If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80. Summer Harvest\"Why do you know, Fourth Sister-in-law?\" Zhou Xiao Mei's cheeks flushed red.\"Why else do you think I told him about your day off tomorrow? If he comes to pick you up tomorrow, then you should seriously consider it. If he doesn't, his head will be too thick and also proves that his relationship with his uncle isn't great, to not even give a reminder.\" Lin Qing He finished and went back.When she went to bed at night, she brought up Su Da Lin to Zhou Qing Bai.\"Quite a good lad. Shorter than you, almost one-eighty.\" Zhou Qing Bai's height was almost one meter eighty-five, which was really tall in this era of widespread malnutrition.\"His facial features are also pretty good. A high nose that gives a bit naive feel and the eyes are contrasting black and white. Clear, no twinkle of crookedness.\" Lin Qing He continued.With her face, the other youths couldn't see Zhou Xiao Mei beside her. On the other hand, she can't see her existence in Su Da Lin's eyes. Only Zhou Xiao Mei was in his eyes.\"Although he stutters a bit, it's not really important to live a life. In the future, if they quarrel, ten of him still won't be Xiao Mei's opponent. I heard Xiao Mei say that the house is okay. More than ten square feet. \"Lin Qing He said.Don't look at the house of this time with the eyes of future generations. At this time, a whole family squeezed in the house of approximately 40 square feet.It can be seen how much of a luxury residence Su Da Lin's home of 40 square meters was.\"His salary is 34 yuan a month.\" This salary was double of Zhou Xiao Mei's.Because Zhou Xiao Mei was a new worker, even if it has risen a bit this year, it was only 17 yuan. Su Da Lin has 34 yuan since he was a team leader and also because he had been working for a long time.A family of five, such as hers, can live well for ten dollars a month. Of course, the standard defined by the time.Using Lin Qing He's standard, she had to add ten yuan. Twenty yuan was enough for her family to live comfortably.Previously, she felt she went through the money quite quickly, but now Lin Qing He has a way to make money.Using the pork from Mei Jie and her husband, she can earn approximately four yuan each time.Over at the black market, the meat coupon wasn't required. She could exchange it for some grain coupons, but the price was still dear. It could be as much as 1.5-1.6yuan per jin.Pick-up was every three days, each time five jins of meat. Including the extras, it was about seven jins.After giving Mei Jie a dime profit, the cost of a jin of meat was one yuan. She can earn five dimes.Each time, she can earn four yuan. Once every three days, so forty yuan profit per month.Of course, Lin Qing He was very cautious when handling pork. She specifically looked for old ladies. These old ladies usually have a large population at home and wouldn't cause trouble. They were more careful than she was when they exchanged.In a month, she can earn this amount. Even if her own consumption was big, she can still save a lot.Lin Qing He was quite satisfied. What's more, she wanted to put in an effort to save money. Saving money this way, meant she'll have a lot saved by the time the restrictions dropped. She'll have enough capital.These were too far in the future, let's get back to Zhou Xiao Mei's matter.After listening to what she said, Zhou Qing Bai uttered: \"You think he's good, then it's fine.\"\"You trust my eyes so much?\" Lin Qing He beamed and said to him.Zhou Qing Bai's lips slightly curved and silently looked at her. Lin Qing He found that his smile was really pretty, even though he rarely smiled.\"If I guess right, Xiao Mei will probably marry this year. We don't have much stuff but at that time, we'll add a new quilt to her dowry.\" Lin Qing He pondered.In this period, a new quilt was an excellent product. What's more, it displayed how great the relationship was between two sisters-in-law. Otherwise, which sister-in-law will give such a quilt?\"You decide.\" Zhou Qing Bai didn't interfere with these things at home.Lin Qing He hugged his waist and commented, \"You have lost a lot of weight during this time.\"She nurtured him so well in the winter, fat and strong. Now, they were about to enter the summer days and he had clearly lost weight.\"I haven't.\" Zhou Qing Bai shook his head, only got strong.\"Wife, have you recovered yet?\" Zhou Qing Bai's voice became hoarse again.Lin Qing He coughed dryly and replied, \"That thing of mine hasn't left yet.\"Zhou Qing Bai sighed out a breath. Lin Qing He giggled as she pulled his cheeks, \"Why are you so improper now?\"When have I been proper to you?Zhou Qing Bai raised an eyebrow, his eyes revealed this message.Lin Qing He understood it and responded with a faint smile: \"When you first came back, you were. I told you to go to sleep next door. Didn't you agree so readily? I thought you had no interest in me.\"Zhou Qing Bai became helpless.How can it be said like this? His biggest wish when he came back was that she could peacefully live.Human's desire will always get bigger and bigger. Although she had a bad temper, her care for him had no lacking. Although she was still lukewarm to him in that while, he can feel that she was different from before.So he didn't know when he started to want to be close to her.\"Hurry up and sleep. Next month is the summer harvest. Instead of conserving strength, you want to toss around,\" Lin Qing He urged.Zhou Qing Bai hugged her as he dozed off.It was now May.In May, the weather was getting hotter and hotter, and the loach and ricefield eel came out in the field.As Zhou Qing Bai busied away, he would bring some back from time to time. It wasn't just him, Da Wa, the lad liked to catch loach.He carried a bucket in joy. Both Er Wa and San Wa followed too. Because the water was not deep and it was all in the mud ditch, Lin Qing He had let them be. But she did warn Da Wa to keep an eye on his little brothers from time to time. Da Wa was quite responsible.The loach that was brought back was raised in clear water for one night and can be eaten the next day.It was loach and tofu, or iron-plated loach, or braised loach. Including Zhou Qing Bai, who didn't like the earthy taste, they all loved with these dishes.In a blink, it was early June.The summer harvest will begin at the end of this month.But in the past few days, it was raining. And it was pretty big.\"Will this affect the summer harvest?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"No.\" Zhou Qing Bai stayed at home as he didn't need to work on rainy days.\"It's great that it won't, otherwise we won't have anything to eat. We're counting on this crop.\" Lin Qing He remarked.But God was doing his beautiful work. It had been pouring for seven-eight days. In mid-June, it started to clear up.What's more, it was hot sunny days.The summer harvest's horn sounded until the end of June.On such important days like Summer Harvest, the whole village was going to participate, except for Lin Qing He. Da Wa and Er Wa joined in, as they could also get points for collecting wheat.Lin Qing He managed the domestic animals at home, then prepared meals and brought it over with San Wa once it was done. The whole family had a picnic under the tree.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81. Temporary workBecause it was summer harvest, what they ate was relatively simple, but absolutely nutritious.They had spring pancakes.The spring pancakes were all packaged up and brought over by Lin Qing He from home.Small pieces of meat, diced mushrooms, fried leeks with eggs, and her specially made tomato sauce and seasonal veg were all wrapped inside. The taste was particularly exquisite and delicious.Along with this was soup. Lin Qing He had brought bowls, one for each person.After eating they rested. Then chomped another fresh tomato, the taste was perfect.The food on this side was definitely the best in the village. The old Zhou Family had no way to compete.Second Sister-in-law watched the family of five over there eating spring cakes, especially on the bountiful fillings. The smell could drift over here.\"Eat so well, why doesn't she bring some over to Father and Mother.\" Second Sister-in-law grumbled as she chewed on her pancake.\"They already separated. Eat yours.\" Mother Zhou shoot a glance at Second daughter-in-law, who clearly wanted to stir trouble.With these words, it got Second Sister-in-law to shut up. But she was greatly discontent on the inside.Lin Qing He didn't stay long. She rubbed a layer of sunscreen on Zhou Qing Bai, Da Wa, and Er Wa. This was what she got while she collected her supplies. Two big cans of it.It became handy at this moment. Da Wa and Er Wa were better as they joined in for the fun of it. Lin Qing He didn't stop it, but everyone must wear a hat.Zhou Qing Bai was the main force. He sunburnt till he was red. Lin Qing He's heart felt unbearable at the sight.\"You don't have to apply this on me.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.\"I don't have much left here, only a few applications left.\" Lin Qing He stated.Zhou Qing Bai's brows softened at this.\"Rest ba.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Qing Bai nodded, led Da Wa and Er Wa to drowse.Lin Qing He packed her things and took San Wa home. It was really hot today, like a fire.But on such an important day, no one can escape it. They have to go to the field and speedily harvest. Lin Qinghe was lazy and never gone to the field, so everyone had accustomed it, feeling there was no reason to criticize.As soon as the horn sounded, Zhou Qing Bai and the rest went down to harvest the field again.Da Wa, Er Wa, and the other children were better off, the requirements from them weren't big. They were responsible for picking wheat ears in the field, which were calculated by weight for the work points. These children were quite hardworking.But no matter how energetic they were, at the end of the day, it was also very exhausting.When they returned home, Er Wa was laying on his father's back. Obviously, he was too tired.Lin Qing He was startled, fearing he had a heatstroke, and declared, \"Tomorrow, Er Wa, don't go.\"\"No, I will go!\" Er Wa instantly replied.\"Not tired?\" Lin Qing He eyed him.\"Not tired!\" Er Wa nodded.Judging by how he was,Lin Qing He left him be. She reminded him: \"If you are tired immediately go to rest, understood?\"\"I know, I won't push myself. If I get heatstroke, it'll be painful.\" Er Wa said.Other children had suffered heatstroke. Just watching how they vomited and had diarrhea, he felt uncomfortable.After eating a simple and nutritious dinner, Lin Qing He brought out the completed mung bean soup and cooled it in the well water.This was rock sugar and mung bean soup, adjusted to mild sweetness, but it still tasted great.Lin Qing He intends to feed the father and sons a few more times of mung bean soup. She scooped out two bowl amounts and got Da Wa to send it to his grandpa and grandma.Lin Qing He told Zhou Qing Bai: \"Tomorrow I will add on mung bean soup for you. This is the best for cooling off the heat.\"\"Sure.\" Zhou Qing Bai agreed.Satisfied, Lin Qing He continued, \"You're tired today too. Go rest.\"Zhou Qing Bai shook his head, he wasn't that exhausted. He went to clean the pigsty but found that it was cleaned.It goes without saying, Lin Qing He had tidied it. For this man, she made a sacrifice.\"I can tell you now, I'll do it for you this summer harvest, other times you can do it by yourself.\" Lin Qing He stated.\"You don't have to do it, just wait for me to come back.\" Zhou Qing Bai stared at her.\"You're already that exhausted, I can't dump it all on you.\" Lin Qing He pouted.Zhou Qing Bai's eyebrows were extremely soft, she could sense the sweetness in his eyes.This was rarely seen from this tough guy's gaze.\"Go to rest.\" Lin Qing He waved.Soon Da Wa came back. This kid was worn out from today too, so Lin Qing He gave the brothers a bath and sent them to the Kang to play. She gave them mung bean soup at 6:30 in the evening.Can't say it was super chill, but it was still cooled by the well water. Plus with the addition of rock sugar, the sweetness was fulfilling to drink.From the next day onward, Lin Qing He delivered mung bean soup at approximately 10 am.Of course, she prepared a share for Father Zhou and Mother Zhou. As for the others, Lin Qing He couldn't be bothered to care.As anticipated, Second Sister-in-law wasn't short on sour words, remarking that the adults can go without, but how can the children not have some?Eldest Sister-in-law took care of the children while cooking at home, and Third Sister-in-law came to work.Because Eldest Sister-in-law had only given birth for two or three months, she didn't have to take part in such bustling actions. She was in charge of the family's food and took care of the babies at home.This time Eldest Sister-in-law also gave birth to a son.Lin Qing He wasn't stingy at that time. She gave her two trotters to stew with peanuts to eat, which was great for breastmilk.Third Sister-in-law was dead on her feet, but she didn't pay any heed to Second Sister-in-law's words.They had already separated out. Lin Qing He, this fourth sister-in-law, could give the elders a mouthful, and that was all there was to it. The rest wanted to eat her family's stuff? Impossible.Mother Zhou had instructed Eldest Sister-in-law when she came back that day to cook some mung bean soup at this side and get Fourth's wife to deliver it together.Second Sister-in-law began mumbling again: \"Are you two old ones afraid of eating Fourth's family to poverty?\"This time, Third Sister-in-law didn't hold back and told Eldest Sister-in-law about it.\"Qing He had Father and Mother drink some, she was dissatisfied and said she didn't prepare for the children. Now Mother told you to make it for the whole family, she's still not pleased. All-day long, she complained these behind her back.\" Third Sister-in-law vented.\"Who would deny that? I heard Tao Zi's Mother mentioned it the day before yesterday that Wang Ling wanted to mock Qing He, but Qing He had her grudgingly return home. Wang Ling has a good relationship with her.\" Eldest Sister-in-law's mouth also twitched.\"That's a long tongue woman. I can hear her splurting things everywhere I go,\" Third Sister-in-law remarked in despise.\"Don't bother with it, at most, she'll only dare to talk about it privately. If she got the ability to go to talk about it in front of Qing He's face, see if Qing He will spare her.\" Eldest Sister-in-law concluded.Third Sister-in-law had nothing else to say, this summer harvest was exhausting.Because summer harvest was a hectic time, Lin Qing He didn't go to the county city to sell pork. The pork that was collected every day was placed into the space.Once this was over, she'll go to the county city to get rid of it.Mei Jie was now out of work. Only then, Lin Qing He knew that she was only a temporary worker before. No wonder the original owner had rarely seen Mei Jie before.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82. Nutritional managementThankfully, she now had such a business.Although it was only once every three days, she can earn seven dimes each time. And it was ten times a month, so she can get seven yuans, which was also a considerable amount.Sometimes, when there was a lot, they can get almost ten jins of meat.In addition to giving a dime, Lin Qing He also gave Mei Jie some food stamps, which were all exchanged from those old madams in the county city.Totaling it all, it wasn't much worse than when she went to work.However, because of Mei Jie's connection, it was very easy for Lin Qing He to buy something out of stock in the supply and marketing cooperative.For example, there were three jars of honey stored at home, which was gained through Mei Jie's connection.The honey at this time was really pure wild honey. Lin Qing He bought a jar of winter honey last year.It solidified like a lump of oil similar to lard.She had finished it in one winter, as she had to drank one cup of honey water before going to bed every day. She would drink it herself, the children didn't need to drink it yet.Zhou Qing Bai didn't have a share, at that time he didn't have any importance in her heart yet.However, since that marital obligation, cough, and she cared about him.So the nightly honey water included Zhou Qing Bai's share now. Zhou Qing Bai said he does not need it. He didn't like to drink these pure sweet things.But his wife had him drink, so even if he didn't like it, he had to drink it.Lin Qing He felt great drinking this honey water.The health benefits of drinking this for a long time were self-evident. It was essential for Zhou Qing Bai to drink it. He had to do farm work every day. Even though she made three healthy meals a day, it was not enough nourishment.So Lin Qing He tried hard to manage it for him.Seven days after the summer harvest began, Lin Qing He slaughtered a chicken at home.Since raising it in spring, it was now one jin or so. One of them became unwell during the period, so there were five left. There were still four left after the slaughtering. They were still over the limit.This chicken wasn't eaten just like that. Lin Qing He also pre-ordered a pork stomach from Mei Jie's pig farm.She washed the pork stomach, cooked it and cut it. Then it was stewed with the chicken as well as a sprinkle of sesame seeds.It was a pot of sesame, pork stomach, and chicken.The taste was definitely aromatic. In the evening, the father and sons ate the sesame pork stomach and chicken served with wholegrain mantou.Although the kids didn't like to eat this kind of mantou very much, Lin Qing He would still make it occasionally. Must eat, even when they don't want to. They can't always eat fine cuisine all the time.The chicken drum was divided between Da Wa and Er Wa. Lin Qing He expressed that the chicken drum would be eaten in turns. This time, she let them two eat first. Next time, it will be them, husband and wife's turn. When San Wa gets bigger and know how to eat, he'll join in the queue.Da Wa and Er Wa agreed.Lin Qing He grabbed a chicken wing and let San Wa chew on it. The rest was Zhou Qing Bai\u2019s. But the only drinking soup and avoiding meat her, was pushed by Zhou Qing Bai to feed on a chicken wing.A summer harvest took about half a month.Although the summer harvest wasn't as tiring as the autumn harvest, it must be said that it was still hard work ah. Eldest Brother, Second Brother, and Third Brother, all slimmed down.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou were tormented a good bit as well.They had copied Fourth's wife's mung bean soup, so they did not have heatstroke. Truthfully, the mung bean soup's taste can't be compared with Lin Qing He, as Eldest Sister-in-law didn't add in sugar.Also, old Zhou's family's food wasn't as good as this side.After such a summer harvest, Zhou Qing Bai was just worn out. As for slimming down or other aches, were non-existent.Same for Da Wa and Er Wa. Their bodies were excellent.Once the summer harvest was over, Lin Qing He puffed out in relief.There was a new round of farm work afterward, but at least, they can always go home and take a rest at noon. Unlike the summer harvest, where 30 minutes was given for meal. After eating, only a little more than ten minutes were left to nap before they had to head down to the field again.This was draining to death.Zhou Qing Bai helped Lin Qing He get all the learning materials she wanted.Although she hadn\u2019t been studying for many years, it wasn't difficult to pick it up again now. Zhou Qing Bai had his education in the organization. Lin Qing He read it herself, on some parts, she deliberately pretended to ask him.It was mostly to reveal her progress in her studies so that he did not have any doubts. Like this, he was witnessing her progress?On the surface, Zhou Qing Bai was calm, but he was surprised in his heart because he found that his wife's learning process was really fast. Sometimes he heard her murmur in dreams at night. Those murmurs were reciting the texts. Too dumbfounding.After this summer harvest's food distribution, Lin Qing He's family got a lot allocated to them.Zhou Qing Bai received 10 work points, his share naturally bountiful. In addition, there were two pigs at home. From the beginning of May, Da Wa carried a basket of pigweed every day to exchange for the work point.Lin Qing He went back to gather pigweed too, but her's was taken home for the pigs at home.But because of this, her family got a lot distributed to them a lot this time. At least this time, it wasn't necessary to buy food.Lin Qing He pulled some out of the space, and it was mostly sufficient.As for the two huge pigs at home, it was raised excellently.Mother Zhou was very surprised when she came over to check last time.She didn't mention it outside. Lin Qing He told her not to say anything. There were excess chickens in the backyard.Wait for the remaining chicken to be slaughtered and it'll be fine to talk about it. If the village branch secretary wants to come over to observe it, it was no problem but for now, it wasn't possible.Grain had been harvested for almost half a month, and a new round of seeds had been planted before the weather turned gloomy. Then it began to rain.Even Zhou Qing Bai had a happy face because it saved a lot of effort. No need to manually water, and it was almost God was providing a meal for them.Lin Qing He studied at home, the brothers as well.Although it was seven years away from the reintroduction of the college entrance examination, she was bored, might as well do it.Initially, she wanted to make some clothes but reconsidered. The whole family basically had three or four sets of clothes to wear. In this era, it was definitely plentiful.Once the rain stopped, Second Brother and Third Brother came over to call Zhou Qing Bai.They wanted to capture ricefield eel and loach. Zhou Qing Bai grabbed a bucket and followed them. Zhou Da Wa and Zhou Er Wa immediately declared they were following. San Wa also wanted to go.Lin Qing He turned to Zhou Qing Bai. Zhou Qing Bai approved: \"Let's all go.\"So the three brothers were overjoyed, got off the kang, and headed out with their father.Lin Qing He continued to study on her own. Third Sister-in-law brought Zhou Dong Dong over for a visit.When she saw that she was studying and reading, she was surprised: \"Are you studying by yourself?\"The most difficult part, i.e. Zhou Qing Bai, was passed. Toward other people like Third Sister-in-law, Lin Qing He didn't care what they thought.\"Aren't we quite free now? Staying at home is also staying, so I asked Qing Bai to bring me some books to read.\" Lin Qing He explained.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83. Huge Watermelon\"You wrote these words?\" Third Sister-in-law swiftly flipped through some. With a shocked expression, she uttered to her fourth sister-in-law.The font was beautiful, really well written.\"I wrote it casually.\" Lin Qing He laughed, those were her written notes that were already revised.Others were jotted down silently after memorizing the text.\"I didn't know you could write so well. So awesome.\" Third Sister-in-law couldn't resist admiring her.As Third Sister-in-law had partaken in a literacy class for a while, the words she knew were very limited, let alone written.\"Previously, my academic record was good. However, I had no choice. My family won't let me study, instead, let my white-eyed wolf Second Brother studied.\" Lin Qing He said.Males were being prioritized over females was a common phenomenon found in many parts of the rural area in the country.\"But it's useless to study now.\" Third Sister-in-law remarked.\"I know it's useless, but it's good to read it. People who read more will be smart.\" Lin Qing He responded.Third Sister-in-law felt that her fourth sister-in-law wasn't clever for no reason. Look how studious she was. Even as a mother of three children, she didn't forget to study.\"Third Sister-in-law, don't mention this outside. It's enough for me to look over by myself. If it gets out that I self-study at home, people will laugh.\" Lin Qing He urged.\"I won't say. But loving to learn is a glorious matter, who would laugh at you?\" Third Sister-in-law promised.\"Those petty-minded.\" Lin Qing He smiled.Third Sister-in-law recalled Second Sister-in-law's loudmouth face and was silenced. Lin Qing He observed Zhou Dong Dong and grinned: \"Little Dong Dong grows so fast. Last year, he was only a little bit. This year he can sit.\"\"Kids are like that. Wasn't Da Wa the same? He has gotten a lot bigger this year, and those at his age in the village aren't as tall as him.\" Third Sister-in-law commented.Lin Qing He said with a laugh: \"He's very naughty. In the middle of his homework, he saw his father go fishing for eel and immediately ran off with his two younger brothers.\"After talking about the children for a while, they chat on other topics for a while. Then Third Sister-in-law took Zhou Dong Dong home.Of course, Lin Qing He's reception toward her was good. She picked a few tomatoes, cut them on the plate, sprinkled with some sugar, and served with a toothpick to eat. This was a very good snack for hospitality.Zhou Qing Bai took his three children out and returned almost in the evening.The brothers, including Zhou Qing Bai, were all muddy. Lin Qing He didn't care since the clothes were washed by Zhou Qing Bai. It wasn't easy to dry this weather, but there were still spare clothes, so Lin Qing He wasn't mad.If this she was to wash it, the brothers couldn't avoid a good yell.Zhou Qing Bai brought back three big ricefield eels and numerous loaches.During this season, whether it was ricefield eel or loach, both were very fat. And the taste was also impeccable.The eel didn't need to sit in water first, while the loach needed to. So the eel was stewed straight away for dinner.Zhou Qing Bai, who ate ricefield eel, was a little stimulated. Afterward, Lin Qing He suffered some good round of happiness issue.There was no other way ah! This time was too long, so she sweated a lot. Sweating in this hot summer weather was uncomfortable.But when she complained, Zhou Qing Bai had an innocent expression. He couldn't do anything if it took long. He just last that long.Lin Qing He chuckled as she pulled his cheeks. It became more and more apparent that this man was black-bellied.Zhou Qing Bai embraced his wife, filled with content.In the beginning, retiring halfway made him very lost, because he liked the force very much. That was his dream.He powerlessly pulled out halfway, so how could his heart feel comfortable?But now, he doesn't regret returning to a home like this at all.Holding his wife, Zhou Qing Bai felt very satisfied with his current life. He even blamed himself for neglecting her.His wife was wonderful, super wonderful. Since he didn't cherish her before, he will treasure her even more in the future.\"Wife, let's do it again.\" Zhou Qing Bai wanted to dote his wife again.Before Lin Qing He had the chance to object, he pulled her into a new round of stormy waves and made her woke up late the next day.Although the summer was hot, the heating summer was also the beginning of fruit produce.A new round of work began after the rain stopped.Lin Qing He brought Er Wa and San Wa along with her to county city as she rid of the meat stored in this periodShe had the two of them eat popsicles at the entrance of the mall, and ordered Er Wa to take good care of San Wa. The two got a popsicle each.Er Wa said that he remembers and won't lose sight of his brother.Lin Qing He also knew he was intelligent, but he was still four years old. Lin Qing He tied their brothers together with a rope at their waists.She instructed him to watch the bicycle and his brother before she rushed to sell pork.Due to worrying for the brothers, Lin Qing He came back in half an hour later and was sweating all over.The brothers were sitting there obediently. Lin Qing He was relieved, but at the same time, she couldn't help being distressed.\"Come, follow Mother to the supply and demand cooperative. I'll buy you cans of malted milk powder.\" Lin Qing He beckoned.Er Wa and San Wa saw her coming back and excitedly entered with their mother. The brothers were pretty. As for Lin Qing He's aura and appearance, it was needless to say.So when the mother and sons came in, it had the salesperson's eyes lit up.Lin Qing He's handiwork was quite extraordinary; malted milk powder, white rabbit candy, red dates, dried dragon-eyes, and the likes. Especially when she bought a six pound big watermelon outright.These things had Er Wa and San Wa drooling.They had eaten everything else, so it wasn't anything unusual. But the big watermelon, they had never tried it before!Lin Qing He didn't go straight away after buying these things. She brought Er Wa and San Wa to the mall to go shopping and bought some school supplies back.After these were bought, Lin Qing He took her two sons and these materials back home.\"Mother, will you bring us next time?\" Both Er Wa and San Wa were in the front seats.The brothers were sitting on specially-made children's seats, which were drawn by Lin Qing He and asked Zhou Qing Bai to find a carpenter to make them.Lin Qing He was not at ease when they were at the back as they were too small.\"I'll see how you brothers behave\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.\"We'll all be obedient.\" Zhou Er Wa immediately superficially swore.\"Be good, eat watermelon.\" Zhou San Wa was pining for the watermelon.The mother and sons soon reached home. They didn't eat once they arrived, because Zhou Qing Bai hadn't got off work yet, and Da Wa hadn't finished school.Have to wait for them to come back before eating.Although it would be more pleasant to eat it after chilling in the well water, Lin Qing He did not put it in the well water as the children were still young.\"Mother, do we have to wait for Father and Eldest Brother to come back to eat?\" Er Wa longingly looked at the big watermelon.\"Then if you aren't at home one day and there's tasty food, we'll eat it first without waiting for you. Would you agree?\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.Er Wa shook his head and waited for their father and brother.San Wa was playing with the big watermelon on the cool mat. Since the big watermelon couldn't be eaten first, Lin Qing He gave them a tomato each.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84. Can I tonight?Da Wa got home first.Once he reached home, he grabbed a back basket and headed out to gather pigweed with his other small friends in the village.These can contribute to the work points.Da Wa, who was conscious of being the second man in the family, would forage a basket of pigweed every day after school.He only had enough time to give the schoolbag to Er Wa to help him take it into the house and did not catch Er Wa saying that Mother had bought a huge watermelon back, don\u2019t go out and get pigweed.The baby was very responsible, so Lin Qing He doesn't govern him too much now. She let him decide on some things on his own.This was also to cultivate his independence.For dinner, it'll be a simple meal, stewed pork ribs with potatoes, a soup, and then cornmeal mantou.When Zhou Qing Bai was off work, Da Wa also returned.So they ate dinner first.As for the watermelon, it was a snack after a meal.\"Mother, why are you willing to buy such a big watermelon?\" Da Wa's eyes brightened.\"If I don't buy a big one, how can it be enough for our family to heartily feast on?\" Lin Qing He said.Watermelon was one of her favorites. She had asked Zhou Qing Bai, Zhou Qing Bai liked to eat it. The 6 jin watermelon was actually just right, not too much.What's more, they were still young now. When they get older, two was required to satisfied them all.After dinner, the brothers started rolling the watermelon.Dinner was at six. At seven, Lin Qing He got Zhou Qing Bai to cut the watermelon and then divided it between them.Coincidentally, Mother Zhou came over and saw the family munching on the watermelon. She sighed at how shocking Fourth's family's life was.Such a life costs a lot of money.\"San Wa, give a piece to your Grandma.\" Lin Qing He said.San Wa grabbed a piece of watermelon and handed it to his grandma. Now, this little brat can understand people's words and can express himself clearly.Mother Zhou received it and mentioned, \"I just heard that your maternal family's Third Sister-in-law had given birth.\"Lin Qing He froze for a moment, then her brain reacted, it was Third Brother Lin. When she went back before New Year, she didn't know that the Third Sister-in-law Lin was pregnant.Even though she didn\u2019t have a good impression of Third Sister-in-law Lin, she still liked Third Brother Lin very much. Must give Buddha face, even if one doesn't to the monk, so she nodded. \"I'll see how it is after my brother come over with happy news.\"The watermelon was very delicious. It tasted average in Lin Qing He's opinion, while the children were obviously satisfied with it. Even Zhou Qing Bai also enjoyed it.\"Next time I go to the county city, I'll buy another one.\" Lin Qing He promised.The brothers cheered in joy. Although the time was now 7 o'clock, the sky was still not dark. The kids took Fei Ying out for a walk.Lin Qing He knew what was up without asking, she didn't intervene.Kids, it was good to have a little hobby.\"Tired?\" Lin Qing He turned to Zhou Qing Bai: \"Do you want me to give a massage?\"Zhou Qing Bai was not tired, but it didn't stop him from enjoying his wife's services. Now that the three children weren't home, he readily let her massage.Lin Qing He had already knew that he had muscles. Only when she pressed, she found out that the flesh was really tough.\"Not doing it.\" Lin Qing He gave up after pressing twice.It was too hard to massage.Zhou Qing Bai grinned and took his wife into his arms.On such a hot day, Lin Qing He didn't mind the heat and sat on him. Smelling the refreshing smell of his body after bathing, she spoke: \"This soap fragrance is quite nice.\"He used the soap she had collected for bathing. After one wash, even the little grease and mud could be removed. It was efficient to use.\"Do you think I'm splurging a lot of money? Think I'm a prodigal woman?\" Lin Qing He hugged his neck, stared at him with raised eyebrows.Zhou Qing Bai shook his head: \"No.\"His wife was doing it for the sake of the family, not being extravagant and wasteful.\"I was thinking, when will we have time to go over to the capital and take a look?\" Lin Qing He brought up.\"Why do you want to go to the Capital?\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her.\"Just curious. The Great Wall, Imperial Gate, the legendary existence.\" Lin Qing He laughed.As if. She didn't know how many times she had been there already.But for people of this era, it was very meaningful to go to the capital.\"Not possible at the moment. After all, outside is unsteady. Wait and see.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Lin Qing He just wanted to mention it. She turned the topic, \"Is there anything like jade on this side?\"\"Those are all old capital feudal objects.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated.Lin Qing He: \"...\" She understood the environment in which this man grew up since he was a child, so she said: \"Then forget it.\"Zhou Qing Bai understood that his wife wanted one, so he decided to find some time to check with his old friend. If it was good, he'll bring it back to her.\"Can I tonight?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked as he stroked her skinny waist.Lin Qinghe: \u56e7. What was inside this head?But when she met his eyes, Lin Qing He was extremely embarrassed as he was seriously asking her: \"After a day's work, you're not tired?\"\"Not tired.\" Zhou Qing Bai beamed. He knew what she meant, and plucked a kiss on her cheek.Da Wa and his brothers went out to walk for about ten minutes and then came back. After returning, they did their homework as usual and then prepared to sleep.Zhou Qing Bai ate a meal, and Lin Qinghe, who was eaten, was exhausted in the end.\"You worked in the field for the whole day, every day. Once you're home, you continued to work. You still have that energy.\" Lin Qing He expressed weakly in frustrated.Zhou Qing Bai said hoarsely: \"If you want to, I can continue.\"Lin Qing He pushed him aside. Zhou Qing Bai chuckled and pulled his wife into his embrace. He fanned his wife with a fan and then went to sleep.Now the weather was really sultry, Lin Qing He frequently made mung bean soup. Every night after a family's meal and rest, they will drink a bowl of sweet mung bean soup.Third Brother Lin came with happy news after half a month.Lin Qing He scolded: \"It's been a long time since the birth, why come over here now?\"\"It was busy for a while, I had to help out at home.\" Third Brother Lin meekly smiled.\"Hurry up and drink this bowl of mung bean soup. Just look at you, you're so exhausted that you'll soon become a skeleton.\" Lin Qing He frowned.Third Brother Lin was indeed too thin. He was one meter seventy-five tall, which wasn't too short in this era, but it was unknown if he even reached one hundred and ten jins in weight. He was too skinny.\"How can it be as exaggerated as you said, Sister?\" Third Brother Lin smiled but still drank mung bean soup.After drinking, his face displayed satisfaction. This sweet mung bean soup was really delicious.Lin Qing He scooped up another bowl for him, Third Brother Lin immediately reacted, \"Sister, I had enough.\"\"What enough? One bowl for such a big man? There's a lot left in this pot.\" Lin Qing He maintained.She had Third Brother Lin drink mung bean soup as she went in and got some pork out. She gave a jin of pork belly and two ribs. These were private goods from her space.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85. Wagging tongue natureOn top of that, she scooped two jins of brown sugar out. There were two jins of red dates at home, she also gave out one jin. As for the rest, she planned to make red date mantou as a change. She also threw in half a jin of shrimp skin and a jin of eggs.Once these things were brought out, Third Brother Lin questioned at once: \"Sister, what are you doing?\"\"I'm most clear about those two old ones' nature. Your wife birthed a daughter last time, and this time she birthed another girl. The two of them will definitely be displeased. They always favor boys over girls, so your wife can forget about good post-natal confinement. But how important post-natal confinement is to a woman? I know you who have been a dad once understand, so do you still want to push these around with me? \"Lin Qing He said.\"Sister.\" Third Brother Lin's eyes reddened.After his wife gave birth to this daughter, his father and mother didn't display any good attitude, making his wife shed tears several times during the post-natal confinement.Wanted something to eat, but got none. This made him feel very guilty.However, being guilt was useless, it can't give anything to his wife during post-natal confinement.\"It's still early in this period. Everyone hasn't got off work, so go back quickly.\" Lin Qing He urged.\"Okay.\" Third Brother Lin nodded and pushed back the tears that were about to fall.He did not want to cause trouble to his sister, so he took advantage of this time to return quickly.A nylon polybag held all these things on his way back.But even at this time, there were still people in the village. For example, Wang Ling, who had been headbutting with Lin Qinghe before. She had witnessed it.\"Sure enough, she's a wicked thing. It didn't take long before she started to pour things into her maternal family!\" Wang Ling sneered coldly.She waited for Second Sister-in-law to get off work and brought it up to her.\"You don't know how much he took back. I saw it with my own eyes, there was quite a quantity!\" Wang Ling exclaimed.\"Do you really see it?\" Second Sister-in-law instantly uttered.\"How can I lie? I estimate there are eggs for sure!\" Wang Ling nodded.Second Sister-in-law went straight home to tell Eldest Sister-in-law about it.Third Sister-in-law was also present and once she heard it, she said: \"Second Sister-in-law, we are two separate families now. How Qing He lives got nothing to do with us. Whether she gave it to her maternal family or not, those things don't belong to us. We don't have to preach. \u201dEldest Sister-in-law had the same perspective, uttered: \"They already separated off. Qing He is the one in charge over there, let's not say too much.\"Second Sister-in-law felt that her two sisters-in-law were bribed by Fourth's wife. See here, they all stood on Fourth's wife's side!Second Sister-in-law made a beeline to Mother Zhou and revealed this news.Although Mother Zhou was really displeased, she still scowled at her second daughter-in-law, said \"Where did you hear the gossip? If you have nothing to do, then give old Zhou family more grandsons and reduce your trips to talk to those wagging tongue natured women! \"Second Sister-in-law's face was flashed green and white for a while. She explained herself: \"Mother, I was just thinking on behalf of Fourth Brother-in-law, as the whole family rests on his shoulders. Now he has to help his wife support her maternal family's brothers. Isn't this wanting to crush Fourth Brother-in-law to death? \"This registered into Mother Zhou's mind.However, Mother Zhou didn't dare to look for Lin Qing He. She had a private talk with her youngest son, Zhou Qing Bai. Observing how tired her youngest son was after work, Mother Zhou's heart broke. \"Old Fourth, you don\u2019t have to work yourself to the bone, have an occasional break. \"\"Mother, I'm fine.\" Zhou Qing Bai spoke: \"Mother, did you come for something?\"\"Today, Da Wa's Third Jiu from old Lin Family came over. I heard that your wife gave a lot of things away. Is there enough to eat at home?\" Mother Zhou mentioned.\"His(Da Wa's) Third Aunt gave birth and is in post-natal confinement. It's only right to give some things.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.His wife only acknowledged her third brother from old Lin's side, she alienated the rest.\"Yes, it is right, but at most a jin of eggs. I heard that he took a lot back.\" Mother Zhou continued: \"It's not the same as before, where you send few tens of yuans in allowances back every month. The whole family relied on you, this burden isn't light. \"She certainly didn't dare to say these words to Lin Qing He, even when Lin Qing He was courteous to her. It was only because she was Zhou Qing Bai's mother that Lin Qing He occasionally sent Da Wa to deliver stuff when they got something good.But if Mother Zhou wanted to intervene in her life and arrange how she lived, Lin Qing He would never allow it.Once she sticks in, a fight was inevitable.This wasn't what Mother Zhou wanted to see, so she looked for Zhou Qing Bai in private instead.\"Mother, my wife knows what she is doing, you don't have to worry about us. Aren't we living well now?\" Zhou Qing Bai assured.\"You are doing fine now, and doesn't that cost money? When the money is all spent, doesn't everything need money when Da Wa and his brothers get older like marrying a wife or something?\" Mother Zhou pointed out.\"My wife said no need to make provision for children. When the kids grow up, they can just earn it themselves.\" Zhou Qing Bai said this with laughter in his eyes.His wife's original words were: \"It's still a long before the boys marry. Besides, when you married me, didn't you rely on yourself? Our house was built with your money. You can do it, your sons can do it too. The tiger father birth no pups, so we don\u2019t have to worry about it. \u201dWith one sentence, she praised him and his sons.Mother Zhou sighed aloud. Seeing her son was, it was apparent that he was tamed by Fourth's wife, so how could he have the ability to think?In peasant households, who doesn't save money for emergency use? Such spending habits, how can they live properly?Mother Zhou went back, and Zhou Qing Bai came home.Lin Qing He raised her eyebrows when she saw him return: \"What did Mother talk with you? Acting so secretively and hide outside to discuss?\"\"Not much.\" Zhou Qing Bai shook his head.\"Did my Third Brother's visit reached Mother's ears through someone? Mother came to get you to remind me that one need to live more prudently now that there's no fixed income every month like before. The pressure of the whole family is all on you, and her old heart is distressed for you, the youngest son.\" Lin Qing He said.Zhou Qing Bai glanced at his wife. Even though she didn't hear it, his wife had basically repeated what his mother said.\"Correct.\" Lin Qing He threw a glance at him.\"Wife, you're the head of our family.\" Zhou Qing Bai looked at her seriously.\"That's more like it.\" Lin Qing He observing how firm he was, she harrumphed.As for the things given to her third brother, she did not intend to explain.\"If Mother comes to ask you again, then simply tell her that she doesn't have to worry so much and our family is doing well.\" Lin Qing He stated.Zhou Qing Bai knew that his wife must be displeased due to his Mother getting involved in their family matter.But he was the type of person that didn't know how to explain, so he could only solemnly stare at his wife.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86. The best mother in the villageLin Qing He exited with a sway of her hip. She continued to cut out red date petals. She cut the red dates into small petals with a scissor and removed the seed. Then she used it to make red date buns.As for Mother Zhou.Even though Lin Qing He express understanding, Lin Qing He didn't approve.They had already separated, so even if she cares about this side, there should be a limit. Routinely nagging, can it not be bothersome?If it was a goody-two-shoe, maybe they won't see it that way and be grateful to Mother Zhou for being so concerned about her family.However, Lin Qing He won't accept such kindness.She was the mistress of her family and did as she likes. If there was something wrong, Zhou Qing Bai can correct her. But outsiders absolutely can't.This was the bottom line for her as family head.So in the following days, whatever delicious stuff was made at home never got delivered to old Zhou Family.\"I passed by today. I saw Da Wa and his brothers were eating mantou. They said it was red date mantou and very delicious.\" Second Brother mentioned.He wasn't purposely sowing disorder. It was just a casual comment.Father Zhou paid no heed, while Mother Zhou was silent.\"I assume there weren't much and was a new treat for Da Wa and his kids.\" Third Sister-in-law voiced out.\"Why didn't they send a portion of new treat over for Father and Mother.\" Second Sister-in-law raised an eyebrow.\"They have separated, they got to live their life there.\" Eldest Sister-in-law smiled.After eating, they returned to their own rooms. Third Brother questioned with an awkward expression: \"What's going on?\"Third Sister-in-law snorted: \"It's Second Sister-in-law. She tattered to Mother about Fourth's wife giving something to her third brother. Mother became unhappy. She probably when over to give some reminders as Fourth's wife didn't share anything with the elder. \"\"Huh, they already moved out. It doesn't matter what Qing Bai's wife does have nothing to do with our side ah. What is Mother going over to criticize for?\" Third Brother said.\"Mother has always favored Fourth Brother-in-law, and now the whole family burden sits on Fourth Brother-in-law's shoulders, Mother definitely won't agree to Fourth's wife supplementing her maternal family.\" Third Sister-in-law pointed out.Eldest Brother discussed this with Eldest Sister-in-law when they returned to the room.\"Second's wife was stirring trouble. Why did she talk about this to Mother.\" Eldest Zhou said.Eldest Brother responded: \"Mother is also nosy. She knows then she knows. The family had already divided, whatever happened there has no relation to here, so why does she always goes there and badger them?\"\"Who knows.\" Eldest Sister nonchalantly replied.As for Second Sister-in-law, she rewarded Second Brother with a hug and kiss once they entered the room. Second Brother had a disgusted look: \"What are you doing?\"\"What, you're averse to me?\" Second Sister-in-law immediately glared.Second Brother twitched his mouth and thought, 'if you're like Fourth's wife, I would welcome all the kisses. But look at your own face, how can it be comparable to Fourth's wife.'Speaking of this, usually when the men talked in private, they talked about Fourth's wife. Of course, he listened to it silently. He dared not say it to them.They all said that old Fourth was blessed.Second Brother also felt that his fourth brother was lucky.See how well Fourth's wife had nurtured him after he came back? He heard she was being creative with the food.He also witnessed it with his own eyes this summer harvest. At lunch, it was white meat buns, or spring pancakes, or fried dumplings. The worst was cornmeal mantou.But it was still served with a lunchbox full of a dish with numerous meat for old Fourth to eat.After a bustling summer harvest, who hadn't become skinny from exhaustion except for old Fourth. Not just that, he was obviously nourished well. This had him envious.\"I'm speaking, what are you thinking?\" Second Sister-in-law uttered.\"Nothing, what else can I think about.\" Second Brother sighed: \"I don't know when our family will make something delicious?\"Passing by Fourth's house, he wanted to go in and scrounge a meal. Watching how the kids' red date mantou and the sweet fragrance it emitted had a lot of children gathering around, he became too embarrassed to enter in the end.\"Our Mother lives frugally. It's not a special day, so don't think about it\" Second Sister-in-law waved her hand.At this time their son came in and said that Elder Brother Da Wa nad others had delicious treat again, he wanted to eat it too.Second Sister-in-law's son was called Zhou Xia, about the same age as Er Wa. He was older than Eldest Sister-in-law's eldest son Zhou Yang, because Eldest Sister-in-law had daughters in front.\"Eat what? Why not go and become their family's son.\" Second Sister-in-law scolded.\"Can I?\" Zhou Xia's eyes lighted up even more.Second Brother laughed: \"Son, you don't have that life. Let's eat cornmeal pancake at home.\"His son's face dropped.He really wanted to be Fourth Uncle and Fourth Aunt's son.Elder Brother Da Wa got yummy food every day. It was either meat or noodles or white mantou. Also, they ate white rabbit candy, malted milk powder, and huge watermelon!Their life was so blissful. He also wanted to be his uncle's son.Da Wa and his brothers weren't just envied by Zhou Xia. Zhou Yang, Eldest Sister-in-law's son was envious too. Same with Third Sister-in-law's Zhou Wu Ni.These were old Zhou Family's. There were still the children in the village. Once it got out, who didn't feel envious?They heard adults say Da Wa's Mother doesn't know how to live, but they felt that there was no mother in the world who can live more properly than Da Wa and his brothers' Mother.If she was their mother, how good it'll be?Lin Qing He didn't know that she had become the most ideal mother in the eyes of the children in the village.She was only experimenting with the red date mantou this time, but she didn't expect it to work out so well. She liked it.But red dates weren't cheap, but they will be much cheaper when new ones come out. At that time, she can buy more back to make them. She never thought of making red dates mantou before.Once Zhou Qing Bai came back from work, he went fishing for ricefield eel, catching loach, capturing fish, and shrimp. Even the snail was brought back by him. His wife's cooking skills were excellent, and these can become delicious things in the hands of his wife.\"If I go to the county city next time, I'll bring you a bottle of Maotai wine. Serving this and drinking the wine will have you delighted.\" Lin Qing He fried the snail and said to Zhou Qing Bai.Zhou Qing bai beamed: \"The next time you buy a bottle back, let's drink together?\"\"Alright.\" Lin Qing He raised an eyebrow.At this time, the eel was also very fat and delicious. The important thing was that it was a pure free-range. It got a lot of nutrition. If Zhou Qing Bai wasn't exhausted from farm work, Lin Qing He would send him every day to go fishing for eel.\"Let's keep the loach for tomorrow. Go exchange the soybean dreg and bring back some tofu. I will make some fried tofu.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Okay.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Life at home was unquestionable. Lin Qing He took Er Wa and San Wa back to the county city after seven or eight days.Must say, the brothers became smarter day by day after following Lin Qing He on her trip.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87. Chen Shan the scumSoon September arrived and they entered the season of autumn. The autumn harvest started at the end of this month and all the way up till November.This was a very huge project, equivalent to three times the summer harvest's effort. That was enough to understand how tormenting this autumn harvest was.Still, Lin Qing He did not enter the field.From the beginning of this project that started at the end of September. Lin Qing He made lunch every day and delivered it over. Because she empathized with how much toil it was on Zhou Qing Bai, she took on all the chores at home.Even the pigsty was cleaned before he returned home, so Zhou Qing Bai, who was busy, doesn't have to tidy the pigsty and chicken shed when he returned.As for lunch, Lin Qing He exhausted her all creativity.Big buns, mantou with fried meat, or cornmeal mantou with stew meat.Of course, a huge bundle of vegetables can't be omitted, such as tomato soup and green bean soup.She had brought it all to Zhou Qing Bai.The lunch was delivered by bike. She didn't care about the old Zhou's house. Even when Eldest Sister-in-law suggested that she help her bring it, Lin Qing He refused without hesitation.Every family did their own thing. Don't mix them together, so no one gets condemned.Yes, Lin Qing He was still mad about Mother Zhou poking into her family affairs. She wasn't one to let herself be aggrieved, so naturally, she won't take care of the old Zhou Family.When harvesting this summer, she would send a portion of mung bean soup or something to the old Zhou Family. But this autumn harvest, that side didn't receive a single bite from her. Of course, Lin Qing He also knew they might not desire it, but what does it have to do with her?Her attitude was very obvious. She was in charge of her family's affairs, and no one else is allow to chip in, even if it was the mother-in-law, Mother Zhou. Her intention was good but still shouldn't stick in.It may be overbearing, but that was the kind of person she was.Zhou Qing Bai probably felt it too. As he drank the mung bean soup, he snuck glances at his wife.Lin Qing He's eyelids soberly squinted at him: \"Do you have something to say?\"Before Zhou Qing Bai had the chance to speak, Da Wa spoke on behalf of his father: \"Mother, do you need to send some to grandpa and grandma?\"\"If Old Zhou's home wants to drink, don't they have mung beans to cook? Since they didn't make it, it means that they don't want to drink.\" Lin Qing He indifferently replied.\"Then Second Aunt will definitely criticize you,\" Er Wa remarked.\"So what if she criticize! If she has the gut to come and say it to my face, I'll definitely give her a good punishment.\" Lin Qing He sneered.Zhou Qing Bai felt helpless.\"Quickly eat and rest once done.\" Lin Qing He ordered.Zhou Qing Bai munched his own food. Same with Da Wa and Er Wa. After eating, they laid on the nylon polybag and catnapped.There was limited time to rest, but drowse when they can.Lin Qing He took San Wa home on the bike, as well as Third Sister-in-law.Third Sister-in-law advised her: \"Don't hold your grudge so long.\"Lin Qing He laughed: \"What grudge do I have? Everybody has their own life, wasn't it like this before?\"Third Sister-in-law said: \"Before was before, now is now. Now Fourth Brother-in-law is also at home, you acting like this makes his heart ill at ease.\"Lin Qing He gave no response, but her mind muttered, 'how am I making Zhou Qing Bai ill at ease?'But she didn't give much explanation. After all, there was a generation gap, and some things cannot be communicated.When she got home, she separated from Third Sister-in-law. Lin Qinghe led San Wa home. At this time, an urban educated youth came over: \"Fourth Zhou Sao, can I have a lend of the bicycle? I'm going to the field. Fourth Zhou Ge and the kids can ride back in the evening.\"Lin Qing He frowned: \"Who are you?\"\"My name is Chen Shan, an urban educated youth from Jin City. Please take care of me Fourth Zhou Sao.\" The urban educated youth, Chen Shan, smiled gently.Lin Qing He's face remained unchanged, while her heart was surprised. After the shock, she sneered.Chen Shan?Wasn't this the scum man who seduced the original owner in the original plot?No wonder in life, encounters happen everywhere. She came across him now!\"Educated youth Chen, before today we never met and you still dare to come and borrow a bike from me. Who gave you the face? Do you think because you are an educated youth from Jin City, that you're so amazing?\" Lin Qing He laughed, but what was said was similar to cold scum.A scum man dared to come to her and pretend to be elegant?However, Chen Shan was able to maintain his grace and look: \"The Fourth Zhou Sao's words said it like you discriminate against us, urban educated youth who came to the countryside and is no different from everyone.\"\"Can be called discrimination. Just some people, who aren't what they appear to be, dissuade people from giving flatters. Of course, it's undeniable that most of them are good, but there happened to be some lazy bum, who has never gone to work til now!\" With a chuckle, Lin Qing He turned around with San Wa and walked away.Although she got even more unpleasantness to give, she mustn't go overboard and give some face as her three kids were still young\"Such a lovely skin, to marry such a rough country man, you'll have a time when you'll regret it, I'm waiting for you to follow me once you're in regret!\" Chen Shan's gaze held a must-have intention as he watched Lin Qing He's back.Based on Chen Shan's high-level examination, Zhou Qing Bai's wife was a gem. She got what was truly defined as a waist and a hip. That face was so smooth that one can pinch out water.Within these ten li and eight villages, one couldn't find such a woman. Even if she had three sons, she was still so beautiful and so tempting.Sooner or later, you will beg for mercy under me!Despite not knowing what this sewer rat thought, Lin Qing He held contempt toward him.In fact, the original owner didn't fancy this man, but she was tempted by Chen Shan only after she was forced into a helpless corner. Although the external temptation was there, it was still due to the fact that the original owner wasn't highly-principled.She was not the same as the original owner. In her opinion, Zhou Qing Bai was great in every aspect, so no such thing will happen.No matter how powerful the plot was, since she was here, it was her decision!\"Mother, sleepy.\" San Wa said as soon as he came home.\"Mother happened to be sleepy too.\" Lin Qing He grinned and went to bed with her son.They slept until 2:30 and Lin Qing e got up. San Wa had enough sleep, so she let him play with Fei Ying. Lin Qing He went off to handle the dough to steam mantou. As the dough was resting, she started to clean the pigsty and chicken shed.Since Zhou Qing Bai was too worn out, she will help out with a question. If the original owner was still there, then it was impossible for the family to raise pigs. She believed that she has done a lot better than the original owner, but Mother Zhou still gave criticize. Even if her original intention was benevolent, she really doesn't approve.So don\u2019t blame her for being extreme. What she wanted to express was that she doesn\u2019t need anyone, even her mother-in-law, to intervene in her family\u2019s affairs, no matter how big or small.She won't accept any compromise. On this matter, as long as Mother Zhou did not express her attitude or come up with an attitude, there was no room for reconciliation.Even if Zhou Qing Bai was put on a tight spot, she won't cause herself discomfort. he loved to be troubled then go be troubledSao (zi)- means Sister-in-law/ brother's wife, but also a way to address a married, unrelated woman near their age.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88. Zhou Qing Bai's punishmentWhen Zhou Qing Bai brought Da Wa and Er Wa back, it was already half past six in the evening.It was pretty late this time, so when the father and sons returned home, the delicious meal was ready.White buns are served with tomato &amp; scrambled eggs and a braised pork. A cucumber and a bone radish soup was the finishing touch.The food was very simple but it still a wonderful meal.After the whole family finished eating, Lin Qing He didn't tidy up the dishes and cutlery as usual. It was Da Wa's responsibility.Lin Qing He had finished her work, so she can do as she liked with the time. She started studying.Although there was still seven years more before the college entrance examination, it did not affect her enthusiasm for studying. Since there was nothing to do, then study.Zhou Qing Bai said: \"I can come back and tidy up the pigsty.\"\"When the autumn harvest is over, naturally it'll be you who clean it. At the moment, you don't have to snatch to do it.\" Lin Qing He kept on processing the book's content as she answered without looking up.Zhou Qing Bai stared at her for a moment before going to bathe first.The autumn harvest was indeed tiring, but with enough energy from food and enough time to rest, he can still keep going.When he came back after the wash-up with a cool soapy scent, Lin Qing He glimpsed at him and said, \"After a hectic day, you must be tired? Would you like to take a rest first?\"\"No need.\" Zhou Qing Bai stared at her.Lin Qing He let him be and continued to read her book. She brought up: \"I don't know if the college entrance examination will resume in the future. If it does, then I will try it. Don't stop me.\"\"At that time, how old will you be.\" Zhou Qing Bai did not expect his wife to think of this and uttered with somewhat bafflement.By that time, who knows what age she'll be, so why take part in the college entrance examination?Lin Qing He glared at him: \"I will always be eighteen, understand?\"Zhou Qing Bai nodded very tactfully: \"In my eyes, my wife will always be 18 years old beauty.\"Satisfied, Lin Qing He said, \"At least you're discerning, otherwise you will spend the night with mosquitoes outside.\"Just finished washing the dishes, Da Wa pinched his mouth to copy from her: \"At least you're discerning, otherwise you will spend the night with mosquitoes outside.\"Lin Qing He didn't find it odd when she said it but listening to Da Wa's parroting, she had goosebumps all over. She set down the book and snapped out: \"Zhou Da Wa, do you want a beating?\"\"Mother, you can do it, but I can't. Isn't that what you said just a few days ago, only allow officials to set fire and forbade the common people to light the lights?\" After Da Wa cheekily laughed, he ran out.Lin Qing He sat back down and continued studying as she muttered: \"None of these cheeky boys are affectionate. They all get me fuming. Sons are birthed to collect debts, only girls are caring.\"\"I think so too.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded seriously.Lin Qing He gave him a glance: \"You still dare say that you think so too? Whose planted these seeds!\"Zhou Qing Bai's eyes looked at her softly: \"I didn't expect you to be so capable.\"She was very capable, three sons in one go.But in the future, shouldn't they get a daughter?Speaking of it, he had done it a lot with her, but her stomach still had no movement these days.Lin Qing He gave him an eye roll and mentally uttered, 'it got nothing to do with woman whether they gave birth a boy or girl. It\u2019s up to you guys to decide.'However, this couldn't be randomly voiced out, so she continued to read her book.\"My mother is like that, always worried that our family isn't faring well, so she says a lot.\" Zhou Qing Bai said hesitantly.\"So it's my fault. I should have empathized with her good intentions instead of butting with her, right?\" Lin Qing He gave him a smile.As if without hesitation, Zhou Qing Bai shook his head: \"Wife, I don't mean that.\"\"If you think that I am insensible and unfilial to your father and your mother, you can say it clearly. We can end it here.\" Lin Qing He solemnly declared.Zhou Qing Bai's face sank.Lin Qing He sneered: \"I'm telling you now, Zhou Qing Bai. I don't care if your mother meant well or not. In short, I am filial. She can take anything to eat, but I don't allow others to intervene in my family and how I treat you or your three sons. If you aren't uncomfortable or unhappy, you can tell me directly. But if others come, then I won't be polite.\"After that, she grabbed the book and went straight to the children's room.Leaving Zhou Qing Bai with a helpless face.Needless to say, Lin Qing He wanted to sleep on a separate kang tonight instead of sleeping with Zhou Qing Bai, the stinky man. He can sleep by himselfHowever, Zhou Qing Bai refused to. He openly carried her back in front of the three sons, causing Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa to protest.Lin Qing He was embarrassed, while Da Wa didn't mind inflating the matter: \"Daddy, what are you doing!\"\"Taking my wife back to the room to sleep.\" Zhou Qing Bai stated: \"The three of you sleep well. You have to get up early tomorrow morning.\"The latter half was directed to the brothers.In the summer, San Wa no longer slept here. He preferred to sleep with his two brothers.It goes without saying, Zhou Qing Bai was delighted.The kids giggled in agreement and Lin Qing He was taken back to her room.\"Can you not do this in front of the children!\" Lin Qing He warned, but her voice was lowered, so it seemed to coquettish.\"It's time to sleep. There'll be a lot of matter tomorrow.\" Zhou Qing Bai said.Even after the lights went out, Lin Qing He was still angry. Zhou Qing Bai started coaxing her, softly and gentle coaxing.It took almost ten minutes for Lin Qing He to drop her anger. Then Zhou Qing Bai flipped on top of her at once.\"What are you doing? Aren't you tired out from the whole day?\" Lin Qing He said.\"Not tired.\" Zhou Qing Bai began his meat-feasting activity.Halfway through his work, Zhou Qing Bai questioned her: \"Do you dare to say end it with me anymore?\"This woman's words irked him. They got three children already and she dare to say anything!At this critical time, what can Lin Qing He do? Of course, she can only surrender and admit her mistake.Only then, Zhou Qing Bai continued to love her.After busying from nearly nine o'clock to ten o'clock, the couple went to sleep.As for the previous anger, it was naturally quarreling at the head of the bed and reconciled at the end of the bed. That was basically how it was between husband and wife.Zhou Qing Bai was refreshed when he got up the next day, while Lin Qing He slept lazily until she woke up at six in the morning.As for Zhou Qingbai, he had already set off then.The autumn harvest was also harvest rush. At about 4:30a.m., the whole group departed. The sky hadn't lighted yet when they head over. Once the sun rose, a lot of works were already done.Before she went to bed last night, she steamed a pot of pumpkin mantou. As for the vegetable dish, she didn't have time to make. She only cooked a shrimp skin soup to eat with pumpkin mantou.Da Wa and Er Wa wanted to head over, so they followed over their grandma a little later.Although Lin Qing He and Mother Zhou had some differences in opinions, Lin Qing He did not stop the kids from interacting with their grandma. She was not that unreasonable.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89. HeatstrokeShe prepared a hearty breakfast for the boys.Only then did she let the two brothers, Da Wa and Er Wa go out. These brothers were really active.Because of these kind of life, other families' children were forced to go. But these brothers were both eager to go.What can Lin Qing He do? As expected, she can't do nothing.After feeding the pigs and chickens, she began to make the dough. Pancakes was for lunch.She grabbed a handful of mushrooms and soaked them.The filling was bountiful. The soaked mushrooms were diced, then the loin. She plucked three pieces of cucumber and cutted it into sticks for later. Next was scrambled eggs. Eaten with it inside the scallion pancake, the taste will be heavenly.Then she prepared a few tomatoes and a bowl of mung bean soup.These things were what Lin Qing He was going to send over.Usually, she placed these things directly into the space and takes them out after arriving there, so that they won't overflow and easily drop out.After finishing this, it was only past 9 o'clock, not 10 o'clock yet. She waited until 10:30 before delivering the meal with San Wa.\"San Wa, come. Mother will teach you how to draw.\" Lin Qing He, who was at home, started teaching San Wa to draw. She found that San Wa really had a gift for drawing. It must be noted that even though the kid was mischievous, he was serious once he drew.Next time she intends to buy some colored pencils back for San Wa to let him draw better.\"I really envy Fourth's wife. To actually be able to stay at home and paid no heed to outside matters.\" Second Sister-in-law, who was busying away in the field, was so dead tired that her waist and back were sore and she couldn't resist muttering.Second Brother remarked: \"Weren't you saying she was lazy before? Why are you being envious now?\"\"Why else? If it weren't for you being incapable, I won't need to come out and suffer this torment on this day!\" Second Sister-in-law couldn't resist complaining.Now each family was responsible for one piece of land. They don\u2019t work together like before. This one family was responsible for this piece and another was responsible for that piece. The earlier one finished, the earlier one can rest. If not done, then continue to work with no break for lunch.So here was working on one piece.Zhou Qing Bai was responsible for another piece. Don't underestimate him on his own, he can do the work of two.Second brother pursed his lip: \"If you scorn me for being incapable, then you can find another guy.\"This remark made the Second Sister-in-law furious.\"Just work, what are you talking for,\" said Father Zhou from that side.\"Chattering all day long, and not much work done.\" Third Sister-in-law scowled.Third Brother was also exhausted, just commented: \"I wonder what we'll eat at noon.\"\"This time, Mother is at home. What delicious thing can there be?\" Third Sister-in-law sighed.If she or Eldest Sister-in-law was cooking at home, it would definitely be better. But when her mother-in-law was holding fort at home, then, needless to say, cornmeal pancake served with pickled veg and lump veg was the best it can get.Eldest Sister-in-law also held no hope toward this.Eldest Brother scolded her: \"What Mother makes is what you eat.\"Eldest Sister-in-law responded: \"Now the days aren't terrible. After this time, the food will be distributed. We'll also have a bumper harvest this year. We should eat better at home occasionally.\"It was draining to work in the field. If one didn't eat well, how can the body bear the strain?\"Our family hasn't split yet? What Mother makes is what you eat. Can you even complain to Mother? Did you not see Mother is giving displeased attitude toward Fourth's wife.\" Eldest Brother said.Eldest Brother knew this even if he was slow-witted.Because their mother was disgruntled with Fourth's wife's extravagant way in life, where they had either eggs or pork every day, she said a few words.Fourth's wife became offended, so the conflict happened.\"Da Wa's family had already separated out, how they eat and what to make, Da Wa's Mother what she's doing. Can't believe Mother, why did she have to go and say something.\" Eldest Sister-in-law replied.In this matter, she supported Da Wa's mother. If they hadn't separated, then it was fine. Now they moved out, she didn't have to criticize Da Wa's mother on what she wants to do as long as she doesn't reach out to old Zhou Family.It was more like Da Wa's Mother giving attitude to her mother-in-law, rather than their mother-in-law giving disgruntled looks to Da Wa's Mother.Look, there was no bite of delicious food at this side. During the summer harvest, it was a must to send a portion over. Now this even more exhausting autumn harvest. don't dream of sharing a bite.Who was on the losing end?Eldest Brother sighed: \"Fourth's wife hold resentment so long. No matter what, Mother is an elder.\"Eldest Sister-in-law said nothing.Haha, being sisters-in-law for so many years, who didn\u2019t know Da Wa's Mother's character. Expect her to give food when they are in a cold war, gotta be dreaming right?Moreover, Da Wa's mother wasn't in the wrong on this matter. Compared to before, Da Wa's mother was more reasonable now.At least Eldest Sister-in-law and Third sister-in-law were willing to interact with Lin Qing He. As for the others, they don't know.Mother Zhou delivered the lunch. After Lin Qing He learned that she was delivering the meal, she deliberately delayed herself.After she had arrived for a while, she came down much later with the pancakes packaged in the insulated box for Zhou Qing Bai and her sons to eat.\"Did you come with your Eldest Aunt in the morning?\" Lin Qing He asked Da Wa.\"Came with Third Aunt.\" Da Wa answered while eating the pancake.\"Mother, this pancake is really yummy.\" Er Wa munched in content.Lin Qing He observed the brothers' sun-flushed cheeks and nagged, \"Don't you know to rest occasionally when it's too sunny?\"\"How can I rest? If I rest, it'll let them pick up more and our work points will be less.\" Er Wa shook his head.Da Wa nodded in agreement: \"That's right, Mother. Don't worry about us, we're all right.\"Because of the way Lin Qing He fed them, the brothers were fine. But Eldest Third Sister-in-law's eldest daughter, Wu Ni, suffered from heatstroke. (T/N: mistake in raw)That night she vomited and had diarrhea.Third Brother came knocking at midnight to borrow the bicycle to send Wu Ni to the health center.Lin Qing He has taken a liking to Wu Ni. The little girl was very clever and occasionally came to help with chores. Although there was nothing much to do at home, Lin Qing He still gave her a little when there was something delicious.\"Is it serious? I have medicine here, I bought it for an emergency. How about letting her take it first and see?\" Lin Qing He entered into her room and took out the pills.This was something she didn't forget to buy when she was collecting materials. They were all very effective medicines.But she didn't dare to say anything absolutely, instead, said give it a try?\"Thank you Fourth Sister-in-law. I'll take it back to try!\" said Third Brother.Because when brought to the health center, she'll still have to take medicine and injections. Of course, if there was medicine, they can try it first.However, Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai sorted themselves before heading over.As for the three boys at home, they were exhausted from the day and slept like little pigs at this moment. Even thunder couldn't wake them up.It was enough to leave Fei Ying to watch in the house.Wu Ni's face was a little pale. The small face, which was initially tiny, became even thinner. Lin Qing He's medicine was very effective. After eating it, Wu Ni was much better.After being in agony for so long, she fell asleep once she was comfortable.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90. Splitting the familyWhile the child can sleep it off in peace, the adults were in shock.\"This time, it scared me to death. That lass did not say anything when feeling unwell. In the middle of the night, her father and I were anxious as headless flies.\" Third Sister-in-law pulled Lin Qing He closer and gratefully said.\"It's alright now. I still have a bit of this medicine. Tonight, Wu Ni should be fine. I'll ask Da Wa to bring it to you tomorrow morning.\" Lin Qing He comforted.She did not stay too long and went back with Zhou Qing Bai.Father Zhou, Mother Zhou, Eldest Sister-in-law, Eldest Brother, and others were also disturbed and woken up. They were all relieved as well.\"It's really thanks to Da Wa's Mother, otherwise who knows how long Wu Ni would be tormented this time. She's too strong-willed, to bear the discomfort and be silent.\" Eldest Sister-in-law sighed.\"Which medicine did Wu Ni take this time? The effect was so quick?\" Second Sister asked.\"I don't know what medicine, but it's definitely not cheap.\" Third Brother shook his head.\"Then should we give Da Wa's Mother money? I'm afraid that she bought it with much difficulty to prepare for emergency uses.\" Eldest Sister-in-law turned to Mother Zhou.\"Give what money?\" Second Sister-in-law interjected before Mother Zhou could speak, \"All one family, isn't it treating her like an outsider by talking money when helping each other?\"\"Mother, this medicine wasn't easily obtained by Fourth Sister-in-law. I have to get another again tomorrow. The money must be returned to her. After all, they have separated off already. What's more, I'm deeply grateful that Fourth Sister-in-law is willing to take this medicine out for Wu Ni this time!\" Third Sister-in-law piped in.Second Sister-in-law pursed her lips, and then looked at Mother Zhou. Mother Zhou waved her hand and said, \"Ask her how much money and give it to her.\"\"Everyone is tired today, hurry back to rest. We have to get up early tomorrow.\" Father Zhou also said.So they went back to bed.On this side, Lin Qing He explained to Zhou Qing Bai: \"Fortunately, I circled around the black market. The man said it was secretly recipe and sold it dearly to me. I smelled it and felt it was pretty good. So I bought it when you guys in mind, I didn't expect it to come in handy.\"Zhou Qing Bai nodded, as expected, he didn't probe any further about this.The next morning, Lin Qing He passed the medicine to Da Wa and asked him to bring it over.When Da Wa came back, he asked, \"Mother, Third Aunt asked you how much is this medicine.\"Lin Qing He was in the middle of frying cucumber and eggs. In response, she said, \"You can tell your Third Aunt that this medicine is for your sister Wu Ni, no money needed. If she wants to repay, it's enough to let Wu Ni come to help me with the work in the house when she's free. \"This was naturally being courteous, there weren't many chores to do.Third Sister-in-law understood what she meant and stated, \"I'll remember this favor, Fourth Sister-in-law.\"Eldest Sister-in-law didn't head out to work yet. The men went over first. It was no problem for women to go later. At this time, it was only 6 o'clock, so it wasn't too late.\"This medicine works really well.\" Eldest Sister-in-law estimated that this wasn't cheap.Third Sister-in-law was in agreement. Second Sister-in-law remarked: \"She's not short on this bit of money, so there's no need to say so much. Let's get ready, it's time to go. There are many things to do today.\"\"Then you take good care of Wu Ni at home.\" Third Sister-in-law told Third Sister-in-law.Because Wu Ni had a heat stroke, Third Sister-in-law stayed at home to care for her and handle the cooking and the likes.Eldest Sister-in-law, Mother Zhou and Second Sister-in-law brought the group of children to the field, including Da Wa and Er Wa.\"I got to say, Da Wa has grown a lot this year,\" Eldest Sister-in-law said with a smile.Second Sister-in-law glanced over as she sourly said: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, look at what these brothers eat every day. Surely they can grow taller eating like this.\"\"What are you being sour about? If you have that ability, you can do it too.\" Mother Zhou opened her mouth and said to this second daughter-in-law, who always go to finding trouble.Second Sister-in-law glimpsed at her and spoke, \"Mother, if I separate off, I can also live that well.\"The meaning was clear, she wanted to separate.\"Okay.\" Mother Zhou smiled. Watching her, she declared: \"I have discussed with your father, once this autumn harvest is over, we will separate the family for you. Each of you will live on your own, but if you want another pot and stove, there's none, so everyone cooks in the kitchen.\"\"Mother, our first branch doesn't have that intention.\" Eldest Sister-in-law said quickly.\"Of course, the first branch doesn't have that intention. The first branch got three daughters in front and two sons at back. Got so many mouths.\" Second Sister-in-law immediately responded.Zhou Da Ni, Er Ni, and Si Ni were born from Eldest Sister-in-law. (T/N: refer to here for order understanding)Third Sister-in-law's San Ni was the same age as Er Ni, but slightly younger by a bit. The next one was Third Sister-in-law's Wu Ni.Liu Ni was Second Sister-in-law's, and finally, it was Zhou Xia, the son.Second Branch currently had two daughters and one son.First Branch was three daughters and two sons.Third Branch now had a daughter and a son.Fourth Branch, that was Lin Qing He's three sons and no daughters.\"Even though my family has a larger population, my family does not drag us down. Usually, my girls, Da Ni and Er Ni washed the whole family's clothes, earned points by getting pigweed and picking cow dung!\" Eldest Sister-in-law swept her gaze to her.In addition, she and Eldest Brother were diligent, so they will never drag the family behind.On the contrary, it was Second's wife and Second Brother-in-law, who were lazying around and procrastinating!\"Enough, no need to fight. Wait until the autumn harvest is over and the winter wheat is planted, then we'll split. At that time, each family will eat their own. Your father and I are getting old too. We can't govern your business. Go decide for yourself, I won't criticize you in the future.\" Mother Zhou declared.Eldest Sister-in-law knew then, she was serious.And listening to the meaning in this sentence, it seems to indicate her to pass it to Fourth's wife?Eldest Sister-in-law didn't say anything. After all, the two elders decided to split up, so let's split up. After splitting, her family won't fare any worst.As the adults whispered these things, the children weren't listening as they chattered on the way. Even Da Wa and Er Wa wasn't paying any attention to there.They were currently bringing up what their mother said, she will make fried mantou for them for lunch.\"Fried Mantou? Brother Da Wa, can you give me a piece at that time?\" Zhou Xia, Second Sister-in-law's son, couldn't resist telling him.The fried mantou sounded very yummy and he had never eaten them.Not only that he hadn\u2019t eaten it before, but none of the other kids(No.1-4 &amp; 6 girls and Zhou Yan(first branch eldest boy)) present either.As for Eldest Sister-in-law\u2019s younger son and Third Sister-in-law\u2019s son Zhou Dong Dong, they were too young, so they stayed at home. Whoever cooks at home will take care of it.Normally, rural children were like this. They basically grew up playing with mud on their own.It was impossible to say they were carefully raised.Da Wa kept showing off as showing off, he won't share his own food, uttered: \"My mother didn\u2019t make much. There's enough to share with so many of you. And Third Aunt will cook for you at home today. She'll definitely prepare some tasty things to eat.\"\"That's right, Third Aunt will definitely make you a good meal.\" Er Wa nodded too. Don't covet his family's stuff.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91. Splitting the family is a good idea.\"Eat fried mantou, they really know how to enjoy.\"The children were happily chattering away there, while the adults here listened. Second Sister-in-law couldn't help blurting out.Mother Zhou had decided that to govern so much to provoke her daughters-in-law's dissatisfaction. Once the family separates and she had no plans to control anything.Eldest Sister-in-law pondered on what delicious thing to make for the children one day after the family split away.At home, Lin Qing He knew that her Third sister-in-law was watching the house. She came over once her work at home was completed.Although Wu Ni was still tired and unwell, her complexion was much better than last night.After making sure she was fine, she chatted with Third Sister-in-law and then left San Wa behind. San Wa wanted to play with Zhou Dong Dong and Eldest Sister-in-law\u2019s younger son, Tu Dou. He hadn't gotten a formal name yet, for now his nickname was Tu Dou.Da Wa and Er Wa weren't boasting. Lin Qing He did promise that they'll eat fried mantou when the brothers asked what was for lunch.She sliced the mantou, layered on an egg liquid mixed with salt and sesame, and fried until the sides were browned. The taste was fantastic.Lin Qing He made a lot and had used the peanut oil she brought.After so long, the five barrels of peanut oil she brought with her, she had only used one bottle as she usually used lard. So there were four bottles left.So she acted thriftlessly and used this oil for the fried mantou.In addition to fried mantou, was mung bean soup. The mung bean soup was pure mung bean soup without sugar, as it was the best combination to serve like this.It should be enough for the whole family to eat. Lin Qing He began to boil green grass to make a pot of refreshing water, which was specially used to relieve the heat.When lunch was delivered at noon, she dropped over to Third Sister-in-law to pick up old Zhou Family's share.She didn't bring along San Wa, instead, she left him at the old Zhou's house for Third Sister-in-law to babysitOf course, she had left fried mantou and mung bean soup for San Wa, Wu Ni, and Zhou Dong Dong to eat. (T/N: what about potato(Tu Dou)??The weather was really blazing and sultry. Lin Qing He felt like this when she came to deliver the meal, so if they wanted to make her work, don't even think about it. She can\u2019t accept it.So when seeing Zhou Qing Bai, Lin Qing He was very attentive for once.\"In my opinion, this fried mantou served with green bean soup can easily produce body heat, so these herbal teas are specially prepared for you father and sons. Remember to drink it, okay?\" Lin Qing He urged.Watching how she was so naggy, Zhou Qing Bai's eyes were soft and uttered, \"Eat more.\"\"I ate at home.\" Lin Qing He waved her hands. However, Zhou Qing Bai gave more pressure, so she ate another piece.Da Wa and Er Wa were already fulfilled by this meal.The fried mantou was golden brown on both sides with black sesame seeds and eggs on the top. Salty and crispy, so delicious with mung bean soup.The food for old Zhou Family was brought by Lin Qing He, but she handed it to Eldest Sister-in-law and cared no more.Second Sister-in-law looked over to this side, as expected it was fried mantou. As she ate the pancake made by Third Sister-in-law, she said, \"And it's covered in egg and sesame seeds.\"The aromatic scent flowed over here along with the wind.\"Really know how to indulge.\" Second Brother munched on the pancake, as he blurted.It was pretty good to have a double-sized pancake today. But if compared with Fourth Family's fried mantou, it was nothing.Eldest Brother shook his head and expressed, \"How can they live like this?\" Eating like this, how much things were needed?Eldest Sister-in-law thought, \"What's wrong with living this? How much better Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa?\"However, it was her, Eldest Sister-in-law dare not.Occasionally making it for the children as fine. As for cooking creatively every day was impossible.After all, within so many groups, it was really impossible to find a second one like Fourth's wife.Father Zhou said nothing, he never cared about this.Mother Zhou had thought it through, so she didn't say anything. They were two families and managing too much was a bad ideaRecently, she got told off by Father Zhou, so she became open-minded and was ready to separate and let the children live their own life.But providing for the elderly was a must.Lin Qing He prepared to head back after serving fathers and sons. She instructed them that if they felt uncomfortable, they had to find a place to rest immediately.She also left two pills for Zhou Qing Bai to keep for an emergency.The autumn harvest days were indeed bustling, and this year, they had a pretty good harvest season, So despite being busy, everyone had the pure and simple joy on their face as they knew they secured their food this year.It was the end of October in a flash.Numerous grains had been collected. Some grains were distributed as soon as they had handed over the public rations. Some who hadn't finish collecting yet, continue to work.During this period, the entire group was filled with merriment.This year, a lot of food was allocated to the family. Lin Qing He, who had no sense of collective honor, was quite happy to see the food that Zhou Qing Bai carried back.\"This year our two pigs will be able to exchange a lot of food when the time comes.\" Lin Qing He said.She had put in the effort to serve the two big fat pigs at home and now it was excessive to call it big fat pig. They were probably about two hundred jins?Lin Qing He had fed them several times a day with pigweed, rice bran, soybean waste, soybean dregs, cornmeal, and the likes. With so much good stuff, how can it not grow meat?Zhou Qing Bai stated: \"This year we can get a pig's head.\"Lin Qing He stared at him. Does this mean he wants to eat pig head?Lin Qing He had no liking for pig's head meat but since Zhou Qing Bai liked it, she nodded and said, \"Alright, we'll get a pig's head. I'll make braised pork head meat for you.\"Zhou Qing Bai gazed at her.Lin Qing He's heart beat a little faster from his stare. It was broad daylight, what can he do? So she kissed him on the cheek. Before she could escape, she was hugged by Zhou Qing Bai.Lin Qing He coughed and talked about the serious matter: \"I heard Eldest Sister-in-law said that your parents intend to let the three families split once the autumn harvest is over.\"\"Splitting the family is a good idea.\" Zhou Qing Bai replied.It was ridiculous for so many people to huddle together, even though it was a norm in the village. Zhou Qing Bai believed it was still better to separate and each family lived their own lives.\"Father and Mother aren't young anymore. When the times come, you discuss with your brothers on how you'll provide for the elderly. Whether it's given monthly or quarterly.\" Lin Qing He reminded.It can be regarded as Mother Zhou giving her standpoint, letting everyone have their own way and she had no intention to intervene.So as a daughter-in-law, Lin Qing He put a stop and no longer hold back.Since hearing from Eldest Sister-in-law, she often let Zhou Qing Bai and the kids bring a share of the meal over to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou.The previous matter was considered to be over.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92. Getting Meat and eating it.After the last grain was collected and handed over to the public ration, the last food distribution beganThen winter wheat was planted again, and the production team announced that the work was finished.At this time, the pigs were killed and the meat got distributed. At the same time, if anyone in the village raised the pigs, they have to drive the pigs out and be tasked to hand over the pig.Other families reached seventy to eighty jins at best. However, Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai's two pigs were at least about two hundred jins each.Two pigs racked up above four hundred jins.When these two pigs were guided out, it caused a sensation throughout the entire Zhoujia Village.So they all rushed to find out from Zhou Qing Bai how to raise them? How can the pigs get so fat?Zhou Qing Bai had nothing to hide; foraged pigweed, soybean waste, soybean dregs, and cornmeal.The first few were fine, but the cornmeal at the back was shocking.What, feed the pig with cornmeal?They don't even get to eat cornmeal, so how could they used it to feed pigs.Needless to say, this must have been his terrible wife's idea.Lin Qing He was used to bearing such blame, so when Zhou Qing Bai wanted to say that they used to raise pigs like this back in the force, he was stopped by Lin Qing He. She told him, he didn't need to say more. They could believe it if they want.But there was no doubt that these two big fat pigs which can outweigh the other normal five fat pigs, were very eye-catching. It went without saying that the work points won't be lacking. More importantly, the whole village was sharpening the knife at once.Because other families, including those on the team, didn't achieve such fatness, they wanted to kill these two to distribute with everyone. If they can get pig fat, it will definitely be able to boil a lot of lard for use!So with the consent of everyone, the village branch secretary signaled the slaughter and the others rushed to complete the task.This time the pork distribution can be handed out again before the New Year. There were still a lot of pigs on the farm, which was reserved for the community.This time, the autumn harvest was draining, so everyone ate better.So their family's pigs were killed. Zhou Qing Bai asked for a pig head, a length of pork intestines, a pork stomach, a pigtail, five jins of pork fat, eight large ribs, and large bones. He also got a good bit of pork belly and lean meat.The most popular and well-recognized as good meat nowadays was fatty pork, then followed by pork belly loin, and pig head.As for the pig's large intestine, pork stomach, and the internal bits, they weren't counted. And the lean pork, ribs, and big bones weren't popular, so they were all cheap.So even though it looked at a lot, it was in fact matched to his work points.Moreover, these two big fat pigs were raised by his family. It was no problem for him to pick from it first. No one in the village would say anything.Even if many people coveted the big pig's head, no one dared to object when Zhou Qing Bai took it away.\"Da Wa's Mother, why didn't you let Fourth Brother-in-law ask for more pork fat? How can those meat be better?\" Eldest Sister-in-law came over and whispered.\"It's okay, we should leave some for everyone.\" Lin Qing He replied.\"Da Wa's is very broad-minded.\" Huang Daniang, their neighbour, praised her.\"Huang Daniang, what's with your words? If she was really broad-minded, then why haven't I seen her enter the field once.\" Wang Ling snickered.\"If I go to the field, can you still have such good pork like my family's? Do you know how difficult it was to raise such a big fat pig? Shut up when you got something to eat. No one will treat you as a mute when you don't talk.\" Lin Qing He gave her no respect.Wang Ling's face blackened.Lin Qing He shot a humorless smile. Whether it was fighting or quarreling, she was not afraid. If she got ability, then come!Truthfully, Wang Ling didn't dare to go up, so she turned around and talked to Second Sister-in-law. Second Sister-in-law glimpsed at Lin Qing He. Lin Qing He paid no heed to her.Once Zhou Qing Bai was allocated with the meat, she followed him back with Da Wa, Er Wa and San Wa.\"Mother, this year our family got so much pork, can we make meatballs?\" Da Wa asked.Er Wa looked expectantly at his mother.He still remembered the delicious fried meatballs that were made last year.San Wa was young, but he knew from his eldest brother and second brother's desire, it was yummy. So he turned to his mother: \"Mother, meatball.\"\"Alright.\" Lin Qing He was in a good mood and agreed at once.Just meatballs, not a big deal? Want to eat, then let's eat, since there was so much meat at home.After returning home, Lin Qing He sent Zhou Qing Bai to clean up the pig's intestines. These things were what he wanted to eat. She couldn't bear the smell, so she only promised to make it but for the cleaning, he can do it himself. She also got him to clean the stomach as well.Lin Qing He began to sort the rest.She cut the pork fat into small pieces and then placed directly to the pan to start cooking lard.Even though it was only five jins, they still got a lot of oil at home. What's more, she had mixed in some peanut oil, it was definitely enough.There was a lot of oil oozing out from the five jins.While the fat was cooked, Lin Qing He began to pour out large bones, pork belly and lean meat.Although the weather is getting cold now and it was only the end of October on the lunar calendar, it can't stay fresh in the end, unlike meat distribution at the end of the year. That time, it can last longer.Because they were going to make meatballs, these meats were set aside. Ribs can be in soup or steamed or fried ribs.Big bones were used for boiling soup.The pork intestine outside will be fried with pickled veg. And there was also a huge pig head and stomach.In short, Lin Qing He went all out.This time the autumn harvest was really exhausting. It went without saying that it was necessary to nourish Zhou Qing Bai.So in the next few days, unless Zhou Qing Bai had no appetite, he ate until he got a mouthful of oil.Probably due to be sated and the winter wheat has been planted, Zhou Qing Bai, who was idle and had nothing to do, used all his energy on Lin Qing He at night as they were basically preparing for winter isolation.Zhou Xiao Mei, who got a holiday break, saw her Fourth Sister-in-law's glamorous appearance and became all shy. Who knew what was going through her mind.\"What are you doing on this return? Are you going to get married?\" Lin Qing He raised her eyebrows and said to her.\"Now that my father and mother are free, I came back to let my parents know and then settle on a time.\" Zhou Xiao Mei was embarrassed, but that didn't hold back the spring aura.\"Great ah! Go tell Father and Mother. They should be delighted. Su Da Lin is a good man.\" Lin Qing He expressed.After then, she had met and conversed with him a few times. Su Da Lin won't go wrong, he knows how to live well.\"En, then I'll go back first.\" Zhou Xiao Mei said.\"Take this plate of meatballs back. Adding a dish for you. Remember to bring the plate back.\" Lin Qing He gave her a plate of meatballs and said.\"Thank you Fourth Sister-in-law.\" Zhou Xiao Mei grinned as she received it.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everything else was simple.Of course, even if they wanted something complicated, there was none.Lin Qing He was already prepared, while the old Lin Zhou family was preparing for separation recently.Zhou Xiao Mei's matter came at a perfect time.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou decided to wait until they marry off their youngest daughter, and then they separate the family.Su Da Lin came over the next day along with Da Lin's Jiu and Aunt. They had prepared adequate gifts.There was sugar, snacks, and the likes. In short, it was decent for this meeting and had the intention to place importance here. If not, they would not prepare such a good gift.Although Father Zhou and Mother Zhou felt that Su Da Lin's stuttering was not a good point, the two of them had self-awareness, knowing if it was not this shortcoming, how could their daughter marry to such a family?A forty square home as well as a permanent job. Once married over, she was the matriarch. And the four major wedding presents were all sorted out. (T/N: 4 major household items that people wanted in the late 1950s - radio, bicycle, sewing machine and watch)Toward such marriage for Zhou Xiao Mei, they didn't have much to say. The conditions were excellent.After Su Da Lin and his Jiu and aunt left, Mother Zhou was overjoyed: \"No wonder Da Wa's Mother said this marriage is top-notch. This marriage is really superb.\"\"Only have some stuttering,\" Zhou Father said.\"What's wrong with stuttering? It's not he's mute. What's more, the most important thing in life is to make money, the rest is nothing.\" Mother Zhou retorted.All in all, this marriage was settled, at the end of this month.Although Lin Qing He had witness the speed of people getting married in this era, she was still shocked by the speed.The next step was the dowry.Lin Qing He returned from the county city that day with a brand new quilt.She had already prearranged the cotton and ordered it. Although it was only five jins, it was a quality new quilt.\"I'm giving this new quilt to Guzi as a dowry. These two soaps were also prepared for her. When the time comes, let her take them together.\" Lin Qing He cycled to old Zhou's House and directly gave Mother Zhou the quilt and the soap she has taken from her space as she explained.\"No need for so much.\" Mother Zhou didn't expect that she would give so many things to Xiao Mei for her marriage, said.Whether it was the quilt or these two soaps that were not cheap at first glance, they were excellent goods.\"It's a bit much.\" Eldest Sister-in-law remarked with slight unease.\"How can we compare with Da Wa's Mother? What kind of living condition she has and what kind is our?\" said Second Sister-in-law.Third Sister-in-law remained silent.Lin Qing He solemnly glanced at Third Sister-in-law: \"If you have something to talk about, then talk. Don't cover it all in sour air. If you have the ability, ask your man to earn for you to spend. If you don't have the ability, shut up.\"Second Sister-in-law's face sank, saying, \"Fourth's wife, how can you speak like this!\"\"No matter how I speak, it's still human's word, which some people's dog mouth can't even vomit out decent sound and can't even speak human words.\" Lin Qing He swept her a contemptuous gaze.\"Do you want to fight?\" Second Sister-in-law pushed her without hesitation.It was apparent that Second Sister-in-law had enough of Lin Qing He.\"Mother, Eldest Sister-in-law, Third Sister-in-law, you saw it right? It was Second Sister-in-law who hit me first.\" Once Lin Qing He finished the sentence, she flipped Second Sister-in-law over the shoulder onto the ground.\"Boom!\" The ground resounded.All the women in the whole house were stunned. Not to mention them, even Father Zhou who was smoking a big cigarette was also taken aback.Mother Zhou's expression displayed bewilderment, while Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law were startled.\"Aiyo, it hurts like hell. Fourth's wife, do you want to kill someone!\" Second Sister-in-law laid on the ground moaning. With every hum, her body ached. She can't even get up on her own.\"I'm giving you face by calling you Second Sister-in-law. And you really parade it around? Don't you know how many jins you are? Is Zhou Qing Bai's woman, someone you can push around?\" Lin Qing He domineeringly gazed at her.\"Hurry, hurry up and support Second's wife up.\" Mother Zhou regained her mind and uttered hastily.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law had also just recovered, so they quickly helped Second Sister-in-law up. Mother Zhou ordered: \"Support her back (to her room).\"With this, the two sisters-in-law carried Second Sister-in-law back.Lin Qing He paid no mind to this. Don't just say Second Sister-in-law had tolerated her for a long time, she too had endured Second Sister-in-law. This time, she dared to move her hand first, would she still be polite to her?Take action when she should!When the two sisters-in-law came back, Lin Qinghe continued on the previous matter with Mother Zhou and the two of them: \"Mother, this is for Guzi's marriage, I will leave it here. As for Eldest Sister-in-law and Third sister-in-law, you don't need to copy me. Xiao Mei knows what each family's situation is like. The intention is enough. I\u2019ve seen Xiao Mei\u2019s new house over there. Everything is complete. At the end of the month, everyone joyfully sends Guzi off to her marriage. Don\u2019t get upset over this marriage gifts.\"Having said this, Lin Qing He went back in a very good mood.\"Cough, is Second's wife fine?\" Only then, Mother Zhou turned to the two sisters-in-law.\"She's fine. Just some ache,\" answered Third Sister-in-law.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think this quilt is brand new.\" Father Zhou examined the new quilt.Mother Zhou\u2019s attention shifted to this: \u201cIt\u2019s newly-made. Really thoughtful.\u201d\"You decide.\" Father Zhou said.\"Then give fifty?\" Mother Zhou replied.\"Isn't that a bit little?\" Father Zhou blankly stared at her.Mother Zhou responded: \"What little. She and Da Lin both have jobs. They can make a lot of money every month. In the end, only a bit was divided to the family. Her work didn't bring much back, how much do you expect?\"\"That side gave the four major gifts,\" Zhou Father pointed out.\"Keep the bicycle at home, and send everything else back with her. At that time, there's be this quilt, soaps, hot water bottle, and the likes.\" Mother Zhou stated.Father Zhou had no comment.Mother Zhou said in a small voice: \"We still need to save money for Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa's marriage. Look how Da Wa's Mother extravagantly splurge. They can't save much. What should to do when the boys marry?\"At this, Father Zhou still said nothing.It was true that his daughter has no shortage over there. Then leave it for Da Wa and his brothers.The old couple neglected Second Sister-in-law. After all, she was the one who started the fight first. Everyone saw her pushing Fourth's wife first. Who can she blame when she got thrown?But how could Second Sister-in-law be willing to leave it like this? Second brother came back from the outside and saw her lying on the kang as she groaned in pain.\"Why are you crying out for?\" Second Brother asked.\"Damn you! Your wife nearly got beaten to death and where did you run off to!\" Second Sister-in-law yelled at once.Second Brother was shocked: \"Got beaten! Who dare to beat you?\"Second Sister-in-law gritted her teeth as she uttered, \"It was that Fourth's wife. Lin Qing He beat me!\"\"You got to be kidding me.\" Second Brother frowned: \"How can you not win against her? With her dainty appearance, does she know how to fight? Two of your push is enough.\"Second Sister-in-law was so vexed: \"Whose's side are you on? I was beaten by Lin Qing He. Father, Mother, and the other sisters-in-law saw it with their own eyes. If you don't believe me, you can ask them. I'm telling you, Zhou Qing Lin, this matter between Lin Qing He and I ain't over. If your old Lin Zhou Family doesn't hold her accountable, then I will go back to my maternal house to find my brothers. My brothers won't agree to me getting beaten!\"Second Brother frowned. He came out and asked Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law: \"Eldest Sister-in-law, Third Sister-in-law, what happened? San Ni's Mother is making a ruckus to go back to her mother's house.\"\"Speaking truthfully, on this matter, it was San Ni's Mother who shoved Da Wa's Mother first.\" Eldest Sister-in-law answered honestly.\"Father and Mother were all present at the time. Third Second Sister-in-law pushed Da Wa's Mother first, and then Da Wa's Mother threw her over the shoulder.\" Third Sister-in-law added.\"Over the shoulder?\" Second Brother was taken aback.\"Probably taught by the Fourth Brother-in-law,\" replied Third Sister-in-law.\"What? Is your wife throwing a tantrum?\" At this time, Mother Zhou came out of the room and looked at Second Brother.\"Mother, San Ni's mother is currently making a scene, wanting to go back to her maternal house to find her brother(s) to come over to give her justice.\" Second Brother hastily explained.\"Alright, go back then! Let's see if my old Zhou Family is easy to bully. Go, and go back for me now!\" When Mother Zhou heard this, her face became solemn and shouted toward Second Sister-in-law's room.\"Mother, I've been beaten like this and you're still partial to her. Are we not your daughters-in-law!?\" Second Sister-in-law angrily talked back.\"I'll ask you then. On today's matter of you receiving a shoulder throw, who was the one who moved their mouth first? Who wanted to move their hand today?\" Mother Zhou Mu questioned.Second Sister-in-law was silent.\"Let alone getting old Second to cause a scene, even if you go find those brothers from your old Chen Family, I can get them to return with their tail between their legs. You spoke first. You also moved first. You can't beat her with your tongue, you use your hand. You can't win with your hand, you still feel you're in the right? If you are discontent, then pack your things and go back to your old Chen's house. Let your old mother come talk to me. I want to ask her how she teaches her daughter!\" Mother Zhou reprimandedAt that side, Second Sister-in-law dared not to speak.\"Go back, keep a good eye on your wife. All-day long, she wagged her tongue and no growth in other aspects can be seen.\" Mother Zhou also targeted Second Brother.Second Brother fleed into his room in disgrace. He disgruntedly vented: \"What are you doing when it's your fault? You made me get scolded by Mother.\"Second Sister-in-law angrily turned around to cry.There's no justice! She was the one who got beaten, and it was still her fault!?Lin Qing He, on the other hand, was ready for Second Sister-in-law to come to find fault with her maternal family. But no one came after she waited for the whole afternoon.Judging by the looks of it, it was suppressed by Mother Zhou.Lin Qing He sent Zhou Qing Bai off to get firewood the next day.Although their household was allocated a lot of burning material this year, they weren't adequate, so more firewood was needed.It was easy to ride a bicycle over and come back with a load or two.Because Zhou Qing Bai was at home, naturally, Zhou Dong was no longer needed. This year Zhou Dong and Zhou Xi also gained a lot of food. It was enough to eat.Zhou Qing Bai was still clueless about his wife beating someone up, but there was indeed a shortage of firewood at home, so he went out to work after lunch.Lin Qing He started steaming sweet potatoes to prepare to make sweet potato mantou.This time, there were a lot of sweet potatoes at home. Perfect for sweet potato mantou. Nowadays, it was getting colder and colder each day and today it had increased a bit.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hurry in and eat. I will heat it up for you.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Taking advantage of these days, I will get more back.\" Zhou Qing Bai nodded.With a bike, he brought back so many. It was almost sufficient after a few more trips, so Lin Qing He gave no objection. She warmed up the buns and the side dishes.While Lin Qing He warmed his meals, he put the firewood in the backyard, so Lin Qing He didn't have to do it later.Zhou Qing Bai was indeed starving and with his appetite already large, he wiped clean everything Lin Qing He heated up.\"Go rest a bit. There's nothing left to do at home.\" Lin Qing He urged.Zhou Qing Bai agreed.He still didn't know about his wife's fight. It was when he was about to go out the next day to get firewood, he got blocked by Second Brother and heard his grumbling, did he found out.\"I didn't know about this matter yet, so I can't give you any explanations. We'll talk about it when I come back.\" Zhou Qing Bai finished and hopped on the bike.When he came back in the afternoon, he asked his wife while he was washing his face.\"What? He dares to come and complain to you? It was she who first moved her mouth. She also struck out first. Still, dare to complain?\" Lin Qing He sneered.\"She hit you?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked.Lin Qing He noticed his focus was on that part and was immediately healed. She beamed: \"I'm fine. She just shoved me a bit and got thrown by me.\"Then added: \"At that time, Father, Mother, and the other two sisters-in-law were there. I have a lot of witnesses on this matter. Even if her old Chen family comes over, I can beat them away!\"Zhou Qing Bai nodded and stated: \"If they really dare to come over, you don't need to take action.\"Lin Qing He got his meaning and shot a grin at him. Zhou Qing Bai returned a soft gaze, said, \"In the future, tell me about these matters straightaway. I won't be angry.\"\"OK.\" Lin Qing He nodded and continued, \"Actually, I haven't taken this seriously. She has endured me for a long time. I also find her displeasing for a long time. The day before yesterday's fight was actually quite refreshing.\"Zhou Qing Bai: \"...\" This time, his gaze toward his wife was a bit helpless.Zhou Qing Bai knew that his wife couldn't be blamed for this matter, so naturally, he ignored Second Brother. On this matter, Second Brother only came over to grumble. In fact, he wanted to express was out of all things, why did you have to teach your wife how to fight?However, before this main point was finished, it was dismissed by Zhou Qing Bai. With this, it was over.Zhou Qing Bai had been busy working these few days. He had prepared all the firewood that his family needs for winter.Once he finished, and it snowed.What's more, a lot got accumulated on the ground.At the end of November, Zhou Xiao Mei got married. The whole family sent her off. Because it was too cold and the snow was still falling, everything was simple.Out of the wedding gifts, a bicycle remained. The others were displayed for a bit before gifting it back.The banquet was also held at the in-law's place. Zhou Qing Bai and his brothers had went over, while Lin Qing He and the children didn't attend.Zhou Xiao Mei really liked the quilt and two pieces of soap that Lin Qing He had gifted, especially two pieces of soap. Whoever used it, knew how effective and how fragrant it was.Eldest Sister-in-law gifted a pair of enamel cups, while Third Sister-in-law sent two towels. As for Second Sister-in-law really buttoned up, she didn\u2019t give anything at all.No one criticized her, they didn't want to cause any unpleasantness for such a small thing. After all, it made no difference whether it was included or not.Three days later, Zhou Xiao Mei came back with Su Da Lin.They brought back return gifts for the three families. Lin Qing He's side received a jar of malted milk powder and two bags of white rabbit candy. They had dropped the things here first before heading back to her maternal home.Eldest Sister-in-law and Third Sister-in-law each got a pack of white rabbit candy. And Second Sister-in-law, she received nothing.Zhou Xiao Mei wasn't one to be courteous. Among the sisters-in-law, who treated her well and who didn't take her seriously, she was very clear.For example, this Second Sister-in-law. Since she wasn't even bothered to give a little dowry, then she won't give any respect to her.In fact, Zhou Xiao Mei knew that her fourth sister-in-law had the best living condition. She had no expectation for the other three sisters-in-law, it was more or less the intention they conveyed.For example, Eldest Sister-in-law's enamel cups and Third sister-in-law's towels. They were not worth much money, but it was the thought that counts, right?She didn\u2019t give anything, so why would she prepare her a return gift? Even when Su Da Lin said it was for the better, she maintained her stance.After visiting the old Zhou's house, Zhou Xiao Mei brought Su Da Lin to her fourth brother and fourth sister-in-law's house.Su Da Lin conversed with Zhou Qing Bai in the hall, while Lin Qing He went into the room with Zhou Xiao Mei.\"Judging by your appearance, you got moisturize pretty well. Your complexion is white and rosy.\" Once they entered the door, Lin Qing He opened a perverted topic.Causing Zhou Xiao Mei, who recently married and became a woman, to blush severely.\"To the main point, is Da Wa's young Guzhang good to you?\" Lin Qing He asked in a low voice.\"He's treats me pretty well.\" Zhou Xiao Mei answered with a flushed face.\"That's good, I can rest assured then.\" Lin Qing He expressed with satisfaction: \"Now it's cold these days. You are burning coal there, so better pay attention to ventilation.\"\"En, Da Lin understand these.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded.\"Just now, I saw there was a little dispute when you two came over. Why?\" Lin Qing He asked.\"It's about Second Sister-in-law. She was speaking like riddles when we went over. When I got married, she didn't prepare anything for me. Her hands were empty-handed, so I returned the favor to her. Da Lin said it's not good to act like this and I retorted a bit to him.\" Zhou Xiao Mei explained.Lin Qinghe smiled: \"Da Wa's Guzhang is too kind-hearted.\"\"He is, but I'm not. She deserved the beating from Fourth Sister-in-law last time. Her mouth is harsher than before.\" Zhou Xiao Mei snorted.\"Can't be bothered with her.It's not like the world won't spin without her.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, I feel very blessed now.\" Zhou Xiao Mei beamed again.Lin Qing He grinned and advised, \"Both of you have jobs. From now on, save a bit and see if you can save a sum of money to buy a bigger house.\"\"He has saved some.\" Zhou Xiao Mei mentioned shyly.\"It's only right to save some, but he also spent a lot of money in order for you to marry him splendidly. So, save a little in the future. I am also saving money now. If I can buy a house, I will buy one in the city.\" Lin Qing He said.\"Fourth Sister-in-law, you plan to buy a house in the city?\" Zhou Xiao Mei looked at her.\"In the current situation, can't buy one. Once we moved there, there's no work. I'm saving it for future use.\" Lin Qing He replied.\"Will the situation be better in the future?\" Zhou Xiao Mei was taken aback.\"People have to learn to see the bright side. If we don't have money in our hands, even if the situation improves in the future, we won't be able to have a chance. If we have savings in our hands, we will buy it if able to then.\" Lin Qing He explained.\"En, I'll listen to you, Fourth Sister-in-law, and save money.\" Zhou Xiao Mei nodded.\"Now on these cold days, don't touch the cold water on the normal circumstance. Pay attention to your period. I estimate you'll be pregnant soon.\" Lin Qing He suggested.Zhou Xiao Mei blushed again.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The table was completely harmonious.When Su Da Lin cycled Zhou Xiao Mei back, he stuttered as he spoke: \"Four...Fourth brother and...Fourth Sister-in-law...are very nice.\"Zhou Xiao Mei hugged his waist with a sweet expression: \"That's for sure. Da Lin, my fourth sister-in-law told me that we need to save a bit. There's a chance we'll be able to buy a big house to live in.\"Su Da Lin agreed. Although he spent a lot of time marrying his wife this time, he still has more than a thousand yuans in his saving. This family was definitely quite rich in this era.The husband and wife returned home, while on Lin Qing He's side, a couple discussion was happening.\"Although it's a little stuttering, as long as he treats Xiao Mei with all his heart, there's basically no problem.\" Lin Qing He told Zhou Qingbai.\"En.\" Zhou Qing Bai acknowledged.Toward this Meifu, Su Dalin, he had no prejudice. What's more, as a person, he was great.\"Eldest Gujie and Second Gujie had no time to return when Xiao Mei married. They will probably return on the second day of the New Year.\" Lin Qing He said.This time Zhou Xiao Mei got married, the oldest Guzi, Zhou Xiao Juan and the second Guzi, Zhou Xiao Ju did not return.Zhou Xiao Juan had caught a cold this time, and it was severe. However, she did get her husband to send five yuan as a dowry gift. It counted as her blessing.Because of her mother-in-law catching a severe cold, Zhou Xiao Ju had no choice but to stay behind and care for her as her husband was the only child. She also got her husband to deliver the five yuans to express her thoughts.This Eldest Gujie and Second Gujie were the two eldest sisters, older than Eldest Brother. If men and women were counted together, Eldest Brother would rank third.However, they don't mix it together over here. They ranked men only their own, same with the women.\"Want to go to the county city?\" Zhou Qing Bai understood his wife and looked at her.\"Rather than the second day of New Year, it'll be the same to go on the third day.\" Lin Qing He decided.If Zhou Xiao Mei wanted to visit, then they must stay this year. As for Eldest Gujie and Second Gujie, it didn't matter, because Lin Qing He was not very familiar with them.Then Lin Qing He went over last year's photos.Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa all gathered around to look together. They liked their own photos.\"Mother, can we still take a picture during this year's trip to the county city?\" Da Wa gazed expectantly at his mother.\"Take it, Mother?\" Er Wa also looked hopefully at his mother.\"Want photos!\" San Wa nodded.Lin Qing He nodded: \"Since you behaved very well this year, we can take picture for another year.\"The three children cheered.In the evening Lin Qing He was still gazing at the photos. After she had her fill of being vain, she admired Zhou Qing Bai's.Zhou Qing Bai's picture was also very serious. Even though Lin Qing He requested him to look softer, he still didn't smile. From the looks of it, that was the kind of man he was.\"Just lack photo frames, otherwise I will put them all into a photo frame.\" Lin Qing He remarked.Zhou Qing Bai's eyebrows were soft and spoke, \"I can ask the carpenter to make some.\"Lin Qing He changed her mind again: \"Forget it, leave it to the future. Taking pictures once every year, we'll have a lot of them accumulated. Better to not take up space.\"Zhou Qing Bai left it up to her.It snowed. There basically no activity. Zhou Qing Bai carried back two little piglets to raise.

    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Back to the Sixties: Farm, Get Wealthy & Raise the CubsCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Weak or not, don't you know the best?\" Zhou Qing Bai smirked and covered her lips.After a while, Lin Qing He became disoriented. He was more and more like an experienced driver. She was not his opponent at all.Lin Qing He could only gasp out 'be gentler'. Afterward, she had no time to speak.As expected, that evening Zhou Qing Bai was sated once again.The next day Lin Qing He got up long after eight o'clock. Lin Qing He was very emotional about her present days.This was simply too extravagant.After a simple breakfast, Lin Qing He rode over to Mei Jie.Now the collection location was switched to Mei Jie's house. She didn't need to go to the slaughterhouse anymore, because she disdained the freezing weather and thought of not doing it.Mei Jie was unwilling to cut off this source of income. Now that she had become unemployed, she was relying on this method. She said she'll go get the goods, and then she(LQH) can go over to her home to collect it.Needless to say, Lin Qing He agreed.The truth was there wasn't much meat coming in. At most, it was five or six jins and when it was less, it was only two or three jins. It can\u2019t earn much.But even if it was only seven or eight yuan a month, it was still very important to Mei Jie.\"Still haven't received notification about your return to work?\" Lin Qing He asked Mei Jie.\"Not yet. Need to wait until there's a vacancy.\" Mei Jie confirmed.After giving the meat to Lin Qing He, Lin Qing He settled the transaction with her.Mei Jie got the money and mentioned with a smile: \"Do you want honey? My eldest brother foraged it in the mountain before the snow fell. He gave me two jars. I didn't eat it. Seeing how you like it, take it back.\"Lin Qing He's eyes brightened and said, \"Then I'll take both jars of honey. However, I need to give money. If Mei Jie doesn't take the money, then I won't accept it and go directly to the supply and demand cooperative.\"Mei Jie went inside and brought out the two jars of honey, said, \"You don't have to be courteous with me. Just take it.\"\"I have to pay. Mei Jie, don't fight with me.\" Lin Qing He pushed out the bike, hopped on the bike with the two jars of honey, and stuffed the money to Mei Jie.It was according to the supply and demand cooperatives' price.It was not cheap, but in Lin Qing He's opinion, it was great value to buy these two jars of wild honey with this amount of money.Earlier she bought a can, but that one only had half left.Every night, after finishing things with Zhou Qing Bai, they have to drink a cup. Cough, it was still necessary even without doing it. So it was consumed quickly.She brought the two jars of honey and pork home.It was now mid-December. The last meat distribution for this year was on the 25th of December.For the whole year of this year, her family had no shortage of meat. For example, after the winter wheat was planted last time, her family was allocated a lot and they ate it for several days before they used it up. They had it in a variety of ways.Two pots of honey were put inside the top of the cupboard. The adults can grab it as soon as they reached out, while the children could not see anything on it.\"I'm going out tomorrow to see if there is any lamb.\" Zhou Qing Bai watched her come back and stated.\"Alright. If there is any, get more lamb chops/ I like to eat that.\" Lin Qing He hurriedly interjected when she heard him.Zhou Qing Bai nodded.Toward his wife's meat business, he didn't intervene much. It was a bit questionable. But as soon as he heard that his wife said she had a client and the meat she got was immediately changed hand, he didn't stick into her business.So Zhou Qing Bai understood why she came back so quickly.In fact, it was all down to his trust in his wife.The next day Zhou Qing Bai went out to bring mutton back to eat.Lin Qing He brewed a mutton soup. Only goji berry and red dates were inside. The mutton soup was very flavorful.Of course, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou weren't omitted from such a good thing. Approximately a bowl for each person was delivered, accompanied by some small chunks of lamb. Which was also very delicious.Mutton initially had a unique odor, but Lin Qing He knew how to handle it. Since the mutton soup had no stale taste, the two of them liked itOld Zhou family had separated now.After Zhou Xiao Mei's bridal return, Father Zhou and Mother Zhou presided over the family division. Each family was allocated a hundred yuans. The other furniture and the food were all divided too. Whoever owned whatever in the house was clearly stated.However, cooking was still done in the kitchen. When one family finished, the other cooks.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou handle their own cooking.As for the matter of old-age care, a certain amount of food supplies were given each season, so which family's turn it was, they give. It must be clearly stated on the first day.This was discussed between Zhou Qing Bai and his brothers.Father Zhou and Mother Zhou drinking lamb soup and eating mutton, had Second Sister-in-law's son Zhou Xia craving. When he returned, he asked his mother: \"Mother, when will our family eat meat?\"\"The meat will be divided in ten days. What you anxious for? I will make dumplings for you.\" Second Sister-in-law replied.Second brother was feeling greedy and suggested, \"Should we go buy the meat first?\"\"You have a meat coupon?\" Disgruntled, Second Sister-in-law uttered.Rural people do not get meat coupons and food coupons. Only those in the city did.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98. Why is she still not pregnant?\"You shouldn't have.\" Hearing Lin Qing He said this, Second Brother was tempted.At this time, there was indeed no meat. If he wanted it, he'll have check early in the morning.\"It's nothing.\" Lin Qing He can see his desire to get meat, so she got up and entered the kitchen. The meat that Zhou Qing Bai brought back was good-quality, the traditional pork belly.There were approximately two-three jins. Lin Qing He cut a jin out. She had been to the black market in the city long enough to tell the approximate portion.After sharing a jin of pork belly Second Brother, the money was naturally collected according to the price on the black market. Still, Second Brother returned in a merry mood.If he had exchange money for a meat coupon and then go over to buy meat, the price can be a little more expensive than buying meat on the black market, so it was better price-wise to directly exchange meat at the black market price.And not just anyone dared to go to the black market.Seeing that he brought the meat back, Second Sister-in-law was stunned.\"Da Wa's Mother cut it out.\" Second Brother gave her the remaining money.\"Why did it cost so much?\" Second Sister-in-law saw how little money was and gritted out.Baffled, Second Brother uttered: \"What so much? From the beginning, that money was enough for a jin of meat. We still have change left.\"\"She went according to the black market's price?\" Second Sister-in-law persisted in discontent.\"It was bought by Qing Bai with much trouble. It's because Da Wa's Mother heard that Xia Xia was craving for meat, she divided some for me. If our family went to buy it instead, not only do I have to travel so far, I might even be able to buy it. What's more, old Fourth bought the meat at the black market price, it goes without saying we have to follow that price. What, you want to get old Fourth to give it to you cheaper?\" Second Brother threw a glance at her as he spoke.His wife gave him a daggered gaze.\"Fine. Let's not argue on this anymore. Hurry, make dumplings. This is a quality pork belly. If we weren't brothers, old Fourth wouldn't have given this to me.\" Second Brother did not want to quarrel with her, said.The money was already spent, Second Sister-in-law can't really keep complaining, so she made dumplings and had it.The family of five had eaten to their hearts' content. Being able to have dumplings, even made Second Sister-in-law closed her mouth and refrained from commenting.They did get meat allocated to them last time, but the family had not split yet. How much could each person possibly eat?This time she put half a jin of meat into the dumplings and it was delicious. For the remaining half, they'll take their time consuming it.Second Branch got a taste of meat, which was exchanged with Fourth Branch by Old Second.Eldest Sister-in-law had a sarcastic expression, while Third Sister-in-law sneered coldly. She whispered to Third Brother in private: \"She just had a fight last time and still embarrassed to exchange the meat. Her face is so big.\"\"How about our family go to exchange too?\" Third Brother's focus was on elsewhere. He wanted to eat meat too.Third Sister-in-law disapprovingly remarked: \"Eat What? In a while, the meat will be divided. What's wrong with eating it then?\"\"Well, you pregnant are now. You should eat some meat.\" Third Brother Wednesday grinned.That's right, it was almost a year after Zhou Dong Dong's birth and she became pregnant again.After giving birth to Wu Ni, it took a few years before she had Zhou Dong Dong. To her surprise, she was pregnant again and was a month along.Because her period hadn't come, she was sure of it. There was no need to go to the health center, she will know when she waits for the next month.But basically, it was certain.Lin Qing He didn't know yet. It was when she went over on the 25th for the meat distribution and bumped into Third Sister-in-law, she heard about it.Shock wasn't enough to describe Lin Qing He's expression: \"You are too fast. How long has it been?\"She felt Dong Dong had just been born and she was pregnant again.Third Sister-in-law laughed: \"It's nothing. You should be soon?\"Lin Qing He looked horrified and said, \"What soon? I have no plans to give birth again. I have three sons.\"For the rural people, three sons was enough to say birth no more and their confidence was absolutely sufficient.Third Sister-in-law said nothing then.This time, Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai got allocated a lot, but in the end it wasn't her family's pigs. The oil content was as thick as her family's pigs.Once they got their share distributed, Lin Qing He and Zhou Qing Bai returned home with their boys.\"Third Sister-in-law is pregnant again?\" Zhou Qing Bai asked when he came home. He had just heard this. Because it was a conversation between women, he didn't hear the later part and walked away a bit. So he didn't hear Lin Qing He say not giving birth anymore.Lin Qing He nodded and said: \"I was also taken by surprise. She just gave birth to Dong Dong last year and was pregnant again this year.\"But this wasn't the only case. In Zhoujia Village, there seems to be the same for many people and were pregnant.Especially since the beginning of winter isolation, there seems to be good news from many people one after another. For example, the next-door Huang Daniang\u2019s daughter-in-law had a newborn last year and bought two jins of brown sugar last year. She was pregnant again......\"Such a good thing, what is there to be surprised about.\" Zhou Qing Bai glanced at her.Lin Qing He meet his eyes and understood what he meant. She coughed and changed the subject: \"How do you want to eat these pork?\"\"You decide.\" Zhou Qing Bai replied.However, having a child matter was obviously not something Lin Qing He can avoid. Once the children went to bed at night, Zhou Qing Bai had an in-depth discussion with her before saying: \"Give birth more, our family can afford it.\"Lin Qing He expressed in her mind that she wouldn't give birth, but she was also a little puzzled. She and Zhou Qing Bai had never used protection. Why hadn't she been pregnant after so long?She had experienced his capability, so this brave and powerful man can easily make a woman pregnant.Why wasn't she pregnant yet?If she did get pregnant, should she have the baby?This thought was terrifying. She won't ever give birth.She planned to go to the hospital in the city next time to get him protection, otherwise, if she was pregnant, what should she do?However, did she forget anything? Why hadn't she got pregnant after so long?\"Huh?\" Zhou Qing Bai moved after waiting a long time for his wife to respond.Lin Qing He blushed and said, \"The fate hasn't arrived yet?\"Zhou Qing Bai accepted this explanation and pulled his wife for another round. It until Lin Qing He was exhausted, did he let her go.Lin Qinghe thought before going to sleep that she would go to the city to buy condoms tomorrow and absolutely won't get pregnant!It was a pity it snowed heavily after she planned this and couldn't go.Because the weather was too cold, Lin Qing He stayed huddled on the Kang. She simply recited and studied the books on Kang. Like this, time passed.There was nothing to do on days like this. They didn't go out. With such heavy snow, why go out?However, on the evening of 29th December, Third Brother Lin came with a hare. His face was severely frozen when he arrived, which indicated he caught it much trouble and sent it here.\"Such large snowfall, you still go out to catch rabbits?\" Lin Qing He glared at him.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99. Giving New Year's greeting to Aunt\"It's no problem.\" Third Brother Lin smiled and handed her the rabbit: \"Sister, for you. I'll go back now.\"\"What for me? Take it back for yourself to eat.\" Lin Qing He quickly took it to him and said.\"I got this for you, Sister. This year, it was thanks to the meat Sister gave me, my wife was able to have post-natal confinement.\" Third Brother Lin maintained.\"No need to thanks.\" Lin Qing He said, and then continued: \"Come in first.\"Zhou Qing Bai took his boys over to Father Zhou and Mother Zhou, so they weren't home. It was just her and Fei Ying.Fei Ying swept a glimpse at Third Brother Lin. Since he was brought in by Lin Qing He, he was not hostile.\"Down this now.\" Lin Qing He poured a large glass of ginger and red date tea and ordered.This was cooked and drunk at home routinely and the effect was quite good. Third Brother Lin drank it and his body warmed up.\"On this cold day, why aren't you wearing more?\" Lin Qing He dug through the room and pulled out Zhou Qing Bai's old sweater. This was bought by him. It was certainly old now. He didn't wear it much, since Lin Qing He knitted him a brand new one last year and he was wearing that vest now.\"This was is your brother-in-law's leftover. He didn't wear it anymore. It should be a little big for you, but it's still wearable. Hurry up, put it on.\" Lin Qing He passed this sweater to Third Brother Lin and ushered.\"Sister, no need. This is my brother-in-law's clothes.\" Third Brother Lin hastily refused.He came here to send the rabbit, not to get something.\"I'm giving it to you, so wear it. With our current family condition, if we honestly could wear it, I won't have offered it to you.\" Lin Qing He maintained.Third Brother Lin still shook his head: \"Don't want, don't want. Sister, don't give me brother-in-law's clothes, brother-in-law would probably quarrel with you when he comes back.\"\"Your sister makes all the decisions in this house. I listen to your sister too.\" At this time, Zhou Qing Bai brought the boys back and interjected.\"Brother-in-law.\" Seeing him, Third Brother Lin greeted at once.Zhou Qing Bai nodded. Da Wa, Er Wa, and San Wa all called out 'uncle'. Third Brother Lin smiled and acknowledged.\"I haven't seen you in this sweater since last year. It made no difference if we keep it or not. Give it to my brother?\" Lin Qing He asked him.Zhou Qing Bai remarked: \"Would it be a bit too old?\"\"It depends on whether my brother disdains that or not.\" Lin Qing He turned to Third Brother Lin.Third Brother Lin shook his head: \"How can I disdain such a good sweater for being old.\"\"If you don't, then quickly change into it.\" Lin Qing He instructed Da Wa: \"Da Wa, take your Third Uncle to your room to put it on.\"\"Uncle, come with me.\" Da Wa said.\"Listen to your sister.\" Zhou Qing Bai also observed how really thin Third Brother Lin's clothes were, and urged.Only then, did Third Brother Lin went in with Da Wa to put on this sweater. He felt a whole lot warmer.\"Eating here tonight?\" Lin Qing He asked Third Brother Lin.Third Brother Lin rapidly shook his head: \"No, no. I'll eat at home.\"\"If you want to go home and eat, then go home and eat. You take these buns. Heat it when you return and it'll be ready to eat.\" Lin Qing He gave Third Brother Lin three big buns.She made this the day before yesterday with Zhou Qing Bai and the boys.Whenever they were hungry, just steam it up, and then just add an additional soup. There was also a lot of mantou, all of which were ready-to-cook. No need to worry with this weather.\"No need.\" Third Brother Lin shook his head.\"I'm telling you to take it, so take it.\" Lin Qing He wrapped it in oil paper and stuffed it to him.\"Sister, will you go back this New Year?\" Third Brother asked her.\"Not going. I said it already, I'm cleanly breaking it off with those white-eyed wolves.\" Lin Qing He waved her hand.Third Brother San felt helpless, but he said nothing. Instead, he uttered, \"Then I will come over with my wife this year?\"\"The first day or the second day is free.\" Lin Qing He suggested.\"Then we will come here on the first,\" replied Third Brother Lin.\"OK.\" Lin Qing He gave him the answer.Third Brother Lin came back with three buns.Third Sister-in-law Lin asked him, \"What were you doing today? It's freezing.\"\"I was out catching a rabbit.\" Third Brother Lin laughed.\"Did you catch it?\" Third Sister-in-law Lin responded.\"I did and sent it to my sister.\" Third Brother Lin said.Third Sister-in-law Lin froze for a moment and said nothing once she recovered.This year's post-natal confinement, she felt that she'll remember it for the rest of this life.If it weren\u2019t for this sister who secluded herself from her maternal family, her second daughter wouldn't have a bite of an egg to eat!So this year her family separated off.First Branch and Second Branch didn't split, just her Third Branch. Naturally, life was hard because there wasn't much to items allocated to them. But even if there wasn't much, Third Sister-in-law Lin insisted on separating!She was fed up. She'll take control of her family. She'll eat what she wants and handle things how she wants, who dares to talk nonsense?\"Look what this is.\" Third Brother Lin took out three large buns from his arms and grinned.\"Where did you get that?\" Third Sister-in-law Lin's eyes lit up and asked.\"Third Sister gave it.\" Third Brother Lin laughed.This answer was not unexpected. Third Sister-in-law Lin sighed: \"I didn't expect that the Third Sister, who wouldn't even want to acknowledge her maternal family, would recognize you as her younger brother.\"In her last post-natal confinement, this Third Sister only gave eggs and pork ribs on the basis that he was her brother.This was something she kept in mind. If it was just her, there was no need to think about, Third Sister won't give any consideration because she didn't speak for Third Sister before.\"Third Sister has always been kind to me.\" Third Brother Lin gave the truth, and then lifted up his clothes, said: \"Look, this sweater was given by Brother-in-law.\"\"Third Brother-in-law gave it?\" Brother Lin's wife couldn't help but touched it. The sweater was very warm.Although this sweater was Zhou Qing Bai's unwanted, there was nothing bad with it. It was because Lin Qing He made a new one for him, he didn't wear it anymore.\"When Third Sister gave it to me, Brother-in-law also saw it. Brother-in-law let me wear it.\" Third Brother Lin said, and then talked about visiting on New Year's Day.\"She doesn't plan to come back this year?\" Third Sister-in-law was taken aback.\"Third Sister still holding the grudge,\" answered Third Brother Lin.Third Sister-in-law Lin thought how she was still mad even after a year, then she really intends to not interact with her maternal family. However, Third Sister-in-law Lin didn't mind and said, \"\"This year we will bring Yu'er and Xiang'er over to give their aunt a new year greeting!\"She can tell that out of old Lin family, only Third Sister cared about her little family, even if it was due to her husband. But still, this relationship should not be broken.Third Brother Lin nodded in acknowledgment.In the evening, the couple divided the three big buns with their two girls. It was eaten after heating it up a bit.The youngest daughter was still a baby, so it was soaked in the soup for her to eat. After a half, she was full.The eldest daughter devoured one by on her own.The remaining was for Third Brother Lin and Third Sister-in-law Lin. Naturally, it wasn't enough to eat. Somewhat full was enough, as they didn't need to work in winter isolation. They all had to tighten their belts during these days.Especially since his family had just separated off. It was impossible to get many shares of food.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100. Last day of '70At home, Lin Qing He was making braised rabbit meat and brought up Third Brother Lin to Zhou Qing Bai: \"Say, what is up with my third brother? He's thinner than before?\"Naturally, Zhou Qing Bai didn't know, suggested: \"Would you like to go back and see?\"\"Not going back.\" Lin Qing He had no good impression from old Lin Family. Last year, they gave her such a good excuse and broke it off outright without any hesitation.Zhou Qing Bai was helpless.Lin Qing He didn't care about old Lin's family anymore. The braised rabbit meat is very aromatic to smell. Lin Qing He was willing to add seasonings, so the rabbit meat was particularly pleasing to smell.Of course, Father Zhou and Mother won't miss out on such delicious food.\"Carry this dish to your father and mother. Remember to say that this is the rabbit meat sent by my third brother. He stayed outside for a day to catch it.\" Lin Qing He handed a small dish to Zhou Qing Bai and instructed.This was to prevent them from assuming that she was supplementing her maternal family. She was not the original owner, so old Lin family better not think about benefiting from her at all. She only recognized her third brother.Even if her third brother sent such a rabbit today, she only gave three buns.It wasn't that she didn't want to give, it was due to the fact her third brother was now married.Beside being her brother, he too was a husband and father to others.So she didn't give too much, just three buns, to avoid nurturing his wife's appetite too much.Because when including the favor she did for the post-natal confinement last time, Third Sister-in-law should know to be content with even just three buns.This was how human relationships should be, with output, there was input. Don't take it for granted as nothing in the world is rightly yours.However, she didn't know that the value of these three buns wasn't inferior to a rabbit.A bun of this large size would cost a few dimes. If one went to the city to buy it, they will need food coupons, otherwise, don\u2019t think about buying it.How many food coupons did one need for three?And there was really a lot of filling inside. Pork belly, eggs, and flour, these cost a lot of money. Don't forget the rest (of the ingredients).Three delicious buns in one go, it wasn't stingy at all.Hearing his wife's words, Zhou Qing Bai had a cold sweat . Still, when he sent it over, he mentioned that the rabbit was sent by his wife's third brother.Mother Zhou understood.Once her youngest son went back, Mother Zhou said: \"Last time I didn't say anything about Da Wa's Mother.\"Father Zhou expressed: \"Don't worry about that too much.\"Mother Zhou gave no response and quickly went to warm the pancakes. Then they ate the braised rabbit meat with the pancakes. The two of them couldn't have enough, because the taste was so scrumptious.\"From what I see, old Fourth's side is doing pretty well. After such a busy year, I didn't see old Fourth become sapped. He was well-nourished by his wife.\" Father Zhou commented.He really felt that Fourth's wife's culinary skills were top-notch, with no complaints at all.From time to time, the meat dishes brought to them were all delectable. His son and grandsons were taken care of by her culinary, so how worst can they get?\"I didn't say she couldn't take care of old Fourth and his boys. It just too money consuming.\" Mother Zhou sighed.In terms of the ability to take care of their men and children, no one in Zhoujia Village can compare with Fourth's wife. What's more, her old husband was right.It seems that since old Fourth had retired until now, he apparently became healthier. Not a hint of weakness could be seen.Same for Da Wa and his brothers. Which one of them wasn't energetic?\"While we can still work, let them gather some savings.\" Zhou Father stated.Mother Zhou nodded and didn't say anything. Apparently satisfied, she decided to drop it and let Fourth's wife do as she likes. The future marriage money for Da Wa and his brothers, they'll secretly give it to them.They can't possibly let three grandsons become a bachelor, right?Unknown to Mother Zhou\u2019s thoughts, Lin Qing He had a fulfilling dinner with Zhou Qing Bai and the boys.A shrimp skin soup and cornmeal mantou. With this delicious rabbit meat, the family ate until their heart's content.\"Father, when are we going to catch the rabbit?\" At the dinner table, Da Wa munched on the rabbit's head as he asked\"Where are you going on such a cold day?\" Lin Qing He glared at him.\"There were chubby rabbits in the field during autumn harvest this year, but it ran too fast and Father didn't catch them,\" Er Wa mentioned.There were rabbits popping up during the autumn harvest and these rabbits bounced around and got away really fast. Even Zhou Qing Bai hadn't caught one.\"Your father is exhausted to the bone during the harvest and you still want him to catch you a rabbit? Why don't you hunt one for your father to eat?\" Lin Qing He directed to Er Wa.\"Aren't I still small? Once I grow up, I will definitely be able to catch it.\" Er Wa waffled.\"Then eat more and grow up quickly.\" Lin Qing He brushed off.The wild rabbits were very agile. What's more, a wily rabbit had three burrows, so how can it be so easy to hunt? Each and every one of them were drained from the busy summer and autumn harvests.Chances of catching one was low. And one needs to be extremely lucky to catch one.Zhou Qing Bai calmly ate meat as he enjoyed the favoritism from his wife.He went out the next day, but when he came back, his hands were empty. Rabbits were difficult to hunt.Luck and strength can't be lacking.With strength and no luck, it still won't do.\"Are you that bored on New Year's Eve? Does it feel great going up to the mountain and freeze yourself? Do we lack that bite of meat at home?\" Lin Qing He nagged once he came back.Despite what she said, she didn't omit a single drop of ginger soup for him to drink.Today was the 30th of the twelfth lunar month. Everyone was separated this year, but they still adhered to tradition, have New Year's Eve dinner together.This was the last day of '70.As usual Lin Qing He brought two solid dishes, a stewed meat and starch noodles, and meatballs.Two meat dishes were definitely passable.Especially meatballs, it was very tasty. The children like Zhou Yang loved to eat it. They stabbed it with their chopstick and bite into it. Each of them munched away happily.After the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner, the women started chatting, while the things were handed over to Da Ni and Er Ni to clean up.Second Sister-in-law didn't stay. She headed out at once.Lin Qing He didn't fancy having her here After the last fight, she and Second Sister-in-law had bad blood. Second Sister-in-law didn't dare to speak crap but also no longer spoke to Lin Qing He.Lin Qing He simply ignored it.\"Just now, I noticed you have a bad appetite at dinner, what's wrong?\" Lin Qing He asked Third Sister-in-law.\"This baby is a naughty one, so my reaction is a bit big.\" Third Sister-in-law felt helpless.\"Morning sickness?\" Lin Qing He wondered.\"That's right. I heard it early in the morning.\" Eldest Sister-in-law nodded.Lin Qing He thought that it must be difficult!Even like this, Zhou Qing Bais still wanted her to give him another daughter. This unfeeling man.Lin Qing He decided to not let Zhou Qing Bai get close to her body. He must wait until she buys condoms first, otherwise, she couldn't imagine what she'll be like when she's pregnant!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
