Cough! Cough!On top of a sandalwood bed with an antique style, laid a sickly youth who abruptly started coughing violently.It looked as if he would not stop unless he coughs up his lungs out.The youth's lips were purplish, and his face was pale. It was a clear sign that he was not long for this world. However, his violent cough made the young madam beside him frantic.The young madam looked around 30 years old, and even though she was not in her prime, she still retained her graceful charm. At this moment, her tightly locked brows finally eased up slowly, and she quickly grabbed hold of that sickly youth's hand.\"Yuan-er! You finally woke up! You scared Mother to death! Ah ! Quickly call the family head back. Yuan-er already woke up, so the matter at hand is to treat Yuan-er first. We will settle this debt with the Wan Family in the future!\"The servant quickly left upon hearing the young madam's orders.Yet at this moment, the youth paid no heed to all these and only focused on coughing.Suddenly, puhwark! A mouthful of black blood was spat out! The black blood quickly corroded a large hole in the bedding. Clearly, it was highly toxic.After spitting out that mouthful of blood, the youth seemed to completely relax.He looked at the anxious young madam, and a strange yet familiar feeling welled up inside his heart.He attempted to recall who this woman was, only to feel a splitting headache.\"Yuan-er, what's wrong? Is the Intestine Rupturing Gra.s.s Poison triggering again? Quick! Bring a high-grade Detoxification Pill for Young Master to eat!\" the young madam said with a face full of concern.Another servant left to follow the order.The youth used this chance to rearrange the mult.i.tude of memories in his brain, and then he finally remembered who the woman in front of his eyes was.This woman was none other than his biological mother, Ren Hongling. And he himself or more accurately the original owner of this body was called Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan was born in one of the top Alchemy families within the State of Qin. The family head was Ye Hang, who was also Ye Yuan's father, a low-grade Alchemy Grandmaster; an existence who held a prominent position within the State of Qin.But sadly, Ye Hang was a tiger father who begot a dog for a son, having a useless silkpants, Ye Yuan, for a son. He only knew how to cause trouble every day and harmed good women. He did not even manage to become an Alchemy Apprentice after so long. It was such a disgrace that his face was thrown all the way back to his grandma's place.However, Ye Hang did not mind all these. He never had any expectations for his son and had let Ye Yuan do whatever he wanted. He was even overprotective of him to the extreme. Every time Ye Yuan caused trouble outside, Ye Hang would end up wiping his *ss.But as a father, he always hoped for his son to be promising. In the end, Ye Hang paid a huge price to admit Ye Yuan into the Dan Wu Academy, all just for the off chance that he would learn something. Who would have thought that this punk Ye Yuan, would get jealous over a woman and confidently challenged someone to a detoxification compet.i.tion? The end result was that he poisoned himself to death!After recalling his predecessor's memory, Ye Yuan sighed lightly. The original owner of this body could be considered one of a kind. To have actually killed himself in such manner, what sort of great courage and intellect were needed to do this!Forget it. To think that I, Qingyun Zi, a dignified Alchemy Emperor successor, would one day end up transmigrated into the body of a silkpants. But since the Heavens blessed me, Qingyun Zi, to rebirth once more, I will take revenge for Father, for myself, and kill that wildly ambitious traitor with my own hands!Thinking up to this point, Ye Yuan's expression became fierce, and his eyes filled with killing intent.Ren Hongling obviously noticed Ye Yuan's expression, and he thought that Ye Yuan bored a grudge towards that punk from the Wan Family for harming him. She quickly tried to console him and said, \"Son, one should abide one's time and wait for the right opportunity to seek vengeance. Our Ye Family will definitely settle this debt, but right now, the most important thing for you is to recuperate. We can discuss other matters in the future.\"Feeling Ren Hongling's motherly love, Ye Yuan felt touched in his heart.He inherited this body, so he naturally also inherited this body's feelings. No matter how much of a b*stard Ye Yuan was outside, he cared deeply for his parents who loved him very much.\"Mother, I'm sorry to have worried you.\"Ren Hongling was stunned by her son's words. This punk caused trouble all the time outside that her heart was almost crushed, and yet she had never heard this punk say any heartfelt words. What's wrong with him today?Could it be that after this incident, he suddenly woke up to reality?After being stunned for a while, Ren Hongling immediately became overjoyed. With tears in her eyes, she said, \"As long as you are alright.\"At this moment, bam! The door to the room was kicked open.\"You aren't dead yet, you punk? You really scared your father!\"A thunderous voice shouted, making Ye Yuan's eardrums hurt. Even though the words were not very pleasant, anyone could hear the joy and concern within those words. Needless to say, the family head, Ye Hang, has arrived.Ye Hang was born a little boorish. n.o.body would connect him with his n.o.ble status as an Alchemy Grandmaster. In fact, he looked more like a rugged man from the mountains.Hearing her husband's words, Ren Hongling turned over and glared at him. \"Yuan-er just escaped death. Can't you say something nicer?\"Ye Hang did not mind her words and took a glance at the black blood before calming down. He laughed and said, \"Looks like my, Ye Hang's son, has a blessed life. To even survived this, hahaha! Come, quickly swallow this Detoxification Pill, and purge the residual toxins from your body. You should be fine afterward.\"Ye Hang casually took out a medicinal pill and was just about to stuff it into Ye Yuan's mouth.Seeing this, Ye Yuan immediately jumped in fright and quickly shrunk back into his bed.\"Can this thing even be eaten?!\" Ye Yuan cried out in shock.Glaring with anger in his eyes, Ye Hang snarled, \"You little punk, did the poison screw your brain up? Did you forget what status your father has?\"Ren Hongling also thought that Ye Yuan had some misgiving about the pill and quickly said, \"Yuan-er, your father is an Alchemy Grandmaster. Even if His Majesty meets him, he will show some respect. Furthermore, this is your father. Would he possibly harm you?\"Ye Yuan's mouth twitched, and he declined to comment.He obviously knew that this medicinal pill was a Detoxification Pill. Only that its quality was a little too weak. In his past life, Qingyun Zi's father was an Alchemy Emperor. He grew up eating medicinal pills as if he was eating jelly beans. How could he not even recognize something ordinary like the Detoxification Pill?Although eating this pill would help to restrain the toxins in his body, its effects were too weak and would not be able to thoroughly eliminate all the residual toxins within his body.The average alchemists were unable to detect these toxins, and it would not have too great of an effect on Ye Yuan's health in the future. But these toxins would lay hidden inside his body and would continuously become the body's burden. It would even affect his future advancements in the Martial Path.The Intestine Rupturing Gra.s.s naturally was not worth mentioning in Ye Yuan's eyes. It was not even worth much in Ye Hang's eyes. It was just that when Ye Yuan was sent back home, the poison already spread thoroughly. He was only breathing in and not out, unable to even eat the Detoxification Pill. That's why Ye Hang was utterly helpless and was preparing to bring people to go fight it out with the Wan Family.Before dying, Qingyun Zi was already at the Alchemy Emperor standard, so he could not be any more clear about these medicinal theories. His worldview and horizon obviously could not be compared with an Alchemy Grandmaster like Ye Hang.Looking at his son's expression, Ye Hang felt severely provoked.\"You little punk! To actually dare questioned your father's pill refinement standards!\"Ye Yuan stared helplessly at the dull-looking black pill in his father's hand. Looking once again at the rage in his father's eyes, he opened his mouth and said, \"Red Abalone Gra.s.s was more by two parts, and Green Snake Gall lacked by one part. It should have been a result of inadequate control when refining the pill. The biggest mistake was adding iron sulfate into the Detoxification Pill. Not only did it not improve the medicinal effects, it even messed up the composition of this Detoxification Pill. Father, since you have difficulty refining Tier 3 medicinal pill, you should just lower your standards.\"Ye Hang's facial expression was fascinating right now. He was at first angry, followed by astonishment, and finally, he was left dumbfounded.He was the one who refined this pill, so he was naturally aware of its properties. Ye Yuan's a.n.a.lysis was as if he saw it with his own eyes, and even if he saw it personally, he should not be able to a.n.a.lyze it this accurately.Is this punk really his son?Ye Hang could not help but become suspicious. Only after sizing him up did he confirm that this was indeed his son.\"Stop staring. I'm your son, really.\" Seeing Ye Hang's expression, Ye Yuan could not help but feel a little guilty, so he quickly defended himself.\"Hey brat, you couldn't possibly have pretended to be a pig in order to eat a tiger in the past, right? That's not right, because if you were really playing a sucker to catch a sucker, then why is it that you can't even resolve the poison from the Intestine Rupturing Gra.s.s?\" Ye Hang felt that things did not quite add up.Rolling his eyes, Ye Yuan quickly s.n.a.t.c.hed the Detoxification Pill in Ye Hang's hands and swallowed it.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the moment, it was more important to alleviate the symptoms on this wretched body.As for the hidden dangers left behind by this Detoxification Pill, Ye Yuan naturally has means to eliminate it.Ever since obtaining this body, the great Alchemy Emperor Qingyun Zi could not bear to look at his own physique. He seriously did not understand how his predecessor survived for the past ten years or so.Born in a prestigious Alchemy family, yet this punk did not even manage to reach the Second Level Essence Qi Realm.Even if it was in a mortal country, being born in such a family and eating the most ordinary Essence Qi Pills like sweets, one should be at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm and above, right?Wanting to cry but no tears flowed . . . This Alchemy Emperor could only use such phrase to describe his current emotion.Using this dreadful body to withstand such a violent poison, no wonder Ye Yuan died. Although Qingyun Zi was now in possession of this body, there really was not much he could do with it at the moment. He could only do things one step at a time.In the eyes of others, Ye Yuan's act of s.n.a.t.c.hing the pill was revealing his true colors.However, Ye Hang smirked. \"Ha! I knew you were bluffing. You actually scared me for a moment.\"Just now, Ye Hang realized something was amiss. This punk definitely snuck a look at the pill formula or overheard the family's retainers talked about him refining this Detoxification Pill. That was how he managed to know all the details about the pill. Since this punk was already cracking jokes, there should not be any major issues with his condition.Regarding this, Ye Yuan definitely would not explain anything. Being ignorant and faking incompetence suited this body more. It would be better if he maintained a low profile.\"Father, Mother, I'm a little tired and want to rest for now.\" Ye Yuan wanting to recuperate requested them to leave.\"Yuan-er, you just recovered from a major illness. You should indeed rest more. If there is anything, let Lu-er inform us.\" His parents then brought everyone out of the room.. . . . . .Ye Yuan started to meditate. He circulated essence energy within his body to absorb the medicinal effect of the Detoxification Pill and purge the poison in his body.However, the essence energy in his body was pitifully little, that he could only imagine its weak efficacy. An Alchemy Emperor of his generation just got another chance in life and then survived after being poisoned, but now nearly died from exasperation.By the time all the medicinal effects from the pill in Ye Yuan's body were fully absorbed, it was almost dawn. This round of meditation actually took 12 hours. What a piece of work.But this bout of hard work finally showed some results. Ye Yuan's current complexion was apparently much more radiant and rosier in color. The toxins in his body were already pretty much neutralized.This naturally was not anything remarkable to the current Ye Yuan. With Qingyun Zi's attainments in the Dao of Alchemy, to thoroughly dig out all the efficacy of this tiny Detoxification Pill naturally was not difficult at all.Thinking about it now, even though his predecessor was not serious about training, it was actually a blessing.Currently, this body was akin to a blank piece of paper. Qingyun Zi could fiddle with it freely and not worry about wrecking this body. If his predecessor practiced martial arts haphazardly, Qingyun Zi would instead need to pay a hefty price to rebuild his foundation. This actually saved him some trouble.It was just that although Intestine Rupturing Gra.s.s Poison was nothing serious, the efficacy of Ye Hang's Detoxification Pill was severely limited. Tiny amounts of residual toxins were still present in the body. Moreover, this Detoxification Pill had its own flaws, which also further left some medicinal toxins within Ye Yuan's body. After dawn breaks, he would need to find some medicinal herbs to completely eradicate the hidden dangers which could manifest in the future.Luckily, the Ye Family is one of the prestigious Alchemy families in the State of Qin. Getting some medicinal herbs would not be an issue.There was still some time left before dawn. Ye Yuan decided to properly strategize the path to take after his rebirth.In the previous life, Qingyun Zi was obsessed with the Dao of Alchemy and somewhat neglected the Martial Dao. Otherwise, he would not be completely helpless in front of that traitor.Qingyun Zi cultivated martial arts in order to refine better pills; as long as it was enough to use, it was all good. Because of this, he became the youngest Alchemy Emperor in the Divine Realm.That year when he became an Alchemy Emperor, he was hailed by all major Holy Lands as the genius who was most likely to become an Alchemy G.o.d in these tens of thousands of years. One had to know, no one had managed to reach the level of an Alchemy G.o.d for several millennia.However, all that glory had become history. Today, there was no longer the Divine Realm's genius Qingyun Zi, but only the Lower Realm's youth Ye Yuan who now stepped onto the path of revenge.Since he had to take revenge against that traitor, Qingyun Zi would have to be diligent in the martial path in this life. Although that traitor's talent in the Dao of Alchemy was only slightly worse than Qingyun Zi, he was nonetheless undoubtedly a genius of the Martial Dao. To surpa.s.s him, the current Ye Yuan would have to put a lot of effort.Initially, for a Lower Realm's youth in a mortal country, the most lacking aspect was definitely resources and techniques. Resources to the current Ye Yuan were indeed a luxury, but what he lacked the least was techniques.Regardless whether in the Lower Realm or in the Divine realm, an alchemist was always treated with exceptional respect. Furthermore, Qingyun Zi's father, Zhengyang Zi was the number one Alchemy Emperor in the Divine Realm. The numbers of techniques acc.u.mulated over the years were countless.Even though Qingyun Zi was not very receptive to the Martial Dao, but in order to a.s.sist in Alchemic procedures, he extensively studied many martial art manuals to improve his cultivation. To find a few techniques suitable for him was naturally nothing difficult.Sorting out the memories of his previous life, Ye Yuan finally decided on a martial art called the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art as his core cultivation technique.This martial art was the core cultivation technique of the Divine Realm's renowned Spirit Bristle Divine King. That year, to refine a Ninth Rank Medicinal Pill, he came to beg Zhengyang Zi. However, failing to ama.s.s sufficient remuneration, instead, he left his primary cultivation technique behind.This technique was abnormally tyrannical. Spirit Bristle Divine King relied on this technique to become undefeated in the Divine Realm, becoming one of the top ten most mysterious existence.In the Divine Realm, anything with the word 'Divine' attached to it was incomparably precious. Such item would cause an absolute blood fest.That year when the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was revealed, the entire Divine Realm was shaken. In order to s.n.a.t.c.h this technique, it was said over 10 Divine Kings fell. In the end, it ended up in the hands of the then little-known figure, the Spirit Bristle Divine King.He laid low for over a decade before bursting forth, becoming the Divine Realm's top Divine King in a single stroke. Were it not for how extraordinarily precious and vital the Ninth Rank Medicinal Pill was to the Spirit Bristle Divine King, there was no way he would have used this technique to exchange for it.Of course, he was at ease with pa.s.sing this technique over to Zhengyang Zi because Zhengyang Zi and his son were obsessed with the Dao of Alchemy and had neither ulterior motive nor any intention to contend in this world.Ye Yuan studied the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art before cultivating according to the manual. Traces of essence energy seeped through the body and started giving off a faint yellow glow.At the Essence Qi Realm, a cultivator would direct essence energy from the heaven and earth into the body. This was the foundation realm in cultivation.Essence Qi Realm might appear seemingly unimportant. However, it was a vital realm when cultivating martial arts. A towering skysc.r.a.per built on flat ground would require a solid foundation. Without a proper foundation, it would be like a rootless plant which would one day fail to support its growth. It was common knowledge among cultivators. But when cultivating martial arts, only a few actually applied this. Many cultivators would blindly pursue cultivation speed and unknowingly cut-off their own future.\"Huuuu . . .\"Four hours later, Ye Yuan awakened from his meditation and exhaled a long breath.\"This Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art is indeed powerful. Although these four hours of cultivation didn't increase much essence in my body, the quality is extremely pure. If I carry on cultivating like this, wouldn't I be invincible within the same realm?\"Ye Yuan who used to be an Alchemy Emperor naturally had broad horizons. For him to give such an appraisal to this technique showed how extraordinary it was.During the past four hours, Ye Yuan had used the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art to temper what little essence energy his predecessor had. This process refined the essence energy in his dantian which led to it becoming much more pure in terms of quality.But by doing so, his realm did not advance. Instead, it deteriorated all the way down to the First Level Essence Qi Realm.Fortunately, his predecessor neglected his cultivation during the past years. Otherwise, Ye Yuan would have to expend much effort to refine his body's essence energy. This could be considered profiting from a disaster.Now that the sky was already bright, Ye Yuan got up and left the room to grab some medicines for his body from the Ye Family's medicine warehouse. Right after stepping out of the room, a green figure collided with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Coupled with a long green dress, she looked like a little green pixie.With regards to Lu-er, Ye Yuan obviously knew her well. She was his playmate since young and also the person closest to Ye Yuan apart from his parents.Within the household as well as outside of it, n.o.body thought highly of Ye Yuan, with Lu-er as the sole exception. No matter how much of a scoundrel Ye Yuan was outside, Lu-er took care of Ye Yuan with all her heart.Therefore, the current Ye Yuan instinctively felt close to Lu-er, as if she was his little sister; even though his predecessor also enjoyed teasing Lu-er.In reality, even though Ye Yuan was atrocious, he actually would not force himself onto women. He only enjoyed causing some mischief. It was just that sometimes, his pranks were a little over the top.Having inherited his predecessor's memories, Ye Yuan discovered that his predecessor's talent was not considered bad. It was just all these bad habits were the outcome of being spoiled. In this aspect, his father, Ye Hang, had to bear substantial responsibility for it.Except, a father's love was akin to a mountain. Ye Yuan obviously could not blame all these on Ye Hang. Instead, he felt very touched, as Ye Hang was just like his past life's father.\"Y-young Master . . . Yii? Y-you are alright?\"Lu-er b.u.mped into Ye Yuan and was initially perturbed by it. Raising her head, she saw that Ye Yuan was full of spirit and vigor, and she immediately became overjoyed.Sensing Lu-er's concern which came from her heart, Ye Yuan laughed and said, \"I'm fine, your young master is a lucky man! After not dying due to this crisis, my future fortunes will be limitless!\"\"Teehee. Young Master, you are so humorous. But Lu-er also feels that since you didn't die in this disaster, in the future, you might really be different!\"A casual remark sounded significant to an attentive listener.Unsure of where Lu-er's confidence came from, Ye Yuan's heart skipped a beat. Thinking to himself, this girl's thought process was really too keen.Ye Yuan instantly laughed and said, \"Alright, accompany Young Master to bring some medicinal herbs back from the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.\"Lu-er did not speak, and just lowered her head and followed Ye Yuan.. . . . . .The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was the medicinal shop which the Ye Family established. It was one of the great powers in the State of Qin. Naturally, it was thanks to Ye Hang's ident.i.ty as an Alchemy Grandmaster.In the tiny State of Qin, the status of an Alchemy Master was already incomparably honorable, let alone an Alchemy Grandmaster. Because of Ye Hang's status, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion possessed an extraordinary position.In the State of Qin, the ident.i.ty of an Alchemy Grandmaster itself was a golden signboard. Hence, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion had always been a household name. Ye Hang obviously would not personally be out there to diagnose people, but the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's power was not to be underestimated. The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's main branch which was situated at the capital had an Alchemy Master stationed to diagnose people daily. This was not something that a small power could accomplish.Ye Yuan brought Lu-er inside the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and immediately attracted a few side-glances.From the employees' eyes, Ye Yuan saw fear, scorn, as well as disdain. This made Ye Yuan shook his head silently, thinking to himself that his predecessor's reputation was really too terrible, even causing innocent bystanders to get into trouble!Ye Yuan naturally would not bother with these servants. He walked straight up to the counter and said to an Alchemy Apprentice, \"Paper and brush.\"This Alchemy Apprentice knew Ye Yuan's status and did not dare to delay. He pulled out a paper and a brush and placed it respectfully in front of Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan took them, and it did not take much time for him to write down a list of medicinal herbs before giving it back to the Alchemy Apprentice.Ye Yuan was not long-winded and directly ordered, \"Get these medicinal herbs for me. If there's any problem, look for my father.\"The Alchemy Apprentice swept a look through the list of herbs and only relaxed after not seeing anything overly precious. Turning around, he left to get the medicinal herbs.These herbs were very ordinary, but the prescription was not.In his past life, Ye Yuan was an Alchemy Emperor of his generation. Since young, he studied and memorized all sorts of pill formulas. His understanding of medicinal herbs and medicinal effects had already reached an unfathomable level. Were it not the case, he would not have been hailed as the genius most likely to reach the Alchemy G.o.d Realm.The Alchemy Apprentice clearly did not understand Ye Yuan's intention. He thought that this silkpants had a change of nature and started to play with medicinal herbs.While the Alchemy Apprentice was getting the medicinal herbs, Ye Yuan brought Lu-er to wait in the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's consultation room. The master on duty lightly glanced at Ye Yuan and continued treating patients after expressing his contempt.The masters stationed here were at the Alchemy Master level, all of whom were retainers invited by Ye Hang. Ignoring the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, even when placed in the entire State of Qin, they were people who had some status.Those who came to get treated were all inflicted with unusual illnesses; those that ordinary people could not address. After witnessing a master's diagnosis, Ye Yuan shook his head silently.If Ye Yuan were the one on duty, he would be able to provide several, even dozens, of more superior prescriptions. It was just that something like this would be far too astounding. Either way, that master's formula would work, so Ye Yuan obviously would not take any unnecessary actions.\"Next,\" the attendant beside the master called out lifelessly.A brawny-looking man came forward, except his condition did not look too good. His face was purple, and there was death qi around his forehead. Furthermore, he was coughing non-stop. Clearly, it was symptoms of poisoning.The master took his pulse and looked at his tongue. Frowning slightly, he said, \"You are just a tiny little Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm. To actually recklessly entered the Endless Forest. The deadly poison of the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python isn't pleasant, right?\"The brawny man did not become unhappy because of the master's ridicule. Instead, he revealed a face filled with admiration and gave a bitter smile. \"Great master is wise, but I don't have a choice. My entire family relies on me to survive, so I have no other alternative but to become a demonic beast hunter. In the past, my companions and I only moved around the borders of the Endless Forest. Who would have thought that this time, we would encounter a demonic beast like the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python? It's also because I was lucky, that I managed to make it back. Both of my companions died at its jaws.\"After explaining, the brawny-looking man became dejected. Clearly, it reminded him of the tragedy.The Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python was a Second Rank demonic beast, the equivalent of a human Spirit Condensation Realm. Furthermore, as a demonic beast, its combat power was even higher compared to a human. The brawny-looking man was only at the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm, and it was likely that his companions were not much different. So how could they be its match? It was already fortunate for him to escape with his life.The master nodded and said, \"You were indeed lucky. A Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python is extremely vicious and tough. Being able to escape with your life can already be considered lucky. This poison might pose some trouble at other places, but it isn't something difficult in my Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Except, you have to know that this is a high-grade poison, so the price isn't low.\"Hearing this, the brawny looking man was ecstatic. He had already been to many medicinal establishments, and all of them were helpless on this matter. Furthermore, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's remuneration tends to be very high. So unless he had no other alternatives, he would absolutely not come here. But he knew that the poison had already spread thoroughly. If he did not get it treated, he probably would not make it past these few days. Therefore, he could only brace himself and enter the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Who would have expected that the master here was indeed amazing and managed to identify the crux of the problem with a single glance?\"Don't worry, Master. I managed to save some money over these few years. Initially, I wasn't willing to take it out to treat the poison. However, my entire family is relying solely on me. If I die, their lives will become much harder. As long as Master can treat this Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison, the treatment fee will be paid in full,\" the brawny-looking man coughed as he said this.Wealth and opportunity came with danger. Demonic beast hunter was an occupation that lived on the edge of danger. This brawny-looking man naturally had some savings.As a matter of fact, the effects of the Detoxification Pill which Ye Hang refined were even better. Except, his status was too high, and it was difficult to request to him even for the refinement of one Detoxification Pill. Usually, he only interacted with the State of Qin's Imperial Family. Furthermore, the fees were atrocious. A medicinal pill of that level was obviously not something that this poor, brawny-looking man could afford.Having heard this, the master was not going to be long-winded either. Instructing an attendant, he said, \"Green Flow Gra.s.s six grams, Vermillion Soul Sand six grams, Ironwind Eagle's inner core nine grams, and throw in some Daystar to supplement it. After brewing it, let this warrior drink it, and that will do it. Additionally, prepare two more sets of medicine for him to bring back.The attendant acknowledged this, took the prescription, and sent it off. Upon returning, he was about to call out 'Next' when someone gestured for him to stop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: QuestioningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: QuestioningTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThe person signaling the attendant was Ye Yuan who was by the side all along.Noticing Ye Yuan had stopped him, the attendant hesitated because Ye Yuan was the young master of this Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Coupled with him having a terrible reputation, the attendant naturally did not dare to offend this person.\"Uncle Qian, that medicine isn't right. It would kill a person,\" Ye Yuan went there and whispered.Ye Yuan was no longer the useless moron his predecessor was. Seeing as they were in the same boat, Ye Yuan naturally had to maintain the latter's reputation. So he only whispered in a very low voice.This great master was named Qian Miao. Having spent many years in the Ye family as a retainer, he was well-qualified and had a much-respected status. Although his attainments in the Dao of Alchemy cannot be compared to Ye Hang, he was definitely no ordinary man. After listening to a junior's nonsense, his facial expression changed instantly.\"Little Yuan, what nonsense are you talking about? It's one thing to run amok every day, but another to wreck the business that your father took great pains to establish. This Old Qian will definitely be the first person to not spare you! You must know that for Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to have its status today was not only because of the family head. We old bones expended a great deal of effort too. Alright, go back. There are still many patients waiting for their treatments.\"Qian Miao clearly held Fragrant Medicine Pavilion dearly and did not have much patience to deal with Ye Yuan. A tiger did not father a dog, but this . . . this was clearly a pup. Many times before this did Qian Miao felt sorry for Ye Hang.Today, this punk actually crawled on top of his head to mess around and even warned him that he was harming someone. How could his expression not change? If he did not take into account this punk was Ye Hang's son, he would have long sent Ye Yuan flying with a slap.Ye Yuan already expected Qian Miao's reaction. After all, his predecessor was indeed a piece of work. Therefore, he did not mind the harsh words.Were it not for the fact Qian Miao's diagnosis would affect the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's reputation, Ye Yuan would not choose to stand out. He had instead continued to maintain his image as a wastrel.If Qian Miao continued with this prescription, the brawny man in front of them would not only fail to be saved, it would aggravate the poison even more. This man most likely would not survive the night.To the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, as a customer, a demonic beast hunter is a vital source of income. Demonic beast hunters spend each day in danger. There was no need to talk about the bruises and cuts which were daily occurrences. When they entered and exited the Boundless Forest, pills for detoxification and recovery were essential necessities. Therefore these demonic beast hunters were a critical source of revenue for the Ye Family.If this brawny man died at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, it would be a tremendous blow to the prestige of the Ye Family among the demonic beast hunters. Some compet.i.tors might even take the opportunity to bring down the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. The loss would be immeasurable.After thinking thoroughly, Ye Yuan had no choice but to stand out and rectify Qian Miao's misdiagnosis.Ye Yuan had yet to say anything, Lu-er who was by his side already could not endure it. She pouted and said to Qian Miao, \"Young Master isn't saying rubbish. He definitely has a reason for it.\"Ye Yuan glanced at Lu-er somewhat surprised, and thought in his heart, this little girl actually trusted him that much?His predecessor had his fair share of teasing her in the past and yet even with such moral caliber, Lu-er actually believed him?Trust was trust, but Ye Yuan also knew Lu-er's words just raised the difficulty of things. An expert such as Qian Miao was not to be offended. Not to mention, these two juniors repeatedly questioned his medical skills.Indeed, Qian Miao's expression sunk further. He then said in a low voice, \"Little la.s.s who does not know the immensity of heaven and earth, why don't you try to explain how I'm harming people? For a poison from a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python, if Ye Hang were here, this would be how he treats it. Just the two of you juniors still wet behind the ears actually dared to question my prescription? If you don't explain yourselves today, just wait for a beating!\"Although Qian Miao normally held his nose high up in the air, he actually never used any underhanded means to deal with people. n.o.body in the Ye Family dares to offend him either. But today, these two youths caused such a ruckus that he could not take a step back anymore. If he does not demonstrate his prestige and authority, there would be no place left for him in the Ye Family.The brawny man never expected such a situation to happen either. He stood there stunned, not knowing what to do. Why did they start to fight among themselves?While Qian Miao's prestige cannot be compared with Ye Hang, it was still well-established. Even within the entire Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, he can be considered as a master. At one side stood a renowned master, while at the other side was a punk who was still wet behind his ears. Even a fool knew who to trust.The brawny man initially did not know who this youth was, but after Qian Miao's fiery remarks, he came to a realization. Was this youth that incompetent son of Master Ye?As a demonic beast hunter, he naturally would not be ignorant of events happening in the capital. The fame of this young master was likely even greater than Master Qian.A wastrel like him actually dared to question Master Qian's diagnosis? Could it be that this punk was bored to death and decided to come and harm my life?Thinking about this, the brawny man suddenly became furious. He had never messed with anyone and yet was nearly harmed for no reason. This brat had such a wicked heart at a young age!\"This Brother, Master Qian is currently treating me. Please don't interfere,\" the brawny man said in a low voice. Although his words were polite, it was clear the intention was to chase them away.If the Ye Family were not a power he did not dare to offend, his words would definitely not be this courteous.\"Hey, this Warrior, I would have to trouble you to wait a moment. I, Qian Miao, spent my entire life immersed in the Dao of Medicinal Pills. Having treated countless mortals and martial artists, have never been maligned as someone who harms people. Ye Yuan, you have to say today, how am I harming him?!\"Qian Miao's stubborn temper flared up. He was bent on teaching Ye Yuan a lesson before dismissing the matter.\"This . . . Master Qian, the poison in this one's body would become dangerous if it's delayed any longer. Master, please don't be angry and help me purge the poison first. They are merely two ignorant youths casually rambling.\" The brawny man did not expect Master Qian to take things seriously, so he could only try to persuade the latter.However, Qian Miao waved his hands indifferently saying, \"Relax, it wouldn't take much time. This old man has a certain level of confidence in dealing with this poison and wouldn't let you die. If this matter isn't clarified today, in the future, how will this old man have the face to sit here and make diagnoses?\"Having said this, he then turned to Ye Yuan and questioned the young master with a black face, \"Why don't you say it?! If you can't explain yourself, then don't accuse me of bullying you with my seniority and complain about it to your father.\"Ye Yuan stood at the side without a word. Only when Qian Miao started questioning that he opened his mouth and replied, \"The poison this warrior was inflicted with did not come from the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python.\"\"Utter nonsense! My two companions lost their lives at its fangs. I myself nearly couldn't make it back. Don't tell me I identified it wrongly? Ignorant brat, I have no grudges with you, but why do you want me dead?\" the warrior interjected before Ye Yuan could finish speaking.\"Hahaha . . .\" Qian Miao laughed so hard until tears nearly fell before saying, \"Did you hear that? Completely ignorant! Naive brat, get lost quickly! If you continue to cause trouble, I will call for someone to drive you out!\"Qian Miao was able to identify the poison the warrior was inflicted with at a glance. That by itself was already convincing enough. Furthermore, the warrior escaped from the fangs of the python; how could he have identified the beast wrongly?Demonic beast hunters dealt with demonic beasts regularly. One could say that apart from own family, they were most familiar with demonic beasts, which further lowered the likelihood of identifying them wrongly.\"Get lost quickly! Don't delay master Qian from diagnosing us!\"\"This mischievous child is actually ruining his father's business. Truly hopeless!\"\"If I actually gave birth to a son like this, I would have long beaten him into a paste with a stick.\"At this time, those around watching a good show could not keep quiet any longer. Believing this was a farce orchestrated by Ye Yuan, they started chasing him away with words.At that moment, Lu-er no longer had the confidence from before; with a timid expression, she pulled the corner of Ye Yuan's sleeve. However, she was not retreating. Instead, she took a step forward, standing right in front of Ye Yuan. She was actually afraid these people would become violent and harmed Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan's heart was touched, but he shook his head before replying calmly, \"What you saw with your own eyes might not be what you thought it was. The poison this warrior's inflicted with actually was not from a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python, but instead, it was a poison from a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python? I've never even heard of such a thing! Do you think that by fabricating a demonic beast, you can deceive us?\"Qian Miao was considered an accomplished alchemist in the State of Qin. Thus, he indeed had researched demonic beasts before. As for this Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python, he had never even heard of such a thing!If even he had never heard of it before, forget about Ye Yuan, who was an ignorant and incompetent brat.\"Young Master Ye, you aren't just insulting Master Qian and me, you are insulting all of us demonic beast hunters! We demonic beast hunters spend all of our time fighting for our livelihood under the demonic claws of those demonic beasts. I've been a demonic beast hunter for so many years, yet I've never heard of this Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python before.\"At this point, the brawny-looking man felt even more confident that Ye Yuan was causing trouble out of nothing. Ye Yuan was plotting to harm his life. Thus, his words were no longer courteous and instead wanted to expose Ye Yuan's ulterior motives.Small fries had small fries' way of living. Although the brawny-looking man might appear unrefined most of the time, in reality, he was sharp in some ways. He was still relying on Qian Miao to save his life, and so, in order to not offend Qian Miao, he tied Qian Miao and him together. Additionally, he brought out the group of demonic beast hunters, all to make Ye Yuan retreat in the face of difficulties.Even if Ye Yuan does not retreat in the face of the overwhelming odds, the Ye Family would know better than to offend the entire group of demonic beast hunters.Many of those who came here were demonic beast hunters. After hearing his words, the scene became chaotic immediately.\"That's right! What Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python! Never heard of it!\"\"This affluent second generation really lost face for Grandmaster Ye! It looks like the Ye Family won't be able to compete with the Drunken Star Manor, and its glory will end with this generation. What bulls.h.i.+t Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python?! I've been around the Endless Forest for almost 30 years, and I've never even heard of such a demonic beast.\"\"Enough, enough. I think we all better go over to the Drunken Star Manor. A perfectly fine Fragrant Medicine Pavilion befouled by an affluent second generation.\"Ye Yuan remained standing still silently, which was unthinkable to Qian Miao who knew him well. If it happened in the past, this punk Ye Yuan would have exploded long ago. Yet now, he was behaving like nothing's happening, as if those patients were not scolding him.However, Ye Yuan had thoroughly swept away any face he had today. No matter from which perspective one looked at, Qian Miao stood at the side of reason, so he had nothing to fear. Best to let this brat suffer some hards.h.i.+p. Otherwise, if things continue like this, the family business carved out by Old Ye would sooner or later be destroyed by this brat's hands.Ye Yuan's gaze slowly turned towards the noisy crowd and swept his gaze over those who were happily making the most noise. Initially, those people were very pleased, but without knowing why, those who crossed sights with Ye Yuan, felt like their entire person fell into an ice cellar.Ye Yuan's gaze finally fixed onto the face of the person who first incited everyone to go to the Drunken Star Manor. That man was just in the midst of snickering to himself when all of a sudden, he felt a piercing cold killing intent lock onto him. His facial expression froze, feeling indescribable eeriness.He was a very keen and capable middle-aged man, as well as a demonic beast hunter himself. Those familiar with him knew him as Liu An, but n.o.body knew that he was actually a spy placed among the demonic beast hunters by the Drunken Star Manor. Anytime something valuable was discovered in the Endless Forest, he would kill and rob that person, and then pa.s.sed it over to Drunken Star Manor.This Drunken Star Manor was precisely the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's biggest compet.i.tor in the State of Qin.All of a sudden, the initially noisy hall turned silent; the racket akin to a waterfall was being cut in half and stopped abruptly.For a moment, the hall was so quiet that one could even hear a pin drop. The silence was terrifyingly oppressive.Liu An was stared at by Ye Yuan that he had gooseb.u.mps all over his body. He thought to himself, what's going on? This punk, Ye Yuan, clearly only has the power of a First Level Essence Qi Realm. A person at the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm like him could crush someone like Ye Yuan to death with a single hand. So why would he experience such terrifying oppression where he did not even dare to breathe loudly, the feeling of facing a terrifying opponent?Ye Yuan's strength was evident at a glance. Apart from a few mortals in the hall, virtually everyone was able to see his cultivation realm with a glance. A punk who was weak to the extreme, how could he possibly create such a sense of oppression?Liu An felt that this was definitely a hallucination, yet the silent hall constantly reminded him that it was not.The oppressive feeling made him feel extremely uncomfortable, making him feel like he absolutely had to dispel the current state. An Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm being oppressed by a First Level Essence Qi Realm till he could not speak? What an utter joke!Liu An decided to tear apart this joke. Gathering a breath of true essence, he was just about to open his mouth when Ye Yuan's gaze moved away from his body . . .Pffft!Ye Yuan's words were interrupted halfway by a sound.The crowd turned towards the source of the sound and discovered that it was by Liu An. At that moment, he was spraying a mouthful of blood far away, splattering on quite a few people.He forcefully gathered a breath of true essence to talk, and yet Ye Yuan just happened to withdraw the pressure exerted onto his body, which made his chest feel like it was heavily struck by a sledgehammer. Plus his body was originally carrying some injuries, so he directly sprayed out a mouthful of old blood, and became even more heavily injured right now.\"Young Master, this person seemed to be heavily injured. Why not let Master Qian treat him first?\" Lu-er pulled on Ye Yuan's sleeve and said pitifully.Ye Yuan's face briefly revealed an astonished expression, but he was actually full of joy in his heart. He thought to himself that this little la.s.s was intelligent, to actually have such a remarkable follow-up.\"Killing a chicken with a butcher's knife? It might look serious, but in reality, this warrior only has some light internal injuries. Our Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's Heart Protecting Pill is renowned far and wide. Just let him consume one, and it will do.\" Ye Yuan had a radiant smile on his face while he looked at Liu An.Lu-er saw that Liu An looked horrifying, so she did not wait for Ye Yuan orders, and immediately left to fetch the medicine. But this deeply frightened Liu An.\"N-no need. T-there are still so many people queuing up in front of me, c-cutting isn't very nice,\" Liu An said with guilt.\"That won't do. I know you don't trust me, but are you telling me that you can't trust our Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's reputation? I believe everyone is aware of the reputation of our Heart Protecting Pill. Using it to treat your injuries will definitely work,\" Ye Yuan said, full of concern.As he finished, even Qian Miao nodded and said, \"That's right. This time around, Little Yuan isn't messing around. Even though your injuries aren't severe, it wouldn't be good if it continues to deteriorate. Using a Heart Protecting Pill to treat your injuries is perfect.\"In reality, Ye Yuan's gaze just now stopped on quite a few people. It was just that it paused on Liu An's body just slightly longer. The others did not feel what he felt, so they did not discover anything amiss with Liu An.Right now, Ye Yuan seemed to be full of concern for Liu An. Even though n.o.body knew what medicine he was selling in his gourd, there was nothing wrong with saving people.In the time it took to have this conversation, Lu-er already rushed back like a gust of wind with a Heart Protecting Pill.\"Young Master, here.\" Lu-er gave it to Ye Yuan like she wanted to claim credit for it.Turning around, Ye Yuan received the medicinal pill. Petting Lu-er's head, he smiled and said, \"It was hard on you.\"\"Not at all.\" Lu-er shook her head vigorously.Right now, Ye Yuan had his back turned towards the crowd, and n.o.body, not even Lu-er, noticed his hand movements.If one were to pay attention to Ye Yuan's hand that was holding the medicinal pill, one would discover that the medicinal pill was not being held in his hand, but instead, hovering on top of his palm. While at the same time, Ye Yuan's fingers were moving at a very high frequency.After talking with Lu-er, Ye Yuan turned around, walked in front of Liu An and pa.s.sed the medicine pill to him. \"Here, swallow it quickly.\"Receiving the Heart Protecting Pill, Liu An's face changed color several times. Did this brat really discover something? No matter what, this brat isn't some saint, so why would he suddenly be concerned about others.Just as Liu An was feeling nervous and uneasy, his eyes swept around until they were on Qian Miao who was by the side. Immediately, he went up and said righteously, \"Master Qian, it's not me who's narrow-minded, but rather, Young Master Ye whose reputation isn't that good. Honestly speaking, I worry about this medicinal pill. Master Qian, please make the decision for me!\"When he said this, everyone all nodded in agreement. But Lu-er could not stand it. \"You are such an ungrateful person! Our family's Young Master is filled with good intentions to save you, yet you are suspecting him!\"\"Hmph. Everybody knows what kind of person your young master is. Is there anything wrong with suspecting him?\" Right now, Liu An also became resolute and refused to eat it.Qian Miao looked at Ye Yuan and discovered that Ye Yuan was very calm and did not get angry because of this, making him even more suspicious.Looking once more at the medicinal pill in Liu An's hands, he took it and scrutinized it, even sniffing it before saying, \"This is indeed our Heart Protecting Pill without anything inappropriate. Furthermore, this particular Heart Protecting Pill's medicinal fragrance is overflowing. Clearly, its quality is even greater than the average ones. I am not forcing you to eat this Heart Protecting Pill, but your injuries right now aren't light. If you are not careful, it might affect your cultivation in the future. I advise you to just take it.\"Liu An really became confused this time. Could it be that he was really overthinking it? Supposedly, Ye Yuan, this brat had just escaped death, did he really have a change in nature ever since?Qian Miao, this old fellow, is an honorable man, so he can't possibly be cheating me. Thinking up to this point, Liu An gave thanks and swallowed the Heart Protecting Pill in one go.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if his entire body relaxed quite a bit.The medicine's efficacy was pretty good!From the looks of it, this punk Ye Yuan really had a change in personality. To actually give him a high-grade Heart Protecting Pill. At this moment, Liu An felt he gauged the heart of a gentleman with one's own mean measure.\"This Warrior, how are you feeling?\" Ye Yuan asked, his face beaming with a smile.Liu An cupped his hands and replied with grat.i.tude, \"Thank you, Young Master Ye. This one was too rash. I hope you can overlook my transgression. However, let's return to the topic at hand. Forgive me for being ignorant, but I've never heard before of a demonic beast called Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python.\"Liu An did not overlook his mission and immediately dragged the topic back after he recovered.After the disturbance, everyone's focus was diverted and forgot all about that matter. Now that Liu An brought it up again, everyone came to a realization and once again looked towards Ye Yuan with contempt in their eyes.Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, \"Actually, a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python is a mutation of a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python. It's just that a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python is more common, while a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python is much rarer. Snakes belong to the yin attribute. Thus, the majority of snake species possesses yin poison. However, there is a minority which mutated to have yang attribute. It happens to be that the one you encountered was this. Appearance wise, a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python doesn't differ much from a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python. However, it's known as the Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python because there's a seven-colored flower on its seven inches thick skin.\"\"This demonic beast has a huge frame. When this Warrior was facing it, there was no way of spotting that seven-colored flower. Naturally, this means that he couldn't differentiate between a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python and Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python. It's just that these two demonic beasts, one possesses yin poison while the other yang poison. If we used the prescription intended for yin poison to detoxify yang poison, we would actually be harming this warrior.\"Ye Yuan finished talking while Qian Miao started frowning.What Ye Yuan said sounded plausible, with virtually no flaws. If this brawny man were genuinely suffering from a Yang poison, then this treatment method would really harm him.However, he could not comprehend how Ye Yuan came up with this diagnosis. How could Ye Yuan possibly know a demonic beast that he himself had never even heard of before? Even if he knew about this demonic beast, how had he found out the poison inflicted on this brawny man was different from the venom of Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python?\"Humph! Even if it existed this so-called Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python that you spoke of, why are the symptoms of his poisoning exactly the same as the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python?\" Qian Miao asked coldly.Ye Yuan smiled and replied, \"What's so unusual about that? A Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python and a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python both came from a common ancestor. Naturally, after being poisoned, the symptoms are almost similar, but not the same. This warrior, try pressing down on the spot seven inches below your armpit.\"The brawny man was at a loss on what he should do. Seeing Qian Miao nodded his head, he then measured the mentioned range of seven inches below his armpit and pressed down the spot.There was not much force, but a pained expression immediately appeared on his face. Following which, a mouthful of blood sprayed out.As the blood splattered on the ground, a foul stench a.s.saulted their noses. Seeing how it made people feel dizzy, it was clear it contained a deadly poison.\"This . . .\" Qian Miao was astonished. Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison was not uncommon; hence, he was able to identify it after a brief diagnosis. But according to what he knew, Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison would absolutely not have such a situation occur.Although a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison is potent, it is far from being this overbearing.Ye Yuan frowned slightly and ordered the attendants, \"Men, come and clean this place.\"If it were in the past, most likely no one would heed his order. But looking at the current situation happening in front of their eyes, two servants immediately came forth and started cleaning.These two servants were clearly used to doing such things. Soon enough, no sign of blood could be seen on the ground.Qian Miao's facial expression kept changing before finally taking in a deep breath and said, \"Yuan-er, in your opinion, how should the Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python's poison be treated?\"By saying this, it was equivalent to acknowledging his misdiagnosis earlier. It was just that in front of so many people, there was naturally no way he would apologize to a junior. Hence, his words were more subtle with implicit meaning.Furthermore, the way he addressed Ye Yuan also had changed. Calling him with Yuan-er seemed much intimate now. Of course, with his status, Qian Miao could certainly address him as Yuan-er.Even so, these words caused a stir in the crowd.\"Yin poison has to be treated with yang means. Yang poison naturally has to be treated with yin means. Uncle Qian has a deep understanding towards medicines. The prescription just now didn't actually have major mistakes. You just have to swap yang attribute medicines with yin attribute ones. That will do. Green Flow Gra.s.s and Vermillion Soul Sand are neutral medicines. But Ironwind Eagle belongs under yang attribute. Furthermore, eagle subdues snake. If it were the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison, this medicine would be the best. Right now, we just have to swap the Ironwind Eagle's inner core with a Lightning Ferret's inner core, and that should solve this problem. A Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python's poison burns more fiercely. So it is best to add some Extreme Yin Datura.\"Ye Yuan talked as if he already had a well-thought-out plan. But most importantly, everything he said was reasonable and well-founded. As long as the person understood medicine, there would be no way to refute his words at all.Lu-er looked at the Young Master and felt that he was simply too handsome today.\"Mas-Master Qian, i-is it true what he just said?\" the brawny man asked hesitatingly.Qian Miao took one look at the brawny man, shook his head with a bitter smile and said, \"Honestly, even I'm not so sure now. But looking at the poisonous blood you spat out just now, what you are inflicted with, indeed, doesn't look like a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison.\"\"Bu-But will the method he said work? What if I die from his treatment?\"It was not that the brawny man did not have faith in the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. It was just Ye Yuan's former reputation was too rotten. This prejudice left him unable to trust Ye Yuan at all.His body's poison as diagnosed by Ye Yuan was only the latter's claim. n.o.body could determine whether it's real or bogus. How could he be confident?Qian Miao forced a smile and said, \"I don't know either. But I feel that his method is worth a shot. What do you think?\"\"What are you still standing there for? Quickly grab the materials! Do you want the patient to die from the poison?\"At this moment, a thunderous voice roared in everyone's ears. The crowd looked toward the door and saw a rough-looking man walked in swiftly.\"Understood, Family Head.\" The attendant standing beside Qian Miao saw who it was and immediately responded and left.That man was Ye Hang.\"Father.\"\"Family Head.\"Ye Yuan and Qian Miao greeted Ye Hang at the same time.Ye Hang stopped in front of Ye Yuan and nodded his head lightly. With approval and relief being apparent in his eyes, Ye Hang said, \"Looks like your personality changed for real this time. To have finished reading all those books I left you during this period, you really did diligently studied the Dao of Alchemy. Not bad.\"Without waiting for Ye Yuan's reply, he turned and said to the brawny man, \"Little Brother, my son is right. You are truly inflicted with a Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python's poison and not a Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison. This type of demonic beast is extremely uncommon which led to Old Qian being unable to identify it. I apologize for that. However, the prescription my son issued isn't wrong either; just drink it and see. If something happened, my Fragrant Medicine Pavilion would take full responsibility. What do you think?\"Ye Hang had a very distinguished ident.i.ty in the entire State of Qin. Usually, it was impossible to see him here; let alone request for him to treat you. Today, he personally guaranteed it. What reason was there left for the brawny man to hesitate?Looks like even though the Ye Family's Young Master might be incompetent, it was in no way as exaggerated as the rumors outside. At least he had some real capabilities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was nearly hoodwinked by you yesterday. Looks like you really are different than in the past. What Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python. I've never heard of it before this too. Just now, even if I personally diagnosed him, I'm afraid the results would be the same as with Old Qian.\"Thinking of it now, Ye Hang was a little fearful after that episode. If it was not for his son's stroke of genius, the golden signboard of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion would be ruined today.That brawny-looking man already drank the medicine, and he got better. He was eternally grateful to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and Ye Yuan. What was supposed to be a disaster, became a good thing because of the anomaly, Ye Yuan.In fact, what could be foreseen after today was that the prestige of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion would soar even higher among the demonic beast hunters. The benefits involved would be immense.\"What? Even Lord Father doesn't know about this? I thought that with your attainments in the Alchemy Dao, treating this sort of poison would be a piece of cake.\" Ye Yuan pretended to be surprised.\"A piece of cake? Hehehe. Naturally, within this tiny State of Qin, I have some status. But outside of the State of Qin, I, your father, am nothing. What Alchemy Grandmaster? It's merely just crossing the threshold of the great path of Alchemy. The State of Qin is a well, and I am a frog in that well. It's just that I am a slightly larger frog. There are too many things I don't understand.\"Ye Hang suddenly started to mock himself, looking a little desolate, which made Ye Yuan somewhat surprised. In his predecessor's memory, his father, Ye Hang, was a man of indomitable spirit, as if nothing could bring him down. He had never seen his father reveal such an expression before.Ye Yuan could feel that Ye Hang displayed this side of him because he felt that his son had grown up and was more sensible now. So he felt like a heavy load had lifted off his shoulders, which was why his tightly wound nerves finally relaxed.Ye Yuan felt touched in his heart. His father most likely had his heart crushed over these years for his son. It was just that he never showed it in front of his son.Ye Yuan once again thought of his past life's father, Zhengyang Zi, and felt a mult.i.tude of feelings surge up. He could not bear to mock Ye Hang anymore, so he opened his mouth and said, \"Father, I know what you want to ask. Actually, I also don't know what's going on. This time around when I got poisoned and was on the verge of death, I met an expert in a dream. He imparted to me both martial and alchemy techniques which were exceedingly profound. Initially, I thought it was just a dream, but after waking up, I discovered that I remembered clearly what happened in the dream. Furthermore, I could completely do it in reality. If it wasn't for that expert, with Father's means, you probably wouldn't see me again.\"Ye Yuan could not possibly tell Ye Hang that his son's body had already been occupied by another soul. So he had no choice but to fabricate a white lie which was close to the truth.Hearing Ye Yuan's words, Ye Hang could not help but become ecstatic. To think an expert took fancy of his son and imparted profound techniques in his dreams. This was a completely inconceivable thought for him. With such an expert for a master, the ma.s.sive boulder that had been pressing on Ye Hang's heart was finally lifted.\"T-That expert, did he say who he was? He saved my son's life. As a father, I've got to at least thank him.\"But Ye Yuan shook his head and said, \"That expert didn't reveal his name, neither did he say why he saved me. He just said to properly comprehend the skills he imparted to me. When the time comes, he will naturally look for me again.\"\"So that's the case . . . Then the next time you see him, you must definitely give thanks to him on Father's behalf,\" Ye Hang said with regret.Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"Of course. Father, I still have some matters on hand, so I will take my leave first.\"A moment later, Ye Yuan arrived at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion once more and said to the shopkeeper, \"In a while, if someone looks for me, let him come to the manor at the east of the city. Additionally, here is a prescription. Help me prepare the medicines.\". . . . . .Presently, Liu An was quite pleased with himself, while also feeling a little dejected.He was pleased because Ye Yuan that brat was indeed a fool. To actually give a high-grade Heart Protecting Pill to someone with both hands. That Heart Protecting Pill's effects seemed to be exceptionally good. Currently, not only were his injuries healed, there was even a faint sign of breaking through after his injuries recovered.He had already been stuck at the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm for many years, and yet he could never seem to touch the threshold of the Ninth Level. Liu An was prepared to first temporarily put aside his duties for the Drunken Star Manor so that he could attempt to impact through the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm with full force.What made him dejected was that Drunken Star Manor's scheme to redirect the troubled waters had failed. And it actually failed due to a silkpants.No matter how Liu An thought of the incident, he just could not figure out how a silkpants was able to identify and treat a poison which even the Manor Lord of the Drunken Star Manor, Wan Donghai, could not handle.This Wan Donghai was an existence on the same level as Ye Hang. His attainments in the Alchemy Dao even faintly surpa.s.sed Ye Hang. How could the ignorant and incompetent son of Ye Hang possibly have survived through that situation?And yet, the situation happened like that right under his eyes. Currently, Liu An had a headache thinking about how he should account to the Manor Lord.Therefore, Liu An did not even believe that the brawny-looking man was treated by Ye Yuan, but instead, it was Ye Hang who took action behind the scene. Ye Yuan was just a chess piece which Ye Hang pushed out into the open.' Looks like this Ye Hang is very shrewd. When I return, I have to warn the Manor Lord to be on guard. 'While Liu An was thinking as he walked, he suddenly discovered something wrong. The area underneath his nostrils was a little wet. Reaching out to touch it, he jumped in fright when he saw that his hands were covered in fresh blood.Overly heaty? What kind of joke was this? He was an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artist. How could he possibly have a nosebleed because his body was heaty?Somehow, he suddenly recalled Ye Yuan's sincere smiling face, and he shuddered uncontrollably.Immediately, he shook his head and rejected that thought. He, Liu An, was not some rookie. Even though he was not at a high level like Qian Miao, he was still capable of identifying between a fake and a genuine medicine. That medicinal pill was absolutely a Heart Protecting Pill; furthermore, it was a high-grade Heart Protecting Pill.Definitely too heaty.Liu An consoled himself in this manner, but he quickly discovered that he was too naive.Not long after, blood then flowed from his two eyes, followed by his ears, and finally, he directly coughed up a large mouthful of blood. His internal organs felt like it caught fire, and his viscera was ablaze right now.At this moment, he could confirm that he was indeed poisoned.Liu An could also be considered someone who frequently walked along the borders of life and death. But the more so, the more he was terrified of dying. Right now, his entire person felt a chill as if frozen. He had never experienced the despair he was feeling right now even back when he faced powerful demonic beasts.At this moment, Liu An only had one thought, which was to survive. He sprinted desperately towards the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. There was not much time left for him.. . . . . .The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's shopkeeper was shocked by this person bleeding from his seven orifices. He did not care about anything and just grabbed onto his sleeve after entering, requesting to meet Young Master Ye.The shopkeeper was taken aback and did not react in time. Suddenly, he recalled what the young master instructed before leaving, so he told the address to this blood-covered person in front of him.After that person left, the shopkeeper was a little puzzled. \"This person is really weird. Already like that, and yet he didn't look for Master Qian, but Young Master instead. For what? Unless Young Master knows how to treat diseases?\"Everyone, including initially Liu An, thought that the brawny-looking man being saved today could not possibly have anything to do with Ye Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Young Master, when did you become so amazing?\"Ye Yuan smiled and pinched Lu-er's delicate pink nose. He then grumpily replied, \"Since when your young master isn't amazing?\"Originally intended as a joke, who knew Lu-er actually seriously pondered awhile before nodding. \"Oh, in the past, people always talked bad about Young Master. I don't know why, but I've always thought of Young Master as a good person. It's just that now Young Master is even more impressive. Right, what does this pill do?\"One day after transmigrating, Lu-er already became the closest person to Ye Yuan. Without hiding anything, Ye Yuan explained, \"It's poison, a very potent one.\"Lu-er seemingly frightened by this and asked, \"Ah? Why did Young Master refine something like this?\"Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"Naturally for a person to eat.\"Lu-er mused over this explanation, before replying with a straight face, \"I understand. Young Master definitely refined this poison for bad guys to eat.\"Ye Yuan laughed out loud and said, \"Let's go. The bad guy is almost here. We will wait for him in the parlor.\"The two just stepped into the parlor, and a servant came to report that a person with a bloodied face was at the front entrance of the manor seeking for an audience. Ye Yuan commanded him to bring that person over.Momentarily, the servant brought a pitiful looking Liu An to the parlor.Upon seeing Ye Yuan, Liu An sprinted over. Hugging Ye Yuan's leg and crying, he said, \"Young Master Ye, I beg you to be magnanimous and save me, please. We don't have any grudges between us. Why do you want to put me to death?!\"Ye Yuan gave a look of disdain and then sent Liu An flying with a kick before squatting down and said, \"Don't have any grudges? Do you really take me for a fool? No matter how many Heart Protecting Pills my Ye Family has, we wouldn't take it out to feed dogs. Make your choice now. Do you want to confess in exchange for the antidote or die due to the poison?\"Even after being sent flying with a kick, Liu An did not have any complaints and nearly tripped over himself while crawling back. Only this time he did not dare to hug Ye Yuan's legs again. However, Ye Yuan was just at the First Level Essence Qi Realm; even if the kick was packed with true essence, it was unable to cause any substantial harm to Liu An.As to the risk for Liu An retaliating like a desperate dog leaping over a wall, Ye Yuan was not concerned at all. That was because Liu An's true essence scattered all over in his body, and he was unable to gather them together.\"Young Master Ye, I truly don't know what you meant by that! I only came to Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to get treated. Even if I'd offended you, it isn't deserving of death. I am only a small figure. I beg of you, Young Master Ye. Just treat me like a fart and let me go,\" Liu An said as he cried without even trying to maintain his dignity.Ye Yuan did not speak and only looked at Liu An's alarmed face until the latter became fl.u.s.tered.At this point, Liu An still held onto one last trace of possibility that Ye Yuan's wastrel disease struck and that this was a practical joke. He hoped that by letting go of his dignity, he could coax Ye Yuan into giving him the antidote. If people found out about his shady ident.i.ty, he would be hunted down by demonic beast hunters.However, after Ye Yuan stared at him for a long time with that same gaze, Liu An's heart hit rock bottom.Ye Yuan looked at Liu An and suddenly smiled. A smile which made his heart went cold.\"Yo-Young Master Ye.\"\"Hahaha. It's fine if you don't want to talk, I have plenty of time, but you don't. Right now, do you feel your organs burning up, and your entire body as if it's about to ablaze? This is merely the beginning. After a while, your skin wouldn't be able to withstand it and start to crack open, bit by bit. Eventually, your entire body will go pah! And explode like a watermelon.\"As Ye Yuan spoke, he even made an explosion gesture with his hands. Liu An's entire body quaked as if following Ye Yuan's hand movements and exploded.At this point, Liu An knew he was out of luck. Ye Yuan definitely saw through something.a.n.a.lyzing everything up to this point, Liu An's heart swiftly calmed down. This was an ability developed through countless years of hunting demonic beasts; he became an extraordinarily sinister and cunning person. His mind calculated everything, and a scheme developed.It was already impossible to return to the past with the situation that was happening right now. Liu An decided to go all out. As long as he managed to swindle the antidote from Ye Yuan's hands, he would immediately kill Ye Yuan and this little girl before leaving for a distant place.Liu An was a decisive man. Now that the scheme was in place, there was no need to delay things any longer. Naturally, he would not reveal his inner thoughts. Instead, he continued to maintain a pitiful and helpless appearance in order to deceive Ye Yuan.Liu An repeatedly kowtowed and babbled nonstop, \"Young Master Ye, I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong. I can't hide anything from your keen sight. I'm willing to tell Young Master Ye everything. I only beg Young Master Ye to spare my worthless life.\"Ye Yuan looked as if he was delighted with Liu An's performance. He smiled and said, \"That will depend on whether the information you are going to reveal is valuable or not. If it is, this Young Master naturally will not make things difficult for a small fry like you.\"Liu An became thrilled upon hearing this. He thought to himself, this punk is indeed a pampered child, baited with just a little bit of honey. Liu An no longer hesitated and spilled everything out.The truth did not deviate much from Ye Yuan's conjecture. That brawny man initially went to several medicinal pill stores. Occasionally, there would be physicians who could recognize the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison. But they were helpless against it.Do not look down on Qian Miao just because he was nothing in front of Ye Yuan. When put in the entire Qin Country, he was a top-ranked individual. He could identify and treat the Seven Evils Flowing Cloud Python's poison, but this does not mean that others could do the same. Luckily they could not handle it; otherwise, the brawny man would have long succ.u.mbed to the poison.Left without any choice, the brawny man then went to the Drunken Star Manor first. Coincidentally, the Drunken Star Manor's Manor Lord, Wan Donghai, happened to be there and saw the brawny man.The diagnosis of a Drunken Star Manor's physician was actually the same as Qian Miao's. However, Wan Donghai saw that something was not quite right, and requested the brawny man to seek a more capable expert.Within the State of Qin, other than the Drunken Star Manor, there was only the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. What could the brawny man do, other than to go try his luck at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion? Wan Donghai could feel that something was wrong, but like Ye Hang, he was helpless against the poison.Your enemy would be the person who understood you the most. Wan Dong Hai was confident that Ye Hang could not neutralize this poison. Hence, he sent Liu An to blend with the crowd and wait for an opportunity to fan the flames in order to ruin the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's reputation. If the situation went out of control, it would be best to incite the demonic beast hunters to smash up the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.That way, even if the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was not destroyed, it would result in a considerable loss of reputation, leaving them unable to compete with the Drunken Star Manor any longer.Liu An who was wounded earlier had just returned to the capital of the State of Qin. Furthermore, he was quick-witted which made him the most suitable candidate.Initially, everything had been going along as planned by Wan Donghai. But who knew halfway through, something unexpected would happen. Ye Yuan unexpectedly actually managed to resolve this poison, leaving Liu An unable to do anything.\"Hehehe. It really was Wan Donghai. What a great trick to manipulate this incident.\" Ye Yuan smiled coldly.This Wan Donghai had always viewed Ye Yuan's father as an enemy. Both were Alchemy Grandmaster with prominent status within the state. Yet, Wan Donghai was an insidious, unscrupulous person, completely different than Ye Hang.Ye Yuan was naturally familiar with this Wan Donghai. Although his predecessor was far from being a match for Wan Donghai, his son Wan Yuan, was his nemesis at the Dan Wu Academy.Naturally, although they are rivals, it was actually Wan Yuan one-sidedly bullying Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan thoroughly could not retaliate at all. Although Wan Yuan was also another silkpants like him, he was still outstanding among the students at the Dan Wu Academy. Apart from reaching the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, he even became an Alchemy Apprentice of the Dao of Alchemy.Even among the talents in the Dan Wu Academy, Wan Yuan was an exceptional genius who was well-favored. In comparison, Ye Yuan was not even fit to hold his shoes up.In fact, the matter regarding Ye Yuan's poisoning, after a.n.a.lyzing his predecessor's memories, there was an 80% likelihood that Wan Yuan being the mastermind behind the incident.Good! Excellent! The old grievances have yet to fade, and new grudges were formed already. This father and son pair from the Wan Family . . . This feud, we will never reconcile! Ye Yuan thought and laughed coldly in his heart.\"Yo-Young Master Ye, I've said what I should say, as well as what I shouldn't have. Don't you think . . .?\" Liu An said weakly.Just now, he even revealed that he was a spy for the Drunken Star Manor; all just to obtain Ye Yuan's trust and swindle that antidote from him.Feeling satisfied, Ye Yuan nodded. Taking out the newly refined poison pill, he threw it to Liu An and said, \"Not bad. You've performed well. This antidote is your reward.\"Liu An received the pill and was feeling elated. Without even being skeptical, he swallowed it and immediately meditated to absorb the medicinal effects.Indeed, the moment the pill reached his abdomen and was being absorbed, his originally stagnant true essence started circulating immediately. His eyes suddenly snapped open, and he flew forward like a cheetah with clawed hands, moving towards Ye Yuan's throat.\"Ah! Young Master!\" Lu-er at the side gave a shrill scream. Without even thinking, she jumped in front of Ye Yuan.This claw attack was abnormally vicious, bringing with it an imposing aura tempered by the life-and death-situations he encountered daily as a demonic beast hunter. Against a little rookie like Ye Yuan, it was impossible to fail.And yet, this claw suddenly stopped three inches away from Lu-er's throat. Following this, Liu An collapsed to the ground and started convulsing; his face distorted in pain.Ye Yuan pulled Lu-er aside from the back. Looking with pity at Liu An who was on the ground, he smiled coldly and said, \"Disasters from the heavens can be withstood, but the evil we bring upon ourselves is the hardest to bear. If you didn't have any devious ideas, this Heart Inch Fissure Poison wouldn't activate this early. Yet, because you had vicious thoughts, you have to suffer more.\"\"W-Why . . .\" Liu An twitched as he squeezed out the word between his teeth.Ye Yuan smiled lightly and said, \"You thought the Heart Protecting Pill I gave you back at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was actually poison. In reality, that was really a Heart Protecting Pill. It's just that the medicinal pill had been refined several times. Consequently, the medicinal effects became several times more violent. You are bleeding from the seven orifices and unable to gather true essence was merely some side effects. There was actually no serious problem with your body. Once the medicinal effects pa.s.sed, not only would you be completely fine, you might have experienced improvement.\"\"But the pill you just ate was a real poison pill, the Heart Inch Fissure Pill. Furthermore, the effects are extremely violent. After consuming it, you will suffer from the pain of your intestines rupturing for six hours each day. Moreover, each time it happens, it will become even stronger. All the way until you die.\"Ye Yuan's words clearly reached Liu An's ears. This seemed to make him convulsed even more violently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beside him sat a middle-aged man who looked very calm.\"Big Brother, why isn't there any news from that Liu An? Could it be that the brawny-looking man's poison was cured by Ye Hang?\"The one talking was precisely the man pacing around, Wan Dongyang; he was Wan Donghai's brother, an alchemist himself from the same sect. The person sitting down naturally was the Manor Lord of the Drunken Star Manor, Wan Donghai.But Wan Donghai was composed and said unhurriedly, \"Dongyang, remain calm. I am all too clear on Ye Hang's abilities. It's impossible for him to treat that poison. We just have to sit here and wait for the good news to come.\"\"Aiya. Big Brother, this Fragrant Medicine Pavilion has been competing with us for so many years. Now that we finally have this opportunity, how can we ease the hatred in our hearts if we don't take them down completely?\" Wan Dongyang gritted his teeth and said.\"Haha. Oh Dongyang, you really need to fix that short temper of yours. Otherwise, it will be tough to break through and reach the Alchemist Grandmaster Realm. The poison inflicted on that brawny-looking man was very peculiar. If I guessed correctly, it should be poison from the mythical Seven-Colored Flowing Cloud Python. If it wasn't for the fact that I happened to read a word or two about it from an incomplete book, I'm afraid it would be our Drunken Star Manor who would suffer from this. But since I encountered it, then Ye Hang deserves to be unlucky. However, it's only being unlucky. It's not realistic to use this to bring down Ye Hang. At best, this matter would only let us suppress them in the business aspect.\" Wan Donghai remained unperturbed.Even though Wan Donghai said all that, there was not the slightest bit of unhappiness on Wan Dongyang's face. The step from Alchemy Master to Alchemy Grandmaster might seem simple, but in reality, it was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Otherwise, there would not be so few Alchemy Grandmasters in the entire State of Qin.However, this impatient temper of his was probably not going to change as he asked impatiently, \"Big Brother, why do I keep feeling that something is wrong? Why don't we send someone down to check on the situation there?\"Wan Donghai was afraid that if he acted rashly, he would alert and draw Ye Hang's attention. Apart from Liu An, he did not send anyone else to inquire about the news. But if that side started to fight, they should have long received the news here.Unless there really was an unexpected accident?\"Alright. You send someone to check it out.\" After thinking for a moment, Wan Donghai agreed.Wan Donghai was not really worried that something had happened to Liu An. After all, he and the Drunken Star Manor had no connections on the surface. He was merely a demonic beast hunter.Wan Dongyang acknowledged the instruction and was just about to send someone down when he heard urgent knocking on the door. \"Manor Lord, something big is happening! Someone is here to cause trouble!\"Hua.The door opened from the inside. Wan Donghai said coldly to the shopkeeper, \"Who is it?\"\"Who is so audacious? To actually dare climb on top of our heads?! What are all of you doing?!\" Hearing that someone was causing trouble, Wan Dongyang's hot temper immediately surfaced.The shopkeeper's face turned bitter and said, \"T-they didn't really come to cause trouble . . . I-it's just to get a treatment.\"Seeing Wan Donghai's face sank, the shopkeeper hurriedly rectified his words. \"No no no, t-they are using seeking treatment as an excuse to challenge us.\"\"Who is it?\" Wan Donghai's patience was almost exhausted.\"I-it's that silkpants from the Ye Family, Ye Hang's son, Ye Yuan,\" the shopkeeper said while trembling.\"Just a silkpants scared you until like this? Are you r.e.t.a.r.ded? Do you still want your job as a shopkeeper?\" The moment Wan Dongyang heard that it was Ye Yuan, he wanted to tear the shopkeeper apart.\"Forget it, let's go out and take a look,\" Wan Donghai commanded.. . . . . .The three of them went to the lobby and saw a youth sitting in an ostentatious manner where the shopkeeper was supposed to sit. Wan Donghai glared fiercely at the shopkeeper, but right now was not the time to punish him.Just as Wan Donghai was about to deal with Ye Yuan, he glanced sideways only to see Liu An who was like a dead dog on the ground; his heart jumped.Ye Yuan saw Wan Donghai appeared and took his time to get up. He walked in front of him, smiled and said, \"Manor Lord Wan, this Little Nephew came here rather abruptly today. I hope you won't take offense.\"Wan Donghai's facial muscles twitched a little and forcefully suppressed the impulse to slap Ye Yuan to death with one blow. Forcing out a slightly ugly smile, he said, \"Not at all. So it was Honorable Nephew who came. I was wondering which blind little b.a.s.t.a.r.d dared to be so rude in our Drunken Star Manor. If Honorable Nephew wants to come, it's better to notify us beforehand, so that we wouldn't be discourteous.\"Even though Wan Donghai wanted to gnash his teeth in hatred, he did not want to suffer a loss verbally, and so he scolded Ye Yuan being a little b.a.s.t.a.r.d. Everyone knew that the Drunken Star Manor and the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion were enemies, but they would still appear to be polite and amiable on the surface. They were all businessmen; if they were to really fight, in the future, who would dare to come and get their illnesses treated?Ye Yuan snickered in his heart at how narrow-minded Wan Donghai was, and yet, he was smiling as he said, \"Aww shucks. It's because I was anxious about saving people, and so I had no choice but to intrude. I've long heard that Manor Lord Wan's Alchemy Dao is number one in the State of Qin. That was why this Little Nephew had the idea of coming here to save a life.\"Hearing what Ye Yuan was saying, Wan Donghai wished he could tear him apart alive. If there were only people from the Drunken Star Manor, those words would be fine. But on the way to the Drunken Star Manor, Ye Yuan caused a ruckus, as if he was afraid that people would not know he was bringing someone to challenge the Drunken Star Manor. He attracted many people, and currently, the Drunken Star Manor's lobby was swarmed to the point where water cannot flow through.To say that Wan Donghai was the number one in the State of Qin in front of so many people was clearly intentional. One had to know that the Alchemy Grandmasters in the capital were not only Wan Donghai and Ye Hang. Ignoring others, there was also an Alchemy Grandmaster in the Imperial Family. If these words were to spread to the ears of the Imperial Family, Wan Donghai would be sitting on pins and needles.The intelligence network of the Imperial Family covered the entire state. G.o.d knows if there were a spy from the Imperial Family within the crowd.Currently, Wan Donghai was feeling uncomfortable as if he had eaten a fly, yet he had to smile and greet Ye Yuan, \"What are you saying, Honorable Nephew? How can I dare to claim to be the number one in the State of Qin? At least your father's and the Imperial Uncle's Alchemy Dao standards aren't below mine. However, I find it a little strange that Honorable Nephew came to the Drunken Star Manor to seek medical help. With an expert like your father, why didn't you find him, but come to our Drunken Star Manor instead?\"Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"It's a matter of expediency. Firstly, your Drunken Star Manor has always been hailed as number one in the capital. Secondly, it was obviously because this place is nearer.\"As Ye Yuan spoke, he pointed to Liu An who looked like a dead dog, and with a face full of benevolence he said, \"I met this person in excruciating agony on the road. Thinking about how heaven cares for every living thing, I brought him to the Drunken Star Manor to seek medical help. But who would have thought that even after swapping a few physicians, they still couldn't do it. This capital's number one . . .\"Wan Donghai suddenly discovered that he could not gain any advantage from this youth in front of him.Something was wrong. Yesterday, Yuan-er even sent news back saying that he plotted to poison Ye Hang's son to death. So why was this brat alive and kicking here today at the Drunken Star Manor?Needless to say, if Ye Yuan casually found someone to cause trouble, Wan Donghai naturally would not be concerned. But he just had to bring over Liu An. This was indeed too much of a coincidence.Things would be fine if he could cure him. But if he could not, what if this Liu An betrayed the Drunken Star Manor? Liu An's ident.i.ty cannot be known to the public. Apart from fellow alchemists, many demonic beasts hunters were also there. Once Liu An's ident.i.ty was exposed, it would absolutely be a tremendous blow to the Drunken Star Manor.Then again, just what was wrong with Liu An? He was perfectly fine when he left for the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. It was only some internal injuries. Why did he become a dead dog when he returned?With Wan Donghai's attainments in the Alchemy Dao, a single glance and he could tell that Liu An was poisoned. But just what kind of poison could leave so many masters completely helpless, and finally made the shopkeeper invited himself out?At that moment, Wan Donghai thought of everything which had happened and realized it was highly unusual. If this was not handled properly, it might cause a ma.s.sive blow to the Drunken Star Manor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He remained pa.s.sive as the situation was unclear. But he never expected something to happen to Liu An who had concealed himself so well.\"Ma-Manor Lord, sa-save me.\" Liu An groaned and currently was lying feebly on the ground.Liu An's words, as if it triggered Wan Donghai's sensitive nerves, made him frown even harder, almost like an upside down eight. 1\"Yiii? Manor Lord, why do I feel as if this friend over here knows you?\" Ye Yuan acted as if he just realized something's odd.He purposely said these words loudly so that everyone could hear them. Other people naturally felt nothing when they heard him, but these words held a different meaning in Wan Donghai's ears.Wan Donghai felt extreme hatred in his heart, yet he displayed a nonchalant att.i.tude. \"Honorable Nephew, you must be joking. This Wan can be considered to have some fame within the Imperial City. My Drunken Star Manor also saved many demonic beast hunters before. Naturally, it isn't strange for him to recognize me.\"Ye Yuan came to a realization and said, \"So that's the case! But when I brought this friend over here, I've never mentioned that he is a demonic beast hunter. How did Manor Lord Wan manage to tell with one glance? This nephew is impressed by Manor Lord Wan's sharp eyes.\"Initially, the crowd was still unclear about what's going on. But after Ye Yuan's insinuation, everyone suddenly understood what was going on, resulting in an awkward atmosphere.Liu An was only an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artist. It was not odd for him to recognize Wan Donghai, but for Wan Donghai to recognize him as a demonic beast hunter at a glance was definitely something unusual.However, this did not mean Wan Donghai cannot get to know demonic beast hunters. On the contrary, he knew several of them. However, with his status, the demonic beast hunters he knew were all at least Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists and outstanding ones at that. How could Wan Donghai recognize a small fry like Liu An?There was not a wall in this world which did not have a crack. There had always been rumors about the Drunken Star Manor sending people to infiltrate demonic beast hunter teams and killing their companions. It was just that there was never any evidence found. Furthermore, the Drunken Star Manor was extremely powerful and had helped many demonic beast hunters. Hence, these rumors had always remained as just hearsay.Ye Yuan intentionally baited Wan Donghai by purposely creating inconsistencies with what was said. This made it as if Wan Donghai had something to hide, which left the crowd to their imaginations.At this point, Wan Donghai felt as if there were tens of thousands of horses galloping across his heart, yet he was unable to stop Ye Yuan at all. Ye Yuan purposely blew the matter out of proportion so that Wan Donghai would spare the rat to save the dishes, and not take action against him.\"Ha-Hahaha. Honorable Nephew misunderstood the situation. This person looks like he has some abilities, plus he is inflicted with a bizarre poison. Just a single glance and it's clear there is an 80% chance he is a demonic beast hunter,\" Wan Donghai explained with a forced laugh.Ye Yuan's goal had been accomplished, so he did not choose to keep harping on it. Instead, he left the crowd to their own thoughts.\"So that's the case. Manor Lord Wan would have to forgive me. This Nephew, I, was just recently poisoned and nearly lost my life. Hence, the doubt. Maybe I'm overthinking it. After all, those rumors are obviously nonsense. Oh right, we've been chatting for so long we almost forgot to save the patient. Just look at the expression in this friend's eyes. He's practically seeing Manor Lord Wan as his relative. Oops. Wrong. It is his savior.\" Ye Yuan messed around for some time before finally returning to the topic at hand.In any case, it's not like you have to pay with your life for grossing people to death. Ye Yuan naturally did not mind grossing Wan Donghai out a little more; he was also collecting some interest for his predecessor.At this moment, Wan Donghai could not argue even with a hundred mouths; Ye Yuan would not give him the chance to do so either. Wan Donghai frowned as he looked at Liu An on the ground, and then instructed the servants, \"Men, bring this . . . Friend to the back hall. I will diagnose him-\"Wan Donghai was only half-finished before being interrupted by Ye Yuan. \"Manor Lord Wan, can't you see how many friends came today. All of us just want to witness the splendor of Manor Lord Wan's Alchemy Dao. Manor Lord Wan cannot disappoint us! Everyone says that Manor Lord Wan is the best in the capital, yet few had actually seen Manor Lord Wan demonstrate own skills. Hearing is deceiving, seeing is believing. Manor Lord Wan should just display own abilities, so everyone can broaden their horizons, as well as giving us juniors an opportunity to observe. Right, everyone?\"The crowd came to watch a show, and with such a great show starting they naturally would not leave. Instead, they echoed their support.Now that Wan Donghai was riding a tiger, he found it hard to get off. Looking at Ye Yuan, he wished he could hack him to pieces. At any rate, he was a grandmaster cla.s.s figure. Who would have thought he would be cornered to such an extent in front of so many people by a junior?Isn't it just a detoxification procedure? I will detoxify for you to see! Within the State of Qin, what poison was he unable to treat? Not to mention this poison was concocted by a junior like Ye Yuan.Wan Donghai understood Ye Hang quite well. This matter was definitely not instigated by Ye Hang. That fellow always competed openly and with honor. Even if it was to make trouble, he would not send his own son. This was definitely all Ye Yuan's idea.Merely a silkpants. Did he expect he can flip the heavens?Although there was nothing to be proud of with smacking a junior's face, since you already delivered yourself to the door, then isn't it a shame to not smack you?Wan Donghai waved his long sleeve and instructed, \"Since everyone's in such a good mood, I will detoxify this friend in front of everyone. Men, set him down.\"Seeing this, the crowd acted as if they were on stimulants and flocked in at once. They really wanted to see how this super silkpants Ye Yuan, with his wide-spread notoriety, could challenge the Drunken Star Manor's Manor Lord.By this time, even a fool would not believe that Ye Yuan just happened to b.u.mp into Liu An on the streets. This poison was most likely concocted by Ye Yuan himself.As for the person who got poisoned . . . even if it was not like in the rumors, he definitely had a close and intricate relations.h.i.+p with the Drunken Star Manor.Many of those present were professionals. They already found out about what happened in the morning over at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Connecting the dots to the situation happening under their eyes, several brighter folks already guessed Ye Yuan came here to give the Manor Lord a dose of his own medicine.. . . . . .Wan Donghai looked at the half-dead Liu An and could not wait to kill him with a single blow. This incompetent thing not only failed to complete his mission but had also caused so much trouble for him.At this moment, Liu An was already in agonizing pain, occasionally twitching, just like a dead fish.Wan Donghai did not want to smash his own signboard. Hence, there was no choice but to save Liu An.Wan Donghai occasionally lifted Liu An's eyelids, sometimes took his pulse, and at times loosen up Liu An's clothes to inspect his body. Tinkering for almost half the day, his heart gradually sunk to rock bottom; his brows locked even tighter together.He was actually incapable of identifying any clues at all!An Alchemy Grandmaster was actually unable to diagnose what poison the patient was inflicted with. This was completely inconceivable. Were it not for the fact Liu An was like a dead fish right now, Wan Donghai would even suspect that he was collaborating with Ye Yuan to tear down his stage.\"Big Brother, how is it?\" Looking at Wan Donghai's knitted brows, Wan Dongyang had a bad premonition.\"Go, fetch my high-grade Detoxification Pill over,\" Wan Donghai instructed while gritting his teeth together as if he just made a difficult decision.\"What?! That high-grade Detoxification Pill was something you spent a great effort to refine; it's intended for His Majesty. Now you want to use it on him?\" exclaimed Wan Dongyang.\"Just go since I asked you to! What's with all the nonsense?\" Wan Donghai had already lost his patience at this point and became very irritable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not dare to delay and quickly went to retrieve that high-grade Tier 3 Detoxification Pill.Detoxification Pill was a universal type of pill which meant it could treat any poison. But as for its efficacy, it depended on exactly what sort of poison the person was inflicted with.A Detoxification Pill could cure virtually any ordinary poison. Hence, it was the most widely used, as well as being one of the most practical pills.In Ye Yuan's eyes, Detoxification Pill was considered under the low-level category of pills. For this pill, there were several tiers; there were Tier 1 Detoxification Pill, Tier 2 Detoxification Pill, and all the way to Tier 5 Detoxification Pill. As for poisons above Tier 5, a Detoxification Pill was basically useless against them. That was because poisons above Tier 5 were either very unique or extremely rare; Detoxification Pills were ineffective on them.This Detoxification Pill, refined by Wan Donghai, naturally was not an ordinary item within the State of Qin. This high-grade Tier 3 Detoxification Pill was his life's most exceptional work. Not even Ye Hang could refine a Detoxification Pill of this grade.Even though both were Alchemy Grandmasters, they had their own specializations. Ye Yuan knew that his father, Ye Hang, was inferior in terms of dealing with poisons. That was why Ye Hang could only let Ye Yuan consume a low-grade Tier 3 Detoxification Pill while Wan Donghai could take out a high-grade Tier 3 Detoxification Pill.This Detoxification Pill essentially represented the pinnacle standard of this specialization within the State of Qin. Even the Imperial Uncle cannot be compared with Wan Donghai on this aspect.When Wan Dongyang handed the pill over to Wan Donghai, his face twitched violently. To use such a pill on a lackey such as Liu An was a waste of G.o.d's gifts.Wan Donghai received the pill, looked at Ye Yuan, and gave a cold humph . Regardless of the result today, he was already bested by this junior.Yet Ye Yuan just stood there watching Wan Donghai with a nonchalant expression.Wan Donghai rolled his sleeves, and Liu An involuntarily sat up. Following this, Wan Donghai's fingers rapidly jabbed Liu An with extreme speed. The crowd only saw an afterimage of fingers before hearing a series of puffing sounds.Each of Wan Donghai's finger jabs made Liu An groaned in anguish. As the last finger jab landed, Liu An opened his mouth in excruciating pain. Wan Donghai did not hesitate and hastily threw the Detoxification Pill into Liu An's mouth.After Liu An swallowed the pill, Wan Donghai then ceased his actions. Liu An who had lost his balance slumped down once more.Clap . . . Clap . . . Clap . . .At this moment, slow applause echoed. Ye Yuan sighed with a smile. \"I've long heard Manor Lord Wan's Profound Phantom Finger technique is exceedingly wondrous, capable of reviving the dead as well as granting a fate worse than death. Seeing it today truly broadened my horizons. How extraordinary!\"Wan Donghai lightly gasped for air. Clearly, the bout just now was not so easy for him. Hearing the ridicule in Ye Yuan's praise gave him the impulse to want to kill someone.\"Humph! Who cares what poison was it. In front of my Profound Phantom Finger and the Detoxification Pill I refined, he will be as good as new.\"It was not that Wan Donghai was wildly arrogant. But within the State of Qin, he indeed had never encountered any problem he could not resolve.\"That would be for the best. Just look at the state this friend is in. I also hope that he can be safe and sound.\" Ye Yuan then sighed.Ye Yuan sounded very sincere, as if Liu An was an old friend for many years. But to Wan Donghai's ears, it conjured a faint premonition.As if confirming his thoughts, after those words, Liu An suddenly threw up a mouthful of blood.Wan Donghai's face changed color. Supporting Liu An, he asked, \"Are you alright?\"\"Ma-manor Lord, pain . . . argh . . . The pain is killing me!\" Liu An's initially alleviated symptoms had flared up once more. It hurt so much that he rolled off the bed onto the ground.It was clear that Wan Donghai's actions failed to remove the poison from his body but instead stimulated the toxin inside him resulting in tormenting pain.\"Why . . . Why is it like this?\"Wan Donghai was utterly befuddled. Although the display just now did not seem very impressive, it was actually his limits. Who would have guessed that not only Liu An's poison was not cured, it actually became even more intense.Liu An rolled on the floor in agonizing pain, yet n.o.body stepped forward to help him.\"Yiii? Manor Lord Wan, looks like your Profound Phantom Finger and Detoxification Pill failed to have any effect. Instead, it worsened this Friend's condition. Just take a look at that painful appearance; I can't bear to stand it. Don't tell me Manor Lord Wan has no other methods to ease his pain? The Drunken Star Manor is known as the number one in the capital!\" Ye Yuan exclaimed questioningly.Wan Donghai could no longer keep up appearances. Pointing at Ye Yuan, he bellowed, \"Stinky brat! What on earth did you make him eat? Want to frame our Drunken Star Manor? You are still not qualified!\"Ye Yuan deliberately gave a shocked expression and said, \"Why did you say that, Manor Lord Wan? As the saying goes, saving a life is better than building a seven-storied paG.o.da. Are you telling me now that this friend is suffering like this, I have to be indifferent to it? Or is the Drunken Star Manor undeserving of its reputation, unable to even diagnose what this friend is poisoned with?\"You!\" Were it not for his last trace of reason, Wan Donghai would have stomped off instantly.Ye Yuan gave a look of pain while leaning down to say to Liu An, \"This Brother, I've already tried my best. In the capital, if even Manor Lord Wan can't save you, then there is nothing I can do. When you arrive at the Underworld, don't blame me for it.\"Liu An was originally half dead already. But after hearing Ye Yuan's words, it was as if he regained terminal lucidity; his initially dull, lifeless eyes gained a trace of brilliance.\"Ma-Manor Lord! Sa-Save me! I helped you to se-sell . . .\" Enduring the pain, Liu An forced out a few words between the gaps of his teeth.At this point, Liu An only had his instinct for survival stimulated by Ye Yuan, but the second half of his words were like lightning bolt during clear weather to Wan Donghai. Initially, Wan Donghai was filled with wrath towards Ye Yuan. But right now, it was as if he was drenched from head to toe in cold sweat.Without waiting for Liu An to finish speaking, Wan Donghai quickly leaned down and told Liu An, \"Don't worry. I will save you no matter what.\"Wan Donghai's eyes were filled with sincerity, completely different from Ye Yuan's phony sincerity. The feeling it gave Liu An were as if they were life and death comrades.At this moment, that sense of uneasiness stirred up by Ye Yuan got suppressed, and what replaced it was serenity.\"Ma-Manor Lord, h-he . . . said this poison . . . is called Heart Inch Fissure.\"After saying this, Liu An ceased all movements just like a deflated ball.\"Heart Inch Fissure . . . Heart Inch Fissure . . .\" Wan Donghai muttered it over and over while his brows furrowed even harder.The more he repeated it, the more he felt like he had heard that name somewhere before.\"Heart Inch Fissure? HEART INCH FISSURE?! It's actually Heart Inch Fissure?! Th-This! How could a brat like him knows Heart Inch Fissure?\" A trace of astonishment flashed across Wan Donghai's eyes.Wan Donghai finally recalled where he had heard that name before. It was during his early years where his master once mentioned that name!Thinking back on it now, his master had even said that this sort of poison was abnormally tyrannical, practically without any cure. A Heart Inch Fissure Pill was not some high-tier pills. In fact, it was the opposite; it was only merely a high-grade Tier 1 Pill. Yet, his master, a Tier 4 Alchemy King, back then had said it was incurable. It was evident just how terrifying this poison was.How could Ye Yuan possibly refine such a terrifying poison? Unless it was Ye Hang's work?Right now, Wan Donghai could not be bothered to think about it. After being stunned for a while, he knew that no matter what he did, Liu An was beyond saving.Since that was the case, he could only sacrifice Liu An!His own reputation might be important, but if the matter of spies among demonic beast hunters were to be exposed, the impact on the Drunken Star Manor would be even more significant. Liu An's incomplete sentence just now made it clear that if Wan Donghai failed to save him, he would undoubtedly expose the ugly side of the Drunken Star Manor in front of all these people. When that happened, the consequences would be unimaginable.Choosing the lesser of two evils.Wan Donghai took a deep breath and sighed, \"This poison is indeed remarkably overbearing. This Wan is incompetent. I only have one last move left.\"Finis.h.i.+ng, he ordered people to hold up Liu An. Rolling his sleeves, the Profound Phantom Finger was executed once more. Only this time, the commotion was greater than before.Flas.h.i.+ng around Liu An and engulfing him in afterimages, Wan Donghai caused a gale to blow so fiercely that the crowd almost could not keep their eyes open.As Ye Yuan looked at Wan Donghai giving it his all for this performance, a cold sneer appeared on his face. The Profound Phantom Finger might be a martial technique, but it could also be categorized as a technique under the Alchemy Dao. In Ye Yuan's view, it was clumsy. But he had some understanding of this finger technique.This finger technique could save lives while also harming others. Furthermore, the way it harmed people was incredibly vicious. This finger technique was used on the acupuncture points in order to stimulate the body. But right now what Wan Donghai was executing was precisely the malignant version of the technique.However, Ye Yuan did not expose Wan Donghai's intentions. Since he was willing to smash his own signboard, Ye Yuan was naturally amenable to a.s.sist him. Moreover, with Ye Yuan's current strength, it was impossible to take down Wan Donghai. He was currently too weak.Indeed, after Wan Donghai's finger technique ceased, Liu An had immediately stopped breathing and slowly slumped to the ground.\"Manor Lord Wan is indeed remarkable! Displaying a set of finger technique and directly cured someone to death. Impressive! Impressive!\" Ye Yuan exclaimed as he maintained the same smile as before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Nine Yin Divine Link MeridianPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12: Nine Yin Divine Link MeridianTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorAt the Ye Manor.In a room, filled with medicinal fragrance and fog, located at an isolated corner of the manor.\"Young Master, you were so impressive today at the Drunken Star Manor. That Manor Lord Wan who even Old Master couldn't deal with was completely defeated by Young Master,\" Lu-er said while fanning with a cattail leaf fan.An herbal bath for Ye Yuan was prepared in an enormous wooden tub. It sat just on top of the fire that Lu-er was fanning with the cattail leaf fan.Today at the Drunken Star Manor, Wan Donghai treated Liu An to death, stunning everyone. The highly popular Drunken Star Manor had always boasted that it was the number one in the State of Qin. Yet today, an ignorant brat walked up to their door to slap their faces, slapping so hard that it reverberated. No matter how thick Wan Donghai's skin was, he was somewhat unable to maintain his face any further.After Liu An's death, Wan Donghai immediately decided to close shop for a day. Everyone was chased away to temporarily avoid immediate embarra.s.sment.Everyone present knew their stuff. Even though they did not know what poison this Heart Inch Fissure was, they could guess that it was something Ye Yuan concocted. Everyone felt the world changed too quickly. A former rotten mud-like silkpants actually forced a Grandmaster of his era to his wit's end. Many people knew that Ye Yuan was dying of poison just yesterday; could it be that the poisoning actually enlightened him?Of course, there were some who did not believe that it was instigated by Ye Yuan but instead by Ye Hang who had borrowed Ye Yuan's hands to give the Drunken Star Manor a vicious blow. But as they thought about it, it did not make any sense. If Ye Hang had that ability, what was he doing all these years? The compet.i.tion between the two families was not a matter of one or two years.Either way, the arguments bore no fruit. But the subject became the mealtime conversation topic of the common people within the capital. Ye Yuan who was originally already well-known became even more famous now.\"Hahaha. This was just claiming back some interest. Although today's event had a large impact on the Drunken Star Manor, it's not fatal. That Wan Family's father-son pair, sooner or later, I will make them pay the real price.\" Ye Yuan's tone became somewhat cold upon mentioning them.Having inherited this body, Qing Yun Zi naturally had the responsibility to take revenge for his predecessor and help the Ye Family eliminate this compet.i.tor. Furthermore, Ye Yuan already witnessed how sinister and unscrupulous this father-son pair were; he had no favorable impression towards them at all.Only that right now Ye Yuan's current strength was too weak. Apart from vexing Wan Donghai a little, he could not really do anything much to him. In the future when he had sufficient strength, the father-son pair naturally had to be eliminated.If it were up to someone else, this would practically be an impossible mission. But to Ye Yuan, Wan Donghai and his son were merely a stumbling block on his road for vengeance; removing it just required some time.\"That's right. That Wan Yuan is so hateful. In the past, he was always bullying Young Master. Young Master must work hard! I have faith in Young Master!\" Lu-er always had that unconditional faith in Ye Yuan.\"Hahaha. Young Master won't disappoint you. Oh right, Lu-er, I can see that your apt.i.tude is excellent. Why don't you practice martial arts?\"After being occupied for the entire day and finally able to lounge with Lu-er in the same room, he discovered that there was not the slightest essence energy within Lu-er's body, to actually be an ordinary person. Yet Ye Yuan could see that Lu-er had an excellent apt.i.tude; a hundred times better than that loser of a predecessor.Hearing Ye Yuan's question, Lu-er's expression became a bit downcast. \"Old Master said Lu-er has Nine Yin Absolute Meridian and cannot cultivate. Otherwise the higher the realm, the earlier I will die.\"\"Nine Yin Absolute Meridian?\" Ye Yuan repeated once, before grabbing Lu-er's wrist to take her pulse.Having her wrist held by Ye Yuan made Lu-er's heart pound, and her face immediately turned bright red. In her opinion, being unable to cultivate might be regretful, but as long as she can be together with the Young Master, that would be good enough.Ye Hang had long concluded her fate, so she did not hold any hope at all. Ever since experiencing that incident, the Young Master really changed so much, becoming more mature, being concerned about others, and taking care of others.Ye Yuan held Lu-er's wrist; his brows initially locked tightly together, before slowly relaxing.\"En. Old Master and Madam treat Lu-er just like their own daughter. If Lu-er could cultivate, they would have definitely long taught me.\" Lu-er was still that considerate girl, afraid that Ye Yuan would misunderstand Ye Hang because of this.Ye Yuan put down Lu-er's hand and smiled. \"My silly Lu-er, you're overthinking. Of course, Father wouldn't lie to you. But even he has times where he miscalculated. Lu-er, tell Young Master, do you want to learn martial arts?\"\"Of course!\" Lu-er replied without thinking.\"That's good. From tomorrow onwards, you will learn martial arts together with me. I will impart to you a technique. With your talent, this tiny State of Qin can't confine you,\" said Ye Yuan with an encouraging expression.\"Young Master, is what you said true?\" Upon hearing this, Lu-er was overjoyed. But without waiting for Ye Yuan's reply, she quickly became dejected again. \"Young Master, you don't have to comfort me. Old Master is an Alchemy Grandmaster, yet even he said it was hopeless. How could I possibly learn martial arts? Although Lu-er really wants to, Lu-er doesn't want to die yet. Lu-er still wishes to accompany Young Master and take care of Young Master.\"Feeling touched in his heart, Ye Yuan reached out and lifted Lu-er's head and smiled. \"Why would Young Master lie to you? Your body's const.i.tution is indeed special. However, it isn't the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian, but instead the extremely rare Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian. This sort of physique is not only able to cultivate, but even the cultivation speed would also be exceptionally fast. If large sects know about your physique, they would definitely fight to the point of bloodshed to s.n.a.t.c.h you over.\"Ye Hang's knowledge naturally could not be compared to Ye Yuan's. But it was also not that Ye Hang was wrong. In reality, Lu-er indeed possessed the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian, but this Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian actually was a variant of the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian. Furthermore, it was an extremely rare variant.The Nine Yin Absolute Meridian that Ye Yuan knew was completely different from what Ye Hang knew. Having a Nine Yin Absolute Meridian did not mean entirely rejecting all possibilities of cultivating, but instead, it meant this sort of const.i.tution was absolutely unique. Cultivation techniques and resources were extremely scarce in the Lower Realms. With the addition of inadequate information within the Lower Realms, it meant that no one had ever stepped onto the path of cultivation with a Nine Yin Absolute Meridian.Without a matching cultivation technique, the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian was indeed a deadly const.i.tution.Should such a physique appear in the Divine Realm, that person would definitely be fought over by major sects to join them. Coincidentally, a technique suitable for Lu-er to cultivate resides within Ye Yuan's memories. It was the cultivation technique of the Divine Realm's Spirit Snow Divine King. And this Spirit Snow Divine King had the exact same variant, the Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian physique.At this moment, Lu-er opened her eye wide in disbelief. \"Young Master, was what you said is real? You are not lying to me?\"\"Of course not. The Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian is certainly extremely tough to cultivate with. But having a matching technique, the cultivation speed would instead surpa.s.s ordinary people. Later, I will impart to you a set of technique, the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul. With how intelligent Lu-er is, you will definitely be more amazing than Young Master in the future,\" Ye Yuan said gently.After listening to this, Lu-er gave a playful smile. \"Hehehe. Lu-er isn't looking to be more powerful than Young Master. As long as Lu-er can stay beside Young Master, that would be good enough. In the past, Young Master was always bullied by other people. That's why Lu-er really wanted to learn martial arts to protect Young Master. However, I was afraid I would pa.s.s away after learning martial arts, that's why I never learned any.\"Upon learning how Lu-er's purpose of wanting to learn martial arts was actually for himself, Ye Yuan was truly at a loss for words. Ye Yuan told himself he must definitely become strong quickly. In his previous life, he could not protect the people closest to him. In this life now, he would absolutely not let his loved ones be harmed again.\"My obedient Lu-er. Alright, the water is almost ready. You go out, Young Master wants to take an herbal bath,\" said Ye Yuan.Lu-er asked with a face full of doubt, \"Young Master, just go ahead and take a bath. Lu-er still has to tend the fire here. In the past, it had always been Lu-er attending to Young Master's bath. Why did you become shy about it today?\"Sweating heavily in his heart, Ye Yuan was really not used to letting a young girl attending to him while taking a bath. But he also knew that if inconsistencies appeared now, Lu-er might start to suspect him.\"Then . . . alright . . .\" Ye Yuan was feeling helpless.Hearing this, Lu-er was overjoyed and went to help Ye Yuan undress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: A Father and Son TalkPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: A Father and Son TalkTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorEntering the herbal bath, Ye Yuan who was feeling embarra.s.sed tried to reorganized his feelings and then circulated essence energy to begin absorbing the medicinal efficacy of the water in order to purge the residual toxins left within his body.The medicinal herbs used for the herbal bath were all common Tier 1 and Tier 2 ingredients without any remarkable effects. But Ye Yuan was able to make good use of these lowly materials, extracting out the medicinal efficacy from these herbs to the utmost limit.To most people, the higher the level of the medicinal herbs, the more valuable and more significant the effects were. But in reality, that viewpoint was not worth a sh*t in Ye Yuan's eyes. Regardless whether it was cultivation or alchemy, foundation skills were the most vital. The stronger your foundation was, the higher you would go in the future; likewise, vice versa.In his previous life, Qingyun Zi once spent over 10 years to bitterly study medicinal herbs and pills that were Tier 3 and below. Those years were not in vain, as his foundation skills in Alchemy Dao became terrifyingly extensive. For him to become the youngest Alchemy Emperor, that over 10 years period were absolutely critical.In the Divine Realm, virtually no one could surpa.s.s him in terms of understanding medicinal properties. That was also the reason why he was hailed as the one from the younger generation most likely to become an Alchemy G.o.d.Actually, even if Ye Yuan had the intention of using some high-tier ingredients, at this moment, he was powerless to do so because his current strength was too weak!Otherwise, Ye Yuan would not have taken only a single Tier 1 pill to challenge the Drunken Star Manor; that was the limit he could refine. Although he reckoned Wan Donghai was not able to resolve the Heart Inch Fissure poison, it was somewhat risky after all. If Wan Donghai really had a way to cure the poison, then it would be as if Ye Yuan had lifted a stone to smash his own feet.In fact, Wan Donghai had actually heard of the Heart Inch Fissure poison before. Except that this sort of pill was too obscure, he had merely heard of it. Otherwise, the outcome of the incident would be hard to tell.Strength!Ye Yuan gave a deep sigh as he finished absorbing the medicinal efficacy of the herbal bath in the wooden tub. Right now he urgently needed to raise his strength. Without strength, revenge and whatnot were all empty talks. He would not even be able to protect his loved ones.With Ye Yuan's current condition, there was no need to mention Wan Donghai; even if Wan Yuan had come, Ye Yuan would still not be his match.Ye Yuan believed that after today's incident, Wan Donghai would definitely view him as a thorn in his eyes. He would want to eliminate Ye Yuan as soon as possible. Furthermore, with Wan Donghai's temperament, he would not be resigned to letting the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion continue to suppress him, and he would consider all means to counterattack.At that time, if he did not have sufficient strength, today's action would instead put greater pressure on his father.\"Young Master, Old Master has already waited outside for quite some time.\"While Ye Yuan was engrossed in his imagination, Lu-er came in to report.\"Why didn't you say earlier that Father came? It's just an herbal bath and not a closed-door life-and-death seclusion.\"If Ye Yuan guessed correctly, Father came to warn him to be on the lookout for Wan Donghai's schemes. Ye Yuan was still very respectful towards this overprotective father.Even though it had only been two short days since he transmigrated, without a doubt, Ye Hang, Ren Hong Ling, and Lu-er already became Ye Yuan's fetters.Lu-er pouted her mouth and said with resentment, \"I wanted to come in and call for Young Master, but Old Master pulled me and didn't allow me to enter. What could I have done then?\"Sweating profusely, Ye Yuan quickly said, \"Good Lu-er, Young Master was in the wrong. Young Master apologizes to you, don't be angry alright?\"Hearing that, Lu-er broke into a smile, \"Lu-er isn't angry. Lu-er knows Young Master loves and respects Old Master. I treat him just like my biological father and respect him deeply like you do, so why would I be angry?\"Ye Yuan was relieved hearing her reply. \"Hahaha. Then it's alright. Go outside and tell Father to wait a moment, I will be out after wearing my clothes.\"Lu-er acknowledged his words and went out.. . . . . .Inside Ye Hang's study room, the father-son pair sat down closely and started to talk.\"Yuan-er, what you did today really vented my frustrations. I reckon Wan Donghai that old punk is probably thoroughly livid at the moment, right? Hahaha! It's been so many years, and yet it's the first time I've seen that old punk had to swallow such a grievance. How great!\" Ye Hang laughed out loud.Clearly, Wan Donghai bullied him rather harshly these past few years with how Ye Hang was laughing so cheerfully. Although Ye Hang could stand it, he had never felt this frustration being vented out like today. Even though he was not the one who went up to smack Wan Donghai's face, what was the difference between being smacked by his son and him?Seeing his father laughed merrily, Ye Yuan felt pleased. \"Father, it was all thanks to what Master imparted to me in my dreams that I could make Wan Donghai that old punk suffered this grievance. I dare not claim any credit.\"Ye Hang waved his hands dismissing Ye Yuan's words. \"No need to be so polite with your father. I'm thrilled that you possess your abilities today. But I still have to remind you once again; Wan Donghai that old punk is very insidious. Having suffered such a loss today, he wouldn't be able to take it lying down. Who knows if he will come up with some underhanded measures? I can still guarantee your safety at home, but once you go to the Dan Wu Academy, Father's hands wouldn't be able to stretch that far. Yuan-er, how about you don't attend the Dan Wu Academy anymore, and just stay at home?\"Ye Yuan sighed in his heart. No wonder his predecessor was a good-for-nothing youth. Ye Hang's overprotectiveness of his child was too extreme. Ye Yuan had no intention of becoming a caged canary; the Dan Wu Academy was a place he had to go to.\"Father, I have to return to the Dan Wu Academy. Even if I stay at home, it is impossible to never leave home. I can hide for a while, but I can't hide for a lifetime. Furthermore, if I stay at home and never leave, this life would be wasted. Even if Master teaches me skills, without contending with rivals and getting affirmation, I will never become an expert. Don't you agree?\"In Ye Yuan's eyes, Wan Donghai could not even be considered as an opponent. If he could not even make it pa.s.s Wan Donghai, this hurdle, how would he slaughter his way back to the Divine Realm? Only by attending the Dan Wu Academy and competing with other geniuses of his generation that Ye Yuan can grow up faster. Moreover, having a high cultivation realm did not mean combat prowess will also be high. In the cultivation world, there are too many examples of the weak defeating the strong; flowers in a greenhouse would never be fully mature.In his previous life, Qingyun Zi was a greenhouse flower. Although his cultivation realm was very high, his combat abilities were a complete mess; all because he experienced too few actual fights. In this life, being burdened with a blood feud, he naturally had to become ruthless with his own training.\"This . . . Yuan-er does make sense. It is Father who was too protective. It's just that you have to be careful outside there no matter what. If you encounter any problems, don't be stubborn. Remember to come back and ask Father for a.s.sistance. Something like being poisoned to death, Father just doesn't want to witness it for the second time.\"\"Relax Father. Since I didn't die in this disaster, in the future, no one will be able to bully me anymore.\" Ye Yuan unveiled a powerful self-confidence at this point. Ye Hang discovered that his son had really matured.\"Good! My good son! Since when have the two of us feared anyone? Isn't it just Wan Donghai? In the future, Father will definitely have him under these feet.\" Influenced by Ye Yuan, Ye Hang felt his confidence swelled as well.Ye Yuan laughed silently in his heart. He was well aware of his father's standards. There might come a day where he could surpa.s.s Wan Donghai, but there would be no way he could trample him under his feet. Of course, that was under the circ.u.mstance that Ye Yuan did not appear.With the current Ye Yuan, time was all it takes for Ye Hang to trample Wan Donghai underfoot.Just as Ye Yuan was about to leave, Ye Hang stopped him. Asking with a curious face, \" Oh right. What pill did you let that person eat today? To think it was so powerful. You are just at the First Level Essence Qi Realm. How did you manage to refine such a high-tier pill?\"Ye Yuan discovered that Ye Hang was also an alchemy fanatic. Upon encountering any alchemy problems, he would become extremely studious. Evidently, this question had troubled him the entire day.In his opinion, a poison pill that could render Wan Donghai helpless definitely had to be Tier 3 and above. But Ye Yuan was clearly just at First Level Essence Qi Realm. It was impossible to refine a Tier 2 pill with this cultivation realm, not to mention Tier 3 and above.Even if Ye Hang pulled his hair out over this paradox, he still could not understand why. Now that he finished the heart-to-heart talk with his son, he could not bear it any longer and shamelessly asked.Towards his own father, Ye Yuan naturally did not hide anything. Beaming, he said, \"Father, that pill is called Heart Inch Fissure. It's not a high tier pill, but merely a Tier 1 pill. With my current standards, refining this pill is already at the limit.\"Ye Hang's smile froze on his face. A Tier 1 pill? How is that possible?!If these words did not come out from his son's mouth, Ye Hang would not believe it even if the person beat him to death.\"Ti-tier 1 pill?\" Ye Hang swallowed hard and asked disbelievingly, \"How could a Tier 1 pill be this amazing?\"Ye Yuan took out a brush and paper and wrote down the pill formula for Heart Inch Fissure; he also included the refining method as well as things to take note of and then pa.s.sed it to Ye Hang.Ye Hang carefully received the pill formula, treating it just like a treasure.Ye Yuan knew he probably would not see his father for a few days . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Explosive Yuan PillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14: Explosive Yuan PillTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThe next day, Ye Yuan went to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion again.Ye Yuan could distinctly feel a difference in the way the employees looked at him. After yesterday's event, everybody now looked at this super silkpants with admiration.Having enjoyed these looks too often in his past life, Ye Yuan naturally would not mind it too much. Today, he only came to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to collect medicinal herbs. Right now, Ye Yuan desperately needed to raise his strength, and the fastest way to increase his strength was undoubtedly by taking pills as a stimulant.Putting aside the ability of an Alchemy Emperor and not utilizing it, would that not make Ye Yuan a fool?There were countless pill formulas inside Ye Yuan's mind, but the medicinal pills he could refine at the moment were too few. He was only able to refine Tier 1 medicinal pills, and that was only by using his powerful soul as support. Otherwise, with his First Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation, he would not even be able to refine out medicinal dregs.Using an entire night to search for Tier 1 medicinal pills in his memories, Ye Yuan still felt that among all the pills, a type of high-grade Tier 1 pill called Explosive Yuan Pill was the most suitable for him.Explosive Yuan Pill, as the name suggested, was a medicinal pill that explosively increased essence energy.Tier 1 pills which could increase essence energy to aid cultivation and currently was circulating in the market was the Essence Qi Pill. It was suitable for Essence Qi Realm martial artists. However, ordinary martial artists could not even consume medicinal pills of such quality; instead, increasing their strength by going through great pains to bitterly cultivate essence energy by themselves.A single Essence Qi Pill could save a martial artist several months of intense cultivation. If one could use Essence Qi Pill to cultivate, then reaching the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm was only a matter of time. However, people who could expend Essence Qi Pills in such a manner were as rare as Phoenix feathers and Qilin horns. Only the Imperial Family and the descendants of major n.o.ble families could afford to do so.Ye Yuan naturally could afford it. But to him, Essence Qi Pill was too weak, completely unable to achieve the effect he desired.Although an Essence Qi Pill was good, the effects would be severely reduced from overconsumption. His predecessor actually ate a lot of Essence Qi Pills, but he did not refine the medicinal effects of the Essence Qi Pills entirely at all, leading to a considerable amount of essence energy dissipated from his body. As a result, Essence Qi Pill already did not have much of an effect on Ye Yuan.But the Explosive Yuan Pill was an upgraded version of the Essence Qi Pill, with several times the medicinal effects of the latter. It was naturally the most appropriate choice for Ye Yuan to use in order to raise his strength. Of course, Ye Yuan had even more amazing pill formulas. It was just those pill formulas were either too high-tier or their medicinal effects were too powerful, making it unsuitable for the current Ye Yuan. Refining those pills after Ye Yuan's strength improved would only be a matter of course.\"Young Master, are you also here today to get medicines?\"The shopkeeper saw Ye Yuan walking in and immediately greeted him with a smile as if he were a different person than he was yesterday.Ye Yuan did not point it out but simply replied with a smile, \"Yes. These are the medicinal herbs I require. Help me prepare three sets of each medicinal herb.\"Ye Yuan handed the shopkeeper a prescription list as he spoke. Written on it were the names of medicinal herbs that the Explosive Yuan Pill requires. Even though Explosive Yuan Pill was much more precious than Essence Qi Pill, the herbs used were only Tier 1 medicinal herbs and were available for purchase at any ordinary shop. As the largest medicinal herb business within the capital, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion naturally had the goods.The shopkeeper swept a look over Ye Yuan's prescription and started to frown. Ye Yuan asked curiously, \"Why? Anything wrong?\"\"Young Master, the medicinal herbs listed on this prescription, everything is fine, except for this Six Leaf Gra.s.s . . .\"The shopkeeper revealed a difficult expression.Upon hearing this, Ye Yuan was even more surprised. \"According to what I know, even though this Six Leaf Gra.s.s is a little rare, it is still a commonly seen medicinal herb. It can't be that our Fragrant Medicine Pavilion is unable to produce three portions of it?\"The shopkeeper gave a bitter laugh and said, \"Young Master, of course, we have Six Leaf Gra.s.s. But we normally wouldn't stock up too much of such medicinal herbs, with precisely just three portions all inside the storeroom. Unfortunately, all three portions of Six Leaf Gra.s.s were reserved by someone yesterday, with the deposit already paid.\"At this point, the shopkeeper snuck a look to a.s.sess Ye Yuan, terrified that the latter would fly into a rage. This little ancestor was not someone that can be easily dealt with. If he were dissatisfied, he might just raise such a fearful din which can cause fowls and dogs having no peace. Ye Yuan's performance yesterday was very eye-catching; rivers and mountains might change, but it was hard to alter a man's nature. G.o.d knows if he might lose his temper because of this.Seeing Ye Yuan remained unperturbed, the shopkeeper finally relaxed, thinking to himself could this little ancestor really have changed his personality?\"Who reserved the medicine?\"\"A youth about the same age as Young Master. Furthermore, he needed it very urgently,\" the shopkeeper replied with trepidation.Nodding his head, Ye Yuan said, \"What time did he say he will come to collect the medicine? I wish to have a chat with him.\"Hearing this, the shopkeeper jumped in fright thinking that Ye Yuan wanted to force people to cancel the reservation. Once something like this was done, it would be extremely detrimental to the reputation of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.Seeing through his concerns, Ye Yuan a.s.sured him and said, \"Relax, I won't mess around.\"The shopkeeper right now could not tell if this little ancestor really changed his personality or not, but seeing that Ye Yuan had no intention of leaving, it looks like he was h.e.l.l-bent on getting those three stalks of Six Leaf Gra.s.s.\"He said he will come to collect it early in the morning. With how anxious he was, most likely he's about to arrive?\" Feeling helpless, the shopkeeper could only tell the truth.\"Alright. Then I will wait for him here.\" Ye Yuan found a place to sit down quietly, closing his eyes to meditate while ignoring the perturbed shopkeeper.The shopkeeper gave a sigh and just let Ye Yuan be, praying that this little ancestor would not cause any trouble. It was not that he was worried about Ye Yuan, but it was just that in the past Ye Yuan had left way too strong of an impression on everyone.After about the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Ye Yuan who had his eyes closed suddenly heard an urgent-sounding voice.\"Shopkeeper, I'm here to collect the Six Leaf Gra.s.s I reserved yesterday.\"\"This . . .\" The shopkeeper once again revealed a difficult expression.The person was a youth around the age of 15 or 16 years old. Upon seeing the shopkeeper's expressions, he exclaimed anxiously, \"Shopkeeper, we agreed on it yesterday, and you even took the deposit. You can't go back on your words!\"\"We naturally wouldn't go back on our words after collecting a deposit. It's just that I wanted to ask this brother, what's your purpose for buying this Six Leaf Gra.s.s?\"The one who spoke was naturally Ye Yuan.Turning his head around only to see a youth around the same age as him, dressed in silk clothing, he naturally did not have a good reaction. \"What does it have to do with you?\"The shopkeeper jumped in fright. To dare to provoke this little ancestor, is this youth tired of living? Just as he was about to speak up, he was stopped by the expression in Ye Yuan's eyes.Beaming, Ye Yuan said, \"Of course it's none of my business. I was just curious why did you buy medicinal herbs instead of a finished product. Could it be that you wanted to refine them yourself? There are three types of Tier 1 pills which require the Six Leaf Gra.s.s to refine, so let me make a guess. The first one is the Heavenly Spiritual Pill, a pill meant for impacting through the Spirit Condensation Realm. You are only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, so it's most likely not this sort of pill. The second type is the Pure Heart Pill, a pill used to maintain clarity of the mind and to chase away Heart Demons. It is suitable for use when a.s.saulting bottlenecks. Looking at how you're not at a bottleneck, it's most likely not this pill. There's still one more type called the Great Returning Pill, a sacred Tier 1 healing medicine. Looking at how anxious you are, could it be that a loved one was badly injured, and this person requires this particular pill to save his life?\"The youth's jaw dropped, looking at Ye Yuan with shock. He was shocked by Ye Yuan's profound medicinal knowledge but even more astonished by Ye Yuan's torch-like eyes.Ye Yuan's a.n.a.lysis was as if he saw it with his own eyes, and the truth was precisely what Ye Yuan had said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But the difference was that Ye Yuan got in through connections, while Tang Yu relied on his own abilities to get into the Dan Wu Academy.In reality, the majority of the geniuses at the Dan Wu Academy were from n.o.ble families. Only a very small number of these geniuses came from ordinary backgrounds. n.o.ble families had the advantage in terms of resources which the ma.s.ses did not; a disparity that no amount of hard work could change. Geniuses with ordinary backgrounds already lost from the starting line.Techniques, medicinal pills, and money. The n.o.bility possessed the advantages that commoners could never attain even if they worked hard their entire lives. That was the advantage acc.u.mulated after generations.Tang Yu being able to enter the Dan Wu Academy as a commoner said a lot by itself. Being at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm at his age was not considered outstanding, but he indeed was not mediocre.From the Third Level to the Fourth Level, there was quite a hurdle. Being able to cross that hurdle without depending on piles of resources showed that Tang Yu was very talented in the Martial Path.Naturally, there was no lack of personal hard work on Tang Yu's part to have the strength he possessed today, as well as having entered the Dan Wu Academy. However, his father's support was not to be overlooked.Tang Yu's father was called Tang Zonghuai, an experienced demonic beast hunter. These few years, Tang Zonghuai braved untold dangers in the Endless Forest. All for the sake of a better future for his son.But eventually, a person would encounter ghosts if he walked around too often at night. This time around, Tang Zonghuai encountered a mighty demonic beast in the Endless Forest. Despite having narrowly escaped death, he suffered grievous injuries.Tang Yu was a sensible child. He saw with his own eyes the countless injuries that his father suffered all these years. Hence, as he pursued Martial Dao, he also aspired to become an alchemist all so he could help to treat his father's injuries whenever necessary. If it was not for the time wasted on the Alchemy Path, it was possible Tang Yu's accomplishments would be far beyond what it was today.However, being an alchemist was a profession which burned a lot of money; something that Tang Yu frankly could not support. Before entering the Dan Wu Academy, he had spent a considerable amount of time to understand theoretical knowledge, but his practical experience was nearly zero. Only after entering the Dan Wu Academy did he really have the chance to practice refining pills.Even so, what he learned was very shallow.In order to support Tang Yu to learn martial arts these past few years, Tang Zonghuai already depleted the household's savings. This meant that Tang Yu could no longer afford the cost of a completed Tier 1 medicinal pill anymore. But Tang Yu could not just watch his father die in front of him like this, so he decided to take the final plunge and attempt to refine a Great Returning Pill.Tang Yu had never spoken to outsiders about his family's matters before, yet he spilled out everything in front of Ye Yuan. Furthermore, this youth in front of him looked to be around the same age as him, yet his accomplishments in the Alchemy Path were way above his. If this person was willing to help him refine the Great Returning Pill . . .Thinking up to this point, Tang Yu put aside his initially indifferent att.i.tude, cupped his hands toward Ye Yuan, and he said sincerely, \"This Brother, I was being apprehensive. If I'd offended you just now with my words, I apologize for that.\"Ye Yuan knew his words took effect, so he smiled and waved his hands. \"Since it's for saving a life, you don't have to be courteous, Brother.\"Briefly hesitating, Tang Yu asked, \"Judging from the way you talked, could it be that you also have an interest in this Six Leaf Gra.s.s?\"Tang Yu was an intelligent man. From the words just now, he already guessed that Ye Yuan seemed to have an interest on this Six Leaf Gra.s.s which was why his tone initially was rude.Ye Yuan did not hide this and said with a smile, \"That's right. I have great use for these three stalks of Six Leaf Gra.s.s. But I also know that you, Brother, need it to save someone. I don't know if you trust me enough to bring me to see the patient, but perhaps I could be of some a.s.sistance?\"If Ye Yuan said this right away after they met, Tang Yu would naturally have snorted in derision. However, Ye Yuan's words just now truly stunned him, letting him know their differences in skill. He could not help but to reconsider it.In reality, Tang Yu did not have much a.s.surance about Tang Zonghuai's injuries and was even less sure about refining the Great Returning Pill. Hene, the reason why he bought all three stalks of Six Leaf Gra.s.s in preparation for failure.Father's injuries cannot be delayed any longer. Tang Yu hesitated for a moment and then made a firm decision. Cupping his hands toward Ye Yuan, he said, \"Then I will have to trouble you. How do I address you, Brother?\"\"My humble surname, Ye, with a single character given name, Yuan,\" Ye Yuan answered directly without hiding anything.\"Ye Yuan?\" Tang Yu ruminated on this name, thinking it was somewhat familiar and wondering where he had heard it before.When the shopkeeper standing by the side heard how the young master talked to the youth, he could not help but developed a better impression of Ye Yuan. However, when Ye Yuan reported his name, the shopkeeper shouted in his mind, ' Not good! 'The name Ye Yuan was too thunderous within the capital.As expected, Tang Yu thought for a moment before connecting it to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, and he came to a sudden realization where he heard that name before.\"You . . . You were at the last place in the ranking at the Dan Wu Academy, the one who was always first at the bottom in every subject? That super silkpants Ye Yuan?\" Tang Yu blurted out.Ye Yuan secretly sighed. He did not know if his predecessor lived a successful life or a failed one; to have made such a name for himself.\"That's right. I'm that Ye Yuan. But you shouldn't reject me in such a hurry first. If I'm guessing correctly, you have no confidence in refining the Great Returning Pill yourself. Am I right?\"That . . .\" Ye Yuan's words sent a chill down Tang Yu's spine.\"How about this? Bring me over to have a look first. If I can't resolve the issue, I will let my father personally take action and help you to refine a Great Returning Pill. How about that?\" Ye Yuan offered, striking the iron while it was hot.The instant Ye Yuan brought up his father, Tang Yu's eyes lit up immediately. If Ye Hang would really take action personally, then his father's injuries would definitely be under control.\"Is this true?\"\"Of course, it's true. If you don't believe me, we can write a contract.\"Tang Yu felt that it was not very nice to be this untrusting of others, but with his father's life at stake, he honestly could not care that much any longer. Furthermore, with Ye Yuan's distinguished reputation, he really did not dare take the risk. If his father could be saved, then he would apologize to Young Master Ye then.Having made his decision, Tang Yu cupped his hands and said, \"Then I will have to trouble Young Master Ye.\"Waving his hands, Ye Yuan said lightly, \"You're welcome. Shopkeeper, help me draft a contract.\"The shopkeeper naturally did not dare to delay; he quickly took a brush and a paper to draft out the contract. Only when Ye Yuan signed his name on it did Tang Yu finally relaxed.Looking at the back view of the two who were already far away, the shopkeeper felt what happened was somewhat unreal. He knew better than anyone that in the past, Ye Yuan would definitely not be this easy to talk to; unless he really did mature after surviving a calamity.. . . . . .Every inch of land in the capital was like an inch of gold. Even though demonic beast hunters generally had much higher income than the average person, Tang Zonghuai still could not afford an excessively large house; let alone supporting his son to practice martial arts.This was a very ordinary house for commoners which looked gloomy inside. The moment Ye Yuan stepped inside the house, a wave of medicinal smell wafted out.\"Tranquil Heart Lotus, Red Pine Nuts, Golden Flower Fruit . . . All of these medicinal herbs are meant for entry-level medicinal pills. It looks like Brother Tang is still practicing refining Tier 1 pills. It's just that this Great Returning Pill is a high-grade Tier 1. With Brother Tang's current standards, I'm afraid even if you used all three stalks of Six Leaf Gra.s.s, you wouldn't be able to refine it, right?\" Ye Yuan was not the slightest bit courteous with his words; drawing blood with a single p.r.i.c.k, he exposed Tang Yu's standards.Tang Yu could not even imagine how great Ye Yuan's skill was. Relying on his nose and sniffing just once, Ye Yuan managed to completely determine Tang Yu's ability. Although they were around the same age, in front of Ye Yuan, Tang Yu felt as if he was just like a child stumbling while learning how to walk.Ye Yuan also intentionally revealed some abilities so that Tang Yu would not look down on him. He did not have any choice since his predecessor was such a piece of work. He had no alternative but to show off a little.Being talked to in such a way by Ye Yuan did not anger Tang Yu, but instead, it startled him. They just stepped into the entrance, but the medicinal herbs were placed deep within the house. Ye Yuan could not possibly see them, yet he could rely purely on his nose to discern the medicinal herbs without missing a single one. What kind of comprehension in Alchemy Dao was needed to do that? Most likely even the instructors in the academy did not have such abilities . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tang Yu carelessly believed the rumors and as a result, affronted Brother Ye. I am ashamed.\" With just Ye Yuan's words, Tang Yu realized this person definitely had an undeserved reputation, and he quickly apologized.Ye Yuan silently praised him. This Tang Yu came from a poor background, yet he was frank and forthright; a friend worth making.On the way here, Tang Yu recounted about his household. Only then did Ye Yuan know this Tang Yu was actually a student from the Dan Wu Academy. No wonder Tang Yu knew he was at the last place in the ranking.With a smile, Ye Yuan said, \"No need for that, Brother Tang. My previous reputation was indeed horrendous, so Brother Tang can't be blamed. As for my attainments in the Alchemy Path, it isn't really that high. It's just that when I was young, my father forced me to learn some of these medicinal herbs, so I ended up recognizing a few of them.\"At this point, Tang Yu no longer dared to underestimate Ye Yuan. He quickly said, \"Brother Ye is too humble. Please, come in.\"As Tang Yu led Ye Yuan into the house, a series of faint and weak coughing sound came from someone lying on a bed. Needless to say, the person was Tang Yu's father, Tang Zonghuai.\"Yu-er . . . cough . . . Are you . . . cough . . . back?\" Tang Zonghuai's condition did not seem to be very optimistic; coughing so severely just by saying something, and even struggling just to sit up straight.Tang Yu looked at this scene and quickly went up to support Tang Zonghuai. \"Father, I already told you not to move about.\"\"Hahaha . . . cough . . . This time around . . . cough . . . Father probably isn't going to make it. In the . . . In the future, you have to . . . cough . . . take good care of yourself.\" Clearly, Tang Zonghuai already harbored the intention to die.Tang Yu's tears immediately spilled out, and he said with a choking voice, \"Father, don't speak anymore. I . . . I will definitely cure you! I already brought back the Six Leaf Gra.s.s. I will go and refine the Great Returning Pill right away.\"Tang Yu was about to get up when he was grabbed by Tang Zonghuai. \"No . . . No need . . . cough . . . It is useless.\"It was not that the Great Returning Pill was actually useless, but rather, Tang Zonghuai knew that it was not possible for his son to refine the Great Returning Pill. Instead of wasting the medicinal herbs, he might as well leave it for his son.\"Cough cough . . . Yu-er, to . . . cough . . . to think there's a guest. Why . . . Why didn't you invite him in to have a seat?\" Only now did Tang Zonghuai notice someone else was standing at the entrance of the room.Upon mentioning Ye Yuan, Tang Yu immediately perked up and turned to Ye Yuan. \"Brother Ye, I beg of you. Please save my father! As long as you can cure him, I would be willing to slog like a horse for you throughout my lifetime.\"Even though Tang Yu's background was not that good, it was clear that he was a person with an air of pride. To be able to say such words showed how deep the relations.h.i.+p between the father and son pair was.Judging others by oneself, even the most delicate string lying within the deepest parts of Ye Yuan's heart was strummed.\"You and I can be considered to have hit it off as brothers. Why did you have to say something like toiling for me akin to a horse? Quickly, let Uncle lie down, I will do a diagnosis.\" Tang Yu made s.p.a.ce for Ye Yuan who did not bother with courteousness and sat directly on the bed.Right when Ye Yuan was about to grab Tang Zonghuai's wrists, who knew the latter would pull away. \"No need for it . . . This Little Brother . . . Thank you.\"\"Father!\" Seeing his father like this immediately made Tang Yu anxious.Ye Yuan knew that Tang Zonghuai wanted to avoid causing trouble for his son. Hence, he was bent on dying. Of course, a part of the reason was that Ye Yuan was too young; he did not believe Ye Yuan can do anything.Ye Yuan did not get angry. Signaling with his hands to stop Tang Yu, he asked, \"Uncle, if I didn't guess it wrong, you were injured by a Giant Wind Rhinoceros right?Hearing that, Tang Yu instantly became agitated. \"What a great judgment, Brother Ye, to have guessed it at a glance.\"Tang Zonghuai remained unmoved. Coughing several times, he said disjointedly, \"It's . . . Yu-er who . . . told you right? Don't . . . bother.\"\"Father, I really did not tell Brother Ye. He figured it out on his own.\" Looking at how his father was bent on dying, Tang Yu's heart was torn with anxiety.Looking at this situation, Ye Yuan started frowning. To treat a person, firstly, he had to address the patient's heart. Tang Zonghuai himself did not want to live anymore. Even if he let Tang Zonghuai ate a miraculous panacea, it might not be able to save him.With Ye Yuan's eyesight, he could indeed see that Tang Zonghuai was heavily injured, and most likely he would not outlive the night to see the next day. If things continued delaying like this, then even if he became an Alchemy Emperor once more, he would not be able to save Tang Zonghuai. Even his current condition was not something that a Great Returning Pill could treat.Ye Yuan decided to give a dose of fierce medicine. \"Forget it, Brother Tang. What's the point of saving such a heartless person? Since he wants to die, then let him die.\"Tang Yu could not catch on of Ye Yuan's real intention. But seeing Ye Yuan demeaned his father like that, he suddenly was in a rage. \"Ye Yuan, what are you saying? My father got injured all because for my sake. How can you called him a heartless person?\"\"Cough . . . Such an immature . . . goading technique . . . is useless.\" Tang Yu might not be able to realize it, but how could an experienced old man like Tang Zonghuai not tell.Ye Yuan naturally did not think that it would succeed so easily. With a cold smile, he then said, \"Is that so? Then just treat it as a goading technique. In the future when Brother Tang dies on the streets and goes to the Underworld to blame you, let's see how you respond then.\"A ripple finally appeared in Tang Zonghuai's placid emotions. Turning around, he said, \"What do you mean by that?\"\"Didn't you said it's a goading technique? Why bother asking so much then? I was taking into account of Brother Tang's filial piety, that's why I agreed to save you. But to think that his filial piety wasn't appreciated at all. It's fine to not save you then. Farewell.\" After saying this, Ye Yuan then just turned around and walked away.\"Hold on!\" Tang Zonghuai and Tang Yu called out in unison.\"Is there anything else, Uncle?\" Ye Yuan ignored Tang Yu and asked Tang Zonghuai coldly.\"I would like to know . . . what did Little Brother . . . meant by . . . what you said just now.\" Saying how Tang Yu would die on the streets really triggered him.\"You are just someone who's about to die, what's the point of knowing so much? To not even care about your own son's life and death, only caring about your own death; if you aren't heartless, then what are you?\" Ye Yuan smiled coldly.\"As . . . As long as . . . this Little Brother clarifies things . . . I . . . I'm willing to be treated.\" Seemingly speaking too much, Tang Zonghuai's coughing became even more intense.Yet Ye Yuan maintained that look of disdain. Smiling coldly, he said, \"Do you think that after Tang Yu enters the Dan Wu Academy, his future would be boundless?\"\"Isn't . . . isn't that the case?\" Tang Zonghuai asked doubtfully.\"Of course not! The Dan Wu Academy is not the holy land you imagined; on the contrary, it's an abnormally cruel place. Of course, I believe Brother Tang has never mentioned this to you before, am I right?\" Ye Yuan questioned him while looking towards Tang Yu.Tang Yu revealed an embarra.s.sed expression, yet he still nodded his head, which was considered tacitly agreeing. Tang Zonghuai was quite familiar with his own son, so he naturally knew that he was not lying; his heart could not help but tighten.Ye Yuan continued saying, \"The Dan Wu Academy is indeed a place where geniuses congregate, but it's also where the compet.i.tion is the most intense; possibly it is even crueler than the outside world! The birth of a genius often requires stepping on the bones of other geniuses. Although Brother Tang's talent isn't bad, it isn't exceedingly good. Furthermore, he is just a commoner. Without the support of ma.s.sive resources, he is destined to be the stepping stone for other people. In the future when he's eliminated, even if he survived, he can at most make a living by becoming a demonic beast hunter. There are no small numbers of people like that within the Dan Wu Academy. How many demonic beast hunters do you think could possibly lead a safe and secure life?\"As a demonic beast hunter himself, Tang Zonghuai naturally understood the circ.u.mstances of demonic beast hunters. Thinking of how his own son would possibly follow in his footsteps, Tang Zonghuai felt like even if he died, he would not have died peacefully.\"Li-Little Brother, just now . . . cough . . . was my fault. Can I trouble . . . you to treat my injuries? I . . . I'm willing to . . . pay any price.\" Initially, Tang Zonghuai was not willing to cause any trouble for his son. However, after discovering that his son might get into even more trouble after he pa.s.sed away, this meant that no matter what, he cannot die.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now that Ye Yuan displayed a standard in the alchemy path that was way above his, he naturally entrusted all of his hopes on Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan furrowed his brows, making Tang Yu's heart sink fiercely at once.\"A Giant Wind Rhinoceros is abnormally strong and extremely fast. Uncle is already considered lucky to have escaped alive from it. His injuries are severe. A lobe of his lung is already in tatters, and his heart is also leaning towards failure; his life is in danger at any moment.\" Ye Yuan's expression was somber.Tang Yu's heart gradually hit rock bottom along with Ye Yuan's words. Instead, it was Tang Zonghuai whose face had the serenity of someone who saw past life and death. He was obviously aware of how severe his injuries were, which was why he was so decisive just now. Hearing Ye Yuan's diagnosis only confirmed his speculations.\"Brother Ye, don't tell me . . .\" Tang Yu did not dare to complete his sentence. Ye Yuan could feel the despair in his heart just from these few words.However, Ye Yuan did not answer Tang Yu's question. Instead, he locked his brows together, as if he was pondering on a problem.For some time, the house was eerily silent. Tang Yu could not tolerate the torture anymore. Plucking up his courage, he asked Ye Yuan, \"Brother Ye, I know it's a little presumptuous, but can you request . . . your father to take action?\"Lifting his head up to look at Tang Yu, Ye Yuan looked calm, but he remained silent.Tang Yu felt a little self-conscious by Ye Yuan's stare and said awkwardly, \"Sorry Brother Ye. It's not that I am looking down on you, but . . .\"\"I know what you meant by that. Regardless whether you believe it or not, it's useless, even if my father came. Not only that, even if it's Wan Donghai or even Wu Daofeng who came, it wouldn't help,\" Ye Yuan said firmly.Wu Daofeng whom Ye Yuan had named was the Chairman of the State of Qin's Alchemists a.s.sociation. In the entire State of Qin, the one with the highest accomplishments in the Alchemy Dao was neither Wan Donghai nor Ye Hang, much less the Imperial Uncle from the Imperial Family; it was this Lord Chairman Wu Daofeng. Now that Ye Yuan said even he would not do, it was basically the same as sentencing Tang Zonghuai to death.Except these words had a hint of quibble in Tang Yu's ears. If it were regarding other matters, he naturally would not argue about it. But right now, Ye Yuan was sentencing his father to death right in front of him. How could he not have doubts? Who was Ye Yuan anyway? Merely a silkpants.\"Brother Ye, you . . .\"\"Yu-er, let Mister Ye . . . finish his words.\" Tang Zonghuai interrupted Tang Yu halfway.Tang Yu was a little stunned. Ye Yuan nodded and said, \"I just said that they won't do. But this doesn't mean that Uncle's situation is hopeless.\"Tang Yu was elated after hearing this. Grabbing Ye Yuan, he said, \"Does Brother Ye has a plan?\"\"The plan actually lies with you, Brother Tang.\"\"Me?\" Tang Yu was befuddled by Ye Yuan's words. In reality, Ye Yuan did not know how to initiate his request; which was why he took a very roundabout way.Nodding his head, Ye Yuan said, \"Brother Tang is also aware that my past reputation isn't that great. I wonder if Brother Tang can trust me.\"At this moment, Tang Yu came to a realization. As a smart man, if he still could not understand Ye Yuan's intention hidden in his words, then he would be a fool.\"Does Brother Ye mean . . . the Six Leaf Gra.s.s?\" Tang Yu asked hesitatingly.\"That's right.\" Ye Yuan did not deny it and directly acknowledged this.In reality, there were differences in the way the Divine Realm and the Lower Realms ranked their medicines. Although a Tier 1 pill in the Divine Realm was also categorized into levels of high, middle, and low, the so-called high-level pills that the State Of Qin had to offer were merely low-level pills when placed in the Divine Realm. The variety and quality of the pill formulas in the Divine Realm were not something which a Lower Realm's mortal country could compare to.Logically speaking, it was impossible for Ye Yuan to refine a high-level Tier 1 pill with his strength. His essence energy could not even support the refinement of a high-level Tier 1 pill. The only reason why he could refine it was that he used to be an Alchemy Emperor. He was only able to refine medicines that surpa.s.sed his strength with his pitiful amount of essence energy by meticulously controlling the distribution of essence energy to a terrifying degree.Yet these so-called high-level Tier 1 Pills were merely some unwanted low-level pills in Ye Yuan's eyes.However, high-level Tier 1 pills from the Lower Realms were no longer sufficient to treat Tang Zonghuai's injuries; middle-level Tier 1 pills from the Divine Realm were necessary. But Ye Yuan's current strength was way too low at the moment, making it impossible to refine pills of such a grade.Hence, he was giving Tang Yu an option. If Tang Yu chose not to believe in him, then his fate with Tang Yu would end here; there would be nothing he could do for Tang Zonghuai's injuries.\"H-how can I do that? What if . . . What if . . .\" Tang Yu became quite fl.u.s.tered.Subconsciously, Tang Yu felt that Ye Yuan was trustworthy. However, when facing the grim reality, Tang Yu really did not know what he should do. His idea was that if Ye Yuan really could not save his father, then he had the Great Returning Pill as his last hope.\"Brother Ye, it's not that I don't believe you, it's just . . . just . . .\" Tang Yu did not know how to word it.\"Yu-er, give it to him,\" at that moment, the silent Tang Zonghuai said with a weak voice.Turning over and meeting his father's gaze, Tang Yu and his father exchanged a great deal of information from each other's eyes. Finally, gritting his teeth tightly, Tang Yu pa.s.sed the box containing the Six Leaf Gra.s.s over to Ye Yuan and said, \"Brother Ye, please.\"Ye Yuan did not decline and received the box calmly. He then said, \"Give me a day. I will be here promptly at this time tomorrow. However, Uncle's injuries are not very stable at the moment. If I don't deal with it, it would be hard to endure until tomorrow. Let me carry out a set of needle technique on him to stabilize his condition to prevent it from worsening.\"Tang Yu made a welcoming gesture and said, \"I will have to trouble Brother Ye then.\"Ye Yuan naturally did not carry golden needles on him, so he returned to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to retrieve the needles.After Ye Yuan left, Tang Yu asked his father uneasily, \"Father, I know that Brother Ye is a man of genuine skill and knowledge, but his previous reputation is really dreadful. I still feel that this is a gamble.\"After a bout of violent coughing, Tang Zonghuai gave a strained smile and said, \"How can I . . . not understand my own injuries? What . . . Brother Ye said . . . was right. Even if . . . Wu Daofeng came . . . it would be futile. Even if . . . it was a gamble, there is . . . nothing that . . . we can't afford to lose.\"\"Father, is it truly so serious?\" Clearly, Tang Yu never thought that his father's injuries had already worsened to such an extent.Tang Zonghuai simply shook his head and said, \"That boy . . . does not belong in a shallow pond. Yu-er . . . no matter . . . the result, in the future . . . get closer . . . to him.\"Tang Yu did not expect his father to have such a high evaluation of Ye Yuan. However, his own bias toward Ye Yuan had been cast beyond the ninth layer of clouds ever since stepping into this house. Nodding his head, Tang Yu said, \"Father, don't worry. I, your son, am not an ungrateful person. As long as Brother Ye treats Father with all his might, this life of mine can be considered sold to him.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment, he discovered that Ye Yuan was utterly not worthless like the rumors suggested.\"Father, how are you? Do you feel better?\" after the acupuncture session was over, Tang Yu asked anxiously.Presently, Tang Zonghuai's face color was a lot rosier, and his coughing was not as violent as before. \"Mister Ye is indeed skillful. Right now I feel that my entire body is a lot more relaxed.\"Even though he was still out of breath when talking, it was much better compared to previously.This needle technique of Ye Yuan naturally was not something ordinary, but a pinnacle needle technique which was self-created. Ye Yuan named it the 72 Paths Great Cycle Acupuncture. This set of needle technique once stirred up the Divine Realm, and it possessed unfathomable capabilities.Of course, with his current realm, he simply could not unleash the power of this needle technique. It could only control Tang Zonghuai's condition a little right now.\"This acupuncture can only alleviate the symptoms, but it cannot treat the root of the problem. Tomorrow, I will send the medicinal pill over. There's no time to waste. I will return first.\" Finis.h.i.+ng his words, Ye Yuan immediately bade farewell and left.. . . . . .Ye Yuan went to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to retrieve the medicinal herbs for refining the Exploding Yuan Pill and directly entered the pill refinement room together with the three stalks of Six Leaf Gra.s.s.Exploding Yuan Pill was only a low-level Tier 1 medicinal pill in the Divine realm, perfect for the current Ye Yuan to refine. He even had better Tier 1 medicinal pills for increasing strength, but currently, he was unable to refine them. Once his strength increased, he would naturally be able to refine higher level medicinal pills of the same tier.To Ye Yuan, the refinement method for the Exploding Yuan Pill was very simple. After six hours, Ye Yuan brought a few medicine bottles with him out of the pill refinement room.Next was naturally a closed-door seclusion training. He found a quiet chamber, and informed the servants to not disturb him, and started his meditation.Looking at the row of pill bottles in front of his eyes, Ye Yuan frowned lightly. He was very discontented with this round of pill refinement. Three sets of ingredients, yet he only managed to refine 26 Exploding Yuan Pills. Among the pills were 15 middle-grade Exploding Yuan Pills, eight high-grade Exploding Yuan Pills, and only three superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pills.Medicinal pills were divided into several grades: low-grade, middle-grade, high-grade, superior-grade, and transcendent-grade. If it were in the past and Ye Yuan refined these sort of lowly medicinal pills, in this case, the low-level Tier 1 Exploding Yuan Pill, the lowest grade would at least be of superior-grade. And yet today, he could only refine out a bunch of trash. This was obviously something he was not accustomed to.If the few Alchemy Grandmasters in the State of Qin were to hear Ye Yuan's thoughts, they would definitely find a hole in the ground to crawl into. If they were to refine the Exploding Yuan Pill, they would express thanks to the heaven and earth if there was one superior-grade medicinal pill. Now, Ye Yuan refined three of them, and he still was not satisfied? Superior-grade medicinal pills to them were something that could only be encountered by luck and not by attempting to refine it. Only sometimes when they were lucky could they manage to refine it.Ye Yuan let out a sigh. He knew that this was not something that could be helped. After all, this body had never refined medicinal pills before, so his skill was still lacking. The most important thing was still that his strength was too weak. One portion of essence energy had to be split into three to be used; naturally, he could not refine high-level pills.Holding the bottle containing the superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pills, Ye Yuan took one out and immediately swallowed it.The instant the pill reached his abdomen, it immediately transformed into gushes of essence energy which swept outwards. The surging essence energy repeatedly gushed through all the meridians in Ye Yuan's body. Ye Yuan did not dare to delay, and he immediately cultivated the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art to direct the chaotic essence energy to flow along the meridians properly. The initially violent essence energy immediately became extremely subservient under the guidance of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. After essence energy fully circulated through Ye Yuan's body, it finally converged within his dantian. After tempering using the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, the initially somewhat chaotic essence energy became incomparably stable.The Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was divided into three chapters of Mortal, Earth, and Heaven. Right now, Ye Yuan was cultivating the early part of the Mortal chapter. The Mortal Chapter was further divided into three sections, and each section had an accompanying martial technique. That was also a strong point of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. A martial technique dedicated to the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art had unmatched power.The Spirit Bristle Divine King was invincible in the Divine Realm because he had mastered the final martial technique in the Heaven Chapter of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art; this martial technique was called the Nine Suns Burning Heaven. The moment this martial technique was unleashed, a radius of several thousand miles would burn into nothingness; it was immensely terrifying.The supporting martial technique for the first section of the Mortal chapter was named the Absolute Yang Finger. It unleashed essence energy from the fingertips, and after mastering to the large success stage, it could smash rocks and break metal, having an extremely high attacking power.After four hours, the medicinal efficacy was fully absorbed by Ye Yuan after cultivating with the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. Ye Yuan felt the essence energy in his body was lacking just by a bit more before he could step into the Second Level Essence Qi Realm.Without any hesitation, Ye Yuan threw the second superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pill into his mouth and continued to temper the essence energy in his dantian. Another four hours pa.s.sed, and Ye Yuan then swallowed the third pill.After Ye Yuan finished taking all the superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pills, he continued to consume the high-grade Exploding Yuan Pills. But the effects were much more inferior compared to the superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pills. Furthermore, with the increasing consumption of Exploding Yuan Pill, the medicinal effects would become less efficacious for Ye Yuan.When dawn was about to break, Ye Yuan felt his entire body's meridians and dantian slightly swelled, and he was in pain. He knew that the maximum amount of essence energy he could absorb had been reached. If he continued, his body would explode, and he would die. Once again checking his body's essence energy, it had actually reached the peak of the Third Level Essence Qi Realm; just a little more needed before stepping into the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Right now, Ye Yuan had already exhausted three superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pills as well as six high-grade Exploding Yuan Pills. It could not be said that it was not extravagant.From the Third Level Essence Qi Realm to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, there was a small bottleneck. In a mortal country like the State of Qin, many people were stuck at this bottleneck, and some might even never broke through it during their lifetime.But this bottleneck was basically non-existent for Ye Yuan. With his extremely high cultivation realm in the past life, a small bottleneck in the Essence Qi Realm naturally could not stump him. As long as the acc.u.mulation of essence energy was sufficient, Ye Yuan could cross this threshold anytime.It was just that continuously rising through two small cultivation realms overnight had made Ye Yuan's foundation slightly unstable. With Ye Yuan's experience, he naturally would not do something where the loss outweighed the gain. Even though he desired strength, he did not want to quench his thirst for it without regard for the consequences. Only by keeping his feet firmly on the ground could he walk further.Over the next few days, his primary mission was to stabilized the sudden rise in strength and to strengthen the foundation of his Initial Stage Essence Qi Realm. Only then would he consider stepping into the next stage.Of course, because Ye Yuan cultivated the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, his essence energy was much thicker and purer than the average Third Level Essence Qi Realm. If someone else was to consume the Exploding Yuan Pill, one superior-grade Exploding Yuan Pill and two high-grade Exploding Yuan Pill were enough to make the First Level Essence Qi Realm promoted to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.Which was to say that currently, Ye Yuan's essence energy was three times thicker than the average Third Level Essence Qi Realm! No wonder the Spirit Bristle Divine King had such power. If a person was to cultivate the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art to an exceedingly high realm, even if one squandered essence energy, one could exhaust his opponent to death.If a person took into account of this, then even if his own strength was inadequate, his essence energy was sufficient enough to refine a Divine Realm's middle-level Tier 1 medicinal pill.\"It's late. Time to help Uncle Tang refine the Ink Jade Heart Returning Pill.\" Ye Yuan stood up and stretched his body, pus.h.i.+ng the door outwards.Right after stepping out the door, he saw Lu-er swaying around like a sylph. She smiled and said, \"Young Master, you exited your closed-door seclusion?\"\"En. Yii? You are already at the First Level Essence Qi Realm?\" Ye Yuan replied with a smile while his perceptions unwittingly swept over Lu-er's body. He discovered that Lu-er who was initially void of any essence energy was actually at the First Level Essence Qi Realm right now. Furthermore, he only taught Lu-er the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul a day ago!Lu-er nodded her head obediently and asked timidly, \"Young Master, am I cultivating too slowly?\"Ye Yuan could not help but laughed. \"You little la.s.s. Don't say these words outside. Otherwise, you will anger others to death. Your cultivation speed is too fast; so fast that it makes everyone feel ashamed of their inadequacy.\"Lu-er had just stepped onto the path of cultivation and completely had no understanding of cultivation speed. Listening to how her young master was praising her, Lu-er was elated.\"Really? Does that mean that in the future, I will be able to help Young Master?\"\"Haha. Of course. Our family's Lu-er is the most amazing. Let's go, follow young master to settle some matters. Tomorrow, we will depart for the Dan Wu Academy. I will bring you to the academy through recommendation,\" Ye Yuan said with a laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its limelight was stolen by the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.Ever since the incident caused by Ye Yuan, Wan Donghai had been in a closed-door seclusion, rejecting all visitors. This made Wan Dongyang extremely anxious. He really wanted to send someone to finish Ye Yuan off, but without his big brother's consent, he did not dare to make the call. Hence, he would linger around Wan Donghai's seclusion location every now and then, hoping that Wan Donghai would exit seclusion faster.Currently, Wan Dongyang was pacing about the room's doorway looking very impatient. Clearly, his patience was already at its limits.\"Big Brother, if you are still not coming out, I will bring people along to cripple that punk! I can't stomach this grievance.\" Wan Dongyang clearly already lost his temper.Getting no response from Wan Donghai, Wan Dongyang stomped his feet angrily. Just as he was about to leave, Wan Donghai's voice transmitted into his ears.\"Dongyang, come in.\"Hearing this, Wan Dongyang was elated and immediately opened the door and went in.\"Uh . . . Big Brother, weren't you in a closed-door seclusion? Why . . .\" Wan Dongyang initially thought that his big brother was really in a closed-door seclusion attempting a breakthrough. Who would have thought that he would see Wan Donghai leisurely drinking tea with a very laid-back appearance?Wan Donghai did not have a trace of frustration nor an appearance of defeat, which was completely different from what Wan Dongyang imagined. In fact, he was full of spirit and energy, as if the incident two days ago never happened.Maintaining a look as if everything was within his grasp, Wan Donghai smiled lightly and said, \"Dongyang, how many times have I told you? When you encounter problems, don't be overly agitated. This is the capital. It is our territory, but also Ye Hang's territory. Do you think you can eliminate Ye Yuan just by bringing people along? Not unless Ye Hang's brain stops working.\"\"But Big Brother, I can't stomach this insult! How can our Drunken Star Manor carry on operating in the capital after being smacked across the face by a brat who is still wet behind the ears?!\" Wan Dongyang retorted.\"Doing business is all about harmony bringing wealth. Even if we have to fight, it should be behind the scene. There would be no meaning for you openly slaughtering your way to their doorstep other than forcing the Drunken Star Manor into a more pa.s.sive position.\"\"This . . .\"\"You just have to settle down and help me manage the Drunken Star Manor. As for Ye Yuan, you don't have to worry about it. I've already made arrangements.\"Wan Dongyang's eyes lit up, and he quickly asked, \"What kind of arrangements?\"With a smile, Wan Donghai said, \"He is just a First Level Essence Qi Realm brat. Why do we need to personally take action to kill him? Now that his body's recovered, I estimate that he will be returning to the Dan Wu Academy within these two days. If he were to have some mishap along the way, then it would have nothing to do with us.\"\"Big Brother's intentions are . . .?\"\"I already hired a Mosha a.s.sa.s.sin to take action. He can't possibly fail to handle a First Level Essence Qi Realm brat, right?\"\"Hahaha!\" Wan Dongyang laughed wildly and exclaimed with admiration, \"Big Brother truly has the situation well within your grasp. This Little Brother is impressed! Why didn't I think of this move? Mosha a.s.sa.s.sins come and go like the shadow. Within the Tranquil Cloud Ten Nations, anyone who hears that name will turn pale. With them taking action, that stinky brat definitely can't escape death!\"\"En. Mosha is the most outstanding as well as the most trustworthy a.s.sa.s.sination organization within the Tranquil Cloud Ten Nations. Since my son, Yuan-er, failed to poison that brat to death, I will send that punk on his way once more. To dare provoke me, Wan Donghai, that brat must be tired of living.\"Wan Donghai's entire personality became colder as he uttered those words.\"That's right. Who knows where that brat got such an obscure poison from. To dare to challenge us? He simply has no idea of life from death. If he himself had some strength, then forget it. But he just had to be a wastrel at the First Level Essence Qi Realm. Eliminating him simply takes no effort at all.\" In Wan Dongyang's eyes, Ye Yuan was already a dead man.Wan Donghai laughed as if he had no more interest in Ye Yuan's matters. In his eyes, Ye Yuan was not even being considered an opponent; at best, he was a just a flea.\"If this incident was instigated by Ye Hang behind the scenes, then he has successfully infuriated me! This time, our Drunken Star Manor will definitely strike down the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion completely! I want Ye Hang's friends and relatives to abandon him!\"Wan Donghai took out a medicinal pill from his sleeve and pa.s.sed it to Wan Dongyang. Filled with suspicion, Wan Dongyang took the pill, but even after staring at it for a while, he could not see anything special. Not every alchemist could reach Ye Yuan's level of understanding of medicinal effects. Wan Dongyang was only able to determine that it was a pill similar to the Essence Qi Pill.\"Big Brother, this is . . .?\"\"This pill is called Essence Gathering Pill. It's the same type of essence energy acc.u.mulating pill like the Essence Qi Pill. However, an Essence Gathering Pill's medicinal efficacy is 50% stronger than the Essence Qi Pill! What do you think would happen once our Drunken Star Manor starts to offer a large supply of this pill?\" Wan Donghai could no longer conceal the pride on his face.Wan Dongyang had a faint idea, but he never thought this Essence Gathering Pill could have such an effect. After listening to Big Brother's explanation, Wan Dongyang's heart felt an upsurge of emotion.Once a pill like this was released onto the market, it would definitely be making a killing!Even though an Essence Qi Pill could help increase strength, if one had started consuming it at the First Level Essence Qi Realm, this sort of pill would not have significant effects after reaching the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm, much less at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.But if the person swapped the Essence Qi Pill with an Essence Gathering Pill and started consuming it at the First Level Essence Qi Realm, it would mean one's cultivation speed became faster than the others by 50%! For the geniuses from major families, it was something they could only dream of.Every minute and second counts in the Martial Path. With an increase in bone age, the potential in the human body would gradually be squeezed dry. Therefore, the amount of time available for getting stronger would be extremely limited. Hence, this naturally meant that anyone who could cultivate to a higher realm when they were young and could walk further along the Martial Path. Looking at things from this point of view showed the extraordinary significance of an Essence Gathering Pill.\"Big Brother, what is the cost price of this Essence Gathering Pill?\" As an alchemist himself, Wan Dongyang wasn't a fool. He asked the crucial question straightaway.\"Relax, this Essence Gathering Pill is also a Tier 1 medicinal pill. The cost price is only slightly higher than the Essence Qi Pill.\"\"That's great! Big Brother, we will be able to completely take down the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion with just this Essence Gathering Pill!\"The two pairs of eyes met, and the brothers started laughing in unison.. . . . . .At the Tang Family's residence.Tang Zonghuai had just eaten the medicinal pill which Ye Yuan brought and was in a closed-door seclusion right now attempting to refine the medicinal efficacy.The pill which Ye Yuan helped Tang Zonghuai refined was called the Ink Jade Heart Returning Pill. This sort of pill naturally did not exist in the State of Qin. But the required medicinal herbs were not difficult to find. With the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's resources, Ye Yuan quickly collected the medicinal herbs and refined it successfully.This Ink Jade Returning Heart Pill was a pill specializing in treating internal injuries. The medicinal properties were about the same as the Great Returning Pill, but the medicinal efficacy was more than an entire grade higher compared to the Great Returning Pill. Not only it could help protect Tang Zonghuai's heart meridians, but also it could repair his damaged organs. As long as Tang Zonghuai managed to absorb the medicinal properties thoroughly, he would recover within three days.In the Tang Family Outer Hall, Tang Yu gave a deep bow to Ye Yuan. \"This time around, if I didn't coincidentally meet Brother Ye, I'm afraid Father would be doomed. Brother Ye, please accept this bow.\"Stopping Tang Yu with his hands, Ye Yuan gave a smile and then said, \"No need to be so polite, Brother Tang. It was also Brother Tang's filial piety which touched me. Looking at you, a father and son pair, I would recall the anxious appearance my own father had a few days ago. How could I bear to watch the two of you be separated by death? In a way, you were the one who saved your father, Brother Tang. If you didn't give me the Six Leaf Gra.s.s, then I would be helpless against Uncle's injuries.\"Hearing Ye Yuan said this, Tang Yu suddenly realized that Ye Yuan's essence energy was way too abundant. To think he already reached the Third Level Essence Qi Ream after one day!\"This . . . in just one night, Brother Ye actually improved by two levels? H-how is this possible?\" Just now, Tang Yu's thoughts were completely on his father. Now that he discovered the changes in Ye Yuan's body, he was dumbstruck with astonishment.The Dan Wu Academy was a place where geniuses congregated. Tang Yu had seen a lot of geniuses before, but he had never heard of a genius who could improve by two levels overnight. It was completely inconceivable.Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"I just took advantage of the opportunity. I've incurred Brother Tang's ridicule.\"To Ye Yuan, it was naturally taking advantage of the opportunity. However, if other people had the Exploding Yuan Pill, they would not dare to consume it as he did. The result would undoubtedly be death due to the rupturing of the person's meridians. However, Ye Yuan's understanding of medicinal properties had reached a height that no ordinary person could understand. With the addition of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, it was also the reason why he dared to swallow such pills.Recovering from his surprise, Tang Yu forced a smile. \"Taking advantage of the opportunity? Incurs ridicule? Brother Ye, these words truly made me ashamed of my inadequacy!\"\"Hahaha. No need to be like that, Brother Tang. I still have some medicinal pills here which aids cultivation. I will give them to you. I think there's no longer any concern for Uncle Tang's injuries. Can Brother Tang accompany me back to the Dan Wu Academy tomorrow?\"\"Alright. After Father exits seclusion and there's really no issues, I will follow Brother Ye back tomorrow.\"\"En. The medicinal pills I gave Brother Tang needs to be kept safe. Take care not to let other people know about it.\"Hearing what Ye Yuan said, Tang Yu knew that this medicinal pill was no trivial thing. So he replied solemnly, \"Don't worry, Brother Ye. This Tang Yu will definitely keep his mouth shut.\"An Exploding Yuan Pill naturally was not of much worth in the Divine Realm, but it was far too precious when placed in a place like this State of Qin. How could Ye Yuan not understand the logic of an innocent man getting into trouble because of his wealth?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Groups of them would often enter the city in threes or fives from outside. Currently, at the roadside, Ye Hang and wife were sending Ye Yuan off.\"Yuan-er, although this is only a half-day journey, I keep feeling uneasy. With Wan Donghai's personality, he definitely wouldn't swallow this insult and humiliation silently. My guess is that he is definitely scheming something. Ah Ping and Ah Cheng had followed me for many years. I think it is best if they escorted you along the way.\" Ye Hang tried his best to persuade his son.Just like how Wan Donghai understood Ye Hang, similarly, Ye Hang too had a deep understanding of Wan Donghai. That was why he had been persuading Ye Yuan all these while to bring along the two guards but kept on being rejected by Ye Yuan.\"Father, it is only a half-day journey. It is fine. Furthermore, there is Brother Tang who is traveling with me. No matter how brave Wan Donghai is, he wouldn't dare to openly send people to kill me.\"Ye Yuan rejected with a smile like before.\"Aiya. Just listen to your father, Yuan-er. That Wan Donghai is vicious and coldhearted. It's easy to dodge a spear in the open but hard to guard against an arrow shot in the dark.\" Ren Hongling tried to persuade him as well.The couple had lost him once, and now they had him back, they did not want any accidents to happen again.However, Ye Yuan just smiled and shook his head; the rejection was already evident.\"Aiya. You are so stubborn.\"Ye Hang knew that his son, currently, could not be compared with how he was in the past. Perhaps he really had a life-preserving trump card. Yesterday, when his son appeared in front of him, he was astoundingly already at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm; this gave him a huge fright. Although he knew that Ye Yuan encountered a powerful master, this advancement speed was too terrifying.But after thinking about the extremely mysterious methods of the expert, Ye Hang felt at ease. He knew that there were too many things beyond his comprehension in this world.\"Forget it. Since he doesn't want to, then let him go alone. Our son is all grown up. There are some things which he must face himself.\" Ye Hang sighed.Ye Yuan bowed towards his parents before setting off with Tang Yu and Lu-er.. . . . . .Ye Yuan was naturally aware that this journey would not be too peaceful. But he wished to face some matters by himself as he wanted to use this chance to temper himself.Ye Yuan possessed unfathomable knowledge in Alchemy Dao; his broad horizons transcended this world as well as having countless martial techniques. However, these things do not represent strength. Otherwise, Ye Yuan could have already charged back to the Divine Realm right now.What Ye Yuan wanted to do was to use these things and turn them into actual strength.In his previous life, Ye Yuan was too focused on Alchemy Dao, leading to him neglecting Martial Dao. His cultivation realm was indeed high, but his combat prowess was a complete mess.How to take the knowledge brought over from his previous life and convert it into combat power?Ye Yuan knows that it was to fight, fight, and FIGHT!Only through non-stop combat he could increase his battle power and slaughter his way back to the Divine Realm!Without actual combat experience, no matter how profound Ye Yuan's knowledge was, it would merely be like the moon's reflection on the water, only an illusion.Hence, Ye Yuan did not wish to grow up under Ye Hang's protection. That was why he chose to return to the Dan Wu Academy in order to compete with other geniuses.Just as Ye Yuan described to Tang Zong Huai, the Dan Wu Academy was not a utopia. In contrast, the compet.i.tion inside was quite cruel.And with this return journey to the academy, it would be the first time Ye Yuan going to face this challenge.. . . . . .The Dan Wu Academy was not situated within the capital, but rather, located a hundred miles north of the capital. The area was close to the Endless Forest; an excellent place to temper geniuses.Ye Yuan and his group did not rush back to the academy. Instead, they rode on their horses in a leisurely manner.\"Oh right, I still haven't congratulated Brother Tang for stepping into the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"Originally, Tang Yu was at the peak of the Fourth Level. Now that he obtained Ye Yuan's Exploding Yuan Pill, he might as well find a rock to commit suicide with if he still could not step into the Fifth level.\"No no. This was all thanks to Brother Ye's Exploding Yuan Pill. The Exploding Yuan Pill is indeed miraculous. To think that the essence energy contained inside is several times greater than in the Essence Qi Pill. I only ate one of them and easily broke through.\"Up till now, Tang Yu was still reminiscing the aftertaste of that violent essence energy, thinking to himself that increasing cultivation level was unexpectedly easy. Furthermore, because he ate the Exploding Yuan Pill, he understood why Ye Yuan could advance two ranks overnight.What he did not know was that Ye Yuan already consumed the Exploding Yuan Pills of the best quality. Furthermore, the quant.i.ty consumed was several times of his. Those pills would have been sufficient for him to cultivate to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.Every stage within the Essence Qi Realm was not as simple as one plus one equals to two. The higher your realm was, the greater the quant.i.ty of essence energy required; furthermore, it increased multiple times. The amount of essence energy needed to go from the Fifth Level to the Sixth Level was practically the total sum of essence energy needed for the First Level to the Fifth Level. Yet, such an immense amount of essence energy was only sufficient for Ye Yuan to cultivate to the Third Level.\"Hahaha. An innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth. After Brother Tang returns to the academy, take care to not reveal the Exploding Yuan Pill. Otherwise, the consequences would be unbearable.\"Wan Donghai had the confidence to take down the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion with just the Essence Gathering Pills, yet this Exploding Yuan Pill's medicinal effects were even greater than the Essence Gathering Pill. Once it was exposed, it would definitely cause a bloodbath.During Ye Yuan's previous life, he spent a long time in an exalted position. Other than that wildly ambitious traitor, he was confident that he had some ability in judging people. Tang Yu had commendable filial piety and was definitely not a despicable backstabber. Furthermore, he saw a great deal of himself in Tang Yu which was why he showed his appreciation of his talent by gifting the Exploding Yuan Pill to him.Of course, Ye Yuan was not without any selfish intention. A good man had three helpers. After Ye Yuan went back to the academy, he could not possibly personally take care of every problem he would encounter. If he had a few good friends, things would be much easier.\"Don't worry, Brother Ye. Tang Yu isn't someone who can't differentiate between good and bad. I am also aware of the huge implications that this Exploding Yuan Pill has and will absolutely not reveal it in front of others. Forgive Tang Yu for being bold, but since Brother Ye has such capabilities, why is there a need to attend the Dan Wu Academy?\"Tang Yu was not a fool. Although he could only see a corner of the iceberg, he was absolutely certain that Ye Yuan's Alchemy Dao standards had already completely surpa.s.sed the current standard in the State of Qin. Was it not an unnecessary move to attend the Dan Wu Academy?However, there were some things that he did not feel comfortable saying, fearful that Ye Yuan might misunderstand. That was where did Ye Yuan learn all of these from? Regardless of that nameless medicinal pill used to treat his father or that Exploding Yuan Pill which Ye Yuan possessed, all of those could not possibly be refined by Ye Hang.However, he could only let all these suspicions remained in his stomach. Unless Ye Yuan took the initiative to tell him, he would not overstep his boundaries.\"The Dan Wu Academy is still a place where the elites of the State of Qin congregate. Such a place where the wind meets the clouds; how can I, Ye Yuan, pa.s.s up this opportunity?\"\"Hahaha. In my opinion, those so-called elites and geniuses, they are all just clay chickens and pottery dogs when compared to Brother Ye.\"Ye Yuan shook his head and replied, \"The heroes under the heavens cannot be underestimated. I think you've guessed it, but these few days, I've had a lucky encounter, which was why my changes were so big. However, my strength is still too weak. A genius who cannot grow stronger will only become stepping stones for others.\"Nodding his head, Tang Yu faintly understood the reason why Ye Yuan wanted to go to the Dan Wu Academy, and at the same time, he was full of admiration towards Ye Yuan.It went without saying that the lucky encounter which Ye Yuan came across was absolutely extraordinary. But for Ye Yuan to not be conceited or rash and remained clear of his position, it was truly hard to come by.Among those geniuses in the academy, which one of them did not have eyes growing on top of their heads? Those people looked down upon others with ordinary backgrounds.Tang Yu believed that soon enough, Ye Yuan would be able to display his own brilliance within the Dan Wu Academy, and those so-called geniuses would be outshone by him.\"Come on out. I believe Mister is tired after following us all the way. Am I right?\" Ye Yuan suddenly shouted out loud while Tang Yu was still lost in his own thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet this time around, the mission he received was actually to a.s.sa.s.sinate a First Level Essence Qi Realm rookie.To have obtained the t.i.tle of a Bronze Rank a.s.sa.s.sin showed that his abilities had already received preliminary recognition from the organization. Chou Ying's strength was at the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, meaning the missions he received were mostly corresponding to his level; sometimes even against martial artists who were stronger than him. Asking him to a.s.sa.s.sinate a First Level Essence Qi Realm rookie was simply a form of humiliation to him.Chou Ying was an ambitious a.s.sa.s.sin. His goal was to become a Gold Rank a.s.sa.s.sin. Hence, the training he received back in Mosha was rather severe. Concealment, disguising appearances, and one hit certain kill; he studied all of these very diligently which was why his strength grew very quickly as well.In order to stimulate his potential, Chou Ying frequently accepted quite challenging missions. There was even an occasion where he accepted a mission to a.s.sa.s.sinate a Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm target which he barely managed to complete by the skin of his teeth. Ever since then, he received more attention from the organization, and the resources allocated to him also increased by a lot.This time around, the a.s.sa.s.sination target was said to be a reckless silkpants who did not have any abilities. A 15-year-old but only at the First Level Essence Qi Realm; he was definitely akin to rotten mud which cannot hold up the wall. Supposedly, the employer spent a large sum of money to request for a Bronze Rank killer to move out.Facing a target like that, Chou Ying only needed to use a single finger to crush him.However, Chou Ying was an extremely professional killer. Although he completely dismissed the employer's repeated cautioning, he still made adequate preparations.Many of those in the same profession used their blood to teach Chou Ying one particular truth; a lion would go all out even when hunting a rabbit.In the past, many rookies, even Bronze Rank a.s.sa.s.sins from Mosha, tried to kill their targets out in the open just because the targets were too weak, but ended up losing their own lives.Additionally, it was expected that the target's father had planned for two experts to escort him, which would make things very troublesome for Chou Ying.However, Chou Ying was extremely confident in his a.s.sa.s.sination techniques. As long as he made use of the favorable climate and geographical advantage, he would definitely be able to a.s.sa.s.sinate the target successfully even while under the protection of the two experts.But who would have thought that the r.e.t.a.r.ded silkpants actually chose not to bring along those two followers. Instead, he left the city with only another punk and a young lady with him.Hehehe. Since you are courting death, then I won't hold back.Chou Ying who was looking from far away was so excited that his heart was about to jump out.After leaving the city, Chou Ying had been following the three of them from far behind, without any intention of making any move. He had already investigated the route leading from the capital to the Dan Wu Academy and already had a place in mind where he will make his strike.These three people did not seem to be anxious. They took their time while enjoying the scenery.Ha, you guys just have fun a little while longer. After all, this is the last bit of fun you guys will enjoy in your lives.Chou Ying laughed coldly in his heart.Seeing as they were about to arrive at the Dan Wu Academy, Chou Ying circled around and went ahead of them, and then laid in ambush among the rocky terrain. He had long predetermined that this was the best location for him to strike. Here, the rocks formed an uneven terrain which was advantageous for concealing himself. He was prepared to kill Ye Yuan in a single blow.Right when Ye Yuan and his entourage were about to enter his certain-kill range, the three of them stopped, leaving Chou Ying stunned.. . . . . .\"Come on out. I believe Mister is tired after following us all the way. Am I right?\" Ye Yuan's words slowly drifted into Chou Ying's ears.No one answered . . .This brat . . . is he making a blind guess?Trying to trick me to go out? Hehehe. That must be it!But he seemed to have underestimated this brat. To think he actually guessed that someone would send people here to kill him. Since Ye Yuan managed to predict this, then why he did not bring along followers? Unless those two followers had been following them all along, and even he himself did not discover it?But how was that possible?The strength of those two followers was at best about the same as him. If they had been following these three people all the way, it would be impossible for him to not have spotted them!As a Bronze Rank a.s.sa.s.sin from Mosha, Chou Ying had considerable confidence in his abilities to conceal and tail people. If it had been a Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist who followed them, then it would be reasonable for him to not have noticed anything. But those two followers were just Essence Qi Realm martial artists. There was no way he could not discover them.No matter what, as long as they entered his attack range, he would just send that Ye Yuan to see King Yama.. . . . . .\"Young Master, what's wrong?\" Lu-er did not understand why Ye Yuan would suddenly blurt out something like that and asked him in puzzlement.Rather, it was Tang Yu whose vigilance was quite high. The moment Ye Yuan said those words, Tang Yu entire body went on alert.\"Hahaha. It's just a small thief. No big deal,\" Ye Yuan said without any care.Lu-er, upon seeing Ye Yuan's casual att.i.tude, took things even less seriously. \"But Young Master, where is that bad guy hiding?\"\"Oh. Right behind that big boulder. My guess is that he is waiting for us to go over before ambus.h.i.+ng us.\" Ye Yuan gestured with his mouth and gave a smile.Chou Ying's emotions which had just relaxed, once again tightened with Ye Yuan's words. Wasn't he behind a big boulder right now?However, this place was filled with piles of rocks and stones; even gigantic boulders were everywhere. How would that guy know which boulder he was hiding behind?Still trying to draw me out?I, Chou Ying, am a professional killer. How could I possibly be goaded out using this super weak goading technique?\"Hey, the state of your heart is in disorder. That's not good.\" Ye Yuan's voice drifted over once again.Chou Ying reacted with a violent shudder.As an a.s.sa.s.sin, Chou Ying always felt that the state of his heart had already been trained to a realm where he was unaffected by any disturbances. However, those two sentences by Ye Yuan really disrupted the state of his heart.How was this possible?! The other party is only a First Level Essence Qi Realm rookie!Could it be that he really discovered me? He wasn't bluffing?Right at this moment, Ye Yuan's demon-like voice drifted into his ears once again. \"How about this? I will throw a rock over. If I hit the correct one, you come out; if I hit wrongly, then I will carry on walking. How's that?\"The moment the voice stopped, Chou Yin heard a whoosh, followed by the crisp sound of a small rock hitting a boulder. The boulder that he was leaning against . . .Chou Ying realized that he was out of luck. Ye Yuan truly knew that he was hiding here and was not trying to trick him.Revealing himself, Chou Ying discovered three youths staring right at him. Among them, one of the youths had a weird smile on his face, who also happened to be the target he was sent to a.s.sa.s.sinate: Ye Yuan.\"How did you discover me?\" Chou Ying asked with a dark face.He was unable to understand how a First Level Essence Qi Realm rookie could discover him. Right now, what he wanted to know the most was where his concealment went wrong, in order to make improvements after today's mission.As for whether or not these three people in front of him posed a threat, that was something he had never even considered!How was it possible for a Mosha's Bronze Rank a.s.sa.s.sin to be defeated by three rookies?\"Want to know how? Not going to tell you!\" Ye Yuan looked as if he was not willing to, and it was also impossible for him to answer Chou Ying's question.He could not possibly tell Chou Ying that this body contained a super amazing soul.\"Courting death!\" Right when Chou Ying was about to strike, he suddenly stopped. \"Yii? To think he's actually at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm? The information doesn't match!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Instant FlashPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: Instant FlashTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorChou Ying spent the past two days observing Ye Yuan from afar, so he was not aware of Ye Yuan's transformation. Now that he was facing Ye Yuan, he realized that his a.s.sa.s.sination target was already at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.To Chou Ying, there was not much difference between the First Level Essence Qi Realm and the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. An opponent like this was basically an instant kill for him.Every three levels in the Essence Qi Realm was considered as one stage. Even though there was only a difference of one stage between the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm and the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, one should not underestimate it, as the difference in strength was huge. It was not difficult for a person at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm to face off against five or six people at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.As Chou Ying was two stages above Ye Yuan, he did not feel that Ye Yuan posed any threat to him.What made Chou Ying uncertain was whether the employer's information was wrong, or it was this youth in front of him that was too monstrous?Chou Ying would rather choose to believe the former. After all, only two to three days had pa.s.sed since the mission was issued. To train from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm in two to three days?Was this a joke?\"Brother Ye, this person is very troublesome to deal with. In a while, I will delay him; you and Lu-er quickly rush off! The academy is only around ten miles from here. The two of you quickly go and get help!\" Wielding his sword, Tang Yu positioned himself in front of Ye Yuan and Lu-er.He could feel the killing intent emanating out of Chou Ying, yet he could not see through Chou Ying's abilities. He knew that this time around, they had met a tough character. Not only did Ye Yuan save Tang Zonghuai's life, but he also gave him a high-level medicinal pill. It could be said that Tang Yu owed Ye Yuan a great debt of grat.i.tude. What Tang Yu was doing now was risking his life to repay the debt.Although Tang Yu was also a genius student from the Dan Wu Academy, when compared to Chou Yin who had been through hundreds of battles, regardless whether it was strength or experience, he was too lacking. Staying behind naturally meant certain death.Among the three of them, Tang Yu's strength was the greatest. Hence, he did not hesitate at all to stand out.Seeing Tang Yu's appearance as if he was about to face a great enemy, Lu-er also started to become nervous. \"Young Master, run away first! Big Brother Tang and I will cover your retreat!\"When Ye Yuan saw Lu-er standing in front of him, he could not help but to laugh. \"Silly girl, what can you do by staying behind. Move away.\"\"No way! I'm not moving!\" Lu-er said stubbornly.Looking at Tang Yu's and Lu-er's actions, Ye Yuan found it hilarious, yet he was extremely touched in his heart.One can only see true feelings during a crisis. Lu-er's actions were within Ye Yuan's expectations. However, he had only just met Tang Yu a few days ago. Even if he had saved Tang Yu's father and gave him an Exploding Yuan Pill, someone who lacked resolution would have long fled for his life.One had to know, with Chou Ying's strength, without any accident, the three of them would undoubtedly die.\"Hahaha. What a touching scene! Ye Yuan, it is fine if you don't say anything. But this young lady looks rather ravis.h.i.+ng, in a while . . .\" Chou Ying started laughing wildly.At this point, Chou Ying was confident that this Ye Yuan definitely cultivated some technique, or he had some treasure on him, which was how Ye Yuan found his location.Such a technique or even a treasure like that was tremendously useful to him. Hence, he felt that no matter what, he had to force an answer out.Furthermore, Lu-er was indeed tempting. Why would he let go of this chance?\"You guys, make way!\" Ye Yuan pushed Lu-er and Tang Yu aside and stood in front. He still had a smile on his face, except now, that smile became ice-cold.An inexplicable chill suddenly filled his heart. It made Chou Ying shuddered.What's going on?Chou Ying had killed at least a hundred, if not eighty people. He initially already had an ice-cold air around his body. Even if a Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist were to stand in front of him right now, it would be impossible to make him shudder. Yet when he was facing this Third Level Essence Qi Realm brat, he actually felt a chill?Chou Ying felt that everything that had happened today was too abnormal. This was supposedly a mission that was simple without a doubt. Why did things become so bizarre?\"You and I originally had no grudges. Initially, I only wanted to try things out with you seeing as you are helping others avert disaster by taking their money. But since you dare to have ideas about Lu-er, then don't blame me for taking your life.\"Ye Yuan's words revealed a bone-piercing chill.At this point, Ye Yuan swallowed a medicinal pill; something that he refined before setting off.Since he knew that this journey would be dangerous, Ye Yuan naturally would not be unprepared.This medicinal pill was named Five Elements Spirit Link Pill; it was refined using medicinal herbs having five different attributes being metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. An Essence Qi Realm martial artist, after consuming it, could directly raise their strength by an entire stage for a period of time!\"Hahaha. This is hilarious! I want to see how a Third Level Essence Qi Realm brat like you can take my life!\"Chou Ying's emotion was nowhere as calm as what he was showing on his face currently. In reality, he only used these words to encourage himself, to chase away the shadow that was shrouding his heart.At this moment, schwing! Chou Ying's sword left its scabbard.As a killer, Chou Ying would stoop to anything to kill his opponent. n.o.body said that you could not do a sneak attack during a frontal battle. A moment ago, Chou Ying was still talking and laughing, and the next moment, his sword already reached in front of Ye Yuan.\"Brother Ye (Young Master), be careful!\" Tang Yu and Lu-er shouted in unison.However, their cries were not faster than Chou Ying's sword. By the time they reacted, Chou Ying's sword had already stabbed through Ye Yuan's body.\"Young Master!\"\"Brother Ye!\"Looking at this scene, Tang Yu and Lu-er gave a heart-piercing cry.Chou Ying felt that something was wrong. His sword obviously pa.s.sed through Ye Yuan's body, but why his hand did not feel anything?The reason why Chou Ying drew his sword so quickly was not only because he was cautious, but also because the uneasiness in his heart had become increasingly stronger.He watched as Ye Yuan swallowed that medicinal pill. Although he did not believe that Ye Yuan could threaten him just by eating some pills, as a person who had always been cautious, he did not hesitate at all before drawing his sword.Only a dead person could make one rest easy.However, he clearly had killed Ye Yuan. But why was this ominous feeling in his heart still there?At this moment, Ye Yuan who was stabbed by Chou Ying gradually dissipated and then turned into nothingness.What Chou Ying stabbed was actually just an afterimage!\"Hey, it's very dangerous for you to show your back to the enemy.\"Ye Yuan's voice made Chou Ying went stiff.How is this possible?! I already stabbed him!\"Instant Flas.h.!.+ It's actually Instant Flas.h.!.+\" Tang Yu exclaimed.\"Young Master! It's great that you are fine!\" Lu-er shouted, pleasantly surprised.\"Hahaha. Of course I'm fine. How can your young master die so easily?\" Ye Yuan said with a smile.\"Brother Ye actually managed to master such difficult footwork. Furthermore, your use of it was absolutely superb. What a genius!\" Tang Yu marveled at this show of ability.\"Just a trifling skill.\"To other people, Instant Flash was an incredibly profound footwork which was exceedingly hard to comprehend. However, to Ye Yuan, this level of footwork did not possess any challenge.Instant Flash might look impressive, but it was actually only a footwork technique that allowed the user to move freely in a small radius. It was merely a Tier 1 Martial Technique, something that was not very profound.However, this footwork encompa.s.sed Heavenly Dao, making it easy to learn but challenging to master. An ordinary person who wanted to master it would find it incredibly difficult. Even within the Dan Wu Academy, Instant Flash was a highly challenging technique with hardly anyone able to master it.However, this level of Heavenly Dao was not worth mentioning to Ye Yuan who once had possessed an incredibly high cultivation level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: I Will Only Use One FingerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: I Will Only Use One FingerTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorAs a matter of fact, there were still some advantages in Ye Hang sending Ye Yuan to the Dan Wu Academy. That fellow at the very least will attend a few cla.s.ses and pick up some stuff.Although these things were not worth mentioning to the current Ye Yuan, it was still a pretty decent option for fooling people.With Ye Yuan's current strength, Instant Flash was a practical martial technique, yet not overly conspicuous.Even though this martial technique faintly encompa.s.sed Heavenly Dao, in reality, it just barely touched a corner of it; it did not even count as crossing the threshold.Ye Yuan spent the past few days reorganizing his predecessor's memories. By relying on these vague impressions from his predecessor's cla.s.ses, he managed to fumble out several basic martial techniques with Instant Flash being one of it.In reality, while the Instant Flash that Ye Yuan executed seemed right, it was actually different. But by executing it with Ye Yuan's comprehension, it was only stronger and not weaker than those demonstrated by the teachers in the academy.\"No wonder you dare to not bring along followers. To think that your Instant Flash already reached such a level. Very impressive! Looks like the appraisal of you in the report was fairly misleading.\"Chou Ying naturally knew that Instant Flash was not a unique martial technique. However, as Instant Flash was a footwork technique with only a small range of motion, it was not very useful for a.s.sa.s.sination. This was why he did not study it much.Mastery of a martial technique could be cla.s.sified into several categories. From low to high respectively: entry stage, small success stage, large success stage, great circle stage, and the legendary breaking illusion stage.Even so, Chou Ying knew that for Instant Flash to leave behind an afterimage, it had to reach at least the great circle stage. To be able to train such an amazing movement technique to the great circle stage, as long as he did not meet any martial artists specializing in movement technique and the opponent was at the Essence Qi Realm and below, he basically had the ability to self-preserve.No wonder this brat dared to be so arrogant, he really had some capabilities.As an a.s.sa.s.sin, Chou Ying naturally had a movement technique that he specialized in. However, his movement technique was only trained till the large success stage. There was still quite a bit of distance away from the great circle stage.It would be wrong to think that there was only a small difference of one realm between the large success stage and the great circle stage. For mastery of a martial technique, it was as far apart as heaven and earth.The great circle stage would mean training the martial technique to the pinnacle, without any further room for improvements. Except for those monsters who possessed incredible comprehension, it would be very difficult to train a martial technique to the great circle stage.As for the legendary breaking illusion stage, it would mean to break out of the great circle stage and create an alternate possibility; a sort of evolution from the original martial technique.The requirements needed to train a martial technique to the breaking illusion stage were so harsh that it made one's hair stand on its end. That was why it was considered a legendary stage. Generally speaking, training a martial technique to the great circle stage represented attaining the highest stage.Chou Yin had always been somewhat confident of his movements, but he did not want to lose to a silkpants.\"You flattered me. But there are no bonus marks. You still have to die,\" Ye Yuan said lightly.\"Hahaha!\" As if he just heard a hilarious joke, Chou Yin laughed wildly before saying, \"To not know the immensity of heaven and earth! I admit that my movements are inferior when compared to you. But I don't think those two people beside you also have movement techniques at the great circle stage, do they? I'd like to see how a weak silkpants at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm like you going to receive my blow directly!\"Chou Ying was a veteran in battles. After missing that one strike, he immediately looked for another way. Obviously, the two people beside Ye Yuan were his biggest weakness.Tang Yu was still fine, but Lu-er was a lamb waiting to be slaughtered in Chou Ying's eyes.Your movement technique is fast? What's the use of you being fast if I force you to fight me head-on?Yet at this moment, that wild smile froze on his face; what replaced it was bafflement.Because at this moment, Ye Yuan's aura started to increase explosively under everyone's perception.Peak Third Level Essence Qi Realm!Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm!Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm!Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!Ye Yuan's cultivation realm broke through its bottleneck from the Third Level Essence Qi Realm to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm and continued rising rapidly; all the way until it pa.s.sed the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm before stopping.Looking at this scene, Chou Ying was dumbstruck and forgot to make his move for a moment.\"H-how is this possible?\" Chou Ying sucked in a cold breath.He suddenly recalled the scene where Ye Yuan swallowed the medicinal pill and thought to himself; could this possibly be the effects of that medicinal pill?Even though he had heard that some medicinal pills were able to increase strength temporarily, this was his first time seeing a medicinal pill which could increase three small cultivation realms in a row.Chou Ying could not help but think that if he had a medicinal pill like this, wouldn't completing missions be as simple as cutting up vegetables?Yet the reality was that a rookie who had a difference of four small cultivation realms from him, in a blink of an eye, created a gap by only one small cultivation realm than him . . .Although the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm and the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm were not on the same level, without a doubt, Ye Yuan indeed possessed the capital to fight with him now. Coupled with his Instant Flash being at the great circle stage, it might be possible for Ye Yuan to battle him.Chou Ying suddenly felt that today was very bizarre. This brat in front of him had truly given him too many surprises. Initially, he was still grumbling about how this mission was too simple. Now, he could not help but somewhat regretted taking on this mission.However, regardless of what happens, the mission had to be completed. Otherwise, he would most likely lose the status he earned painstakingly in Mosha.Apparently, the reason why Chou Ying was still thinking about completing the mission was that even after Ye Yuan swallowed the Five Elements Spirit Link Pill, his cultivation realm ultimately had stopped at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.This was a cultivation realm that he could handle.Narrowing both eyes, the killing intent from Chou Yin firmly locked onto Lu-er.\"One Word Kill!\"Chou Ying immediately made his strongest move which he had used to finish off countless opponents in the past.One Word Kill; simple and straightforward, yet it was domineering. A straightforward move that was not flashy at all.Lu-er stood there completely unable to react as the sword already reached in front of her.A hideous smile flashed across Chou Ying's face as if he could see the beauty, Lu-er, was dying, and the image of Ye Yuan's heart-wrenching grief.However, just as Chou Ying's sword was about to pierce Lu-er's throat . . .Ding!His hand which was gripping his sword became numb, and the short sword which had never left his side was sent flying away.A terrifying strength was transmitted, and Chou Ying was sent flying away as well.At the critical moment just now, Ye Yuan reached Lu-er with Instant Flash, while his attack which was released after, struck first.He only stretched his finger out and tapped lightly, accurately hitting Chou Ying's short sword and sent it flying!Absolute Yang Finger!Ye Yuan's Absolute Yang Finger already had some progress, reaching the entry stage after several days of cultivation.A martial technique of this rank obviously was not so easy to learn. To have reached the entry stage within a few days showed how outstanding Ye Yuan's talent was.Even though it was only the entry stage of Absolute Yang Finger, executing it with Ye Yuan's current Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm was not something that Chou Ying could withstand.Chou Ying rolled on the ground. Puhwark! He spat out a mouthful of blood.Looking at Chou Ying, Ye Yuan said coldly, \"I will only use one finger. Whether you can escape or not, it is up to your abilities.\"Right now, Chou Ying's innards were in mayhem. But he knew that he had hit a hard plate. This brat was clearly pretending to be a pig in order to eat a tiger! He was too strong!Forcefully suppressing his injuries, Chou Ying could not be bothered to care about anything else and started to wildly circulate all the essence energy in his body.He wanted to flee!Chou Ying could feel Ye Yuan's surging killing intent. Clearly, his actions to kill Lu-er just now had thoroughly infuriated Ye Yuan.Chou Ying used all the strength in his body to escape. He could even feel that his current speed was faster than it had ever been before. It was so fast that his movement technique had touched the threshold of the great circle stage.This discovery made him ecstatic with joy!I can escape!I definitely can escape!Chou Ying was screaming in his mind, and then his consciousness gradually blurred . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Good Dogs Don't Get UnderfootPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: Good Dogs Don't Get UnderfootTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorWatching Chou Ying utilized his movement technique to try to escape, Ye Yuan raised his finger leisurely and channeled essence energy with all his might using the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.A finger pointed forward, and a formless force shot out from Ye Yuan's finger. It tore through the air, penetrating Chou Ying's heart in an instant.The force was so swift and fierce that Chou Ying did not even notice his injury. His body continued charging forward for several meters more, collapsing only after he lost consciousness.Absolute Yang Finger was incomparably domineering. The force shot out concentrated instead of dispersing, resulting in an incredibly powerful pinpoint and deadly attack. Being executed using Ye Yuan's Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm strength, its lethality obviously could not be underestimated.Of course, Absolute Yang Finger was not without any weaknesses. The biggest flaw was that it took too long to charge up. That was also the reason why Ye Yuan was slower by a beat when saving Lu-er just now.In reality, if Chou Ying recklessly tangled with Ye Yuan in close proximity, leaving Ye Yuan unable to charge up his full strength, he might have a slim chance of survival.But the various means used by Ye Yuan had long made Chou Ying wanted to withdraw from the fight. Especially when Ye Yuan had sent him flying with only one finger. This shocked Chou Ying's state of mind greatly that made him wanted to flee at all cost.Yet this attempt to escape gave Ye Yuan the chance to charge up.From the beginning, Ye Yuan looked as if he was careless. But in reality, he advanced gradually, entrenching himself firmly at every step.First, he used words to agitate Chou Ying, disrupting his state of heart. Next, he displayed Instant Flash. Following which, he swallowed the Five Element Spirit Link Pill, using his finger to overpower his opponent's sword, crus.h.i.+ng Chou Ying's confidence step by step. Finally, he launched this certain kill strike.It might have looked bland, but the entire process was filled with trepidation.Although Ye Yuan had a lot of hidden cards, his strength was still too weak. If it was not for the fact that he swallowed the Five Element Spirit Link Pill and unleashed the Absolute Yang Finger with his full strength, he would not have been able to do anything to Chou Ying.\"Brother Tang, it is time to go,\" Ye Yuan said to Tang Yu lightly, not even bothering to look at Chou Ying who was lying on the ground.Tang Yu was shocked by Ye Yuan's attack and stood there dumbfounded the entire time. Only when Ye Yuan called him did he recover from his shock.\"Ah? Oh . . . Go . . . Go.\"Tang Yu mounted his horse awkwardly, and the three of them continued heading towards the Dan Wu Academy.. . . . . .Pa.s.sing through this stretch of messy stone forest, their field of vision gradually widened. In front of their eyes was a vast plain, and they were able to indistinctly make out what looks like multi-storied pavilions.It was the Dan Wu Academy!The State of Qin established itself through martial arts, with a strong emphasis on the Martial Dao. However, this Dan Wu Academy was not established by the State of Qin.The domain south of the Endless Forest was hailed as the Tranquil Cloud Ten Nations. There were a total of ten nations, and the State of Qin was only one of them. The reason why they were collectively known as the Tranquil Cloud Ten Nations was that these ten nations were all under the jurisdiction of the Tranquil Cloud Sect; the Dan Wu Academy was the outer sect establishment of the Tranquil Cloud Sect.The Tranquil Cloud Sect established its sect fundamentally with alchemy; even so, the sect's internal hierarchy could be divided into the Pill Faction and the Martial Faction. This was why the outer sect establishment was named the Dan Wu Academy. 1Just as the three of them entered the gates and were about to head to the residential area, they were stopped by a bunch of people.\"Yoh! Isn't this the Ten Thousand Years Last Place? Well, aren't you a tough one. When they sent you out, you were clearly breathing in but not breathing out. To think you had actually returned alive and kicking,\" the person in front of them exclaimed, clearly with sarcasm.He was called Fei Qingping, a loyal lackey of Wan Yuan. Ye Yuan's predecessor was poisoned because of competing with this fellow and ended up losing his life.These several people in front of them all came from ordinary backgrounds. In the Dan Wu Academy, in order for those with ordinary backgrounds to obtain additional resources, many would choose to attach themselves to figures from the n.o.ble families. Only those who truly had outstanding talent would be heavily groomed by the academy.\"Good dogs don't get underfoot, get lost.\" Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him. Would he not be demeaning his own status to act seriously against a dog?\"You! Ye Yuan, looks like your skin is itching again!\" For someone like Fei Qingping, it was a taboo for other people to scold him a dog.\"With just you?\" Ye Yuan asked expressionlessly.\"Yoh. After not seeing you for a few days, you became even more brain-damaged. You First Level Essence Qi Realm . . . Yii . . . How's that possible? Y-you are already at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm?\" Fei Qingping had only just sized him up, and could not help but to draw a cold breath. Ye Yuan was originally at the bottom place. After a few days of not seeing him, he actually rose two level consecutively, stepping into the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.Fei Qingping still thought that he had seen wrongly, and he checked closely again before realizing that Ye Yuan was indeed already at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. Wasn't this a little too heaven-defying?\"Are your dog-eyes blind? Still can't tell after staring for so long?\" Ye Yuan's words once again made the corner of Fei Qingping's mouth twitched.However, at this moment, Fei Qingping had already recovered from the initial shock and thought of a certain possibility.He naturally knew that Ye Yuan's father, Ye Hang, was an Alchemy Grandmaster. If he spared no expenses, pulling his son up by two small cultivation realms was not something incomprehensible.As a matter of fact, there were plenty of methods to suddenly raise strength in this manner. But the price would be to sacrifice one's potential.It was said that there was an evil technique called Ghee Empowerment. The empowered individual could even directly break through the Essence Qi Realm and reach the Spirit Condensation Realm. But the price of this sort of empowerment was that it would no longer be possible for the person to increase his strength throughout his lifetime.Only a few days had pa.s.sed, yet Ye Yuan actually reached the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. Ye Hang should have known that his son's talent was inadequate; therefore, he was afraid his son would be bullied. So he used a method similar to the Ghee Empowerment to raise him by two levels.Linking all of these together, Fei Qingping gave a cold laugh in his heart. A rookie like this, forget about being at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, even if he were at the Fourth Level, at the Fifth Level, Ye Yuan would not be his match.Fei Qingping was at Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, higher than Ye Yuan by one stage. Thus, he naturally had no need to fear him.\"Hehehe. It's great to have a good father. Poisoned to such extent, and yet you still didn't die. Even increasing strength becomes so simple. This is really an era for competing with fathers!\" Fei Qingping said mockingly.Ye Yuan knew what Fei Qingping was thinking right away, but he obviously would not explain to him. Instead, he smiled and said, \"That's right. I can compete using my father, but can you? I heard that your father is a watchdog for other people, using connections to let you entered the Dan Wu Academy. But who would have thought that after coming here, you would also become a watchdog. Indeed, a son will inherit his father's career! One gate and two watchdogs; impressive, impressive!\"Ye Yuan learned from his predecessor's memories that this Fei Qingping's father was the confidant of Wan Donghai, and he entered the academy through the Wan Family's connections. Otherwise, with his talent, he could not possibly join the academy.It would be wrong to think that he and Tang Yu were both the same, being at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Fei Qingping was two years older than Tang Yu. He was also a commoner but had the support of the Wan Family's resources. Yet, this Fei Qingping was only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. In the future, at best he would be at the early stage Spirit Condensation Realm, or he might just even be stuck at the Essence Qi Realm.'You . . .!\" Fei Qingping's lungs were about to explode in anger. Ye Yuan repeatedly calling him dog made him lose all of his face.Fei Qingping looked at his companions, and even though n.o.body laughed out loud, he could tell from everyone's face that they were all just barely holding their laughter back.\"What about me? You want to bite me?\" Ye Yuan stretched out an arm, and with a smile, he said, \"Here, for you to bite.\"\"Hahaha!\" This time around, everyone could not bear it any longer, and they all started to laugh.Watching everyone ridiculed him, Fei Qingping face turned into the color of a pig's liver.\"Ye Yuan! I want to issue a deathmatch to you! Accept it if you have the guts!\" Fei Qingping pointed at Ye Yuan angrily.The Dan Wu Academy did not forbid private battles among student. Instead, they tacitly accepted the friction between students. However, there was a point to take note, which was under no circ.u.mstances were they allowed to kill someone without permission from the academy. Otherwise, the person would face the wrath of the academy.However, if both parties agreed to set a life-and-death contract, not only academy will not stop it, an instructor would even be sent to host the deathmatch.Ye Yuan revealed a surprised expression and asked, \"You really want to carry out a deathmatch?\"\"Scared? If you are scared, then kneel and kowtow three times loudly for me. Afterward, say 'I'm a dog' three times!\" Fei Qingping thought that Ye Yuan was scared and continued to goad him.Previously, he also used this sort of tactic to make Ye Yuan agreed to the previous compet.i.tion.Ye Yuan stretched his ear out and pretended he did not hear clearly, asking, \"Say what three times?\"\"Say 'I'm a dog' three times!\" Right when the words left Fei Qingping's mouth, he realized he fell for it.\"Hahaha!\"The surrounding people laughed out loud again.Fei Qingping wished he could give himself two tight slaps. He shouted angrily, \"Ye Yuan, you coward! Playing this sort of little games when you don't dare to fight!\"\"Good dog, so obedient! Your Grandpa Ye has never looked at the owner before hitting the dog. Since you delivered yourself to my door, I will hit for your owner to see,\" Ye Yuan said with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Yellow Rank's first ranking from the bottom, the one hailed as the Ten Thousand Years Last Place, Ye Yuan, had just signed a life-and-death contract with someone.\"\"Of course I've heard. Don't you think that he's tired of living? However, it's been over two years since a life-and-death contract had appeared in the academy. This is considered news big enough for everyone to discuss for some time.\"\"Yeah, it's been two years and five months now. The previous life-and-death contract was signed by Senior Apprentice Brother Long. Back then, he was also a Yellow Rank student, yet he triumphed against his opponent who was two minor realms higher than him. I'm afraid that back then, n.o.body would have thought that he could charge to the first place in the Martial Roll of Honor after two years.\"\"That is true. Senior Apprentice Brother Long didn't even reveal his abilities completely back then. Ever since he finished off his opponent in that deathmatch, he became unstoppable. charging all the way through into the Heaven Rank, and finally being at the first place in the Martial Roll of Honor.\"Hey, do you think that this punk Ye Yuan can also defeat someone stronger than him and finish off his opponent? Rumors have it that this fellow only used a few days to advance two levels, and he actually went straight from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\"No way! How can he be compared to Senior Apprentice Brother Long? Back then, even though Senior Apprentice Brother Long was low-key, he wasn't weak to this extent. Advancing two levels at once? Don't you know that fellow, Ye Yuan, entered the academy through an enormous backdoor? His father is one of the few Alchemy Grandmasters within our State of Qin. With his means, what's so strange about pulling the shots and helping his son improved by two levels? This sort of advancement is all empty, so what combat power can there be?\"\"That is true. I heard that this fellow had already entered the academy for half a year. If he could advance, he would have done so long ago and would not wait till now. Now that I look at it, it is most likely he used a secret technique to raise his strength.\"\"Hehehe. That fellow really doesn't know life from death. Supposedly, he competed in neutralizing poison with that Fei Qingping, but he ended up almost poisoned to death. His father is pretty impressive to have been able to save him. Yet he is courting death again right after returning to the academy. Do you think this fellow's brain is missing a screw?\"The Dan Wu Academy divided strength into four ranks of Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow. Ye Yuan and Fei Qingping both belonged in the Yellow Rank.Initially, the academy's attention was concentrated mainly on the Heaven Rank. Very few people paid attention to topics pertaining to people of the Yellow Rank. However, after Ye Yuan and Fei Qingping signed the life-and-death contract, it attracted a great deal of attention and became major news in the entire academy.Even though the academy silently acknowledged the compet.i.tions and fights between students, it would not permit any death. There was once a student who relied on his family's ill.u.s.trious background and killed somebody in the Dan Wu Academy. The end result was that he was murdered forcefully by the academy, bearing no room for discussion. In the end, that particular n.o.ble family did not even dare to make any noise.But a life-and-death contract was different. The instructors would not make a move no matter who live or die.In the entire Dan Wu Academy, everyone knew the one in the first place in the Martial Roll of Honor was Long Tang. But not everybody knew the person in the last place was Ye Yuan. However, this life-and-death contract quickly spread Ye Yuan's reputation, almost reaching Long Tang's level.Of course, the majority was like how these two people were discussing, snorting in derision at Ye Yuan's brain-damaged actions.Ye Yuan's rapid improvement in strength was also naturally one of the focal points. But n.o.body thought that it was something he cultivated out by himself. Everyone felt that it was surely Ye Hang who used some secret technique to pull the shots in order to help it grow, letting him reached the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.Hence, everyone's appraisal of Ye Yuan was that he was brain-damaged, foolish, and rus.h.i.+ng to meet King Yama.Just as these two people were discussing, someone suddenly said in a low voice, \"Yiii? Look over there. Isn't that Ye Yuan?\"\"That's him? He doesn't look like someone who is brain-damaged.\"\"Sigh. Who would write brain-damaged on their faces?\"That's true. The deathmatch is three days later. Where is he going instead of making preparations?\"\"He probably knows that it's hopeless to do anything right now. Being at the first place from the bottom, no matter how heaven-defying, he can't possibly jump ranks to defeat an opponent one level higher than him? I heard that because Fei Qingping is older by two years, he is already at the top 10 in Yellow Rank.\"\"Something is wrong. The direction he is heading to seems to be the Scripture Library. Is he trying to hug Buddha's feet in his hour of need?\"\"Hehehe. How can Buddha's leg be that easy to hug? Yiii? He was stopped by someone. That person seemed to be Wan Yuan who just advanced to Earth Rank.\"\"Oh yeah. You see that girl beside Wan Yuan? Wow. That's my G.o.ddess, Liu Ruoshui. If she will speak even a word to me, I would die happy!\"\"Look at your starstruck expression, but yeah, Liu Ruoshui is really beautiful . . .\". . . . . .Ye Yuan was about to head to the Scripture Library.His top-grade predecessor was too prodigious. Everything he heard during cla.s.ses was all bits and pieces without much useful information. Ye Yuan needed to find some martial techniques to deal with the situation.Ye Yuan had countless martial techniques on hand, but he truly did not have anything suitable for a person at the Essence Qi Realm to cultivate. With his position in his previous life, how could Essence Qi Realm martial techniques, regardless of how exceptional, enter his eyes?Who would have thought that he would encounter Wan Yuan on the way to the Scripture Library?Looks like Wan Yuan was intentionally waiting for him. As for Liu Ruoshui by Wan Yuan's side, Ye Yuan naturally was not strangers with her. A few days ago, he competed with Fei Qingping precisely because of this woman.\"What a coincidence! Isn't this Young master Ye? Where are you rus.h.i.+ng to so hurriedly? To reincarnate?\" Wan Yuan was full of smiles, but his eyes were as if looking at a dead person.Ye Yuan sneered unceasingly towards Wan Yuan's impatient mentality. Wan Yuan determined that Ye Yuan was definitely going to be dead this time, so he came in advance to taunt him.After the deathmatch, Ye Yuan would surely be dead. Where would Wan Yuan go to find this sort of pleasure after this?Looking at Wan Yuan's appearance, Ye Yuan no longer hurried towards the Scripture Library. With a smile, he said, \"That's right, to reincarnate. But it's to send you off for reincarnation.\"Hearing this, Wan Yuan laughed out loud and said, \"Send me off to reincarnate? Hahaha! I'm standing right here. Send me to reincarnate if you can! You can't possibly think that just because you cultivated to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm through some unorthodox means, you can challenge me?\"Liu Ruoshui who was by the side also covered her mouth with her hand and chuckled, thinking that Ye Yuan was very amusing.This Liu Ruoshui's every action carried a trace of seductive charm, able to stir that desire lying in every man's heart. The male students in the Dan Wu Academy were all hot-blooded youths. If their willpower were not steadfast, how could they withstand this sort of natural seductive charm?His predecessor was only a very foolish and naive child. His strength was also weak to the extreme. How could he withstand Liu Ruoshui's charms?Back then, Liu Ruoshui was by his side, behaving neither friendly nor aloof for a period of time, and his predecessor completely fell for it. Afterward, Liu Ruoshui used a few small tricks, and his predecessor got hooked obediently, losing his life just like that.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Wan, this Junior Apprentice Brother Ye is an interesting man. He's clearly a miserable wretch, yet he tries to learn from others like a toad l.u.s.ting after a swan. His strength is clearly poor, yet he wants to slap his face until it's swollen to look impressive. He's about to duel with someone, yet he is even threatening you now. Don't you think it is funny?\" Liu Ruoshui was beautiful like a flower, yet her words were bitterly sarcastic.In order to hook Ye Yuan in the past, she naturally had to pretend to be weak and pitiful. Now that Ye Yuan was about to duel with Fei Qingping, he was already a dead man. So she no longer needed to humor Ye Yuan. She fully expressed out the contempt and condescension in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Grabbing AirPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: Grabbing AirTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorNow that Liu Ruoshui and Wan Yuan showed up together, it was clear what they were trying to convey. Before this, not many people knew that the academy's Earth rank G.o.ddess had already walked so intimately with Wan Yuan.By bringing Liu Ruoshui here, Wan Yuan wanted to humiliate Ye Yuan by letting him see the woman he dreamed of was already walking together with his rival.He was looking forward to Ye Yuan's expressions of resentment, shame, as well as regret. But Ye Yuan's reaction disappointed him, as not one of these expressions appeared on Ye Yuan's face.From the start till the end, Ye Yuan never even looked at Liu Ruoshui, treating her like air. And it was precisely being ignored by Ye Yuan that angered Liu Ruoshui, making her words just now so venomous.Liu Ruoshui was rather confident in her appearance. In her opinion, Ye Yuan should be groveling right now, begging her in tears not to go.If it was his predecessor, he might really have lost all control and did just that. But sadly, the Ye Yuan now was no longer the Ye Yuan of the past. With Ye Yuan's status in his previous life, what kind of beauty he had not seen before? It was impossible to try to use such a cheap tactic to seduce him.Ye Yuan gave Liu Ruoshui an emotionless glance and said, \"A swan? Aren't you overthinking things? At best, you are a defeathered chicken. How can you be compared with a n.o.ble animal such as a swan? How can a true proud daughter of heaven spare any thoughts to seduce men? When have you seen Senior Apprentice Sister Feng flirt with other men? G.o.ddesses all have their own pride and wouldn't be the way you are.\"Liu Ruoshui was a prideful person. In the Dan Wu Academy, she was always an existence surrounded by a group of admirers. When had anyone ever compared her to a defeathered chicken?Liu Ruoshui was so angry that her willowy eyebrows were almost vertical. Yet, she could not refute it, because the Senior Apprentice Sister Feng mentioned by Ye Yuan was indeed an existence far beyond her reach.Senior Apprentice Sister Feng was called Feng Zhiruo, a true proud daughter of heaven within the Dan Wu Academy. Not only was she a beauty who could cause the downfall of countries, but she was also among the top three in both Alchemy Roll of Honor and Martial Roll of Honor with strength not at all inferior to Long Tang. She was a person that a woman like Liu Ruoshui could not compare to.Feng Zhiruo never bothered with pursuers, something different from Liu Ruoshui. She was a famous ice beauty in the Dan Wu Academy.In comparison, Liu Ruoshui was much more popular because she did not reject her pursuers. So she appeared very warm. Also, she extremely relished the feeling of being sought after by everyone.\"Hmph! How stubborn! I will let Fei Qingping take good care of you during the deathmatch!\" In Liu Ruoshui's opinion, it was not that Ye Yuan was not willing to look at her, but it was because he was forcefully controlling himself after finding out the truth.\"Hahaha. Then there is no need for you to worry. Did the two of you come to find me just to say this? Since you are done, I won't entertain you anymore.\"After saying these words, Ye Yuan directly walked pa.s.sed them.\"Who permitted you to leave?\" Wan Yuan's face fell, and he made a move to grab Ye Yuan. But who would have thought he only grabbed the air, not even touching the corner of Ye Yuan's sleeve.Looking at Ye Yuan again, he was already several meters away. He even waved to the two of them with his back facing them and strutted away, angering Wan Yuan until his face turned green.\"Hiss . . . Was that . . . Instant Flash?\" Wan Yuan frowned and asked.\"That's right. It was indeed Instant Flash.\" Liu Ruoshui lightly furrowed her brows. Clearly, she was also stunned by Ye Yuan's move.\"Looks like there is really something odd about this punk. Father clearly arranged for an a.s.sa.s.sin, yet Ye Yuan simply swaggered into the academy. I don't know whether that a.s.sa.s.sin was too stupid, or was that punk really pretending to be a pig in order to eat a tiger.\"\"In my opinion, it is likely the former. He is only at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. No matter how powerful his Instant Flash is, most likely he will not be able to escape from that a.s.sa.s.sin, right?\" Liu Ruoshui interacted quite a bit with Ye Yuan before, so she had some understanding of him. In her eyes, Ye Yuan was just a useless person.\"Junior Apprentice Sister Liu's words make sense. But I wonder since when did he learn Instant Flash? With this move, wouldn't he be in an undefeatable position in his deathmatch with Qingping?\"Wan Yuan had always been competing with Ye Yuan since they were young. So he understood Ye Yuan the best. After thinking about it, Liu Ruoshui's words still made more sense.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Wan is panicking because of concern. From the way I see it, Ye Yuan only learned Instant Flash by a fluke. The only move he can rely on is most likely just this. Otherwise, why would he be rus.h.i.+ng to the Scripture Library at this time? Just now, Senior Apprentice Brother Wan was only careless and didn't use your full strength. That's why he could get away. Even though Instant Flash is impressive, it is ultimately only a middle-grade Tier 1 martial technique and isn't invincible.\" Liu Ruoshui had already recovered from her astonishment and returned to being a soul-mesmerizing G.o.ddess.Wan Yuan had long l.u.s.ted after Liu Ruoshui. Seeing Liu Ruoshui chased after him like this made him drunk with pleasure. Just now, he indeed had not used his full strength. It was about 70% power, yet Ye Yuan still managed to dodge it.However, strength was still the key to victory. Movement techniques were ultimately auxiliary. What Liu Ruoshui said was right. Instant Flash is not all-powerful. Naturally, some techniques could counter it.Except that this move from Ye Yuan raised Wan Yuan's alert. He would have to go back and properly warn Fei Qingping to not underestimate his opponent.\"Looks like Junior Apprentice Sister Liu's heart is as clear as a mirror. This time around, no matter what, we can't let this brat live on anymore. Looks like we have to go back and prepare a few hidden cards for Fei Qingping.\". . . . . .After Ye Yuan shook those two off, he went directly to the Scripture Library.As far as he was concerned, Ye Yuan did not mind revealing Instant Flash. That was not what he was relying on anyway. Furthermore, what he just displayed was only at the great success stage.Ye Yuan's greatest reliance was naturally on the Absolute Yang Finger. But this technique could not be displayed in front of outsiders, or else he would get into a lot of trouble. Hence, he came to the Scripture Library in order to choose a martial technique.The martial techniques in the Scripture Library were not too profound. The Tranquil Cloud Sect naturally would not release profound martial techniques out into the secular world. But to Ye Yuan, these martial techniques were sufficient.\"Senior Apprentice Brother, I would like to enter the Scripture Library to choose two martial techniques,\" Ye Yuan requested and handed over his ident.i.ty token to the Senior Apprentice Brother on duty.The Senior Apprentice Brother who was guarding the Scripture Library was Zhao Chunyang of the Earth Rank. When he saw the token with the symbol indicating Yellow Rank status, disdain could be seen from his eyes.The ident.i.ty token was created by the Dan Wu Academy which represented one's status as a student. As long as one inserted a bit of essence energy, one would be able to check the ident.i.ty of the person the token belongs to.\"Ye Yuan?\" Zhao Chunyang seemed to feel that he heard that name somewhere before. After pondering a while, he came to a sudden realization and asked, \"You are the academy's last place, Ye Yuan?\"Ye Yuan smiled and replied, \"If there isn't a second Ye Yuan, then that would be me.\"Ye Yuan was not bothered by the t.i.tle of the last place as that was all in the past.Hearing this, Zhao Chunyang became interested. Handing the token back to Ye Yuan, he held on to him and asked curiously, \"You are a big favorite within the academy now. The last place actually dares to sign a life-and-death contract with others. Just what were you thinking?\"Ye Yuan also did not intend to keep a distance away from Zhou Chunyang, so he smiled and answered, \"Others already rode onto my head. I can't possibly behave like a coward. Don't you think so?\"\"Hahaha. That's true. But your strength . . .\" Zhao Chunyang was an outspoken person and was not afraid that other people would feel awkward.\"Hahaha. That's why I'm here to choose martial techniques.\"\"Sharpening your spear at the last moment, even if it's not sharp, it is at least s.h.i.+ny. These words are not wrong, but there are only three days left. Isn't that a little too short?\"\"That's something that can't be helped. I believe Senior Apprentice Brother is also aware that I neglected cultivation in the past which led to my poor foundation. Even if it is only three days, it is better than not doing anything. Isn't that right?\"Zhao Chunyang sized up Ye Yuan once again and suddenly smiled, and then he said, \"Interesting. You seem to be quite different from the rumors. Go in then. You have two hours.\"\"Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother.\"Zhao Chunyang patted Ye Yuan's shoulders and said with a smile, \"Choose well. I will cheer for you when the time comes.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Stacking Waves Layered PalmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: Stacking Waves Layered PalmTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThe Dan Wu Academy's Scripture Library was divided into three sections. The second section was only opened for those who were in the Spirit Condensation Realm. The current Ye Yuan naturally had no right to enter.The first section collected Tier 1 martial techniques. It was just perfect for the current Ye Yuan to use.The entire section was packed with bookshelves. There were cultivation laws, martial techniques, as well as books related to Tier 1 Medicinal Pills. They were sorted out into categories and encompa.s.sed everything.These books were all stone rubbings. 1 The originals were naturally kept at Tranquil Cloud Sect Headquarters.Concerning cultivation laws, Ye Yuan was already cultivating the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. Naturally, there wasn't any need to cultivate others.And these books on medicinal pills did not even count as introductory to Ye Yuan. So they were automatically filtered out by him.Only Tier 1 martial techniques were useful to the current Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan went to the area of bookshelves where martial techniques were kept and started to search for a martial technique suitable for him.Casually picking up a book, he saw Blazing Palm was written on it. It was a middle-grade Tier 1 martial technique with fire attribute.Flipping through the contents, Ye Yuan shook his head. This sort of martial technique was too crude. There was no depth at all, and the power was too weak as well.Even though the book bragged until flowers were cascading from the sky, with Ye Yuan's insights, why would he eye this sort of martial technique?Placing the Blazing Palm book back onto the shelf, Ye Yuan casually looked through several martial techniques. They were mainly martial techniques on the same level as Blazing Palm, flashy without substance.As time slowly pa.s.sed, Ye Yuan already looked through several dozen books, yet not even a single one entered his eyes.Ye Yuan could not help but sigh, thinking that this Tranquil Cloud Sect was so stingy, using these common goods to put up a front.But after thinking about it, he felt relieved. Cultivation laws and martial techniques were the foundation of a sect. How could truly important cultivation laws be casually placed out in the secular world?Ye Yuan knew that it was impossible to find a martial technique he wanted on this rack of shelves, so he walked deeper in.The martial techniques on this rack of shelves were clearly much lesser, but the quality increased by a grade. They basically reached high-grade Tier 1.Flipping through several books, Ye Yuan still did not encounter anything he was satisfied with.It was not that he had nothing better to do, but instead, he wanted to see if there were any beneficial insights within these martial techniques.To Ye Yuan, a middle-grade Tier 1 and a superior-grade Tier 1 did not have too much of a difference. A lower grade martial technique might not be bad, while a higher grade martial technique might not be good.Just take Instant Flash for instance. It was only a middle-grade Tier 1 martial technique, but this martial technique had some distinctive aspect. So Ye Yuan tinkered with it.Ye Yuan had just seen this Instant Flash martial technique. Briefly skimming through it, he knew that the insight of its creator was still too low. What he had altered was already much stronger than what was written in the book. Obviously, there wasn't any more meaning to researching it.Walking further in, there were no longer books on the shelves but a scattered bunch of jade pieces. Ye Yuan know that this was where the essence of the first layer laid.Highly profound martial techniques could not be recorded down on paper. Only jade pieces could record or replicate it.Ye Yuan used his essence energy to inspect several jade pieces. These martial techniques were all high-grade Tier 1 martial techniques. These were actually already very rare.Any single piece of these jade, when placed in the outside world, were objects worth cities. After all, Essence Qi Realm martial artists made up the largest portion of the population in the State of Qin, and the vast majority of them cultivated either low-grade or middle-grade martial techniques.One high-grade martial technique jade piece to them was something they could only dream of. It was enough for their strength to immediately increase by one stage.However, Ye Yuan did not have much interest in these high-grade martial techniques. He only looked a while before putting them back.Ye Yuan had already walked to the deepest part of the first layer. If he still could not find a martial technique he was satisfied with, he could only settle with these high-grade martial techniques.On the last shelf were only three jade pieces.Clearly, these three jade pieces were not the same as the others.Ye Yuan picked up the first jade piece, injected essence energy, and the information within the jade piece reflected in Ye Yuan's mind.Thousand Feet Leap, a movement technique!When mastered to the large success stage, it could shrink the distance to inches and traverse a thousand feet in an instant.\"A bit interesting.\"Ye Yuan inspected the details of the Thousand Feet Leap. This movement technique had its unique points. Compared to Instant Flash, the Thousand Feet Leap's movement in a straight line was more outstanding. It was somewhat useful regardless of whether using it to sneak attack or flee.This movement technique already reached the superior-grade Tier 1.Placing the Thousand Feet Leap jade piece back on the shelf, Ye Yuan picked up a second jade piece. It was a rarely seen lightning-attribute martial technique which was extremely difficult to learn. Grade wise, it was similar to the Thousand Feet Leap.Although it might be difficult, it did not draw much interest from Ye Yuan.He casually picked up the third jade piece and investigated it.\"En? Stacking Waves Layered Palm . . . Incomplete martial technique? Estimated to be at least Tier 3 and above. It's just that it is incomplete, causing its current grade to fall to the high-grade Tier 1 category?\"Ye Yuan was attracted by the jade piece's introduction.But it was not because this martial technique's grade was high. Tier 3 martial techniques were not exactly high-tier martial techniques to Ye Yuan.What truly attracted him was that this martial technique was a martial technique that paid great attention to the way strength was utilized. When mastered, it could release multiple times, even several dozen times of one's power. The might of it was very substantial.The introduction on this jade piece should have been left behind by a powerful figure from either the Tranquil Cloud Sect or the Dan Wu Academy. If one could execute this technique to its limits, jumping ranks during battle would simply be like eating rice and drinking water.\" Ye Yuan sighed in admiration.Naturally, Ye Yuan also knew that this kind of martial technique would become harder to improve on as it progressed further. The difficulty of it would increase multiple times.Simply put, it was easy to release twice the power. But the difficulty would increase for four times. After that, it becomes eight times, 16 times, and even 32 times. The further one advanced, the more terrifying it became. Naturally, the difficulty would also become increasingly immense.Even so, this was a rather amazing martial technique. But sadly, it was way too incomplete.. . . . . .\"En? You chose this martial technique?\" Looking at the martial technique Ye Yuan chose, Zhao Chunyang was very surprised.\"That's right.\" Ye Yuan long knew that Zhao Chunyang would be shocked.\"But . . . This martial technique might be powerful, but it's incomplete.\"Zhao Chunyang tried persuading Ye Yuan.\"I know, but this martial technique looks very impressive. I will put up with it first. We will talk about it again in the future,\" Ye Yuan smiled and then replied him.\"Not only it is incomplete, but also exceedingly difficult to learn. You know Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang, don't you? He also once tried to learn this technique, but in the end, he gave up. This technique looks amazing, but it's an arduous yet fruitless labor. Three days . . . Even if you are brilliant, at best you can learn the First Layer Wave. It wouldn't be much use against your opponent, right?\"Actually, Zhao Chunyang's words were already very implicit. In his opinion, even if Ye Yuan spent a month's time, he might not be able to learn the First Layer Wave.What was the concept of the First Layer Wave? Just the increment of two times the power simply could not compensate for the difference in strength between Ye Yuan and Fei Qingping.Rather than that, it might be better to just learn a more practical martial technique.Ye Yuan had a rather good impression towards this Zhao Chunyang. At least he did not see himself as a joke like the others. So he smiled and then said, \"Many thanks for your concern, Senior Apprentice Brother. But I have my own plans. As for the deathmatch three days from now, I think I can handle it.\"\"This . . . Alright then. Since you insist, I will not persuade you anymore. Try your best.\" Zhao Chunyang shook his head and could only sigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just kill him! This punk's life is really tough! The last time he was sent back, he was already not breathing. Who would have thought that after a few days, he would be alive and kicking? This time, I will definitely not give him any chance.\"Fei Qingping's words were filled with contempt as if full of disdain towards Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan and Wan Yuan grew up competing with one another, so the latter was also naturally very clear on Ye Yuan's nature as well as his strength. Therefore, he did not feel any burden to kill Ye Yuan during the deathmatch.With regards to Wan Yuan's question, Fei Qingping felt that it was very unusual, so he could not help but asked, \"Young Master Wan, listening to your words, you can't possibly be thinking that I will lose to him during this battle, right?\"Wan Yuan frowned and said, \"I would not go so far as to say lose to him. I just feel that this time around, after Ye Yuan returned, he is rather unusual. Like . . . somewhat different from the past.\"\" Sigh. I was wondering what it was. Of course, he's different, but isn't it just rising by two minor realms? However, from the way I see it, he will probably stay like this for the rest of his life. Hahaha! \"Although Fei Qingping was older than Wan Yuan by two years, he always treated the latter as the boss.Seeing how Fei Qingping was looking down on Ye Yuan like that, Wan Yuan felt that it was very inappropriate, and wanted to rebuke him. Yet, he also felt that Fei Qingping's opinion was correct.That joke who was like rotten mud that could not even support a wall; could he overturn the heaven?Although Fei Qingping was not some extraordinary talent, he was an experienced Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artist, merely a step away from the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm.The Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm and the Third Level Essence Qi Realm were not even on the same level. Thus, Fei Qingping had a good reason to look down on Ye Yuan.This small step was not so easy to cross over.The Dan Wu Academy was an academy for elites. Practically anyone here, when placed in the outside world, could jump ranks during battle.The resources they enjoyed, martial skills and techniques they learned, as well as guidance from accomplished teachers, all of these were not what those from the outside world could compare with.However, within the Dan Wu Academy, jumping ranks during a battle was a challenging thing to do. Unless one really had extraordinary talent.If Long Tang or Feng Zhiruo was only at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, Wan Yuan had no doubt that they could jump ranks to defeat Fei Qingping.But if it were Ye Yuan, even if he were to beat Wan Yuan to death, he would not believe it.Because he understood Ye Yuan too well!After a moment of silence, Wan Yuan still shook his head and said, \"Qingping, the deathmatch this time, you can only win. Defeat will not be tolerated. Even if Ye Yuan is only a rat, you have to go all out to defeat him. Bear in mind that you must not take him lightly, understood?\"Looking at Fei Qingping's careless att.i.tude regarding his words, Wan Yuan finally became angry. \"If you still have this att.i.tude, I will eliminate you first! You are not only representing yourself in this match. You will also be representing the Wan Family, the Drunken Star Manor! If you are defeated by Ye Yuan, where do you want my father and me to put our faces?!\"Wan Yuan's roar surprised Fei Qingping for a moment; his brain unable to react in time.But one thing was clear, and that was Wan Yuan really got angry!For Wan Yuan to be so concerned with Ye Yuan, that was something that had never happened before.\"I-I understand, I will go all out to finish him!\"Feeling Wan Yuan's wrath, Fei Qingping did not dare to be arrogant and meekly promised this.With a sigh, Wan Yuan said, \"Qingping, I know that you feel Ye Yuan isn't even worth looking at. Actually, isn't that the same for me? But this time around after he returned to the academy, I keep feeling that there's something off.\"\"Off? Off in what way?\" Fei Qingping could not help but became curious after Wan Yuan said that.He knew that even though Wan Yuan was younger than him by two years, he was very prudent in doing things, just like his father.Regardless of whether it was talent or intelligence, Fei Qingping was much worse than Wan Yuan. That was why he was sincerely convinced to be his follower.\"Today, I went to find him to destroy his spirit and give him some trouble. I used 70% of my power, but I failed to catch him! Who knows when that punk managed to learn Instant Flash and even trained it to the great success stage!\"\"What? Instant Flash?! Great success stage?! H-how is that possible?\"Fei Qingping was startled. He apparently knew what Instant Flash at the great success stage meant. It meant that Ye Yuan was already standing at an undefeatable position.If it was like this, Wan Yuan's warning was not an unnecessary action!As if he was confirming his exchange with Ye Yuan today, Wan Yuan mused for a moment before nodding his head, saying, \"That's right. It's Instant Flash at the great success stage!\"\"I-isn't that too shameless? How could he possibly manage to learn such profound footwork? Could it be a fluke?\" Fei Qingping suddenly started to ramble incoherently.Wan Yuan said in a deep voice, \"A fluke? Why don't you try executing Instant Flash at the great success stage by luck for me to see?!\"\" . . .\"\"Actually, he stirred up a lot of trouble during his trip back to the capital. He even went to the Drunken Star Manor to make a scene, and Father was unable to do anything to him. This time around on the way back here, Father arranged for a Mosha a.s.sa.s.sin. Yet the result was that Ye Yuan actually arrived at the academy safely! That's why I feel that there is something odd about Ye Yuan after he came back!\"\"Then . . . what should I do?\" At this point, Fei Qingping was thoroughly panicking.Patting his shoulders, Wan Yuan slowly said, \"Relax. Even if he is a little unusual, the difference in strength between the two of you can't be made up! However, you can't let down your guard during these three days. You have to make full use of all the time you have!\"Hearing Wan Yuan said all these, Fei Qingping really did not dare to lower his guard this time. This battle was a deathmatch where life and death must be determined. Fei Qingping was not willing to treat his life jokingly.\"Young Master Wan, just tell me what I have to do. I will absolutely listen to you!\"Seeing how he really took things seriously, Wan Yuan took out a bottle of medicinal pills and placed it in front of Fei Qingping. He said, \"This is the Essence Gathering Pills that my Father refined. Its effectiveness is 50% greater than Essence Qi Pills! These three days, you will use these pills to raise your strength. You must definitely break through to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"Fei Qingping's eyes lit up. If he could break through to Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm, then his chances of victory would increase significantly. Just as Wan Yuan said, the difference in strength was not something that can easily be breached. A Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artist versus a Third Level Essence Qi Realm martial artist; he really had no reason to lose!Immediately, Fei Qingping gave a deep bow and said gratefully, \"Many thanks for Young Master Wan's support!\"Nodding his head, Wan Yuan acknowledged it calmly and continued saying, \"Another thing. These three days, you also have to put all your effort into training the Lesser Capturing Hand. Use it to counter Instant Flash, and you will be in an invincible position.. . . . . .In a training room at the Dan Wu Academy.Ye Yuan stood quietly with his eyes tightly shut as if asleep.Ever since he looked at the jade piece, Ye Yuan was already standing here for close to two hours!Suddenly, Ye Yuan's eyes snapped open.Taking a step back, he then executed a palm movement!\"Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave!\"A burst of wind carried forward, and with a boom, a fleshy palm smashed onto the wall!A dent was made on the wall, but one could see it rapidly recovering with their naked eyes.Looking at the wall, Ye Yuan shook his head, \"This Stacking Waves Layered Palm is indeed hard to train. No wonder Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao advised me to give up. I already used two hours to adjust the essence energy in my body, yet this palm still doesn't have the effects of the First Layer Wave.\"Ye Yuan sighed. If Zhao Chunyang saw this, his jaws would definitely drop, followed by scolding Ye Yuan being an ungrateful wrench.One has to know, back then when Long Tan was training his martial technique, the First Layer Wave was only mastered after a month.Even though Ye Yuan did not mastered it yet, he was not far from mastering the First Layer Wave already. Furthermore, he merely used two hours.\"Once more!\" Ye Yuan was not discouraged. Following the original method stated, he started to circulate the essence energy within his body once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: WagerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: WagerTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorStacking Waves Layered Palm was actually a martial technique that creates a resonance between essence energy within the human body and heaven and earth essence energy, amplifying it in order to damage the enemies.Just like how tossing a rock into water will cause ripples to spread outwards.Describing it seemed easy, but to actually accomplish it was as hard as reaching the heaven.Heaven and earth essence energy was a vague and ethereal existence. In order to create a resonance, one needed to have an incredibly profound understanding towards heaven and earth essence energy.To martial artists, cultivating essence energy was instinctive. One would just need to gather essence energy according to their corresponding martial skill.It was merely a matter of knowing how to do something, but not understanding why.Although every martial artist cultivated essence energy, most likely no one would be able to say what exactly was essence energy.As cultivation realm increased, martial artists would gain a deeper understanding towards essence energy.When completely ignorant about essence energy, one could only go through non-stop training to be able to slowly grasp that sort of resonance in order to master Stacking Waves Layered Palm. That was the reason why this palm technique was so difficult to learn.Ye Yuan possessed an extremely high cultivation realm in his past life. Furthermore, he also had extremely great attainments in Alchemy Dao. That was why it was much easier for him to learn this technique.Slowly raising his right palm, a faint earthly-yellow glow started to condense on Ye Yuan's palm, forming a tiny vortex.Releasing a palm strike, that faint yellow light spread out like water ripples.Peng!The wall sunk in heavily and the dent even deeper than previously.Stacking Waves Layered Palm!Ye Yuan managed to execute it on his second palm strike!\"Well, that's the feeling alright. But it still isn't that stable. Also, the execution time is too long. Looks like I still need to practice more,\" Ye Yuan muttered to himself.. . . . . .In a blink of an eye, three days had pa.s.sed.On this morning, the combat arena was surrounded by a lot of people that not even water could seep through.After three days of seething, virtually everyone in the Dan Wu Academy knew about Ye Yuan and Fei Qingping's deathmatch.In this world, there was no lack of people who liked to watch a good show. It was the same everywhere.Even though the ones fighting in the deathmatch were just two small characters, it was still a deathmatch. It meant that one party would definitely die. Who would miss out on such a good show?After all, there had not been a deathmatch in the Dan Wu Academy for over two years.The deathmatch had not even started yet, but everyone was already discussing in groups of threes and fives.\"Who do you guys think will win?\"Another person looked at him as if he was an idiot. \"Are you r.e.t.a.r.ded? A Third Level Essence Qi Realm versus a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm; what's there to guess? Do you think that Ye Yuan is Senior Brother Apprentice Long?\"\"Hehe. Who knows? Perhaps that Ye Yuan has something surprising up his sleeves. Don't you know that he spent the past few days cultivating in a closed-door seclusion? Maybe when he appears, he would be at Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm already?\" That person did not mind and laughed instead.His words were once again met with disdain. \"What's the use of hugging Buddha's feet at the last moment? Ye Yuan isn't the only one who went into a closed-door seclusion. That Fei Qingping also spent three days in a closed-door seclusion. I heard that Fei Qingping has been stuck at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm for a long time. This time around, who knows if he might directly break through to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm. That Ye Yuan is definitely dead.\"\"That's not necessarily true! I heard that Ye Yuan managed to learn Instant Flash, and it's even at the great success stage. This practically means that he is in an undefeatable position.\"\"Instant Flash? What's the use? s.h.i.+tty combat power, low cultivation realm; don't tell me he has to keep using Instant Flash? When his essence energy is finally depleted, wouldn't he still be defeated? Furthermore, Instant Flash might be amazing, but it isn't invincible, okay!\"\"I'm guessing that Ye Yuan is making up for his weaknesses during these three days of closed-door seclusion. It's hard to increase cultivation realm in a short period of time, so it's possible he's training some amazing martial techniques. I heard that a few days before, Ye Yuan went to the Scripture Library. Oh right, wasn't it Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao on duty then? Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao, what martial technique did Ye Yuan choose?\"Zhao Chunyang who was currently listening to the strength a.n.a.lysis did not expect the topic to suddenly switch to him.Hearing their question, he directly replied, \"It's the Stacking Waves Layered Palm.\"\"Pfft! I already said so. This Ye Yuan is outrageous! Plenty to choose from, yet he just had to choose this martial technique. Even Senior Apprentice Brother Long spent a month before he managed to master the First Layer Wave. Ye Yuan is too confident. Does he think he's stronger than Senior Apprentice Brother Long? Even if he is stronger than Senior Apprentice Brother Long, how long does he need to master the First Layer Wave? Half a month? Ten days? Seven days? Hahaha!\" The more that person spoke, the funnier he found it, and he could not help but laugh out loud.\"Uh. So it's that martial technique? I was still hoping that he could create a miracle by becoming a dark horse, and finis.h.i.+ng off that Fei Qingping. Looks like I was expecting too much. I reckon this deathmatch doesn't have any more value to watch. That Ye Yuan is dead.\"'I've long said that there isn't anything worth watching, but you didn't believe me. This Ye Yuan is just a silkpants whose father forcefully raised him by two cultivation realms. What combat power can he have? If it wasn't a deathmatch, I wouldn't even be bothered to come and watch. Make a guess, how many moves will Fei Qingping take to finish off Ye Yuan?\"\"That . . . Twenty moves?\" this person said uncertainly.\"Twenty moves? You are expecting too much! At best five moves!\"\"Senior Apprentice Brother Zhao, what do you think?\" another person asked Zhao Chunyang.\"Uh . . . That I'm not too sure. But I feel that it might not be impossible for Ye Yuan,\" Zhao Chunyang replied.Zhao Chunyang was not confident enough, but ever since encountering Ye Yuan that day, he felt that something would happen. But all of the signs clearly showed that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to win. Zhao Chunyang did not know why he had this feeling either.That person thought he heard wrong and was just about to open his mouth when another voice sounded off from behind him.\"Ten moves. Junior Apprentice Brother Ye wins!\"That voice did not make any attempts to hide, and many of the surrounding people heard it.Muttering.That voice was like a bomb that just went off, and everyone glanced over in that direction.Before this, everyone's opinions were one-sided; thinking that it was impossible for Ye Yuan to win. The two who were predicting how many moves Ye Yuan would last before he loses were not in the minority.Therefore, this voice could be said to be very different, resulting in all the other discussions ceased.\"Tang Yu, are you alright?\" Someone recognized who it was. It was precisely Tang Yu who returned to the Dan Wu Academy with Ye Yuan. There was even a young lady beside him, who was Lu-er.\"That's right, Tang Yu. I've heard that you've been walking very closely with that moron recently. Is that why you also became r.e.t.a.r.ded?\"\"Hahaha!\"The matter of Tang Yu and Ye Yuan returning together obviously could not be hidden from others. It was dug out over these few days.Tang Yu emotionlessly swept a look over everyone and gave a cold smile. He then said, \"100 Essence Qi Pills. Who dares to wager with me?\"Tang Yu's words once again made everyone silent, but their expressions were even more like they were looking at a fool.\"Tang Yu, did you really become stupid?\"\"Enough c.r.a.p. If I lose, I will pay each and every one of you 100 Essence Qi Pills. But if I win, each one of you will pay me 100 Essence Qi pills. If you don't dare, then shut up!\" At this moment, Tang Yu's domineering air seeped out.As expected, the moment he said that most of the people immediately shut up.100 Essence Qi Pills were not a small amount. It was practically the amount of their usage for three months. Even though there were plenty of people who did not mind, it was still a large enough number to make the majority felt pain for several months.\"Let's wager then. Who's scared of you? But there are at least several hundred people here. If you lose, can you afford to pay?\" At this moment, those who were on good terms with Wan Yuan could not look on anymore, and one of them immediately jumped out and confronted Tang Yu.Tang Yu gave a cold laugh and took out a bottle of medicinal pills.\"Transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pill! Siii . . . All of them are transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills!\" That person stared till his eyes nearly popped out.The value of one transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pill could sufficiently match with ten ordinary high-grade Essence Qi Pills. These medicinal pills were all refined by Ye Yuan before he went into a closed-door seclusion. He long foresaw this scene, and so he decided to use this chance to make a windfall.\"I will wager with you!\"The audience turned towards the voice, only to see Wan Yuan walking in with Liu Ruoshui and Fei Qingping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills! How about it? Do you dare to play?\" Seeing Tang Yu's facial expression, he felt increasingly satisfied.Tang Yu seemed to have been scared by this figure as he revealed a difficult expression.\"Although Ye Yuan is disappointing, his father Ye Hang is an Alchemy Grandmaster that everyone looks up to. It can't be that you can't even take out this bit of Essence Qi Pills, right?\" Seeing Tang Yu's expression, he became even more pleased with himself.\"Fine! One thousand then! Do you think I'm scared of you?\" Tang Yu gritted his teeth and said.\"Hahaha! You got guts! Now, everybody heard that? If the time comes, and one goes back on his word, everyone will go to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion together to find Ye Hang,\" Wan Yuan shouted loudly.Many people saw Tang Yu's expression and felt more confident despite having no basis.\"I will bet too. 100 high-grade Essence Qi Pills!\"\"I will bet too.\"\"Me too!\". . . . . .After hearing Ye Hang's name, everyone was no longer worried that Ye Yuan would repudiate his debt. So they all verbally agreed to the wager one after another.After finding someone to be a witness, those partic.i.p.ating in the wager signed on the paper one after another, and this matter was considered fixed.Looking at all these people's signatures, Tang Yu was overjoyed.\"Looks like Junior Apprentice Brother Ye is still the best. These people just lost their money. In the future, we won't lack Essence Qi Pills anymore. There will be as many as we want!\" Tang Yu thought to himself.Others might not know, but Tang Yu had seen with his own eyes how Ye Yuan used his Third Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation to kill a Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm a.s.sa.s.sin. How could he possibly be defeated by a minor character like Fei Qingping?Not everyone had the guts to partic.i.p.ate in the wager. The final count of all those who signed the paper was more than 200 people. There was an enormous quant.i.ty of Essence Qi Pills at stake!If Ye Yuan really lost, this would be an absolutely devastating blow to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.But . . . they probably would not have that opportunity.Especially Wan Yuan this time around, he was definitely going to suffer a hefty loss.. . . . . .After this business was settled, it was already getting late. Fei Qingping slowly walked into the combat arena.\"Yii? Fei Qingping is actually already at the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"It's true! Ye Yuan is definitely doomed now!\"\"Hahaha! That wager of 100 high-grade Essence Qi Pills just now was really a great haul!\"Under the same circ.u.mstances, a difference of one realm would already decide everything. That was why everyone was not optimistic about Ye Yuan.If these students initially still had a trace of faith in Ye Yuan, after seeing Fei Qingping's Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm now, even that last trace of faith was gone.Listening to the public opinions, Fei Qingping felt very refreshed. The initial trace of worry in his heart was already wholly forgotten.All along, Fei Qingping had always been following behind Wan Yuan. Never had he thought that one day, he would also become everyone's focus.After today, I will probably receive quite a few love letters from girls, right? Fei Qingping thought to himself.These past three days, Fei Qingping did not dare to slack off even the slightest.First, he used one day to break through the bottleneck. The Essence Gathering Pill's effects were unexpectedly good, making him advanced to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm smoothly. Next, he went into a closed-door seclusion to train the Lesser Capturing Hand. Even though time was a little tight, under Wan Yuan's guidance, there was some success.Under this situation, Fei Qingping could not even find a trace of the possibility of losing.\"What time is it already? Why isn't Ye Yuan here yet?\"\"He probably didn't dare to come and ran away already. Hahaha . . .\"\"Losing face is better than losing his life. After all, he will die even if he comes. At least he can save his life by finding his father to s.h.i.+eld him.\"It was already late, and everybody was already impatient from waiting. Under these sort of circ.u.mstances, everyone felt that Ye Yuan was too scared; that was why he did not dare to come.. . . . . .At a private viewing stand in the combat arena.Two young men between the ages of 17 and 18 years old, stood with their hands behind their backs.One with a domineering air soaring to the skies, while the other seemingly had a nonchalant att.i.tude towards life.\"To think that the great Martial Roll of Honor's rank one would actually stoop to come watch this sort of small fight.\" That nonchalant looking man could not help but revealed a surprised expression after seeing the newcomer.Rank one in the Martial Roll of Honor; this person who was emanating a domineering air that reached the clouds was actually the legendary number one figure in the Dan Wu Academy, Long Tang.Long Tang did not have any intention to respond to the other party's mocking. He knew that the person in front of him who looked laidback was actually an extremely nasty opponent.\"Didn't you, Martial Roll of Honor's rank two, come as well?\" Long Tang rebuked leisurely.This laidback looking man was actually rank two in the Martial Roll of Honor, Zuo Bugui!If there were other students around, they would undoubtedly be greatly astonished. Martial Roll of Honor's rank one and rank two, appearing together to pay attention to a battle between rookies. This was completely inconceivable.\"Hahaha! I can't hold onto this rank two for long. Junior Apprentice Sister Feng is right on my heels. I'm afraid this rank two will have to change owners at the next Battle of Martial Roll of Honor.\" Zuo Bugui had a helpless expression.Long Tang did not make any remarks on this. He knew that with Zuo Bugui's strength, one could not knead him as they wished. Even he himself has to be cautious when facing him.\"It isn't just the two of us. Su Yishan, Xu Qingfeng, those guys came too. Look at the grandstand opposite. After all, it's been two years since a deathmatch has occurred. Even if it's only two rookies, it isn't strange to attract everyone over, right? Thinking back, weren't we also rookies back then?\" Long Tang said lightly.\"Hehe. That's true. Who wasn't a rookie before? But that fellow Su Yishan and Wan Yuan have common interests. Is he here to watch a joke? After all, the Su Family and the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion don't get along. With his personality, watching Ye Hang's son get killed will definitely make him derive pleasure from others' misfortunes.\" Zuo Bugui seemed to be very clear on the arrangement within the capital.\"None of my business,\" Long Tang said indifferently.\"Tsk. I knew you were like this! I know that you came here today because you wanted to see if the Stacking Waves Layered Palm that even you couldn't master can be mastered by a rookie, right?\" Zuo Bugui seemed to understand Long Tang very well, and he directly said out the purpose of Long Tang's visit.Long Tang did not deny it. Nodding his head, he said, \"Stacking Waves Layered Palm might be an incomplete martial technique, but it's publically acknowledged within the academy to be the hardest to master, as well as the martial technique with the greatest might. These past few years, virtually no one dared to touch it. I want to see if this Ye Yuan is here to be a joke, or does he really have the confidence to master Stacking Waves Layered Palm.\"Zuo Bugui curled his lips and said, \"I think that you are thinking too much. Even a sicko like you spent a month's time to master only the first layer. How can Ye Yuan that last place possibly master it? Even if he mastered it, what's the use of the First Layer Wave? The difference between Fei Qingping and him is two whole cultivation realms!\"\"Perhaps,\" Long Tang couldn't be bothered to debate with Zuo Bugui and replied nonchalantly.\"Hey hey. What kind of att.i.tude is this? Is there a need to put on a cool appearance all day?\"\". . . . . .\"\"I think you won't be able to see it anymore. Ye Yuan that punk probably ran away already. What time is it already, and yet he still hasn't appeared.\" Zuo Bugui kept on talking non-stop, but Long Tang could not be bothered to respond.. . . . . .\"Make way! Make way!\" Right at this moment, Ye Yuan shouted at the top of his voice. He was stuck outside, unable to enter.\"It's Ye Yuan! He came!\"\"He actually dared to come!\"\"Quickly make way for him; don't delay me from collecting my Essence Qi Pills!\"Amidst a wave of laughter, everyone made way for Ye Yuan.However, Ye Yuan did not enter the combat arena directly, but came to Tang Yu instead and asked slyly, \"Is it done?\"Tang Yu smiled. \"Don't worry, Junior Apprentice Brother Ye. Luckily, I didn't fail you.\"\"Hahaha! Then that's good, that's good.\" Finis.h.i.+ng his words, Ye Yuan then raise both arms up and cupped his hands politely, and he said, \"Many thanks to all Senior Apprentice Brothers and Sisters that gave these Essence Qi Pills. I, your Junior Apprentice Brother, thank you here, and kindly accept them.\"Everyone looked at each other speechlessly, not knowing why Ye Yuan was showing off. Did he mess his brain up from training?Ignoring everyone's surprised looks, Ye Yuan said to Tang Yu, \"Senior Apprentice Brother Tang, take care not to lose the name list. After the match, I have to go and claim from each person.\"Ending the conversation, Ye Yuan walked into the combat arena step by step.Fei Qingping had a cold smile on his face as he watched Ye Yuan showing off. \"You are about to die, and yet you still dare to ask for Essence Qi Pills?\"Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"Fei Qingping, did you wager? Since I'm about to die, why don't you bet some more?\"\"Don't worry. I've already wagered everything! Now, I will send you to the western paradise!\" Fei Qingping fully released the power of his Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm as he wanted to take the initiative right from the start.\"Yo. Momentum's not bad. Yii? You are actually at the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm?!\" Ye Yuan's face revealed astonishment.Fei Qingping saw Ye Yuan's face change color and could not help but be pleased with himself. \"Humph! Anyhow, we are apprentice brothers after all. How about this; I will allow you three moves. Make your move!\"Ye Yuan revealed a delighted expression and asked with amazement, \"Do you really mean it, Senior Apprentice Brother Fei?\"\"Of course!\"\"Then that's great!\" Ye Yuan smiled. Looking all around, he said, \"You all heard it! He was the one who said he will allow me three moves!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And yet, the result was that his strength indeed increased, but his habit of taking the enemy lightly surfaced once again.Wan Yuan was different from Fei Qingping. He also looked down greatly on Ye Yuan, but if he were the one up there, he definitely would not say something like 'allow you three moves.' Instead, he would beat down Ye Yuan with full power.Liu Ruoshui who was by the side covered her mouth as she laughed and said, \"Don't get mad, Senior Apprentice Brother Wan. Fei Qingping might be a little arrogant, but right now he does have the capital to be arrogant. Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm versus Third Level Essence Qi Realm; no matter how you look at it, he wouldn't lose, don't you think? Even if he allows three moves, it has no bearing on the overall situation.\"Since Liu Ruoshui already said all that, Wan Yuan did not feel it was nice to go into it seriously. But in his mind, he was thinking that after they return, he would definitely show him some colors.\"I've incurred Junior Apprentice Sister Liu's ridicule. It's just that this is a deathmatch. Fei Qingping shouldn't be so careless. But I don't think that Ye Yuan would be able to do anything.\" Wan Yuan shook his head and smiled.\"That's obvious. Senior Apprentice Brother Wan spent the past few days to help with Junior Apprentice Brother Fei's bitter closed-seclusion training. Furthermore, he has an overwhelming advantage in terms of cultivation realm. Nothing is going to happen. What's funny is that just now, Ye Yuan was still showing off as if so many senior apprentice brothers' Essence Qi Pills were already his. Looking at this point, he isn't any different from the past Ye Yuan,\" Liu Ruoshui's words carried a faint enmity as she replied.\"Oh? That's true now that you mentioned it! Perhaps I was overly cautious. But this way, it does seem more like Ye Yuan's personality.\"After Ruoshui said that, Wan Yuan also came around. Thinking back to Ye Yuan's actions just now, it was like how he used to act recklessly and blindly in the past.But, this was going to be the last time . . .. . . . . .In the arena, a middle-aged man dressed in black walked in step by step. He was the instructor who was hosting this deathmatch, Huyan Yong.Huyan Yong glanced at the two people without any emotion. It was as if not at all caring the slightest about this deathmatch.\"Since the two of you are here, the deathmatch will begin now. In a deathmatch, each person is responsible for their own life and death.\"\"Begin!\"Finis.h.i.+ng his words, Huyan Yong directly left.Presently, Ye Yuan was wearing a white martial outfit, standing there with a somewhat valiant and heroic bearing.Except that this valiant and heroic appearance did not match his strength, leaving everyone with an inexpressible strange feeling.\"Hey, you said three moves. After I hit you, you mustn't retaliate!\" Ye Yuan suddenly grinned and exclaimed.Fei Qingping smiled coldly. \"Just relying on you?\"\"Hehe. Won't you know after trying? Here I come!\"Right after he finished talking, Ye Yuan's figure already arrived in front of Fei Qingping.\"Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave!\"Smas.h.!.+Fei Qingping's body flew out like a cannonball, cras.h.i.+ng heavily onto the ground.Silence . . .Dead silence!Everyone looked at Ye Yuan standing in the arena with an unbelievable expression, not knowing what happened just now.No, to be exact, they could not believe the truth that they just witnessed with their own eyes!How could he be so fast?Stacking Waves Layered Palm?H-he really mastered it?How is this possible?!\"Just now, that was . . . Stacking Waves Layered Palm?\" On the secret viewing platform, Zuo Bugui's laidback att.i.tude already disappeared from his face, and what replaced it was astonishment.It sounded like he was asking Long Tang, and at the same time as if he was talking to himself.Shocked was written all over Long Tang's face, but he still replied, \"That's right. It's Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave!\"\"But . . . didn't he only train for three days?\" Zuo Bugui felt that his brain was a little insufficient to process this.Three days to learn Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave. Could it be that this Ye Yuan's talent was even more monstrous than this Long Tang in front of him?But . . .Even if Ye Yuan was more monstrous than Long Tang, it could not be to the extent of learning it in three days . . . Right?Long Tang used a month, and yet Ye Yuan only used three days. The time that Long Tang took was actually ten times of Ye Yuan's?Isn't it too demoralizing?Long Tang didn't know what happened either. But among Dan Wu Academy's students, n.o.body was more familiar with this martial technique than him.What Ye Yuan used just now was the authentic First Layer Wave!\"If this was Ye Yuan's first time looking at the jade piece, it means he really mastered it in three days!\" Long Tang's words revealed mixed feelings.Zuo Bugui clearly became aware of that point as well and asked, \"Do you mean that . . . he trained in it before? This time around, it's just to deceive the public? If it's like that, then it makes sense.\"The more Zuo Bugui thought about it, the more he felt that it was the case. That trademark smile once again appeared on his face, except it was still a little forced. \"That's what I said. How can there be someone even more monstrous than you? Furthermore, it's monstrous to such an extent!\"Long Tang shook his head and said calmly, \"I didn't say that. It's just an a.s.sumption. In reality, I'm more inclined to believe that this was his first time seeing that jade piece.\"\". . . . . .\"Zuo Bugui was speechless.In the arena, a trace of light flashed across Huyan Yong's eyes, whose expression had been indifferent all this while.He was similarly shocked by Ye Yuan's strike, but what he was astonished by was not the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, but Ye Yuan's movement technique!Previously, Ye Yuan revealed Instant Flash. So everyone was not a stranger to it. But everyone's understanding of him remained at the large success stage.But the Instant Flash that Ye Yuan displayed just now was undoubtedly at the great circle stage!What Ye Yuan executed just now did not leave any afterimages. Hence, he deceived every student's eyes and ears.Afterimage was a mark of mastering Instant Flash to the great circle stage. But it did not mean that a great success stage of Instant Flash will definitely leave afterimages.Ingenuity in varying tactics depends on mother wit.That was the true meaning of a martial technique at the great circle stage!Coincidentally, back in those days, Huyan Yong also spent a great deal of effort on Instant Flash. He was one of the few people who trained this technique to the great circle stage!Although he went on to practice higher ranking movement techniques, he was still most familiar with Instant Flash.Yet, just now, he clearly felt that the Instant Flash Ye Yuan executed was somewhat different. It was just that he could not say how exactly was it different.But without any doubt, Ye Yuan's understanding of this technique was beyond his!This punk isn't simple!Huyan Yong who was originally indifferent towards this deathmatch started to feel a faint antic.i.p.ation now.\"That fool! I already told him not to underestimate the enemy!\" Looking at the arena, Wan Yuan gnashed his teeth angrily.Wan Yuan never thought that Ye Yuan actually managed to master the Stacking Waves Layered Palm!Just what on earth happened on this guy's body?Just three days!Something that Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang only accomplished using one month, Ye Yuan actually managed to use only three days!Was this really still the Ye Yuan I know?\"Don't worry, Senior Apprentice Brother Wan. Junior Apprentice Brother Fei only underestimated the enemy for a moment. Even if Ye Yuan mastered Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave, he can't win against Junior Apprentice Brother Fei.\" Liu Ruoshui remained fully confident.Wan Yuan nodded his head. He obviously knew that this strike was not unable to cause Fei Qingping any actual harm.\"Underestimated the enemy? Even if he didn't take the enemy lightly, he probably also couldn't avoid that strike just now, right?\" Huyan Yong was not far from Wan Yuan and heard Liu Ruoshui and their conversation, giving this evaluation in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There are still two more moves which you allowed me. You aren't going to go back on your words, are you?\"Ye Yuan clapped his hands together with a face that said it cannot be helped.Cough, cough, cough! Fei Qingping had not caught his breath even after so long.That palm strike just now hit him right in the chest to the point where he could not catch his breath.Were it not for the fact that he gathered essence energy to form a s.h.i.+eld at the last moment, he would have failed miserably at this simple mission.Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm was much stronger than Third Level Essence Qi Realm; it was not just because the essence energy was much thicker, but also because after the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, one would be able to materialize an essence energy s.h.i.+eld. This greatly increased one's self-defense power.The damage from a Third Level Essence Qi Realm's attack, after being neutralized by an essence energy s.h.i.+eld, will significantly be reduced in power.\"Li-little b.a.s.t.a.r.d!\" Fei Qingping held his chest as he struggled to stand up.Just as he managed to steady himself, Ye Yuan palm came again.Smas.h.!.+Fei Qingping was sent flying once more, rolling on the ground far away.\"You're really asking for a beating! Try scolding again if you got the guts!\" Ye Yuan stopped smiling and said coldly.Cough, cough! \"S-so what if I scold you? Li-little bas-\"Smas.h.!.+Before he even managed to complete his sentence, Ye Yuan's palm once again imprinted onto Fei Qingping's chest.\"I admire your guts. Come, carry on scolding.\" Ye Yuan's words became frostier.Cough, cough! \"Three moves are over, prepare to die! Little bas-\"Smas.h.!.+Yet another palm!Only, this palm struck the face. Even though it was weakened by the essence energy s.h.i.+eld, Fei Qingping's face started to swell slightly.\"Little-\"Smas.h.!.+Smas.h.!.+ Smas.h.!.+ Smas.h.!.+. . . . . .Ye Yuan landed one palm after another on Fei Qingping's face.Fei Qingping stood up again and again but was sent flying each time. As long as he stood up, a palm would come whizzing, leaving him no time to start scolding.It was said that when hitting someone, do not hit the face. Yet, Ye Yuan deliberately hit Fei Qingping's face.After over a dozen palms landed, Fei Qingping's face already swelled up like a pig's head. Even if his parents were here, they probably would not be able to recognize their own son.Currently, Fei Qingping was howling in his heart. Each time he made a great effort to stand up, wanting to retaliate, Ye Yuan would appear before his eyes without waiting for him to react.Right now, he discovered that the Ye Yuan he always looked down upon had indeed possessed the strength to threaten him.. . . . . .Everybody looked on dumbfounded at the scene of Ye Yuan continuously striking one palm after the other.Each time Ye Yuan struck, their hearts would jump involuntarily as if that palm was slapping their faces.Stretching out to touch their faces, why was it that they found their faces a little hot?Wan Yuan did not say a word, but his face was already completely black.How was this about Ye Yuan slapping Fei Qingping's face? He was clearly slapping Wan Yuan's face!There were so many people present here. Who did not know that Fei Qingping was his lackey?In his heart, he had already scolded Fei Qingping countless times, but that was not of any help at all to the current situation in the combat arena.Wan Yuan did not possess Huyan Yong's judgment. Even now, he still stubbornly believed that Ye Yuan had the initiative because of those three moves, and Ye Yuan could beat Fei Qingping until this state because Fei Qingping was taken unaware.Thinking back to how Fei Qingping promised to allow Ye Yuan three moves right from the start, it became a complete joke now.It had already been over ten moves, and Fei Qingping had not even counterattacked.\"Fei Qingping, are you a pig?! Quickly, use the Lesser Capturing Hand!\" Wan Yuan could not sit idly by any longer and then shouted out loud.Murmuring.Following Wan Yuan's cry, the hundreds of people in the audience all looked over in his direction.It seemed to have caught Ye Yuan's attention as well. He looked over and ceased his violent rhythmic beating of Fei Qingping.\"Shut up! This is a deathmatch. Who permitted you to shout?\" Huyan Yong turned around and looked frostily at Wan Yuan. A powerful pressure belonging to the Spirit Condensation Realm came forth, crus.h.i.+ng Wan Yuan until his breathing almost stopped.\"Teacher Huyan, does his action count as breaking the academy's rules?\" Ye Yuan asked calmly.Huyan Yong also had a headache. Even though Wan Yuan was an Earth rank student, his potential was quite high. Additionally, with his father, Wan Donghai's network, he could not be too harsh on him.However, what Wan Yuan did was indeed a transgression. A deathmatch prohibited anyone from interrupting the duel. Wan Yuan's interference had clearly disrupted Ye Yuan's momentum.Now, if Ye Yuan was to hold onto this point and not let things go, under everyone's watchful eyes, Huyan Yong really did not know how to handle things.\"Of course it counts!\" Even though it might be troublesome, Huyan Yong could not deny this in front of so many people.Currently, many people's gaze towards Wan Yuan became filled with contempt. Anyone could tell that he intentionally interrupted Ye Yuan's momentum.\"That . . . According to the academy's rules, how should he be punished for his actions? Just now, I had the full advantage, but after that shout, I'm afraid that I will be beaten by Fei Qingping later. I don't want to look like a pig head. Teacher Huyan, you have to stand up for me, the weak party!\" Ye Yuan said innocently.\"This . . .\" Huyan Yong was exasperated and cursed endlessly in his heart.Other people might not be able to tell, but how could he not see it? Even when interrupted, there was no way that pig head could even touch the corner of Ye Yuan's sleeves. It had nothing to do with the overall situation.Yet, Ye Yuan deliberately pretended to be the weak party right now in order to gain everyone's sympathy. This made it even harder for him to find a way out of this situation whether he punished Wan Yuan or not.As expected, when Ye Yuan's voice died down, a wave of murmuring sounded off at the grandstand. Everyone understood what he meant.Ye Yuan was already two minor cultivation realms lower than Fei Qingping right from the start and was at an absolute disadvantage.Fei Qingping himself threw away his initiative, which finally balanced out the initially tilted scale.If Ye Yuan were beaten to death by Fei Qingping right after coming up, there would absolutely be no one who would pity him. But now that Ye Yuan finally saw the hope of victory, and yet was despicably interrupted by Wan Yuan, everybody could not help but pity him.Even though many among them wagered against Ye Yuan.However, everybody was clear in their hearts, that even though Ye Yuan was the one beating violently, in reality, it was all superficial wounds to Fei Qingping; unable to give him any serious injuries.Stacking Waves Layered Palm was indeed powerful, but the First Layer Wave was not able to compensate for the difference in cultivation realm.If Fei Qingping were only at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, then even if he had ten lives, he would be thoroughly dead.If Fei Qingping was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, perhaps Ye Yuan might just have that glimmer of hope to finish him off.But at the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm . . .n.o.body felt that Ye Yuan could really kill Fei Qingping.That was the reality of it . . .Just as Huyan Yong was caught in the dilemma, Fei Qingping finally took the opportunity to stand up, albeit in an unstable manner.However . . . he was already confused and disoriented right now. He was utterly unable to figure out the directions.Fei Qingping saw a blurry figure, pointed at him, and shouted angrily, \"Ye Yuan, I . . . I'm going . . . to kill you!\"\"Hahahaha!\"Hundreds of people took a look at Fei Qingping's funny appearance and burst into laughter.The laughter made Fei Qingping's eardrums quake in pain.Fei Qingping did not understand why everyone was laughing at him, but when he saw clearly who he was pointing at, he immediately broke out in a cold sweat.The person in front of him gradually became clearer. He was pointing to none other than the currently livid Huyan Yong.\"Wan Yuan disrupted the deathmatch. In accordance with the academy's rules, he will go and receive a hundred whippings himself after the duel. Wan Yuan! Leave the combat arena right now!\" Huyan Yong had been an instructor for so many years but never had he lost face like he did today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was carried out using a low-grade Spirit Artifact. Each whip will scatter the student's protective essence energy, causing bone piercing pain.The average student who committed a mistake would receive around 30-50 whips. After that, they basically had to lie on a bed for ten days.Now that Wan Yuan had to receive 100 whips, he would not be able to walk for at least twenty days no matter what.Wan Yuan also knew that he had incurred public wrath, so he did not dare to talk back to Huyan Yong. Glaringly fiercely at Ye Yuan, he said, \"Hmph! In a while, we will come and collect your corpse!\"Ye Yuan did not show any weaknesses and said loudly, \"Many thanks then. But I think you better collect the corpse of your family's dog. I won't see you off.\"Finis.h.i.+ng by drawing aggro, Ye Yuan sent Wan Yuan off with a wave of his hands.If it was not a deathmatch, Wan Yuan wished he could immediately rush down and tear Ye Yuan apart.After Wan Yuan left, Huyan Yong announced with a scowl, \"Deathmatch resumes!\"Currently, Fei Qingping had already recovered. There was hatred in his eyes as if he wanted to tear Ye Yuan apart alive.\"Ye Yuan, you despicable man! To actually use such a contemptible method to execute sneak attacks on me!\" Fei Qingping gnashed his teeth in hatred.Ye Yuan stared at him like he was an idiot. \"Hey, you were the one who said that you will allow me three moves. Now you turn around and blame me for being despicable? Did you really become a pig's head?\"\"Little b.a.s.t.a.r.d! You are dead!!\" Fei Qingping was practically foaming at the mouth from anger and started cursing again.As his voice fell, Ye Yuan's figure once again executed Instant Flash, appearing in front of Fei Qingping.Smas.h.!.+Fei Qingping was sent flying once again.This time around, the audience on the grandstand finally noticed something wrong.If previously, Fei Qingping were sent flying because he underestimated the enemy right at the start, then what about now?Fei Qingping could not possibly be unprepared when facing Ye Yuan in his towering rage. Yet, he was still sent flying with a single palm by Ye Yuan.Those with a good judgment already discovered that this time around, even though Fei Qingping was prepared to counterattack, he was still slower by half a beat.\"This . . . Is Instant Flash supposed to be this quick?\" Zuo Bugui felt that there were too many things happening today that overturned his understanding.Long Tang looked at him and said, \"Looks like we were both wrong. Ye Yuan's Instant Flash had already reached the great circle stage.\"Zuo Bugui sucked in a cold breath involuntarily. \"Siii . . . Great circle stage. . . Do you also know Instant Flash?\"Long Tang seemed to know what Zuo Bugui was asking, so he nodded his head and said, \"I still cannot find the crux to step into the Great Circle Realm.\"Zuo Bugui muttered, \"This Ye Yuan . . . is truly monstrous! Looks like in the future, we will have another terrifying opponent.\"Hearing Zuo Bugui's words, Long Tang's face did not become grim, but instead, it overflowed with fighting intent.\"If he can rise up, he would be a pretty good opponent.\" Long Tang's domineering air continued to soar as if he had already been lonely in the Dan Wu Academy for too long.Zuo Bugui rolled his eyes and said, \"You are indeed a sicko! Even though I don't know what happened to Ye Yuan, most likely he can't cause any threat to you. After all, your cultivation realm is much higher than his.\"\"It may not necessarily be so! Don't tell me you still believe that Ye Yuan rising two minor cultivation realms in a row was the result of his father pulling the shoot to help it grow?\"Zhu Bugui shook his head and said, \"Even though I don't know how he did it, he is definitely not those sort of Third Level Essence Qi Realm with superficial foundation! From the start until now, he had continuously used over a dozen Instant Flashes and Stacking Wave Layered Palms. All these no longer support the principle where his foundation is superficial. But looking at him, he doesn't seem to be under strain. Instead, he seems to be doing it with ease. But the question is . . . how does he do it?\"Since the start of the duel, Zuo Bugui felt that there were too many mysteries on Ye Yuan's body. Many of the things that happened with Ye Yuan surpa.s.sed his understanding.However, Zuo Bugui did not treat Ye Yuan as an opponent, because Ye Yuan's realm was too low.The acc.u.mulation of essence energy was a drawn-out process. No matter how talented someone was, this process cannot be made up for within a short period of time.Zuo Bugui was older than Ye Yuan by two whole years. If he were a mediocre person like Fei Qingping, then there was nothing strange about being caught up by Ye Yuan.However, Zuo Bugui himself was a genius among geniuses, the number two figure on the Martial Roll of Honor. He had his own pride. By the time Ye Yuan reached his current strength, he would definitely have taken another huge step forward.\"Looks like there are plenty of secrets on Ye Yuan. I have a feeling that before long, he will become a formidable adversary for us,\" Long Tang said.. . . . . .Currently, Ye Yuan was looking at Fei Qingping who was on the ground. He said coldly, \"I don't care how you scold me, but if you scold my parents, I won't stand for it. If you have the guts, try scolding another sentence. The next time I strike, it will no longer be light.\"Fei Qingping struggled up from the ground, shook his pig head, and gave a hideous smile, \"Hahaha . . . Just relying on you? So what if you managed to learn the Stacking Waves Layered Palm? It's just the First Layer Wave! Even if I let you hit me, can you even kill me? Once your essence energy is fully exhausted, you are dead! So what if I scold you?! Little b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Little b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Little b.a.s.t.a.r.d! Come on! Come hit me!\"This time, Fei Qingping was wiser. As he spoke, he was already on full alert and secretly revolved essence energy in preparation to use the Lesser Capturing Hand at any time.He also knew that he could not compete in movement technique with Ye Yuan no matter what, so he simply went on the defensive.As long as he thoroughly exhausted Ye Yuan's essence energy, the latter would be dead!However, this time around, Ye Yuan did not seem to have the intention of striking immediately. Instead, he looked at Fei Qingping and started smiling. Except, this smile revealed an icy intent, making the students on the grandstand shuddered involuntarily.Huyan Yong narrowed his eyes. He knew that Ye Yuan really became angry. The next attack would definitely fall like a thunderbolt.It was just that he could not imagine just how Ye Yuan would make up for the difference in cultivation realm.Clearly, the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave, had no use. Could it be that Ye Yuan still has a trump card that he has not used?Huyan Yong began to faintly look forward to it. The Ye Yuan today had brought too many surprises for him.\"Haha! Very good. You really have b.a.l.l.s. I'm coming. You better prepare your Lesser Capturing Hand properly.\" Ye Yuan was full of smiles and even took special care to remind Fei Qingping.The next instant, Fei Qingping discovered that Ye Yuan's figure slowly started to blur. Immediately, he detected something was wrong, and Lesser Capturing Hand was executed without any hesitation in an attempt to slow Ye Yuan's figure.Yet, all of these were futile.Ye Yuan's figure once again appeared in front of him, and a palm was struck out immediately, almost the same as before.\"Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Second Layer Wave!\"Fei Qingping's body flew out like a kite with a broken string.Puhwark!The instant he landed, Fei Qingping vomited a large mouthful of blood. It was clear that he suffered heavy internal injuries.\"Second Layer Wave! He mastered the Second Layer Wave! H-how is that possible? I-it's only been three days!\" Zuo Bugui could not believe his eyes. This scene was just too shocking!Although the attack power only increased by four times, the cultivation difficulty was not just an increment of four times!Long Tang once estimated previously that in order to master the Second Layer Wave, he would need to spend at least three months!Was this fellow Ye Yuan still a human?Although Long Tang who was by the side never spoke, the shock in his heart was no less than Zuo Bugui's.Mastering Second Layer Wave in three days . . . This was something that he did not even dare to imagine!Just what on earth happened to Ye Yuan, making him so monstrous?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who do you think you are? You are nothing but a dog of Wan Yuan,\" Ye Yuan said coolly.Fei Qingping wanted to say something but vomited another mouthful of blood instead.A First Layer Wave was two times the power, and a Second Layer Wave was four times the power.Using Ye Yuan's abundant essence energy to unleash four times the power? Fei Qingping's essence energy s.h.i.+eld was no longer sufficient.That palm just now directly shattered Fei Qingping's essence energy s.h.i.+eld and made an imprint on his chest.Ye Yuan did not hold back his attack at all, directly shattering Fei Qingping's internal organs, and snapping his heart meridian.With regards to Fei Qingping, Ye Yuan had long sentenced him to death in his heart.His predecessor died because of Fei Qingping. Ye Yuan inherited this body, so he naturally could feel his predecessor's resentment before dying.Now that he killed Fei Qingping, Ye Yuan can be considered to have taken revenge for his predecessor.\"Cough, cough, cough . . . Ye Yuan, even if I become a ghost . . . I won't let you off!\" Fei Qingping struggled to stand up to no avail.\"Haha! Then I will make sure that you can't even become a ghost.\" Ye Yuan followed up with another palm, thoroughly ending Fei Qingping's life.From the start to the end, Fei Qingping never even made a single move.On the grandstand, everyone was completely dumbstruck looking at the Ye Yuan in the combat arena. This Ten Thousand Years Last Place gave them too many surprises today.Killing a Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm as a Third Level Essence Qi Realm! Instant Flash at the great circle stage! Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Second Layer Wave!Anyone of these things could shake Dan Wu Academy, but all three things happened on Ye Yuan alone.\"Deathmatch, Fei Qingping died! Ye Yuan wins!\" Huyan Yong finally recovered from his shock and announced the results of the deathmatch.Ye Yuan bowed towards Huyan Yong and said, \"You've worked hard, Teacher Huyan.\"Ye Yuan bowed deeply towards the grandstand and said with a face full of grat.i.tude, \"Many thanks to all Senior Apprentice Brothers and Sisters for supporting. To actually know this Junior Apprentice Brother, I, am lacking Essence Qi Pills for cultivation. It makes me overwhelmed by this favor! I hope that all Senior Apprentice Brothers and Sisters will pay back the debt and not let Junior Apprentice Brother, I, go and look for you. That wouldn't look very nice.\"The audience who were initially still immersed in the shock were now full of resentment and contempt.Isn't this Ye Yuan's appearance when he is eating too ugly?This was a threat! A blatant threat!\"Haha! This Ye Yuan is interesting. With the large mountain Ye Hang, behind his back, how could he be lacking in these sort of things like Essence Qi Pills?\" Zuo Bugui could not hold back his laughter when he saw Ye Yuan's sordid merchant-like appearance.\"This trip wasn't wasted. Let's go,\" Long Tang said nonchalantly.\"Hehehe. Wasn't wasted, wasn't wasted. Looks like Dan Wu Academy will be fun in the future.\". . . . . .\"Ye Yuan! If I don't tear you to shreds, I can't get rid of the hatred in my heart!\"Wan Yuan laid on the bed with horrific whip marks visible on his back.Wan Yuan received the news of Fei Qingping being killed by Ye Yuan at the first moment. Immediately, the hatred in his heart surged to the skies.He still had to go and receive his whip punishment under this sort of circ.u.mstance. This made his hatred towards Ye Yuan reached the absolute limit.A hundred whips later, Wan Yuan's skin was split, and his flesh all torn up. He fainted straightaway on the spot.At this time, Wan Yuan's deep family background revealed itself.He had consumed two high-grade Great Returning Pills, and the injuries on his body were quickly suppressed. Coupled with some external wound medicines, it would take at most seven or eight days before Wan Yuan would be as good as new.It was just that although physical injuries healed easily, the emotional wounds were heavy.No matter what, Fei Qingping and he grew up playing together. Although they were master and servant in name, in reality, they were as close as real brothers.Wan Yuan never expected that Ye Yuan would improve at such an amazing speed, to actually kill the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm Fei Qingping as a Third Level Essence Qi Realm.If he knew this beforehand, then he would not have sent Fei Qingping to his death like that.Just as Wan Yuan was wallowing in his hatred, Liu Ruoshui slowly walked in, as graceful and attractive as before.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Wan, please restrain your grief. To think that Ye Yuan was such a despicable person who planned such a trap for Junior Apprentice Brother Fei to fall into. He is so devious!\" Liu Ruoshui just happened to reveal a sorrowful expression, making her look pitiable and delicate.Wan Yuan could not get up, but he was very touched by the fact that Liu Ruoshui came to visit him at this time.\"Many thanks, Junior Apprentice Sister Liu. I was definitely careless. My father fought with Ye Hang for so many years, and I have also fought with Ye Yuan for so many years. All these while, I had always thought that I understood him very well, so I felt that he was a good for nothing. But I never expected him to have hidden his ability this deep,\" Wan Yuan said hatefully.Liu Ruoshui said, \"Yeah, we misjudged. To think he was actually pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger all this while! I reckon that the poisoning incident previously thoroughly infuriated him. That's why he decided to meet that scheme with his own, luring Junior Apprentice Brother Fei to get hooked by the bait.\"Wan Yuan gritted his teeth and said, \"Ye Yuan! You and I, one of us must die! Furthermore, he is advancing too quickly. I can't let him continue to grow!\"It was clear that through this deathmatch, Wan Yuan had already deeply felt the pressure.The strength that Ye Yuan displayed was too dazzling. Even though he might be a genius that was being heavily groomed by the Dan Wu Academy, he was certain that he could not train the Stacking Waves Layered Palm to such a degree after examining himself.If he gave Ye Yuan a little more time, he might actually really be able to threaten him.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Second Layer Wave, and great circle stage Instant Flash. If he let Ye Yuan grow unchecked, he will soon no longer be his match.Wan Yuan obviously did not know that Ye Yuan had already finished off someone on his level, the a.s.sa.s.sin Chou Ying.If it were a deathmatch, Ye Yuan could already kill him.Liu Ruoshui wholeheartedly agreed with this. \"That's right. Ye Yuan is too devious, and he also has ulterior motives. Senior Apprentice Brother Wan had better find a way to quickly deal with him.\"Liu Ruoshui no longer had any choice. Right now, she and Wan Yuan were like gra.s.shoppers on the same string. She had plotted against Ye Yuan before, so Ye Yuan would not let her go. That was why she came over to urge Wan Yuan to quickly deal with Ye Yuan.\"But the academy doesn't permit students to take action privately. Otherwise, they will be punished severely,\" Wan Yuan frowned as he said this.In reality, even if Wan Yuan was to personally take action right now, he did not have much a.s.surance that he could kill Ye Yuan. That great circle stage Instant Flash placed him in a virtually undefeatable position.\"Did you two forget that the Endless Trials will start one month from now?\"Suddenly, a voice appeared, making Wan Yuan and Liu Ruoshui jumped in fright.\"It's Senior Apprentice Brother Su! Apologies, Senior Apprentice Brother Su. Wan Yuan is injured, so it's inconvenient to greet you.\" Wan Yuan's face was full of apologies.The one who came was precisely Su Yishan, an extraordinary top ten figure on the Martial Roll of Honor.Liu Ruoshui naturally did not dare to slight him either. She got up gracefully and greeted, \"I've seen Senior Apprentice Brother Su.\"Su Yishan gave her a faint look but did not express anything. Without any care, he sat down by the side as if this was his home.The Dan Wu Academy was a place that advocated talent and strength. If one had the strength, then n.o.body would dare to say anything even if he was somewhat arrogant. If one did not, then he could only be stepped underfoot by others.In the past, Ye Yuan was the Ten Thousand Years Last Place, so there had never been anyone who looked up to him. But now that he soared up to the skies in one move, everyone would naturally take him seriously.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Su, just now you said . . . the Endless Trials? That's right! Why didn't I think of it?\" Wan Yuan became excited, and pushed with his hand, agitating his wounds. Immediately, his face contorted in agony.By the side, Liu Ruoshui's eyes also lit up. It was clear that she also understood Su Yishan's intentions.\"That's right, the Endless Trials. The Endless Forest is naturally the ideal location to deal with Ye Yuan,\" Su Yishan commented calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So it was naturally the ideal location to temper the students. Of course, these sort of tempering would often be accompanied by injuries and death.In the past trials, many genius students ended up in the bellies of demonic beasts.The Dan Wu Academy was never a utopia. This place was even crueler than the outside world. The weak was destined to be eliminated.It was a world where the strong ruled.The Dan Wu Academy provided geniuses with a relatively safe environment for compet.i.tion. But a greenhouse could never nurture a true powerhouse. Without the baptism of fresh blood, these geniuses would never mature.There were all sorts of conflicts in the academy. These conflicts had to have a release point, and that release point was precisely the Endless Trials.The grudges that could not be settled within the academy could be dealt with during the Endless Trials.Although the academy would repeatedly emphasize that they were not allowed to make a move on their companions during the Endless Trials, in reality, the academy tacitly approved of students utilizing this opportunity to settle their grudges.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Su indeed has broad horizons, to have already chosen a burial ground for Ye Yuan,\" Liu Ruoshui praised.Su Yishan gave Liu Ruoshui a contemplating look, and she blushed bashfully, making her appear highly bewitching.Liu Ruoshui did not have a good family background. She was born from a small family's concubine and enjoyed extremely few resources since young. However, her talent was pretty good, reaching Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm at 14 years old. This was how she got recruited by the Dan Wu Academy.If she had not entered the Dan Wu Academy, Liu Ruoshui would have long been sent out as a gift by her family. She was full of hatred towards the Liu Family. She hoped that one day, she could return to smack the faces of those elders to let them see that even without the support of the family, she, Liu Ruoshui, could still rise above others!Yet, after entering the Dan Wu Academy, Liu Ruoshui realized just how many incredibly talented people there were. She felt that her talent was not inferior to these geniuses, but that her background limited her growth.What Liu Ruoshui lacked the most was resources so she would try every mean to hang around men just so she could obtain enough cultivation resources.Liu Ruoshui possessed a naturally attractive body and was the dual cultivation partner that all men dreamed of having. This was also her most significant capital, so she used this capital to walk among men, hoping to find a large tree to climb up.Big shots like Su Yishan would not even fancy Liu Ruoshui, and Liu Ruoshui understood that even if they took a liking to her, she would only end up as their plaything.So Liu Ruoshui set her sights on those geniuses who had yet to mature, and that person was Wan Yuan.In reality, Liu Ruoshui had also considered Ye Yuan before, because Ye Yuan was easier to control than Wan Yuan. Looking at their background, these two people were actually roughly the same. But in terms of future, Wan Yuan left Ye Yuan several streets behind.Wan Yuan was full of schemes, possessed strength, and even had an Alchemy Grandmaster for a father. There was no better choice than him.Furthermore, Wan Yuan did not disappoint her and was currently already deeply in love with her.Liu Ruoshui had also just advanced to Earth Rank not long ago and did not have much contact with this sort of extraordinary genius like Su Yishan. However, just this one glance made Liu Ruoshui feel like he stripped her clothes off, making her very uncomfortable.\"Junior Apprentice Sister Liu isn't bad,\" after that contemplating smile, Su Yishan only said a sentence lightly; not understanding what he was trying to express either.After that, he no longer bothered with Liu Ruoshui and carried talking with Wan Yuan.\"At that time, I will cooperate with you to eliminate Ye Yuan. After losing his son, Ye Hang would definitely lose his composure. At that time, our two families will join hands, and we can pull the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion up by the roots. If Ye Hang attacks first, I believe the Imperial Family can't say anything about it.\"Hearing Su Yishan's words, Wan Yuan's gaze became sharp, and he said excitedly, \"Senior Apprentice Brother Su will personally take action? That's great! Honestly speaking, with Ye Yuan's great circle stage Instant Flash, even if I use my full strength, I might not be able to keep him there. With Senior Apprentice Brother Su personally moving out, there will be no escape for Ye Yuan this time!\"Liu Ruoshui felt a little chill in her heart. Su Yishan's methods are terrifying. She and Wan Yuan were only thinking of how to deal with Ye Yuan, but Su Yishan already included the entire Fragrant Medicine Pavilion into his scheme.Su Family's primary source of income similarly was through medicinal herbs and pills. They had deep connections with the Drunken Star Manor, so the two families were always on good terms.Su Family was the largest medicinal herbs provider in the State of Qin. In most cases, Su Family only provided the medicinal herbs and did not interfere with the refinement or sale of medicinal pills.But who knew what channels Ye Hang went through, to not go through the Su Family for all of his medicinal herbs. This naturally made the Su Family hate Ye Hang.In the capital, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and the Drunken Star Manor were like two tigers who could not tolerate the other's existence on the same mountain. The two families had fought for so many years, and the Imperial Family had already given tacit consent to this delicate balance.But the Su Family strongly disliked the existence of Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, because the latter occupied a considerable share of the medicinal pills market which also meant that the Su Family's profits were reduced by quite a bit.But, one had to acknowledge that Ye Hang was remarkable in terms of businesses and operations. The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's prices were fair, and they had never bullied customers with their power. Their prestige among the demonic beast hunters was very good.The Su Family and the Wan Family had created obstacles both openly and in the shadows countless times, and yet, they had never dealt any real damage to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.Su Yishan wanted to use Ye Yuan as the pivotal point to pull the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion up by its roots.To be able to devise such a setup and also be so scheming at such a young age, one had to acknowledge that Su Yishan was an outlaw-like figure.After Su Yishan left, Liu Ruoshui's eyes were sparkling as she said, \"Congratulations, Senior Apprentice Brother Wan! With Senior Apprentice Brother Su's help, Ye Yuan is definitely dead this time. Not only Ye Yuan, but your Lord Father's thorn in the eye can also be removed this time as well!\"Wan Yuan did not have Liu Ruoshui's excitement, as if he was a completely different person from just now when Su Yishan was here.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Su is feeling threatened!\" sucking in a deep breath, Wan Yuan said in a low voice.\"You are saying . . . Ye Yuan?\" Liu Ruoshui was also an intelligent person. Now that Wan Yuan said this, she immediately understood, but she was frightened by this thought.To the academy's students, those in the Martial Roll of Honor's and Alchemy Roll of Honor's top ten were all figures that they had to look up to. An extraordinary genius like him actually felt threatened by a Third Level Essence Qi Realm?It was too inconceivable . . .. . . . . .At Ye Yuan's abode, Lu-er stared at her young master fiddling with Essence Qi Pills that filled up the house.Ye Yuan retrieved six Essence Qi Pills and placed them separately at the six corners of a pre-drawn hexagon array.Slightly injecting some essence energy, the array immediately gave off a faint white light, and the six Essence Qi Pills actually started to melt slowly, converging at the center of the hexagon array.After a while, the light faded, and the liquefied pills started to reform again at the center. It actually reformed into a single medicinal pill!The reformed medicinal pill, just from the l.u.s.ter of it, one could clearly tell that it was much stronger than the original high-grade Essence Qi Pills.\"Young Master, is this a transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pill?\" Lu-er grew up in the Ye Family since young, and naturally was not a stranger to medicinal pills.High-grade Essence Qi Pills were relatively common but transcendent-grade . . . If Ye Hang performed exceptionally well, then it would be pretty good to have one of these in a furnace of medicinal pills.But now, Ye Yuan casually used six high-grade Essence Qi Pills to actually conjure out a transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pill like magic.It was too miraculous!Ye Yuan took the medicinal pill and placed it in a medicine bottle, saying, \"Not bad. This is called Six Astral Array; an array specialized in extracting and refining low-level medicinal pills.\"Lu-er found it all very mystical and praised in admiration, \"Young Master, you are too amazing!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: The Price of SleepingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: The Price of SleepingTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThe next day after the duel, Ye Yuan had a medicinal theory lesson.The medicinal theory lesson's teacher was Feng Ruoqing, the youngest teacher in the entire Dan Wu Academy. She was also a ridiculously beautiful teacher with countless pursuers.Fen Ruoqing's medicinal theory cla.s.ses were always fully packed. Even if the other instructors whipped their horses, they also could not catch up. Furthermore, every student would be thoroughly engrossed and kept their gaze fixed on Feng Ruoqing.The initially dry and boring medicinal theory cla.s.s even appeared to be interesting.However, Ye Yuan did not seem to have too much enthusiasm for it. Currently, he was snoring away. Yesterday night, he expended a tremendous amount of essence energy to extract and refine transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills and was currently completely exhausted.Every high-tier alchemist was also an array master. Someone at the Alchemy Emperor level like Ye Yuan naturally was not an exception.High-tier medicinal pills required the inscription of arrays in order to attain the best medicinal effects. Hence, array formations were compulsory lessons for high-tier alchemists.Although the Six Astral Array was not some high-tier array, extracting and refining tens of thousands of Essence Qi Pills still drained Ye Yuan completely. Even so, Ye Yuan still had yet not finished extracting and refining. Tonight will be another long night, so how could he not catch up on his sleep?By the time all of the pills were extracted and refined completely, Ye Yuan would have several thousand of transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills. This amount would definitely shock anyone.The difference between transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills and high-grade Essence Qi Pills was basically that there were prices, but no sellers.How could something that even Alchemy Grandmasters could refine only when they were lucky to circulate freely on the market?The moment a medicinal pill reached the transcendent-grade, there would be a qualitative change.With regards to medicinal efficacy, a transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pill was already no longer inferior to a low-grade Explosive Yuan Pill. Furthermore, transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills had no side-effects at all. Even if one used it all the way to the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm, their body would not develop any resistance to it!Of course, the pre-requisite was that one had to have a lot of transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills in the first place.Who would dare to eat transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills like jelly beans?Except for Ye Yuan . . .Although the Explosive Yuan Pill might be good, firstly, its tier was a little high. Secondly, with Ye Yuan's current strength, he could not guarantee that every pill refined will be high-grade or superior-grade, let alone transcendent-grade.Even though Explosive Yuan Pill used only Tier 1 ingredients, it was still much more expensive than Essence Qi Pill. Even Ye Hang would not be able to provide it endlessly.Under these circ.u.mstances, transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills were without a doubt the most suitable medicinal pills for Ye Yuan.However, even though transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills were good, it was so d.a.m.n tiring!\"The Seven Star Lotus's attribute is water, and it is a yin attribute. Commonly found within a spirit lake, it's suitable for refining . . .\" Feng Ruoqing threw the 'Herbal Essentials' book on the table, as her words continued to flow easily. Clearly, she already knew all these medicinal herbs' attributes like the back of her hand.Feng Ruoqing was young and already a middle-rank Alchemy Master. This made many seniors perspire in embarra.s.sment.One had to know that even though Master Qian employed by the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was a high-rank Alchemy Master, his age was even greater than Feng Ruoqing by half a sixty-year cycle. That was the disparity in talent!Feng Ruoqing walked lightly while talking about the subject with great familiarity, and the students' gaze swayed along with her body.All of a sudden, Feng Ruoqing frowned lightly and stopped the lesson.Everybody could tell that Feng Ruoqing was unhappy.Everyone followed her gaze only see someone bent over the desk fast asleep, while drool was coming out of his mouth.In a moment, many scornful eyes shot towards Ye Yuan.How could there be someone who was so daring as to sleep during Teacher Feng's cla.s.s? So offensive to a beauty!However, Ye Yuan was currently in dreamland, and could not feel everyone's eyes filled with enmity.Feng Ruoqing lifted her hand and casually shot out two wind blades.Kacha! The table legs broke into two, and the table fell to the ground with a crash.The area under Ye Yuan's hands became empty s.p.a.ce, and he was stunned awake; nearly falling to the ground.Fortunately, his movement technique was already at the acme of perfection, so he managed to stabilize his figure.\"What happened?\" Ye Yuan obviously still was not aware of the situation.But he immediately discovered something was off, because all the students were staring at him, and the beautiful teacher in front of him had a fierce expression. He quickly realized what happened.\"Ah . . . Haha . . . Teacher Feng, you know this; I just experienced a deathmatch yesterday, and I exhausted too much essence energy. I still haven't recovered after one night so I couldn't help myself from falling asleep. Haha . . .\" Ye Yuan tried to laugh and smoke his way through.Feng Ruoqing did not recognize Ye Yuan, but she had indeed heard about the deathmatch yesterday that caused a huge commotion.Hearing what Ye Yuan said, Feng Ruoqing's expression became slightly better. But Feng Ruoqing felt that behavior like sleeping during cla.s.s should not be tolerated.\"You are that Ye Yuan?\"\"Haha. I'm that Ye Yuan\"\"Don't be cheeky during the lesson!\"\"Ah. Yes yes, Teacher Feng is right. I will be serious!\"\"En. If it's because of the deathmatch, then it's still understandable.\" Ye Yuan thought that this was over, but who knew that Feng Ruoqing would change the subject. \"However, in the Dan Wu Academy, the Alchemy Path is as equally important as the Martial Path. Medicinal theory cla.s.s is also the foundation of Alchemy Dao. Someone like you who sleeps in cla.s.s is delaying your future!\"Ye Yuan apologized with sincerity. \"Teacher Feng, I was wrong. I won't sleep during your lesson ever again.\"\"Humph! Not just my lesson; you are not allowed to sleep in all lessons! Go back and copy the 'Herbal Essentials' ten times. I will check during the next lesson,\" Feng Ruoqing said lightly.\"Ah? T-ten times?\" Ye Yuan was stunned.The 'Herbal Essentials' was a simplified version of the 'Herbal Compendium' written by an Alchemy Sovereign of his generation, Li s.h.i.+zhen. It covered a systemic overview of all sorts of medicinal herbs.Although it's a simplified version, it was still a very thick book. Copying it ten times was too horrifying!Ye Yuan had some impression of the name Li s.h.i.+zhen; he came to apprentice himself to his father, Zhengyang Zi. Back then, Qingyun Zi happened to be at the scene.That punk . . . after I return to the Divine Realm, I will definitely show him some colors! I should teach him what shouldn't be written, to actually write such a thick book!Since he already wrote such a thick book, then forget it. But there were so many things inside that were incorrect. Wasn't this harming others?!\"That's right, ten times! Any complaints?\" Feng Ruoqing felt that she absolutely could not tolerate this matter, so as to serve as a warning to others.\"Yes, I have!\" Ye Yuan cried out.Ye Yuan's words stunned Feng Ruoqing, along with all the other students.In the students' opinion, being punished by Teacher Feng who was as beautiful as a heavenly fairy was something wonderful. Why would there be any complaints?The way Feng Ruoqing saw it, this was the first time that she was rebuffed in the academy. Furthermore, it was a man. Moreover, he was even a student!\"The things inside here are so simple. Isn't copying it a waste of time? If there's time, then it's better off to just refine two furnaces of medicinal pills.\" Ye Yuan refused to give in.Right now, Ye Yuan's time was very precious. He did not want to waste it on these trivial matters.What a joke. Was there anyone who understood medicinal theories better than him in this world?Even if Li s.h.i.+zhen personally came back, he would not even be fit to carry his shoes!\"Simple? Haha . . .\" Feng Ruoqing was so angered by Ye Yuan that she started laughing.'Herbal Essentials' was not only one of the compulsory lessons for an alchemist but also a highly profound course. Even if Alchemy Kings were to come, they would not dare say that this course was simple.Yet, this brat who was not even an Alchemy Apprentice actually said it was easy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was the syllabus that even an Alchemy King needed to devote all his attention to study.And now, this punk in front of her who was not even an Alchemy Apprentice actually said that 'Herbal Essentials' was simple. This was simply humiliating all her years of hard work.Ye Yuan did not seem to hear the meaning inside Feng Ruoqing's words and casually said, \"Yeah, it's too simple. The person who wrote the book didn't observe and study properly.\"Everyone was gloating over Ye Yuan's misfortunate currently. They wanted to see just how Teacher Feng would punish this fool.Many among them were cheated out of Essence Qi Pills by Ye Yuan. Now that they saw Ye Yuan being beaten, they naturally welcomed it.During the deathmatch, the shock that Ye Yuan gave them was too great, making them feel that the current Ye Yuan was no longer the man he was. But looking at things today, Ye Yuan was indeed still that Ye Yuan of the past.Ignorant and fearless!\"Good! Good!\" Feng Ruoqing said two 'good' in a row. It was clear that she was extremely angry. \"I want to see just how 'Herbal Essentials' is easy. I will ask a question. If you can answer it, then in future medicinal theory cla.s.ses, you can sleep however you like. But, if you can't answer, I want you to copy the 'Herbal Essentials' one hundred times!\"The way other people saw it, Ye Yuan was definitely dead.Even though Ye Yuan's combat prowess was abnormally strong now, he was not even an Alchemy Apprentice. So how could he possibly answer the questions from the middle-tier Alchemy Master, Teacher Feng?But Ye Yuan himself let out a sigh of relief. Answering questions were much better. He did not want to copy that stupid 'Herbal Essentials' ten times.In terms of medicinal theory, who dared to compete with him?\"That's great. Teacher Feng, please ask your question.\"Looking at how impatient Ye Yuan was, Feng Ruoqing was incensed and thought to herself that he would cry later.Feng Ruoqing pulled a long face and said, \"What medicinal herbs are used in refining Qi Returning Pill? What are the steps involved in the refinement?\"Feng Ruoqing asked this in a single breath and stared coldly at Ye Yuan.The other students also stared at Ye Yuan, gloating at his misfortune. They knew that Ye Yuan was definitely going to make a fool of himself.A Qi Returning Pill was a high-grade Tier 1 medicinal pill, something that martial artists used to recover their essence energy. Refining it required at least the power of a high-tier Alchemy Apprentice. To the Ye Yuan who was not even an Alchemy Apprentice, it was absolutely a highly challenging question.Among the students, there were only a few who could refine this sort of medicinal pill.Since n.o.body could refine it, there would obviously be no one who would pay attention to the pill formula of the Qi Returning Pill. Let alone paying any attention to its theory and points to take note of.Hence, n.o.body thought that Ye Yuan could answer the question.Ye Yuan touched his chin and said, \"Oh, Qi Returning Pill? Simple. The core ingredients are the Jade Toad's inner core and Crimson Sun Sword Toothed Flower. The secondary ingredients are Four Seasons Azure, Wind-Tail Gra.s.s, Sky Southern Star, and etc. One has to pay some attention to the procedure. Separate the secondary ingredients into two portions to temper; one of it with Jade Toad's Inner core, and the other with Crimson Sun Sword Toothed Flower; in order to extract two portions of the medicinal essence. Then, refine it in the furnace at the same time, and finally, merge it into one.\"After Ye Yuan said finished, everybody started laughing.They did not know the pill formula, but this refinement technique was complete rubbish. Splitting the ingredients into two portions, then extracting and refining two portions of the medicinal essence, and finally into the furnace? How does one control it? And also, how would one merge it?This sort of refinement technique was unheard of. One could only say that this Ye Yuan knew nothing about it and was trying to hoodwink Feng Ruoqing!To dare play tricks on Teacher Feng, this fellow was going to suffer for it.A hundred times, oh , one hundred times!Who asked you to scam our Essence Qi pills! You deserved it!After a series of laughter, everyone still did not hear Teacher Feng's exasperated reprimanding.Looking again, Teacher Feng's face showed a thoughtful expression. Everyone could not help but question the situation. Could it be that this fellow actually managed to fool Teacher Feng?\"Ooo? You are saying Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?\" Feng Ruoqing asked.Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"Teacher Feng is indeed well-read, to even know Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.\"Ye Yuan did some research on the Dan Wu Academy's refinement techniques. This Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was a rather obscure refinement technique which the average person would not know.Saying it was obscure was because it was too difficult to learn. The average person could not grasp it at all.Controlling two separate medicinal essences in a furnace of medicinal pills and not letting the two medicinal essences touch at all required one to split their focus. Furthermore, the control over essence energy had to be extremely even. The difficulty involved could not be imagined.It was impossible to control without going through severe training and being repeatedly tempered with experience.However, this was not even hard for Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan had perfect command over refinement techniques that were even a hundred times, a thousand times more complex.\"If one uses Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique, is it also appropriate for Duo-Cycle Qi Returning Pill?\" The initially cold and prideful Feng Ruoqing looked like a student thirsting for knowledge currently, making everyone's gla.s.ses dropped in shock.Could it be that Ye Yuan was also a genius in alchemy? The things that he said completely exceeded the understanding of all the students here.\"Of course, it's appropriate. It's just that the ingredients for the Duo-Cycle Qi Returning Pill are a little more complex, and the refinement process is also a bit more complicated. But the principle still applies. Using the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique is naturally fitting.\"Ye Yuan's words flowed with ease as if he was the teacher now, and the well-read Feng Ruoqing had become the student.Feng Ruoqing's eyes lit up, and she muttered to herself, \"That's right. Why didn't I think of using the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?\"A Duo-Cycle Qi Returning Pill was a high-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill. Currently, Feng Ruoqing was a middle-tier Alchemy Master; her soul strength was between middle-tier Alchemy Master and high-tier Alchemy Master. Being slightly inadequate, the refinement was obviously very taxing.But this Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique could avoid the weakness of insufficient soul strength, as tempering two smaller portions of medicinal essence separately would be much easier than controlling one large portion of the medicinal essence. It was just that the requirement for an alchemist's control ability was too demanding.In addition, the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique had another advantage, which was separating the core ingredients allowed their medicinal efficacy to be preserved to the highest degree, resulting in an even higher quality pill after refinement!If an alchemist was highly proficient in using the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique, the quality of the medicinal pill that he refined would be higher than other alchemists of the same level.Having said that, conventional refinement techniques were already more than enough for alchemists to study. To also study an obscure technique like the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was simply asking for trouble.Hence, even though the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was powerful, little to n.o.body knew it.\"Uh. Teacher Feng, since I already answered, can I go back to sleep now? You just look at my table . . .\" Ye Yuan said with an innocent face.\"You!\" Feng Ruoqing never expected that this fellow was still concerned about his sleep right now. Her originally subsided wrath surged once again.\"Teacher Feng, you were the one who said it just now. If I could answer your question, then I can sleep however I want. Uh. Even though it isn't very polite, but I'm really very tired right now . . .\" Ye Yuan had a troubled face.Feng Ruoqing looked at Ye Yuan's pair of panda eyes and knew that Ye Yuan was not lying. But what did this fellow do yesterday? Even if he went through a deathmatch yesterday, he should not be so tired today, right?\"Did I say anything?\" Feng Ruoqing blinked her eyes, and gave every student a threatening glance, asking, \"Did I say anything just now?\"Being unreasonable was the privilege of a woman, especially it was this unparalleled beauty, Teacher Feng Ruoqing.All the students were petrified, and many revealed embarra.s.sed expressions. \"Ah? S-said what? D-didn't say anything. That's right. How could Teacher Feng possibly say something like that?\"Ye Yuan was thoroughly defeated. Right now, the only thing he wanted to do was to sleep . . .\"T-teacher Feng . . .\"\"Oh? It's not impossible to go back to sleep, but you have to promise me one thing!\"So it turns out the reason was here! But right now . . .\"Let alone one thing, even ten things will do.\"\"Good. I need a student to be my a.s.sistant. You will be my a.s.sistant.\"Everyone was petrified once more. . .Why did not such a wonderful ch.o.r.e happen to them?!Whoosh . . .Executing Instant Flash, Ye Yuan was gone, leaving his voice echoing on the spot, \"No problem . . .\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was seriously too sleepy.How could he not catch up on sleep when he would have another fierce battle at night?As for becoming an a.s.sistant, Ye Yuan only casually agreed to it. At that moment, he did not have any choice.Feng Ruoqing was a genuine Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist. If she did not let Ye Yuan go, then he would absolutely not be able to leave, even with his Instant Flash.Back at his residence, Ye Yuan slept all the way till dusk before waking up leisurely.Throwing a transcendent-grade Qi Returning Pill down his throat, plus the recovery rate while he was sleeping, essence energy in his body was quickly restored.This Qi Returning Pill was refined before Ye Yuan set off, and it came quite handy now.After his essence energy was restored, Ye Yuan continued using the Six Astral Array to refine transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills.This was a colossal project. Tens of thousands of high-grade Essence Qi Pills . . . Even if one refined six each time, it would make several thousand transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills.And just like this, Ye Yuan slept during the day and refined pills during the night.At dusk two days later, Ye Yuan had just woken up and was about to refine the last batch of transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills, when an unexpected guest arrived. It was the host of the deathmatch, Huyan Yong.Ye Yuan was called out by Lu-er. He then blocked the entrance to the room in a weird manner to avoid Huyan Yong from being able to peer inside.\"Haha. h.e.l.lo, Teacher Huyan. Are you looking for me for something? I still have some matters to attend to, so let's keep it short, shall we?\" Ye Yuan laughed and said to Huyan Yong.Huyan Yong was not someone who bothered with such trivialities and did not become angry at Ye Yuan's behavior. He asked curiously, \"Since I'm here, you are not going to invite me in to have a seat?\"Ye Yuan stood vigilantly in front of the door without any intention of letting him in. If he were to let Huyan Yong see that he could freely refine transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills . . . at that time, not only the Dan Wu Academy, the entire state of Qin would be in chaos.\"That . . . It's too messy inside. So it's better for Teacher Huyan to not go in. After I clean up, I will invite Teacher Huyan over to have a cup of tea another day.\" Ye Yuan tried to evade the question.Ye Yuan had heard before that Huyan Yong was usually a little cold, but he was a very fair and honest man. So he was not afraid that he would barge in.Huyan Yong knew that Ye Yuan was clearly doing something fishy inside, but the residences of students were private after all. It would not be reasonable of him to barge in, so he gave up.\"Alright then. I will await your invitation.\"Ye Yuan was only being polite, but he never expected that Huyan Yong would just follow up like that.Everyone said that Huyan Yong was infatuated with Martial Dao and did not curry favor with anyone. Why was he so different today?\"I came to look for you because I wanted to tell you that with your current strength, you should be able to barely make it into Black rank. So you can go take the advancement test already,\" Huyan Yong said his intention for visiting.In the Dan Wu Academy, what rank you were in was not determined by cultivation realm, but actual combat power.If a student felt that his power was sufficient, then he could undergo the advancement test at the Illusionary Spirit Tower. The moment he pa.s.sed, he would advance a rank. And Huyan Yong was the teacher in charge of the advancement test.In reality, many of the Black Rank students in the Dan Wu Academy got in through connections. Their potential was limited, so they belonged to the type where they just sit around doing nothing, waiting to die. The true elites were in Earth Rank and above.Previously, Ye Yuan naturally also belonged to the type who just sat around waiting to die.Fei Qingping's strength was initially already outstanding among the Black Rank students. After rising to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm, he already possessed the strength to take on the Black Rank test.However, if that were simply the case, Huyan Yong would not personally look for Ye Yuan to take the test.Challenging the Illusionary Spirit Tower was a student's personal matter. He could not even be bothered to go and urge the students.During the deathmatch, Huyan Yong developed a strong interest in Ye Yuan, this dark horse.Clearly, there were many secrets on Ye Yuan's body. Of course, this was not something amazing. Which accomplished person did not carry secrets on them?Martial Roll of Honor's rank one, Long Tang, and rank two, Zuo Bugui. These people definitely all had their own lucky encounters. This was not something that the academy would be bothered with. What the academy needed were powerful students.Even though Ye Yuan was only at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm right now, he managed to kill the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm Fei Qingping during the deathmatch.But most importantly, Huyan Yong felt that Ye Yuan did not go all out during the deathmatch. He really wanted to see where Ye Yuan's limits were.The Illusionary Spirit Tower test was naturally a good place to test Ye Yuan's true power.In the Dan Wu Academy, students would rush to take the test once their strength reached the standard for advancing. However, Huyan Yong heard that Ye Yuan spent the past few days sleeping during the lesson and did not seem to have any intention of partic.i.p.ating in the test. Therefore, he personally came to look for Ye Yuan to take the test.\"Ah? Advancement test? Alright, when can I join?\" Ye Yuan was stunned for a moment before readily accepting.These few days, Ye Yuan was only thinking of increasing his strength as soon as possible, which was why he forgot about joining the advancement test.Someone who did not incur the jealousy of others was a mediocre person. Ye Yuan was not afraid of showing off his abilities.Ye Yuan was an Alchemy Emperor previously and did not need to be overly cautious within this tiny Dan Wu Academy. He also wanted to see just where the current limits of his strength were.Ye Yuan's reply made Huyan Yong a little surprised. He thought that Ye Yuan had some difficult dilemma, which was why he did not rush to join the test.\"Any time will do,\" Huyan Yong said.\"Alright. Then I will go over to the Illusionary Spirit Tower tomorrow morning,\" Ye Yuan thought about it for a moment before replying.Huyan Yong nodded and turned to leave.\"Just a moment, Teacher Huyan,\" Ye Yuan suddenly recalled a matter and called out to Huyan Yong.\"Anything else?\"\"I want to let my maidservant partic.i.p.ate in the academy's entrance test. I wonder if Teacher Huyan could arrange for it.\"Lu-er had followed Ye Yuan into the Dan Wu Academy for quite a few days already. However, Ye Yuan was always busy these few days, so he was not free to help her settle down. Today, since he coincidentally met up with Huyan Yong, it did not seem like an unreasonable matter to ask him to arrange the test for her.According to the academy's rules, students were not allowed to freely bring followers into the academy no matter how powerful their background was. There was no issue for Lu-er to stay a few days temporarily, but the academy would definitely investigate after a while.\"That young lady just now? At such a young age and already at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. I suppose she barely qualifies to partic.i.p.ate in the test. Alright, bring her along with you tomorrow,\" Huyan Yong nodded his head and said to Ye Yuan.With Huyan Yong's cultivation, he naturally could see Lu-er's strength at a glance.Lu-er was younger than Ye Yuan by one year. Being able to cultivate to Third Level Essence Qi Realm was barely pa.s.sable. Huyan Yong obviously would not mind too much.However, who knows what his thoughts would be if he were to find out that it took less than a month for Lu-er to cultivate essence energy to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.In reality, even Ye Yuan was highly astonished by Lu-er's cultivation speed.She used a single night to reach the First Level Essence Qi Realm, and after five days under the aid of Ye Yuan's Explosive Yuan Pill, she successfully broke through to the Second Level Essence Qi Realm.And yesterday after consuming transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills consecutively, Lu-er broke through once more, reaching the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, almost catching up to Ye Yuan.If this sort of cultivation speed were spread out, it would be an absolutely astounding matter.Even though there was the aid of medicinal pills, Lu-er's monstrous talent was even more important. In front of Lu-er, all those so-called geniuses in the State of Qin were overshadowed by her.Obviously, there was also the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul that Ye Yuan taught her. It was as if it were custom-made for Lu-er, making her cultivate quite successfully with ease.Lu-er was naturally gifted. These past few days, Ye Yuan taught her several suitable martial techniques. She quickly grasped them, as if she was born just for cultivation.Lu-er's current strength was absolutely no weaker than the average Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. There should not be a problem to pa.s.s the entrance test.Both master and servant going to partic.i.p.ate in the test together was something worth antic.i.p.ating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

By constantly draining his essence energy, unknowingly, Ye Yuan's cultivation realm had thoroughly stabilized.Right now, he was only one step away from the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. As long as the acc.u.mulation of essence energy was sufficient, Ye Yuan could break through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm at any time.What's left was naturally stuffing himself with pills.\"Huuu. Finally done. Lu-er, help me stand guard, I'm going to break through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm,\" Ye Yuan instructed Lu-er.The last batch of pills left today weren't many, so Ye Yuan did not expend too much essence energy.After taking a Qi Returning Pill and meditating for an hour, Ye Yuan recovered to his peak condition.Casually taking out five transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills and throwing them into his mouth, Ye Yuan executed the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art and started to impact through the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.If it were some other Third Level Essence Qi Realm, they would definitely die due to the violent essence energy just from consuming five transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills at once.However, Ye Yuan's Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was just too powerful. The violent essence energy was currently as obedient as a lamb as it moved along Ye Yuan's meridians; it even appeared to lack the strength to carry on.Without thinking too much, Ye Yuan swallowed another three transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills before the essence energy barely managed to reach the requirement.Ye Yuan revolved around his thick and abundant essence energy, impacting through the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm bottleneck. Unlike other people, he did not encounter a large resistance and surged forth like a current; slowly, yet powerfully.The Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm!A bottleneck that would take several months, even a year for an ordinary person to break through, only took Ye Yuan two hours.However, Ye Yuan did not stop cultivating. He continued to swallow transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills non-stop, only ceasing when he reached the peak of Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.Sensing essence energy that was several times thicker than when he was at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, Ye Yuan shook his head instead.\"Still too weak! I wonder when I will have the strength to charge back to the Divine Realm. However, if I were to have a deathmatch with Fei Qingping here once more, I can instantly kill him with only First Layer Wave.\"After a night of cultivation, the sun was already up, and it was almost time to go look for Huyan Yong.Ye Yuan had just advanced to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, so his fatigue was swept away long ago. Presently, Lu-er was also a cultivator. Meditating one night did not have much effect on her.Master and servant went to the Illusionary Spirit Tower together. Huyan Yong had already been waiting there for a long time.\"h.e.l.lo, Teacher Huyan,\" Ye Yuan brought Lu-er up and greeted him.Huyan Yong nodded and acknowledged him calmly.Huyan Yong instinctively swept his divine sense over Ye Yuan's body, and his initially cold face revealed a slight astonishment.\"I didn't see you for one night, and you are already at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm?\" Huyan Yong asked in amazement.\"Haha. Lucky, lucky,\" Ye Yuan laughed and said.Huyan Yong shook his head and said, \"At first, other people said that your cultivation realm was forcefully raised by your father. But I knew that it wasn't the case after watching your deathmatch. However, I never expected that you would advance a small stage, rising to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\"In any case, I'm an Alchemy Grandmaster's son who mainly grew up eating medicinal pills. If I still can't reach Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm at this age, I will be throwing my father's face,\" Ye Yuan said, his words being half genuine, half false.Huyan Yong nodded and did not say much, as if in silent agreement with what Ye Yuan said.\"The test hasn't started yet. You two wait awhile,\" Huyan Yong said.Clearly, it was not only Ye Yuan and Lu-er who were partic.i.p.ating in the test. There were already over a dozen people waiting there.\"Alright, Teacher Huyan.\" Ye Yuan didn't waste his breath and brought Lu-er to stand with that group of people.However, Ye Yuan's appearance caused a stir.Presently, he was too famous. Not only did he kill Fei Qingping who was higher than him by two minor cultivation realms in a deathmatch, but he also scammed thousands of Essence Qi Pills from several hundred students.Even if they did not want to recognize him, they could not.\"You guys, isn't that Ye Yuan over there? He also came to partic.i.p.ate in the advancement test?\"\"What's so strange about it? That Fei Qingping already barely had strength close to the Black rank. Since Ye Yuan could finish him off, isn't it very normal to join the advancement test?\"\"That makes sense. But for a Third Level Essence Qi Realm to join the Black rank test, he can be considered exceptional.\"\"Don't be silly. Back then, wasn't Senior Apprentice Brother Long also at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm when he partic.i.p.ated in the Black rank test? No matter how powerful Ye Yuan is, can he be stronger than Senior Apprentice Brother Long?\"\"But his Stacking Waves Layered Palm was trained until the Second Layer Wave. Surely he's at least stronger than Senior Apprentice Brother Long in that aspect? Senior Apprentice Brother Long trained for a month before barely mastering the First Layer Wave.\"\"Tsk. He was just lucky that the martial technique suited him. How can he possibly compare with Senior Apprentice Brother Long?\"\"Then how do you explain his great circle stage Instant Flash?\"\" . . . . . .\"\"Yii? Look.\"\"Look at what? Making such a fuss.\"\"Ye Yuan seems to have . . . broken through . . .\"\"Broken through what? H-he . . . he is already at Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm! Heavens! Is this fellow still human? How many days has it only been since he advanced to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\" . . . . . .\"When these two people discovered that Ye Yuan broke through, their expressions were like they have seen a ghost.At this moment, others also clearly noticed that Ye Yuan broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, and their eyes when looking at Ye Yuan became peculiar.\"Haha. What's everyone looking at me for? I know I'm very handsome, but I don't swing that way. So don't look at me with that sort of expression, alright? Isn't it just breaking through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm? It's not like it's something major. All of you Senior Apprentice Brothers have a higher cultivation realm than me, so can everybody stop being so amazed?\" Ye Yuan was not uncomfortable with the attention and just brushed it off casually.Everybody was collectively made speechless. Was this fellow here to posture?Breaking through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm was the first threshold on the Martial Path. Who among them would not exercise extreme caution, spending large amounts of time to acc.u.mulate before breaking through?But Ye Yuan only used a few days before crossing it. Now, he a.s.sumed a manner like it was too easy. He was really asking for a beating!\"Isn't it just breaking through to Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm? What's there to be surprised about? No matter how he jumps around, isn't it just Black Rank? Even if he reached the Black Rank, he is still just trash.\"The discussion was broken by an arrogant voice filled with condescension.\"It's Senior Apprentice Brother Lin Tiancheng. He is currently a student in the Earth Rank most likely to advance to the Heaven Rank! I didn't expect him to also partic.i.p.ate in this advancement test. Looks like he is almost certain that he can advance to Heaven Rank this time.\" Very quickly, someone recognized the owner of the voice.Lin Tiancheng slowly walked with his hands behind his back in front of Ye Yuan, bringing with him an overbearing pressure and asked, \"You are Ye Yuan?\"Ye Yuan was not the slightest bit uncomfortable facing Lin Tiancheng's pressure and said calmly, \"I don't know if the Ye Yuan you are talking about is me, but I am indeed called Ye Yuan.\"\"Humph! What a glib tongue! These few days, all I've been hearing are all sorts of clamoring about you. Today, I want to see if you really are as incredible as they say,\" Lin Tiancheng said with a face full of disdain.\"Is that so? I'm actually so famous now? To think that even Senior Apprentice Brother Lin hear my name all the time. However, I think it's my first time hearing of Senior Apprentice Brother Lin today. I wonder if . . . Senior Apprentice Brother Lin can advance to Heaven Rank today. This Junior Apprentice Brother, I, wish that Senior Apprentice Brother Lin won't stumble and fail.\"Ye Yuan still had an exaggerated expression, but the words that came out of his mouth made everyone break into a sweat.This fellow seemed to be cursing Lin Tiancheng to fail . . .However, these words really struck Lin Tiancheng's soft spot . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was the strongest among the remaining few who had yet to advance.This was Lin Tiancheng's greatest shame. Hence, it was a taboo for others to mention this in front of him. Low ranking students would take special care to avoid it.Whether it was a coincidence or not, Ye Yuan's words struck Ling Tiancheng's soft spot.Lin Tiancheng's face visibly changed color. Glaring fiercely at Ye Yuan, he said, \"You have guts! To actually talk like this to your senior apprentice brother! I think you are courting death!\"As he said this, Lin Tiancheng gathered his essence energy and smacked a palm towards Ye Yuan.Smas.h.!.+Ye Yuan stood there without moving, but Lin Tiancheng flew backward instead.Rolling on the ground, Lin Tiancheng barely managed to stabilize his body, looking extremely ragged.\"Which b.a.s.t.a.r.d ambushed me?!\" Lin Tiancheng bellowed angrily.The moment he said this, Lin Tiancheng saw that the surrounding people looked at him with odd expressions and was not sure what it meant.\"Lin Tiancheng, you got the nerve to actually attack right in front of me?!\" Huyan Yong's icy voice sounded out, making Lin Tiancheng shudder involuntarily.Facing Huyan Yong, how would Lin Tiancheng have the courage to resist?He broke into a cold sweat. To actually scold Teacher Huyan a b.a.s.t.a.r.d, isn't that courting death? Huyan Yong was the person hosting the test. If he was to secretly play some tricks, wouldn't he have to return in defeat?If Huyan Yong bore a grudge, then he can forget about advancing ranks for life.\"S-sorry Teacher Huyan. I-I didn't know it was you,\" Lin Tiancheng hurriedly apologized.Huyan Yong was expressionless as he said, \"The Illusionary Spirit Tower is the place for advancement tests. You actually dared to take action without my permission? If you affect the other students' test, can you handle the responsibility?\"\"Teacher Huyan, I . . . He. . . ridiculed me with words on purpose to agitate me into making a move!\" Lin Tiancheng did not dare to offend Huyan Yong, so he naturally pushed the blame to Ye Yuan.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, you can't slander good people. I was clearly wis.h.i.+ng you success in your test, but I don't know how I provoked you to actually attack me. Could it be that Senior Apprentice Brother Lin came here to partic.i.p.ate in the Illusionary Spirit Tower's test, but don't want to advance?\" Ye Yuan gave a perplexed face.Just now, Ye Yuan indeed told Lin Tiancheng to take care not to stumble and fail. It was impossible to find a problem with those words. Except, looking at that exaggerated expression, n.o.body would believe that he was wis.h.i.+ng Lin Tiancheng well.The pitiful Lin Tiancheng still did not know that Ye Yuan came today to join the test today because Huyan Yong personally invited him.Without mentioning the fact that the matter was stirred up by Lin Tiancheng, even if he was in the right, it was impossible for Huyan Yong to stand on his side.\"I already saw what happened just now. From the start until the end, it was you who was doing all the mocking. Do you think that I, this examiner, am so easy to be deceived?\" Huyan Yong's voice became increasingly colder.\"N-n-no, I . . .\"\"Stay here and don't move! Considering that it was your first infraction, I will overlook it. But, if you violate the rules again, I will revoke your a.s.sessment rights!\"Lin Tiancheng did not dare to talk back anymore and quietly went to wait by the side.After waiting for a while, students came one by one. After around 50 people were gathered, Huyan Yong once again appeared in front of everyone.\"Now that everyone is present, in a while, I will open up the restrictions. The Illusionary Spirit Tower will automatically send you to the test site corresponding to your cultivation! Many of you had undergone the advancement test before, but it's the first time for a few of you, so I will briefly go through.\"Huyan Yong briefly summarized the important points about the Illusionary Spirit Tower.Actually, he was explaining especially for Ye Yuan and Lu-er. In this batch, apart from Ye Yuan and Lu-er, everybody else had partic.i.p.ated in the advancement test before.Forgetting about Lu-er, Ye Yuan by right should have gone through the entrance test in the Illusionary Spirit Tower before. But his predecessor was just too weak, and it was impossible for him to have pa.s.sed the test in the Illusionary Spirit Tower. Thus, Ye Hang pulled a lot of strings back then before managing to shove Ye Yuan in here. Therefore, he had never even gone to the Illusionary Spirit Tower before.Feeling the layers of restrictions on the Illusionary Spirit Tower, Ye Yuan praised and commented, \"So it's a 32 restrictions Spirit Artifact. Tranquil Cloud Sect does indeed have some means.\"A 32 restrictions Spirit Artifact naturally was not much in Ye Yuan's eyes. However, even though this Spirit Artifact's rank was not high, it had some unique features, making it suitable to being used for the students' advancement testing.This Illusionary Spirit Tower seemed to have been specially developed by the Tranquil Cloud Sect for a.s.sessing student into ranks. There are a total of five regions, namely, Entry Advancement, Yellow Rank Advancement, Black Rank Advancement, Earth Rank Advancement, and Heaven Rank Advancement.The first four regions corresponded to the four student rankings in the Dan Wu Academy. Pa.s.sing the Entry Advancement allows one to advance to the Yellow Rank. Pa.s.sing the Yellow Rank Advancement allowed one to advance to the Black Rank, and so on. 1Lastly, the Heaven Rank Advancement was what the Tranquil Cloud Sect used to determine if Heaven rank students were qualified to enter the sect. It was a test for becoming outer-sect disciples.Clearly, the difficulty of the five tests increased progressively. By the time it was the Black Rank Advancement test, the difficulty was already rather over the top.In reality, Lin Tiancheng's talent was not bad. It was just that the Earth Rank Advancement test was truly too outrageous. That was why he failed repeatedly. There were many students like him among the Earth Rank students.As for the Heaven Rank Advancement test . . .\"I really hope that one of you will be qualified to partic.i.p.ate in that test during your student life here in the Dan Wu Academy,\" Huyan Yong told the students.Huyan Yong's words did not stir too much of a reaction from everyone. Clearly, they all knew just how terrifying the test was.What Huyan Yong said was 'qualified,' and not to 'pa.s.s.' That is to say that none of the people here would even get the chance to attempt the test before they graduate from the Dan Wu Academy at twenty.One could only imagine the difficulty of that test!Most of the students here today were partic.i.p.ating in the Black Rank Advancement test, aka, the test for a Black Rank to advance to the Earth Rank. A minority was partic.i.p.ating in the Yellow Rank Advancement test and the Earth Rank Advancement test. Lu-er was the only person partic.i.p.ating in the Entry Advancement test.\"The first time you enter the Illusionary Spirit Tower, you can take part in multiple rank advancement tests; all the way until you get killed, or voluntarily withdraw. After pa.s.sing a test, you will automatically be sent to the next test. There, you can make a decision if you want to undergo the next test or not. At that point, the Illusionary Spirit Tower will record the rank advancement test you are killed at. The next time you enter the Illusionary Spirit Tower, you will start anew from that rank. Alright, now enter the Illusionary Spirit Tower!\" Clearly, Huyan Yong's last few sentences were meant for Ye Yuan.Huyan Yong then walked in front of the Illusionary Spirit Tower's gate and gestured his hand up in a half arc in front of him. Faint black essence energy was shot into the Illusionary Spirit Tower.Following that, the Illusionary Spirit Tower's gate slowly opened.The students partic.i.p.ating in the test entered in an orderly manner. The moment they entered the gate, they vanished. It was clear that they were sent away by the Illusionary Spirit Tower.When it was Lin Tiancheng's turn to go in, he shot a fierce glare at Ye Yuan. \"If you can't advance to the Earth Rank, you will forever be tras.h.!.+ You are considered lucky today with Teacher Huyan helping you. In the future, don't let me see you in the academy; otherwise, you are dead!\"After threating Ye Yuan, Lin Tiancheng stepped forward and vanished instantly.Ye Yuan gave a laugh and did not take Lin Tiancheng's warning to heart. He turned to Lu-er and said, \"Lu-er, let's go in too.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each student was in a different s.p.a.ce.However, this sort of method did not count as mystical in the Divine Realm. But it was already very impressive for a tiny sect in the Lower Realms to be able to use this sort of method to groom students.Ye Yuan was at a lost. There was nothing in this empty s.p.a.ce. So how could the test take place?At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded out.\"Welcome to the Illusionary Spirit Tower. This is your first time coming to the Illusionary Spirit Tower. You will undergo the Entry Advancement test shortly. I am your guide during this test.\"Ye Yuan did not make a fuss over it as he knew that it was definitely the Illusionary Spirit Tower's artifact spirit.However, what made Ye Yuan surprised was that he was actually sent to the Entry Advancement test.It looks like the Illusionary Spirit Tower will automatically send first-time students to the Entry Advancement test. As a result, Ye Yuan and Lu-er were now standing on the same starting line.\"What am I supposed to do now?\" Ye Yuan asked.The artifact spirit seemed to hesitate for a moment, being somewhat surprised at Ye Yuan's composure.As the artifact spirit was in charge of the advancement test, it had directed countless of students before. This was its first time meeting a student as composed as Ye Yuan.\"Right now, just sit down and meditate. I will bring you to the test. Later, don't attempt to resist whatever that happens. Otherwise, bear the consequences yourself,\" said the artifact spirit.Ye Yuan did not say a word, and he just sat down and meditated right away.He was a little curious, however, at just how the artifact spirit would conduct the test.A moment later, Ye Yuan felt his body starting to feel light. Falling into a trance, he entered an empty training room.Seeing this situation, the corner of Ye Yuan's mouth curled into a smile.So that's how it is. This Illusionary Spirit Tower's artifact spirit is actually a Dream Tapir. The Tranquil Cloud Sect indeed have some impressive methods. A 32 restrictions Spirit Artifact . . . It looks like it should be the lowest ranking Gray Dream Tapir. Conducting tests in a dream world were both safe and fair. It seemed the person who created the Illusionary Spirit Tower was quite brilliant.Dream tapirs were bizarre lifeforms which were intricately tied with dream worlds. They have their own consciousness, yet they do not have a fixed shape. They could silently enter the dream world of humans and even demonic beasts, strengthening themselves within the dream.Ye Yuan knew that the highest ranking White Dream Tapir existed in the Divine Realm. It possessed incredibly powerful abilities and could even compete with Divine Kings. Their abilities all had to do with dream worlds, making it impossible to guard against.This artifact spirit that Ye Yuan met was most likely the lowest ranking Gray Dream Tapir.They were willing to become the Illusionary Spirit Tower's artifact spirit, most likely because they wanted to borrow the students' dream worlds to strengthen themselves.Otherwise, even the lowest ranking Gray Dream Tapir was not something that a tiny sect like the Tranquil Cloud Sect could capture.One has to know that the State of Qin was not the only country with the Dan Wu Academy. There were similarly also Dan Wu Academies in other countries under the jurisdiction of the Tranquil Cloud Sect. Their a.s.sessment of students was definitely also through the support of the Illusionary Spirit Tower.Such a large-scale capturing of Gray Dream Tapirs would inevitably incur the vengeance of the Dream Tapir tribe. Unless these Gray Dream Tapirs willingly became artifact spirits.Ye Yuan knew that right now, he was already in the dream world.Most likely, that independent s.p.a.ce just now was meant as the medium whereby the Dream Tapir would cast its Nightmare Skill, bringing students into the dream world.While Ye Yuan was expressing his surprise at this methods, he also checked out his strength at the same time.To perfectly project my strength in reality inside this dream world . . . The Dream Tapir tribe's abilities are truly great! This way, there would be no possibility of any trickery. Ye Yuan sighed in admiration.Suddenly, a middle-aged brawny-looking man appeared in front of Ye Yuan. He knew that this brawny-looking man was an illusion created by the Gray Dream Tapir. Within the dream world, Dream Tapirs could take the form of anything.\"Now, I am responsible for your advancement test. The test is about to begin. You can choose your weapon now,\" the Dream Tapir said.\"Choose a weapon? Uh . . . Then I choose a sword.\" Ye Yuan gave an indifferent look. Clearly, he was not even the slightest bit worried about the Entry Advancement test.The Dream Tapir felt that Ye Yuan's att.i.tude was highly unusual. When the other students entered the dream world, they would often ask questions non-stop and did not know what was going on.When Ye Yuan entered, the Dream Tapir noticed that he was not surprised at all. That expression on his face clearly showed that he knew that he was in the dream world.Ye Yuan knew about Dream Tapirs, but this did not mean that others knew about Dream Tapirs too. In reality, Dream Tapirs were part of an extremely mysterious tribe, because they did not possess a fixed shape.Even when in a dream, it was impossible to discover its existence unless the Dream Tapir let you discover it. That was because it could very well be a little mouse in your dream world or maybe even a stalk of gra.s.s.The Dream Tapir naturally would not tell the students its ident.i.ty. It would only inform them that it was the Illusionary Spirit Tower's guide for the test.But this Ye Yuan was not curious about anything at all . . .The Dream Tapir waved his hand, and a completely ordinary-looking sword appeared out of thin air in Ye Yuan's hand.\"Isn't this too shabby?\" Ye Yuan forced a smile.The Dream Tapir said emotionlessly, \"In order to ensure the fairness of the test, the academy requested for us to treat each student equally. No matter what weapon you choose, I will only provide you with the most ordinary one.\"Ye Yuan drew his sword, and a sword light flashed. He said helplessly, \"Alright then, I will make do with this.\"This was the first time the Dream Tapir met somebody who did not care at all. However, it did not think too much about it. A mere Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm rookie was not worth too much of its attention.To the Dream Tapir, whom he was focused on were the few students taking the Earth Rank Advancement test.\"Now, tell me your name and birthplace. I will record down your test results.\" The Dream Tapir remained emotionless.\"The capital, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion, Ye Yuan,\" Ye Yuan reported his name and birthplace.The Dream Tapir nodded and said, \"The test will start now. They are your opponents.\"The Dream Tapir made a gesture, and five black-clothed martial artists appeared out of nowhere. Impressively, they were also at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Following this, the middle-aged brawny-looking man which the Dream Tapir transformed into had vanished. It was clear that it left Ye Yuan to fend for himself.The Entry Advancement test was not worth paying too much attention to it.Ye Yuan swept his glance at the five black-clothed Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists and could not help but smirked. These five black-clothed Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists were the most ordinary kind of Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.When the Dan Wu Academy recruited students, the minimum requirement was for them to break through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm before 16 and to be able to defeat five of the most ordinary type of Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm working together.To the average person, this was an incredibly difficult challenge. In the dream world, weapons, equipment, and medicinal pills could not be brought inside. One could only rely on the abilities they possessed to defeat the opponents.It was virtually impossible to successfully defeat five opponents who were the same cultivation realm as you unless you were a genius.However . . . this was a piece of cake for Ye Yuan.After the Dream Tapir vanished, the five black-clothed martial artists moved at the same time, attacking Ye Yuan from five different angles.Ye Yuan stood straight up and put his sword away before lightly striking out his palm.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave!The ripple of essence energy spread out, and the five black-clothed martial artists flew backward. . .It was evident that the five black-clothed martial artists no longer had any combat power left as they vanished the instant they hit the ground. The next moment, the middle-aged brawny-looking man appeared once again, and he showed a stunned expression.Ye Yuan looked at the Dream Tapir, and gave a faint smile and said, \"My apologies. I forgot to tell you that I'm here to take the Yellow Rank Advancement test.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was because the results of the test might affect their position within the ranking.A light screen displayed everyone's test progress outside the Illusionary Spirit Tower.\"Eh? Did someone pa.s.s the test so quickly? It's Ye Yuan!\" seeing a change in the light screen happened so quickly, someone exclaimed in surprise.\"It's that Ye Yuan who killed Fei Qingping during the deathmatch? That fellow is sick!\"\"But this doesn't mean much either. This should be his first time taking the advancement test, so right now, it should be the Entry Advancement test.\"\"But that is monstrous enough! Calculating the time, he should have just started the test. Even though it's only the Entry Advancement test, he has to face five Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters. Ye Yuan is just at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Could it be that he instantly killed five people at the same level?\"\"Uh. That's really a possibility! Just how great is that fellow's combat prowess? Back then, when I partic.i.p.ated in the Entry Advancement test, I spent the time it took for an entire incense to burn before I managed to finish them off! I'm afraid that even Fei Qingping who broke through also can't instantly kill five Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, right?\"\"Hehe. Looks like I was right for coming today. This Ye Yuan really soared to the skies in one move. I'm really looking forward to just how far he can go during this test!\"No matter what, Ye Yuan instantly killing five martial artists of the same level caused the students to burst into an uproar.All of these students had gone through the Entry Advancement test. But not one of them dared to say that they could instantly kill five opponents at the same level when they were at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.Ye Yuan could kill Fei Qingping who was two minor realms higher than him when he was at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. Now that he was already at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, just how strong is Ye Yuan's combat strength after advancing a minor stage? 1Everyone was curious.Most of them came to see who could advance to Heaven Rank, but now, their attention turned to Ye Yuan.Huyan Yong watched the light screen silently. He, unlike the rest of the surrounding students, was most concerned with Ye Yuan's test.When Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the Entry Advancement test just now, the shock he felt was no less than the other students.When he was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, he could easily defeat five martial artists of the same level. But to talk about instantly killing them . . . that was something impossible for him.This Ye Yuan was truly full of surprises.\"Look! Wan Yuan and Liu Ruoshui came as well. Most likely they came to scout out information to see just where the limits of Ye Yuan's strength laid.\"\"Hehe. I wonder what were they thinking when they saw Ye Yuan pa.s.sing the Entry Advancement test instantly.\"Presently, someone noticed that there were two more people in the crowd. They were precisely Wan Yuan and Liu Ruoshui.Wan Yuan and Ye Yuan's conflict was no longer a secret in the academy. Now that he showed up here, it was obviously because of Ye Yuan.As Wan Yuan looked at Ye Yuan's progress on the light screen, his face sunk.He happened to see the scene of Ye Yuan advancing just as he entered the Illusionary Spirit Tower. Even though it was only the Entry Advancement test, wasn't this speed too fast?Wan Yuan still was not aware that Ye Yuan was already at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. If he knew, who knows what he would think . . .. . . . . .Within the Illusionary Spirit Tower, the Dream Tapir was stunned as he looked at Ye Yuan.He 2 had tested countless student over the years. Each of them possessed the power that outcla.s.sed those at the same level. Some exceptional students could easily defeat these five martial artists. However, this was his first time encountering someone like Ye Yuan who could instantly kill five opponents at the same level.One would have to cross another minor stage, possessing the strength of a Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, before they could instantly kill five Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists.It was not difficult to jump ranks to do battle for genius students. However, it was extremely challenging to cross over an entire minor stage.When Ye Yuan was at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, he could not handle Fei Qingping even when he mastered the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, First Layer Wave. One could see just how difficult it was to jump ranks to battle.Yet now, Ye Yuan could use his strength as a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm to instantly kill five opponents at the same rank. Just how powerful did he have to be to do that!\"My apologies. I forgot to tell you that I'm here to take the Yellow Rank Advancement test,\" Ye Yuan said and smiled lightly.The Dream Tapir was a little unpleased with Ye Yuan's att.i.tude. He frowned slightly and said, \"Alright. The Yellow Rank Advancement test will begin now. This is your opponent.\"The Dream Tapir waved, and another five black-clothed martial artists appeared. The five black-clothed martial artists that appeared this time were shockingly all at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm eh? The difficulty didn't seem to have increased much,\" Ye Yuan muttered to himself.Just as Ye Yuan said, the difficulty of the Yellow Rank Advancement test did not increase too much from the Entry Advancement test. Even though Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm was strong, without crossing a minor stage, it was not exactly insurmountable for students.As students' cultivation realm rose with the acc.u.mulation of time, it would not be difficult to deal with five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters.The truly difficult ones were the Black Rank Advancement test and the Earth Rank Advancement test!The opponents faced in the Black Rank Advancement test would rise to another level; five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists. And the opponents in the Earth Rank Advancement test were five First Level Spirit Condensation Realm fighters!Under normal circ.u.mstances, students would have to increase their cultivation realm in order to pa.s.s the test. Otherwise, it would be far too challenging.One cultivation realm, one layer of heaven. Apart from geniuses like Long Tang, the average person would not be able to jump ranks to battle five martial artists of a higher realm.One would first have to reach Spirit Condensation Realm in order to pa.s.s through the Earth Rank Advancement test to become a Heaven Rank student.Therefore, for Wan Yuan to break through and become an Earth rank student with his Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation, this result was hard to come by. Naturally, the academy would heavily groom him.Five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm opponents; they were much stronger than Fei Qingping.However, back when Ye Yuan was at the Third Level Essence Qi Realm, he could already easily kill Fei Qingping. Now that he was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, these five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters were nothing difficult.The five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters joined hands and attacked together. Ye Yuan's sword remained sheathed, as he once again struck out with a palm.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Second Layer Wave!The five black-clothed martial artists were sent flying once more, and they vanished.The Dream Tapir stared wide-eyed in disbelief at the sight.This brat . . . is too terrifying.Huyan Yong's pupils contracted as he watched the light curtain.Another instant kill? How was this possible?!The Yellow Rank Advancement test consisted of five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters! Each one of them was two minor cultivation realms higher than Ye Yuan! How could it be another instant kill?!Although Huyan Yong knew that Ye Yuan was almost certain to advance to the Black rank when he saw that Ye Yuan was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, he did not expect Ye Yuan to advance with such ease!Five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists . . . Each one of them was stronger than Fei Qingping. Even if Ye Yuan was strong, it was impossible for him to be so ridiculously strong!\"Look guys! Ye Yuan's advancement test ended again! This time, it should be the Yellow Rank Advancement test, right? That's to say, he is already a Black rank student?\"\"T-that fellow is simply too monstrous. A-another instant kill! Just how did that fellow manage to instantly kill five Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm opponents? Even when Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang took the Yellow Rank Advancement test, it wasn't as exaggerated as this.\"\"I'm already drunk. That fellow isn't human at all. He already surpa.s.sed my imaginations . . .\"Wan Yuan gritted his teeth as he looked at the light screen. At this moment, he was feeling an immense threat.Ye Yuan's improvement speed was too fast. At this rate, would he no longer be Ye Yuan's opponent when the time comes for the Endless Trials?No! Ye Yuan must die!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What capital did he still have to challenge Ye Yuan?During the Endless Trials, I must definitely let Senior Apprentice Brother Su finish off Ye Yuan. Otherwise, there will be endless troubles! Wan Yuan made his decision.\"I say, do you think Ye Yuan will enter the Earth ranking?\" After the shock, somebody suddenly thought of that possibility.The moment that was said, everyone became silent.They all knew that Ye Yuan was very strong, but wasn't it too much of an exaggeration for a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm to face off with five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists?It was not uncommon to see a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm jumped ranks to battle with a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. But the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm was an entire four minor cultivation realms higher than the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Furthermore, there was a minor stage in between them.That minor stage was not easy to cross!However, Ye Yuan challenged the Yellow Rank Advancement test and pa.s.sed too easily. It was so quick that it was basically effortless, making them feel a trace of possibility.\"Quickly look! Ye Yuan really went on to challenge the Black Rank Advancement test!\"This shout broke the silence, as everyone's gaze once again concentrated on the light screen.\"This is too crazy! Consecutively challenging three tests during his first time! I'm afraid this made into the Dan Wu Academy's history!\"\"Do you guys think that Ye Yuan can successfully pa.s.s this?\" The person who made everyone fall silent earlier, once again made everybody pondered on this.. . . . . .Facing five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm opponents, Ye Yuan did not take things lightly like before, and he burst forth in an instant.Even so, Ye Yuan was still in perilous danger facing the joint attack from these five opponents.\"F*ck! You actually dare to sneak attack me! These five people actually know how to form a sword array?!\" Ye Yuan shouted as he dodged.\". . . . . .\"The Dream Tapir was speechless.When the Black Rank Advancement test started, the dream tapir secretly added an 'extra ingredient,' making the five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists to attack Ye Yuan with a sword array.After the five black-clothed martial artists used a sword array, their combined might was no weaker than a powerful Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm.Ye Yuan himself was an array master. The moment these five moved out, he discovered it.It naturally was not difficult for him to break the array with his mastery in array formations. But the combined power of these five people was too great. This sort of crus.h.i.+ng advantage left Ye Yuan unable to do anything else, let alone break the array.The enormous difference in power was not something that insights could compensate for. Even if these five people's sword array were full of holes in Ye Yuan's eyes, he could not make a counterattack.Everything was a blur in front of Ye Yuan's eyes, as sword shadows permeated the surroundings.Luckily, Instant Flash was a small radius movement technique; it was perfect for this sort of group battle. Otherwise, even if Ye Yuan had ten lives, he would have long died.Even so, Ye Yuan would still be grazed by sword qi every now and then, leaving him covered with wounds.Although he was in a dream world, the sensation of pain was unbelievably realistic. The Dream Tapir Tribe's Nightmare Skill was truly powerful.Before long, Ye Yuan's clothes were already tattered.As the Dream Tapir looked at Ye Yuan who was trying to cope with the situation, he had a hint of a smile on his face. It was as if satisfied with his revenge.Although Dream Tapirs were born in dream worlds, they also had emotions such as pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy.He did not know why, but from the start when Ye Yuan was unperturbed by everything, it left him very displeased.All these while, he had always been mysterious and haughty. But today, in front of Ye Yuan, he felt like he was stripped naked without any secrets left.Who among the students partic.i.p.ating in the test was not full of respect towards him? It only had to be Ye Yuan with his indifferent att.i.tude. He even postured with instant kills twice, making him feel that he had no face left.Hence, when the Black Rank Advancement test was starting, he secretly added a sword array for those five black-clothed martial artists, increasing their power.\"Brat, this is the result of slighting this seat. 1 Thinking about pa.s.sing the Black Rank Advancement test? Go back and train first!\" The Dream Tapir was secretly pleased.He had been watching the battle, and he knew that Ye Yuan's defensive radius was shrinking. His injuries were also increasing, so he would be defeated sooner or later.However, the Dream Tapir was shocked in his heart at how tenacious Ye Yuan was. To be able to fight with five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm opponents until now with his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm strength. It was simply unthinkable.The Dream Tapir had seen countless geniuses before, but he had never seen a genius who was able to perform to such an extent.But . . . it should end here.. . . . . .Lin Tiancheng was sent out in dismal. He had failed once again. This was already the fifth time he failed to impact through the Heaven ranking!Thinking about the musing looks and those eyes filled with mockery outside, Lin Tiancheng became frustrated.Lin Tiancheng was already at the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm. Facing five First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists was truly a little too forced.It was not that Lin Tiancheng wasn't talented enough and was unable to take that final step. But it was because he had been suppressing his cultivation realm at half-step Spirit Condensation Realm.In the Dan Wu Academy, the lower one's cultivation realm was when pa.s.sing the test and the smaller the age, showed that one's potential was greater. The importance attached to you would naturally be different as well.If he broke through to the First Level Spirit Condensation Realm, it would obviously be a cinch for him to defeat the five martial artists. But that way, it would be acknowledging that his talent could only go so far.Hence, he had always been tolerating other people's contemptuous look, wis.h.i.+ng to pa.s.s the Earth Rank Advancement test with half-step Spirit Condensation Realm strength.The top figures on the Martial Roll of Honor such as Long Tang, Zuo Bugui, and Su Yishan, without exception, all of them pa.s.sed the Earth Rank Advancement test when they were at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm.That was to say, these top geniuses already had a battle power surpa.s.sing the First Level Spirit Condensation Realm when they were at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm!But he, Lin Tiancheng, was already at the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm, yet he still could not pa.s.s the Earth Rank Advancement test. The difference was clear at a glance.Lin Tiancheng walked out of the Illusionary Spirit Tower looking incomparably dispirited.He already made the decision that as long as there was the slightest bit of scorn in anyone's eyes, he would rush over and violently beat him up.The moment he stepped out of the Illusionary Spirit Tower, Lin Tiancheng swept his fierce gaze over and suddenly became stunned.There was actually no one looking at him. Everyone's eyes were fixated on the light screen, with some people watching nervously.' What happened? 'Lin Tiancheng also followed everyone's gaze and looked over at the light screen as well, but he failed to see anything. The light curtain did not have fighting scenes within the Illusionary Spirit Tower. It could only roughly display the conditions of everybody inside.\"What are you all looking at?\" Lin Tiancheng casually grabbed someone and asked.\"Ah? It's Senior Apprentice Brother Lin? Are you already out? We are looking at Ye Yuan. He is taking the Black Rank Advancement Test right now, but it looks like he can't hold on any longer.\" The student did not seem to have too big a reaction to Lin Tiancheng being out.\"What? Black Rank Advancement test? Isn't that fellow overestimating himself? With his strength, even pa.s.sing the Yellow Rank Advancement test would be a little forceful. He actually went to take on the Black Rank Advancement test?\" Lin Tiancheng was stunned initially, followed by a mocking smile.That student gave Lin Tiancheng a look, and the expression in his eyes made Lin Tiancheng feel extremely uneasy. Before he reacted, that student opened his mouth again and said, \"I'm afraid Senior Apprentice Brother Lin doesn't know yet, right? Ye Yuan already long pa.s.sed the Yellow Rank Advancement test! During his Entry Advancement test and Yellow Rank Advancement test, he instantly killed his opponents! Even right now, during his Black Rank Advancement test, he already held on for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn!\"\"In-instant kill?\"Lin Tiancheng suspected that he heard wrongly. However, that student no longer bothered with him and turned his head back to the light screen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looks like there's no hope for Ye Yuan to create a miracle. But it's already very impressive to go this far. He is only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. A once in fifty years genius appeared in our State of Qin's Dan Wu Academy once again.\"As the light representing Ye Yuan on the light screen became increasingly faint, Huyan Yong could not help but feel sorry.However, immediately afterward, he found himself funny. The power that Ye Yuan displayed was already shocking enough. To let him challenge the Black Rank Advancement test with his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm was truly a little too forced.After pa.s.sing the test this time around, Huyan Yong believed that as long as Ye Yuan broke through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, no, just the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm was enough to pa.s.s the Black Rank Advancement test!\"Aiya. It's over, it's over. Ye Yuan can't hold on anymore!\"\"Sigh. He doesn't have a chance anymore. Right now, he probably already suffered heavy injuries, right? It was already good enough that he could last until now.\"\"Miracles really aren't so easy to create! However, Ye Yuan is already very impressive. Back then, Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang only pa.s.sed the Black Rank Advancement test when he was just about to break through to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm. Ye Yuan is only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm presently!\"\"d.a.m.n his sister! Your father spent half the day watching, but he still ended up losing.\"As the glow symbolizing Ye Yuan slowly became fainter, the surrounding students started talking about it. Quite a few people felt pity for Ye Yuan's failure.Wan Yuan watched the light screen as a trace of a sneer flashed across his mouth. Right here, the one who hoped Ye Yuan would fail the advancement test most of all was him.\"Overestimating himself! To actually dare challenge the Black Rank Advancement test when you just broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Do you think that these tests were just ornamental?\"After watching for so long, Wan Yuan was already aware that Ye Yuan broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. A deep sense of crisis followed the shock.Now that he saw Ye Yuan was about to fail, that constriction in Wan Yuan's chest eased up a little.. . . . . .At the Illusionary Spirit Tower, the Dream Tapir felt that something was not quite right as he looked at the group battle over there.Right! Ye Yuan's defensive radius seemed to have not shrunk for a while now!What was going on?Ye Yuan was clearly covered in injuries, but why did not his last line of defensive collapse, and how was he still holding on?En? He used the sword!The Dream Tapir suddenly discovered something abnormal. Ever since the Entry Advancement test begun, Ye Yuan had never used that lousy sword!But now, Ye Yuan actually used the sword!The Dream Tapir recalled back to the beginning where Ye Yuan chose his weapon leisurely like it did not matter. He thought the sword was just an accessory, and that his true killing move was the Stacking Waves Layered Palm!The Dream Tapir naturally knew about the Stacking Waves Layered Palm. Ye Yuan was already very heaven-defying to be able to comprehend the Second Layer Wave.It was precisely because Ye Yuan had comprehended the Second Layer Wave that he could easily pa.s.s through the Yellow Rank Advancement Test.Hence, the Dream Tapir thought that the Stacking Waves Layered Palm was Ye Yuan's greatest trump card. He never expected Ye Yuan's sword art to be so superb.Currently, Ye Yuan was still on the defensive; like a tiny sailboat in a storm. But he still stubbornly held on, and his boat just would not overturn!The dream tapir even realized that ever since Ye Yuan used the sword, he had not been struck once by the black-clothed martial artists.The initially flawless sword array was currently showing signs of instability.Ye Yuan seemed to be able to see through the weakness of the sword array. Although he was forced to be on the defensive, each stance and each strike started to make the entire sword array unstable.Could it be that this Ye Yuan was also an array expert?The Dream Tapir felt that his brain was a little incompetent to process this notion.Ye Yuan naturally would not randomly choose his weapon. He was indeed a sword expert in his past life.Of course, this so-called expert was only when comparing to the Lower Realms. In the Divine Realm, there were plenty of people who could mutilate him as they liked.The sword art that Ye Yuan currently using was something that he created during his leisure time while in the Divine Realm. The name of the sword art was Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword.There was one time when he was talking and drinking with a few friends in a sacred sakura forest. As the skies filled with the falling petals of the sacred sakura flowers, it formed a falling flower rain.As Ye Yuan watched the flowery scenery, he gained enlightenment and created this sword art, naming it as Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword.Back then, there was an Extreme Sword Divine King, Kuang Tianming, among his friends. He was a Divine King who used a sword to affirm his Dao; this person had extraordinary accomplishments in the Sword Dao.After Ye Yuan finished performing the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword, the Extreme Sword Divine King praised it highly.At that time, Kuang Tianming said, \"Brother Qingyun is amazingly talented. Tianming is inferior to you! If this sword art were to be perfected, it would definitely dazzle the Divine Realm in the future. If Brother Qingyun would devote yourself to the Sword Dao, your future accomplishments won't be inferior to your Alchemy Dao!\"Unfortunately, the Qingyun Zi back then had no interest in the Martial Dao. Creating the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was just because of a moment of interest. After creating it, he threw it aside and never used it again.Kuang Tianming did not praise the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword because the sword art was really that powerful.At that time, Qingyun Zi's cultivation realm was high, but his development in the Martial Dao was very limited. Kuang Tianming meant that if Ye Yuan devoted his thoughts on the Martial Dao and continuously raised his comprehension of the Sword Dao, the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword would become a terrifying sword art.The sword art was strong, but Ye Yuan current cultivation realm was too low. Without the support of essence energy, he could not even unleash half of the power.However, the focus of the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was elegance and agility, which happened to pair very well with Ye Yuan's modified Instant Flash. The power multiplied several times over after combining the two.Using the Instant Flash together with the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was just enough to defend against the combined attacks of these five people.These five people's sword array appeared to be extremely powerful, but in reality, it was full of flaws in Ye Yuan's eyes. What he needed right now was an opportunity!And this opportunity finally appeared under the attack of his movement technique and sword art.These five people did not have corporal forms, so their cooperation was flawless. However, this sword array was too simple. It was a weakness that could not be changed!Under the sword array, these five people would have a combined attack every dozen moves or so, and the combined attack this time was incredibly powerful. Previously, even though Ye Yuan used his movement technique to avoid the combined attack by the skin of his teeth, he still suffered rather heavy injuries.But this time around, because of Ye Yuan's a.s.sault, one black-clothed martial artist's movement slowed by a beat.Ye Yuan would not let such a good chance slip by. Before the five people's combined attack arrived, he pushed Instant Flash to the extreme and directly flashed out of the sword array!These five black-clothed martial artists did not know exhaustion at all. Ye Yuan had just left the encirclement when they retracted their sword momentum, and once again formed the sword array wanting to attack.Ye Yuan obviously would not give them the chance to enclose him again. At the same time he exited the encirclement, he gathered all the remaining essence energy left in his body and unleashed a palm strike before the five people attacked.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Fourth Layer Wave!Eight times the power exploded out, bringing a palm wind like a fierce gale; sending the five black-clothed martial artists flying.Ye Yuan knew that this was not over yet, and he gathered the tiny bit of essence energy he had left. With Instant Flash, he moved in front of a black-clothed martial artist and stabbed his heart with one sword strike. That black-clothed martial artist died and vanished after that.The power of that one palm was indeed great, but the difference in cultivation realm between Ye Yuan and the black-clothed martial artists was too great. So he could only heavily injure them.Repeating what he did, Ye Yuan gave the other four people one sword strike each, concluding the battle.After making the final move, Ye Yuan threw the sword aside and dropped his knees on the ground, gasping for air.The Dream Tapir stood there dumbstruck as he watched on, and he did not dare to believe what just happened in front of his eyes.\"Hey, after pa.s.sing this round, are you not going to heal my injuries? At this rate, I will die from excessive blood loss. You can't expect me to challenge the next round like this, right?\" Ye Yuan caught his breath and shouted at the dream tapir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Yuan actually wanted to challenge the Earth Rank Advancement test?Oh please, did he make a mistake?The Black Rank Advancement test was already so forced, yet he still wanted to challenge the Earth Rank Advancement test?Could it be that this brat was a fool and didn't know the difference between the Spirit Condensation Realm and the Essence Qi Realm?This was a major realm!Ye Yuan gnashed his teeth in pain and sucked in a cold breath, crying out, \"F*CK! Quickly heal me! What are you stoning there for?! If you still don't heal me, I'm going to suicide and complain to the dean about you!\"Black lines appeared on the Dream Tapir's head. This brat was a masterpiece.He really did not know if Ye Yuan was a genius or a fool. Why were his words always full of foolishness?The Dream Tapir was even more senior than the dean. Would the dean dare to bother with him?He was at a loss whether to cry or to laugh because of Ye Yuan. But he still helped to treat his injuries.The dream tapir lightly tapped, and Ye Yuan was instantly full of vitality.Feeling the surging essence energy in his body, Ye Yuan gave a sly smile and said, \"Hehe. The dream world is the best. No matter how heavy the injuries, I can also revive.\"At this moment, the dream tapir already recollected himself and looked at Ye Yuan with a smile that wasn't a smile. He asked, \"How did you know this is the dream world? I don't recall saying that we are in the dream world. Also, do you know what I am?\"Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and played possum. \"Oh please. You are insulting my intelligence! If this isn't a dream, then why would I suddenly have a sword out of nowhere? If this isn't a dream, then why did those martial artists disappear after dying? As for you, aren't you the examiner? You are still insulting my intelligence! And also, why did you use an underhanded trick just now?! I want to report you!\"The dream tapir knew that Ye Yuan was not being truthful, but he could not be bothered to argue.No matter what, it was a good thing for the Dan Wu Academy to have one more genius student.\"You really want to challenge the Earth Rank Advancement test?\"\"Do you think I'm joking with you?\" Ye Yuan rolled his eyes and asked back.\"Good. You have courage. You also felt it just now, the pain that you feel is linked to reality. Although you dying in here doesn't mean true death, it wouldn't be pleasant.\"\"I say, Lord Examiner, can you stop wasting my time? I'm very busy!\" Ye Yuan replied impatiently.\"Fine. As you wis.h.!.+\"The Dream Tapir gave a faint smile and summoned five black-clothed martial artists once more. Except for this time around, these five black-clothed martial artists were shockingly all at the First Level Spirit Condensation Realm!. . . . . .Outside the Illusionary Spirit Tower, the crowd was currently seething with excitement.\"How is that possible? Ye Yuan, he really did it!\"\"Am I seeing things? Just now, he was clearly on his dying breath. How did he suddenly finish off his opponents?\"\"Ye Yuan really created a miracle! He should be the Earth Rank student with the lowest cultivation realm since the establishment of the Dan Wu Academy!\"\"And also the one with the greatest talent!\"\"Just what on earth happened to that fellow? Could it be that he pretended to be so useless in the past? Unbelievable!\"Many students felt honored to have witnessed a historical moment.But no matter how they racked their brains, they just could not understand how Ye Yuan improved so quickly. Previously, he was clearly the last place in the academy. But now, he soared to the skies in one move, rising to become an Earth Rank student.The miracle that happened on Ye Yuan's body was simply a paragon counterattack!A change like this would strike a sympathetic chord among many students.If these students were in the outside world, they would naturally be geniuses. But in the Dan Wu Academy, the vast majority of them were just average people.Ye Yuan's result no doubt stirred up their fighting spirit.Huyan Yong looked at the light screen and cursed in his heart. This brat dares to mess with me?! He actually waited until the last moment before advancing successfully! It looks like he didn't even use 30% of his power during his deathmatch with Fei Qingping!Although he scolded, Huyan Yong was actually thrilled in his heart.With Ye Yuan's potential, perhaps he would have the strength to pa.s.s through the Heaven Rank Advancement test in the future?The two people who were the unhappiest were naturally Wan Yuan and Liu Ruoshui. The two of them had just pa.s.sed the Black Rank Advancement test. That is to say that currently, Ye Yuan already had the strength to threaten them?Impossible! Half a month ago, Ye Yuan was still a First Level Essence Qi Realm dreg. And now, half a month later, he could already threaten me?Then what were all my years of hard work for?!Ye Yuan that punk must have used some trick! His true strength shouldn't be that strong!That must be the case!No matter what, I must quickly eliminate Ye Yuan.Wan Yuan did not want to wait for even a second longer. He wished he could immediately call Su Yishan to kill Ye Yuan.Thinking of which, he had already made the decision to kill Ye Yuan several times today. And this thought got stronger each time.When Wan Yuan had just arrived, he paid not much attention to him. But now, he could sense deeply that Ye Yuan was already standing on the same level as him!Recalling Ye Yuan's moves, the great circle stage Instant Flash coupled with the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Second Layer Wave's colossal attack power; could he really escape unscathed?Wan Yuan felt a cold s.h.i.+ver ran through his body.To be able to defeat five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm showed that Ye Yuan's attack power could already threaten him!Was there anything even scarier than that?\"Quickly look! Ye Yuan challenged the Earth Rank Advancement test! My G.o.d! Is he mad?\"\"It's true! That fellow is really a madman! No matter how heaven-defying he is, there's no way he could defeat five First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists! He is only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"I'm already numbed by him. Let him play however he wants . . .\"Wan Yuan looked at the light screen as his heart involuntarily froze.That fellow, could it be . . .. . . . . .The moment the five black-clothed martial artists appeared once more, Ye Yuan felt an overwhelming pressure hitting him head-on, making him feel short of breath.In this sort of test, these five people would not have any sort of compa.s.sion. The moment they attacked, it was with piercing cold killing intent.Even while facing opponents a major cultivation realm higher than him, moreover, five of them, Ye Yuan remained in full fighting spirit.\"Bring it on!\"Ye Yuan howled, his dangling pair of fists turning into palms.All the essence energy in his body surged, creating a whirlwind which made Ye Yuan's sleeves flapped wildly.The Dream Tapir looked at this scene and involuntarily drew a cold breath. He muttered to himself, \"This brat actually mastered the Eighth Layer Wave! Such terrifying talent!\"Ye Yuan's hand posture right now was precisely the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eighth Layer Wave!During the deathmatch with Fei Qingping, everybody thought that Ye Yuan was bitterly training the Second Layer Wave, which was why he was late. In reality, he was practicing the Eighth Layer Wave back then!And this Eighth Layer Wave was also the final move of the Stacking Waves Layered Palm. The fragmented martial technique recorded on the jade slip stopped there.Even if it was only the Eighth Layer Wave, sixteen times the unleashed power was sufficient for Ye Yuan to traverse proudly through the Essence Qi Realm.Sixteen times the unleashed power was on par with the great circle stage Absolute Yang Finger. And Ye Yuan's Absolute Yang Finger was only trained to the small success stage.Which was to say, this Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eighth Layer Wave was currently Ye Yuan's greatest trump card!Unlike being surrounded and a.s.saulted by the previous five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists, these current five First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists did not seem to be in a rush to attack. Instead, they were waiting for Ye Yuan to make his move.Ye Yuan knew that this was the Dream Tapir's doing. In an actual life and death battle, who would give him such a long time to use a big move?After he finished preparing his stance, the five black-clothed martial artists finally moved.At the same time, Ye Yuan's unleashed his palm strike.Smas.h.!.+Both parties collided heavily against each other, and Ye Yuan's consciousness gradually blurred . . .\"d.a.m.n his sister, it scared me s.h.i.+tless. I thought he would even make it through the Earth Rank Advancement test. He was finally killed!\"Outside the Illusionary Spirit Tower, G.o.d knows who said that sentence which verbalized everyone's inner thoughts . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could clearly leave unscathed, but he just had to exit in such a manner. It gave me such a huge fright!\"\"Yeah. Although it's in the dream world, the feeling of death isn't pleasant. Every time I was killed, it made me feel like I was really about to die.\"\"It p.i.s.ses me off. I thought that he really had the strength to challenge the Earth Rank Advancement test. Who would have thought that he would be instantly killed right away. Isn't that messing with us?\". . . . . .'Scared me s.h.i.+tless' was like a bomb that went off among the initially quiet onlookers.The innocent Ye Yuan still did not know that his actions incurred the wrath of everybody, drawing everyone's grievances.The main issue was that he previously whetted everybody's appet.i.te too much, inevitably making everyone think that he had a probability of pa.s.sing.If Ye Yuan lost after a fierce battle, then the students' reactions at least would not be this huge. But who would have thought that he would be instantly killed the moment he went up, making everyone drop their gla.s.ses in shock.The difference between expectations and reality was too large. No wonder everyone felt like they were being made fun of.Huyan Yong also stared blankly at the light curtain and could not help laughing.He and the other students were the same. Ye Yuan stirred up their emotions, making them think that he really had some killing move to pa.s.s the Earth Rank Advancement test. Who knew that this fellow was just fearless because of ignorance; sending himself to his death.\"But . . . to be able to pa.s.s the Black Rank Advancement test, becoming the youngest student as well as the student with the lowest cultivation realm to enter the Dan Wu Academy's Earth Rank . . . Ye Yuan's strength has already surpa.s.sed my imagination.\" Huyan Yong gave his approval.He did not feel that Ye Yuan purposely tricked everyone. On the contrary, he felt that Ye Yuan's martial heart was steadfast.Most people would definitely choose to retreat when facing an opponent who was a major realm higher. But Ye Yuan decided to fight. His choice already highlighted a lot of problems.Of course, if he knew what Ye Yuan did inside the Illusionary Spirit Tower, who knew what he would think?Within the Illusionary Spirit Tower, Ye Yuan had already returned to reality. There were only the Dream Tapir and the other four black-clothed martial artists left in the combat arena.The astonishment in the Dream Tapir's eyes had yet to fade . . .Just now, when Ye Yuan chose to fight the five black-clothed martial artists head-on, Ye Yuan naturally died from the other party's powerful attack.But at the last moment, Ye Yuan's Eighth layer Wave struck one of the black-clothed martial artists, killing him!Even though Ye Yuan would not really die inside the dream world, and there was suspicion of trickery involved, he really finished off a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm fighter!That means that Ye Yuan already had the strength to threaten a Spirit Condensation Realm!A Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm with the strength to threaten a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm. Was this a fantasy story?The Dream Tapir swallowed hard as he thought about how unreal this world was.. . . . . .\"Oh? I should have finished off one of them just now, right?\"Ye Yuan was lost in his thoughts as he walked out of the Illusionary Spirit Tower and did not notice everyone's peculiar expressions. He was still thinking about just now when he faced off with the five black-clothed martial artists.Lu-er was the first to rush up to Ye Yuan. She completed the Entry Advancement test long ago and already officially became a student of the Dan Wu Academy.Pa.s.sing the Entry Advancement test as a Third Level Essence Qi Realm, Lu-er's strength naturally had no room for doubt. Huyan Yong also noticed this inconspicuous little girl.Of course, Lu-er could pa.s.s the test because Ye Yuan pa.s.sed her a rather powerful martial technique called the Profound Ice Nine Forms. This set of martial technique was precisely the martial technique that the Spirit Snow Divine King became famous for. It was incredibly powerful when paired with Lu-er's cultivation law.What Lu-er cultivated in were all top cultivation laws and martial techniques in the Divine Realm. Hence, it naturally was not much to jump ranks to defeat five Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters.\"Young Master, you are amazing! You actually pa.s.sed through three levels of tests at once!\" Lu-er pulled Ye Yuan's sleeve as she exclaimed with pride.Watching Ye Yuan pa.s.s the test made Lu-er feel even happier than pa.s.sing it herself.Ye Yuan looked at Lu-er, and with a smile, he said, \"It's just the Black Rank Advancement test. It wasn't even hard at all. If that d.a.m.n examiner didn't use underhanded tricks to mess with me, I would have pa.s.sed it long ago.\"The surrounding students were stunned once again. This fellow's ability to brag was even greater than his strength.Just now, he was clearly being thoroughly wrecked. But now, he is out here bragging.The Illusionary Spirit Tower's examiner tested countless students and was always fair and just. How could he possibly use underhanded methods to mess with a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm student?\"Hehe. Anyway, Young Master is the most amazing! It's a shame that Big Brother Tang is in a closed-door seclusion. Otherwise, he would also be happy for Young Master.\"After this period of acc.u.mulation, Tang Yu's cultivation realm had already stabilized. He just happened to enter a closed-door seclusion training two days ago to break through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.Ye Yuan gave Tang Yu a batch of transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills. Breaking through the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm was just a matter of time.\"Hahaha. After Tang Yu exits seclusion, he should come to partic.i.p.ate in the Yellow Rank Advancement test. Looking at you, you should have also pa.s.sed the test,\" Ye Yuan said with a smile.Lu-er smiled as she nodded her head and replied, \"Isn't it all thanks to Young Master?\"Ye Yuan laughed and said, \"What does that has got to do with me? You were the one who cultivated out your essence energy.\"The master and servant stood side by side as they talked, making the onlookers envious.Initially, everyone's attention was attracted by the light screen and did not notice that there was such a pretty young lady in the crowd.Now that she and Ye Yuan stood together, it immediately attracted many eyes.The crowd just noticed, since when was there was such a pretty young lady among the students?In terms of appearance, the yet-to-mature Lu-er was already much prettier than Liu Ruoshui. However, that pure and innocent air that Lu-er had was something which Liu Ruoshui was not equipped with.Seeing everyone's expression, Ye Yuan knew that Lu-er would most likely become the target of pursue by many students in the academy.At this moment, a student walked in front of Ye Yuan. Those who saw him immediately recognized who he was.\"Quickly look! Isn't that Senior Apprentice Brother Wu? He is famous in the academy for being infatuated with martial arts; he is a top figure ranked 15 on the Martial Roll of Honor! Could it be that he is already eyeing Ye Yuan? Then Ye Yuan is screwed!\"Wu Luochen cupped his hands towards Ye Yuan and said, \"Congratulations to Junior Apprentice Brother Ye for advancing as an Earth Rank. I am Wu Luochen, Heaven Rank.\"Ye Yuan was not clear with what was going on, but he still returned a greeting. He then replied, \"Many thanks, Senior Apprentice Brother Wu.\"\"Junior Apprentice Brother Ye's talent stands above all others. I believe that before long, you will advance as a Heaven Rank. At that time, I wish to arrange with Junior Apprentice Brother Ye for us to spar. I hope that Junior Apprentice Brother Ye won't decline.\"Even though it was expected, Wu Luochen's words still caused a big stir among the crowd.Wu Luochen was infatuated with martial arts and liked to go around the academy to challenge experts. The people on the Martial Roll of Honor all felt a headache whenever they saw him.Because he pursued martial arts wholeheartedly, Wu Luochen's improvement was also very fast. In half a year's time, he fought his way from the bottom of the Heaven ranking to being ranked 15 on the Martial Roll of Honor.Ye Yuan sized Wu Luochen up. He then suddenly smiled and said, \"Since Senior Apprentice Brother Wu think highly of me. Why wouldn't I dare fight?\"Wu Luochen was initially somewhat solemn looking, but now, he cracked a smile and replied, \"Good! You are indeed the student with the greatest potential in the academy! If you encounter any problems in the academy from today onwards, you can look for me anytime!\"\"Haha. Then many thanks to Senior Apprentice Brother Wu,\" Ye Yuan laughed as he replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His position in the academy would undoubtedly rise.Taking the opportunity to be on friendly terms with a future Martial Roll of Honor expert was a must.At the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, he could already finish off five Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm fighters. This kind of power . . . Once Ye Yuan broke through to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, just how horrifying would his strength become?Who knows, maybe when he's at the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, he would indeed have the strength to challenge the Earth Rank Advancement test!However, those who came up to say h.e.l.lo to Ye Yuan were mostly Heaven Rank students. Those Earth Rank students were destined to never mingle with a genius like Ye Yuan.One would not hit a smiling face. Ye Yuan dealt with these Heaven Rank students' goodwill gestures one by one.There was no lack of experts from the Martial Roll of Honor among these people. So naturally, there wasn't any downside to becoming acquainted with them.Watching Ye Yuan benefitting from everyone around, Lin Tiancheng felt as uncomfortable as if having eaten a fly.What was funny was that he called Ye Yuan a trash earlier on. But after this test, the situation suddenly changed. Ye Yuan actually became popular among the bunch of Heaven Rank students; he was a genius in the eyes of all students.But he, Lin Tiancheng, remained as the mediocre person struggling to advance becoming a Heaven Rank.In comparison to Ye Yuan's results, he was the trash.Pa.s.sing the Black Rank Advancement test when he was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, if Ye Yuan could not make it into Heaven rank, everyone would laugh their heads off.Thinking up to this point, Lin Tiancheng sighed and vanished from the crowd.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, what's wrong? Why do you seem a little absent-minded?\" Just as Lin Tiancheng was about to leave, a melodious and alluring voice sounded behind him.Turning his head, it was Wan Yuan and Liu Ruoshui who pushed their way out of the crowd long ago.. . . . . .\"Quickly look! Isn't that Teacher Feng Ruoqing? What's she doing here?\" someone suddenly cried out among the crowd.\"It's really Teacher Feng! She's walking towards me. Could it be that she is looking for me? Aiyo. What did you hit me for?\" Someone was daydreaming when he immediately got hit on the back of his head and was pulled aside by someone.\"Moron. How could Teacher Feng be looking for you? A good dog wouldn't block the path. Quickly move aside.\"\"Why isn't it possible for her to look for me? Maybe she knows that I'm her loyal fan, and was touched by that, so she came to look for me?\"\". . . . . .\"Everyone looked at him like he was a r.e.t.a.r.d, and then they automatically made a path for Feng Ruoqing to pa.s.s through.Feng Ruoqing walked pa.s.s the crowd and did not even spare a glance for that moron.\"d.a.m.n! Lu-er, quick, run!\" Ye Yuan grabbed Lu-er and started running.Ye Yuan was still engaging with people just now. Now that he noticed Feng Ruoqing, he immediately chose to flee in any way he could.\"Ye Yuan, if you dare to run again, you can forget about pa.s.sing any of your cla.s.ses!\" Feng Ruoqing saw that Ye Yuan was running and immediately shouted.Ye Yuan was completely indifferent to this sort of threat, as he continued running.\"Stop him for me!\" Feng Ruoqing cried out frantically.The students around were stunned . . .What was happening?Why did the fairy-like Teacher Feng become like an abandoned wife?Looking at Ye Yuan again, didn't this seem like a wife who was trying to catch her heartless man?It was evident that Feng Ruoqing was explicitly looking for Ye Yuan, and Ye Yuan seemed to be terrified of seeing Feng Ruoqing.Everyone could not help guessing what was going on between these two people.Even Huyan Yong who was normally composed had a curious light flas.h.i.+ng in his eyes. Clearly, he wanted to know what was going on just like the rest of the students.Just now, when Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the test, many people looked towards him with wors.h.i.+p or with envy.But now, everyone looked towards him with killing intent in their eyes without any prior agreement.It looked like if they were to discover that Ye Yuan really profaned the dream lover of all the men in the Dan Wu Academy, these students would definitely rush up and tear Ye Yuan to shreds.The most painful thing in this world was having the G.o.ddess in their heart being defiled by other men, even if that man was the newest genius in the Dan Wu Academy!Ye Yuan had incurred the wrath of everyone.He wanted to run, but he was completely blocked by a group of people.Initially, there were still some gaps around. But now, they congregated without any prior planning, giving Ye Yuan no chance to escape at all.In this short while, Feng Ruoqing already reached Ye Yuan.\"Run then. What? Not running anymore?\" Feng Ruoqing was fuming as she looked at Ye Yuan.\"It's not that I don't want to run, but I can't run! Teacher Feng, your rallying power is too strong!\" Ye Yuan smiled bitterly as he answered her.\"Why are you hiding from me?\" Feng Ruoqing was secretly a little pleased, but she still pulled a long face and asked.\"Me? When did I? Teacher Feng, you really maligned me!\" Ye Yuan blinked his eyes innocently.\"You still dare to say you didn't? Then why did you run just now?\"\"I suddenly remembered that I have something to do and was just about to leave. Coincidence! It was definitely a coincidence!\"\"Stop trying to pull anything over me! Quickly follow me!\"\"Teacher Feng, I really have something very important to do!\"\"I don't care how important it is! If you don't come, I'm going to use force!\"'Don't, don't! I'll follow you, alright?\"\"That's more like it!\"Under everyone's stunned eyes, Feng Ruoqing grabbed Ye Yuan and left . . .Actually, Feng Ruoqing had already looked for Ye Yuan several times these past few days. But every time, Ye Yuan was sleeping.With Lu-er blocking the way outside, it was not nice for Feng Ruoqing to barge in.Ye Yuan also did not attend medicinal theory lessons these past few days, making Feng Ruoqing unable to find Ye Yuan even if she wanted to.As for Ye Yuan, why would he be interested in becoming an a.s.sistant?The things that Feng Ruoqing was playing with was not much different than children playing with mud. If it was not a waste of time for him to be an a.s.sistant, then what was?Ye Yuan's most pressing concern at the moment was to increase his strength. Where would he have the energy to go be an a.s.sistant for this little la.s.s?With Feng Ruoqing's tiny bit of ability in Alchemy Dao, she was not even qualified to be an a.s.sistant for Ye Yuan. Now, she actually wanted him to be her a.s.sistant? Wasn't this a joke?That day, all he wanted to do was to quickly get rid of Feng Ruoqing. He did not expect that slightly revealing a bit of his ability would invite such troubles.Hence, he made the decision to play cat and mouse with her when he heard from Lu-er that Feng Ruoqing was looking for him.Who knew that he would be caught red-handed by Feng Ruoqing after only hiding for a few days?Coincidentally enough, Feng Ruoqing did not know that Ye Yuan was taking the test here. But when she pa.s.sed by, she heard that students were gathering over at the Illusionary Spirit Tower.Feng Ruoqing was somewhat curious about what was happening over at the Illusionary Spirit Tower. So she stopped a student to ask about it.Who knew that this inquiry would result in information on Ye Yuan. Furthermore, this news also gave her sufficient shock.She naturally knew that Ye Yuan had just broken through to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm not long ago. But he actually broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm in a few days' time.If it was just breaking through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, then forget it. But Ye Yuan actually challenged three rounds consecutively, becoming an Earth Rank student. The shock it gave her was too great.Who would have expected that Ye Yuan's attainments in Martial Dao were also incredibly impressive.Back in the medicinal theory cla.s.s, Ye Yuan left a very profound impression on Feng Ruoqing.A Yellow Rank student who was not even an Alchemy Apprentice actually had such understanding towards a high-level Tier 2 pill formula. He also knew an obscure refinement technique like the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. Hence, she had the thought of making him an a.s.sistant.Who would have thought that Ye Yuan that fellow would actually hide from her!Feng Ruoqing who had never known rejection became even more stubborn. She must capture Ye Yuan to become her a.s.sistant!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just what on earth is going on between Teacher Feng and Ye Yuan?!\"\"That's right. Their conversation was unclear. I only know that one was running, while the other was chasing.\"\"Oh G.o.d. My G.o.ddess! If Ye Yuan dares to do anything, I will definitely kill him!\"\"That's right. We must find out what happened! If Ye Yuan really did something that angers men, even G.o.d, then we must eliminate that hateful fellow!\"Only Ye Yuan and Feng Ruoqing knew what their conversation was all about, which drove everyone crazy.Under this circ.u.mstance, the 'Protect Ruoqing Alliance' was officially established.There were two primary missions in this alliance. The first was to figure out what happened between Ye Yuan and Feng Ruoqing.The second was a priority over the first mission. The moment they discovered that Ye Yuan really did something, they will beat Ye Yuan half to death. Then afterward, they will beat him up every time they saw him! That would make him regret what he did for the rest of his life!Regardless of how powerful Ye Yuan was, he just became an Earth Rank student. One could casually grab a bunch of Earth Rank students who were stronger than Ye Yuan.Of course, there were some who linked it to the medicinal theory cla.s.s that day. But Teacher Feng only asked Ye Yuan to be an a.s.sistant. It should not have caused such a ruckus, right?Furthermore, it was a wonderful thing to be Teacher Feng's a.s.sistant. How did it turn into a public pursuit?After understanding the situation, the 'Protect Ruoqing Alliance' filtered out that possibility. They felt something else must have happened between the two of them.At the same time, multiple speculations about what happened between Feng Ruoqing and Ye Yuan started to spread among the students and even among the teachers in the Dan Wu Academy.Of course, this was all for later. Currently, all Ye Yuan was thinking about was how to get rid of this pestering Feng Ruoqing as soon as possible.Ye Yuan could tell at a glance that Feng Ruoqing truly loved alchemy. That was because she was exactly the same as the past him.Dealing with this sort of people was tough. She would become like a curious baby whenever she encountered something interesting related to Alchemy Dao and would only let it go after she understood it.Presently, Feng Ruoqing was like that. She was fixated on Ye Yuan because she felt that Ye Yuan could help her refine the Tier 2 Qi Returning Pill, helping her to successfully breakthrough to the high-rank Alchemy Master!However, Ye Yuan really did not want to waste too much time on this.On the one hand, Feng Ruoqing might go from bad to worse if Ye Yuan taught her.On the other hand, it was a little outrageous for a student to teach a teacher, possibly causing some unnecessary trouble.Ye Yuan walked in front while Feng Ruoqing followed behind, keeping a close eye on Ye Yuan's every move to prevent him from running.Ye Yuan felt a headache coming on and realized that he could not escape today.\"Teacher Feng? What a coincidence.\" At this moment, a man dressed in yellow blocked their path, greeting Feng Ruoqing with zeal.Ye Yuan did not recognize this person, but looking from his clothing, he should be a teacher in the Dan Wu Academy.\"I have seen Senior Apprentice Brother Song Qian.\" Feng Ruoqing frowned lightly, but she still returned the greeting.Ye Yuan sneered secretly by the side. This Song Qian's eyes shone when he saw Feng Ruoqing and never even looked at him. He was clearly one of Feng Ruoqing's fanatical pursuers.However, this Song Qian was around 25 to 26 years old. He should be considered young and talented among the academy's teachers.But sadly, judging from her reaction, Feng Ruoqing did not seem to be interested in this fellow.A woman like this who was infatuated with Alchemy Dao probably could not be subdued by any ordinary man.Looking at Song Qian's appearance, he seemed to be prepared to enter the pill refinement chamber as well.Ye Yuan speculated could it be that this Song Qian knew that Feng Ruoqing was coming, so he waited here since long ago?\"Teacher Feng is going to the pill refinement chamber again?\" Song Qian asked a pointless question.\"Yes,\" Feng Ruoqing replied indifferently.\"Teacher Feng is so diligent! But this is the teachers' pill refinement area. Teacher Feng brought this student over for?\"Hearing Song Qian, Ye Yuan rolled his eyes involuntarily. So this guy actually noticed him. Ye Yuan thought that he was air in his eyes.\"Ye Yuan is the a.s.sistant I found.\"\"a.s.sistant?\" Only now did Song Qian take a look at Ye Yuan. With a frown, he said, \"If I'm not wrong, he isn't even an Alchemy Apprentice. This Song is incapable, but I dare say that I'm capable enough to be Teacher Feng's a.s.sistant.\"Song Qian could tell at a glance that Ye Yuan was not even an Alchemy Apprentice. That was because alchemists who were ranked would display the badge issued by the Alchemist a.s.sociation on their chests. It was a symbol of one's status as an alchemist!Song Qian and Feng Ruoqing both displayed a badge on their chest with two blinding stars on it. This represented the ident.i.ty of a Tier 2 Alchemist!The Alchemist a.s.sociate also existed in the Divine Realm, but in his previous life, both Zhengyang Zi and Qingyun Zi didn't have this sort of badge. That was because the two of them had never taken part in the Alchemist a.s.sociation's tests.However, n.o.body in the Divine Realm dared to take the father-son pair lightly, because their attainments in Alchemy Dao was not inferior to the president of the Alchemist a.s.sociation, Ou Yezi.But right now, Ye Yuan did not have the time to reminisce his past life. Song Qian's words made his eyes light up!Just as Feng Ruoqing was about to speak, Ye Yuan interrupted, \"That's right! That's right! Teacher Feng, I'm not even an Alchemy Apprentice. How can I possibly help you? Teacher Song is a fine gentleman who is also an Alchemy Master. With his help, what medicinal pills can't be refined? Since that's the case, then I have no more business here. I will be making a move first.\"While Ye Yuan was talking, Song Qian looked at him approvingly. He thought to himself that this punk really knew what to do. He could give him guidance in the future.\"Teacher Feng, you see . . .\"Feng Ruoqing did not even look at Song Qian. She suddenly clawed at Ye Yuan, and an indistinct essence energy thread immediately coiled around Ye Yuan's ankle.If the students who watched Ye Yuan's deathmatch were here, they would see that Feng Ruoqing's move was precisely the Lesser Capturing Hand that Fei Qingping used before!Except that the power of the exact same move, when displayed by Feng Ruoqing could not be mentioned in the same breath.Ye Yuan was about to sneak away after he finished talking when he felt as if his legs were suddenly filled with lead, and he face-planted the ground from the inertia.\"Aiyo!\"Ye Yuan wailed in pain on the ground. The difference between the two was too great. Feng Ruoqing did not even move, and she could knock him down.After knocking him down, Feng Ruoqing took two steps forward. As she walked by Song Qian, she did not even bother to look at him.Walking in front of Ye Yuan, Feng Ruoqing frowned as she said, \"Are you a man? How can you go back on your word? I don't need other people to be my a.s.sistant. I only want you! If you run again, I don't mind reporting you to the dean to get you expelled from the academy. I believe my words will have some standing.\"After she said that, Ye Yuan could not muster up any temper.In the cultivation world, it was an undeniable fact that disciples from sects were stronger that loose cultivators.As the outer sect of the Tranquil Cloud Sect, the Dan Wu Academy gathered virtually every single top geniuses. There was no better place than here to temper himself.Ye Yuan did not have any interest in the Dan Wu Academy's resources, but he had some interest in the geniuses here.Seeing Ye Yuan finally yielded, Feng Ruoqing felt delighted from subjugating him. She finally caught this punk.Turning to Song Qian, she said, \"Many thanks for Teacher Song's good intentions, but it's enough for Ye Yuan to be my a.s.sistant. Teacher Song definitely has many things to do as the Dan Wu Academy's rising star. I won't delay your time.\"\"Ye Yuan, let's go.\"Ye Yuan sighed and obediently followed behind Feng Ruoqing.Although he did not turn his head back, Ye Yuan clearly sensed that there was a pair of eyes filled with ill intent staring at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Refining Medicinal EssencePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Refining Medicinal EssenceTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorAt the Dan Wu Academy, alchemy instructors had their own personal pill refinement chamber. Of course, Feng Ruoqing was not an exception.Feng Ruoqing's pill refinement chamber had a very well-planned layout. All sorts of medicinal herbs were categorized and stored neatly.In the center of the chamber was a red-colored pill cauldron. With Ye Yuan's judgment, he could obviously tell with a glance that this pill cauldron was a superior-grade Tier 2 pill cauldron. Most likely, there was no better one than this among the alchemy instructors in the Dan Wu Academy. However, a pill cauldron like this was worthless to Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan pursed his lips and found a place to sit down.That scene happened to have caught Feng Ruoqing's eyes, suddenly making her feel irritated.\"It seems like you despise my Red Lotus Cauldron?\"\"Ah? This cauldron? Not bad, not bad. Haha.\" Ye Yuan laughed it off.With just one look, she could tell that it was completely insincere.\"You have seen better Tier 2 pill cauldrons?\"\"Me? Haha. I'm just a student who isn't even an Alchemy Apprentice. Where would I see such a high-tier pill cauldron? It's called Red Lotus Cauldron right? Good name, good name!\"Ye Yuan did not expect that his subconscious contempt for the pill cauldron would actually result in a series of questioning from Feng Ruoqing, so he had to humor her a little.But he really did look down on this sort of pill cauldrons. Back in his past life, he would not even bother to use this sort of pill cauldron to boil water with.In the past, if someone were to say that her pill cauldron was not good, Feng Ruoqing will immediately flip out. But Ye Yuan gave her an exceptional feel.The corner of the iceberg that Ye Yuan revealed during the medicinal theory cla.s.s had already exceeded the boundaries of the Dan Wu Academy's students.Even the first place on the Alchemy Roll of Honor could not possibly know how to refine the Tier 2 Qi Returning Pill using the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.It was possible to have coincidentally seen the pill formula before, but the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was not something that the average person would know.Even Feng Ruoqing only happened to have seen this refinement technique from an extremely obscure ancient record.Back then, it was like she obtained a treasure. She spent a period of time practicing this refinement technique in a frenzied craze, but she had no choice but to give up in the end.This refinement technique was too hard!And because of that, Feng Ruoqing was very interested in Ye Yuan, making him her a.s.sistant.To think that this fellow did not appreciate it and even repeatedly hid from her. This made the proud Feng Ruoqing go crazy. Hence, her actions today.Feng Ruoqing did not know why, but even though Ye Yuan repeatedly brushed her off and also looked down on her, she felt that Ye Yuan's scorn came naturally from the heart. He was not pretending to be an expert.Like just now, Feng Ruoqing had always been very confident with her Red Lotus Cauldron. Virtually every alchemist who came by her pill refinement chamber would be shocked by the cauldron. But Ye Yuan only pursed his mouth and had a scornful look.Feng Ruoqing did not detect even a trace of amazement from Ye Yuan's eyes.Could it be . . . that Ye Yuan really knew the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?Feng Ruoqing was frightened by her own thought. How was it possible?Feng Ruoqing practiced the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique before and was well aware of the difficulty of this refinement technique. Ye Yuan was only fifteen. How could he know this refinement technique?\"I asked you to be my a.s.sistant, not be a lord. What are you sitting there for? Hurry up and come prepare the herbs,\" Feng Ruoqing said coldly.\"O-oh. Coming, coming.\"Ye Yuan staggered up to the operating stage. There were all sorts of medicinal herbs placed on it. He took a look at the herbs and asked curiously, \"Aren't you going to refine a Tier 2 Qi Returning Pill? Why all the ingredients you prepared are Tier 1?\"Feng Ruoqing flushed slightly and immediately replied angrily, \"I asked you to prepare the medicines, so just do it. Why are you asking so many questions?!\"Looking at the situation, Ye Yuan instantly understood that this woman had yet to master the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. She was using these Tier 1 medicines to practice.However, this Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was not something that could be mastered in one or two days. How long would he have to accompany her to train with these Tier 1 medicines for practice?His time was highly precious, and he did not have the time to accompany this woman to refine pills!Ye Yuan sighed and just turned around to prepare the medicines.Feng Ruoqing turned around and entered the quiet chamber to meditate and trying to adjust her mental state.Pill refinement was a highly complicated form of knowledge. One must not be distracted even in the slightest when refining pills. It must be finished in one go.Even the smallest disturbance could affect the quality of the medicinal pill, possibly even resulting in a useless pill.Hence, the majority of alchemists would choose to meditate before refining pills. They would only start refining after they adjusted their mental state to be unperturbed by anything.But Feng Ruoqing had just adjusted herself and was yet to fully enter a meditative state when there was a knocking on the quiet chamber's door.This time, Feng Ruoqing really got angry. Dropping the fact that Ye Yuan repeatedly hid from her despite that being her a.s.sistant was a wonderful task that every man in the academy would fight to do, now that he was helping out as her a.s.sistant, he was causing trouble instead of properly performing his tasks!If there was no justified reason, she would definitely beat him up brutally, and then hang him for three days to warn the public.The door creaked open, revealing the raging Feng Ruoqing.\"Haha. I didn't expect Teacher Feng to open the door so hastily. It made me jump.\" Ye Yuan gave a startled expression.Ignoring Ye Yuan, Feng Ruoqing raised her right palm. Traces of essence energy flowed along the palm as if it would strike any moment.\"I asked you to prepare the herbs! What are you doing?! Don't you know that I'm meditating?! If your reason isn't justified, be ready to receive this palm!\" Feng Ruoqing snarled.\"Don't! Teacher Feng, if you said you had violent tendencies, then I wouldn't have become your a.s.sistant even if I had to copy the 'Herbal Compendium' a hundred times back then! The herbs are all prepared already. I even finished refining two sets of medicinal essences before coming over to call you. I didn't think that you would take so long to meditate!\" Ye Yuan jumped far away with a shout.\"What? The medicinal essences are all refined?\"Feng Ruoqing could not immediately process his words. It had only been about 15 minutes since she entered the quiet chamber. Not only did Ye Yuan finish preparing so many herbs, but he also managed to refine the medicinal essence?How was that possible?\"That's right. This reason is pa.s.sable, right? I don't want to be smacked to death,\" Ye Yuan said gloomily.Putting down her hand, Feng Ruoqing gave a cold humph and said, \"If I find out that you are talking nonsense, then it wouldn't be as simple as a single palm.\"After saying this, Feng Ruoqing walked over to the operating stage and was immediately stunned.Two sets of medicinal essences quietly sat in their jade containers. The color was extremely pure. It was clear that they were excellently refined with all the useless medicinal dregs purged away.Feng Ruoqing looked at Ye Yuan and opened her mouth, but no words came out of it.\"Teacher Feng, do you want to say something? Aren't you going to smack me to death? At most, I will call you later next time. How long do you normally take to meditate?\" Ye Yuan asked innocently.\". . . . . .\"Feng Ruoqing was speechless.After a while, Feng Ruoqing finally sucked in a deep breath and asked Ye Yuan, \"This is the medicinal essence you refined?\"Ye Yuan looked around and asked curiously, \"Are there other people in here?\"\"B-but how did you do it so quickly?\"An ordinary Alchemy Apprentice would spend an hour just to prepare the herbs. In addition to refining the medicine essence, it would take at least two hours!Preparing the herbs was not merely just pairing it together. One needed to accurately weigh out the quant.i.ty. Even the tiniest bit of error would not be tolerated.Hence, an alchemist's a.s.sistant would always be very cautious when preparing the herbs. As a result, a lot of time was spent on it.Even Feng Ruoqing herself needed over an hour to refine a Tier 1 pill's medicinal essence.But Ye Yuan only used 15 minutes. This was just unheard of!\"Isn't it just refining a Tier 1 pill's medicinal essence? Why do you need to spend so long on such a simple task?\" Ye Yuan nonchalantly questioned her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Drawing a Circle with Left Hand, Drawing a Square with Right HandPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: Drawing a Circle with Left Hand, Drawing a Square with Right HandTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorIf it was about martial arts, Ye Yuan might be more humble. But as for alchemy, Ye Yuan really did not know how to be modest.It could be said that Ye Yuan spent his entire past life busying with alchemy. He was simply too familiar with medicinal herbs and pills.This sort of familiarity was engraved into the soul. Even if he changed his body, that sort of familiar feeling which came from the soul would automatically make the body carry out the most appropriate actions.Originally, Ye Yuan wanted to be low-key. But once he touched those medicinal herbs, he could not help but to complete the preparation of herbs and refine the medicinal essence.Others might be filled with trepidation towards measuring the quant.i.ty of the medicinal herbs and did not dare to carelessly leave out anything. But Ye Yuan just had to casually grab them with his hands, and the quant.i.ty of the herbs would definitely be accurate.This was the ability developed through million and million times of practice. n.o.body could imitate that.Feng Ruoqing stared blankly at Ye Yuan and did not know what to say.Refining a Tier 1 medicinal pill was . . . simple?\"D-do as you like. I-I'm going to the quiet chamber to meditate!\"After saying that, Feng Ruoqing turned around, and entered the quiet chamber once more.This round of meditation was four hours; it was much longer than initially planned.Feng Ruoqing's mental state was a mess and was not able to enter a meditative state for a long time. She only managed to purge her distracting thoughts after two hours, and then she entered the empty state.After exiting the quiet chamber, Feng Ruoqing recovered her haughty and cold att.i.tude once again. Walking in front of the Red Lotus Cauldron, she instructed emotionlessly, \"Bring the medicinal essence over. Fire up the cauldron. Refine!\"Ye Yuan did not waste these four hours either. He was training while meditating the whole time.In comparison with his past life, the current Ye Yuan was much more diligent.The Ye Yuan who managed to become an Alchemy Emperor before understood that there were no shortcuts to cultivation. No matter how talented one was, there was only hard work and more hard work.Hearing Feng Ruoqing's instructions, Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the two jade containers with the medicinal essences in them over to her and prepared to fire up the cauldron.Feng Ruoqing looked over at Ye Yuan in surprise. Initially, she was prepared to open her mouth to instruct Ye Yuan on what to do. But who would have thought that Ye Yuan would perform what an a.s.sistant should do with such familiarity.The Dan Wu Academy's pill refinement chambers were established on top of an Earth Vein. Earth fire was guided over to refine pills.This sort of pill refinement style was only suitable for low tiers. High tier pills must use heaven and earth flame sources. But Ye Yuan was not a stranger to this style of refinement.Opening the fire valve, the scorching earth fire burst out from the ground, instantly raising the temperature in the pill refinement chamber.Although earth fire could not be compared to heaven and earth flame sources, it was extraordinary among the mortal fires. It was more than sufficient to refine a Tier 1 medicinal pill.Ye Yuan rapidly formed seals with both hands and slowly moved towards the fire. The fire immediately became like an obedient baby while still being incomparably docile. 1Following which, Ye Yuan spread his hands apart and cried out, \"Stabilize!\"The earth fire automatically separated into two and scorched the two sides of the Red Lotus Cauldron uniformly.Looking at this scene, a trace of surprise flashed across Feng Ruoqing's eyes once again.She had never heard of this kind of fire controlling skill!Earth fire was abnormally wild. It could only be used after layers upon layers of array formations were placed on top of the academy.Even so, this fire was not something that an average Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm could easily control.But this fire was just like a house pet in front of Ye Yuan. If he asked it to lay down, it would not dare to stand.However, the refinement procedure had already begun. Feng Ruoqing could not afford to be surprised and hastily recollected herself.Feng Ruoqing formed hand seals with one hand and pointed a finger towards the Red Lotus Cauldron. The cauldron lid flew up by itself.Following that, she gestured with her other hand, and the two medicinal essences flew through the air into the pill furnace.\"Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique! Activate!\"With a low cry, Feng Ruoqing's two jade-like hands moved like phantom images.Right now, it was no longer Ye Yuan's business. He took it easy as he watched Feng Ruoqing repeatedly change seals continuously to temper the medicinal essence. Watching this, he could not refrain from nodding his head.This woman more or less had some standards. It looked like she spent no little effort on the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.But she had yet to fully master the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique, so it appears executing it was a little forced. It seems like this furnace of medicinal pills was going to be wasted.The Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was not so easy to master. During the refining process, the alchemist had to do two things at once. One hand had to perform Yang-attribute seals, while the other hand had to execute Yin-attribute seals. Furthermore, it had to be carried out simultaneously with no room for any error.Any mistake during the process would result in the furnace of medicinal pills to be wasted.This was an extremely challenging test towards the alchemist's mental strength, soul strength, and familiarity with the seals.In the beginning, Feng Ruoqing did quite well. But around the mid-stage of the refinement, it was clear that her strength was failing. Small beads of sweat started appearing on her forehead, and she looked like straining herself.Puff!A black cloud appeared.The pills were ruined . . .Feng Ruoqing stomped her feet angrily and shouted at Ye Yuan, \"Again!\"Ye Yuan looked at Feng Ruoqing but did not say anything and immediately went to prepare the herbs.This time around, Feng Ruoqing finally saw how Ye Yuan prepared the herbs, and she was left utterly speechless.Ye Yuan grabbed at this herb and grabbed again at another herb. After that, he threw them into a jade container and started mas.h.i.+ng them; appearing highly irresponsible.However, Feng Ruoqing was unable to open her mouth to scold him. That was because she knew that the medicine essence Ye Yuan refined, regardless of quality or precision, was much better than her doing it.Just how in the world did this guy do it? Could it be that his hands were measurement tools? How did he know exactly how much was required?The way Ye Yuan prepared the herbs was really too casual . . .Seeing Feng Ruoqing's expression, Ye Yuan gave a dry cough and laughed awkwardly. \"This . . . came from family teachings. You are also aware that my father is an Alchemy Grandmaster. I was forced since young. Haha . . . Haha.\"Feng Ruoqing glared fiercely at Ye Yuan. Believe my foot!But she also knew that Ye Yuan would not tell her the truth, so it was pointless to ask.After 15 minutes, Ye Yuan finished refining the medicinal essence once more.Feng Ruoqing swallowed a Tier 2 Qi Returning Pill. After meditating for a while, her essence energy had more or less recovered.Looking at this, Ye Yuan was secretly dumbstruck. Just what was this Feng Ruoqing's background?A Tier 2 Qi Returning Pill naturally was not much in Ye Yuan's eyes. But it was not something common in the State of Qin. The price was very high.Feng Ruoqing casually took one out to eat and did not even blinked.Also, that Red Lotus Cauldron, it was absolutely a high-grade medicine cauldron in the State of Qin. Ordinary people simply could not get a hold of it.It seemed like this Teacher Feng had a very powerful backing!The result of the second try of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was inevitably another failure.Following this, the third time, and then the fourth time. Not even once did it succeed.The medicinal essence would basically turn into a black cloud of smoke when refining at the latter stages, becoming ruined.Feng Ruoqing became increasingly depressed, and she actually knew that the reason why she could last only up to the latter stages was due to the medicinal essence Ye Yuan refined, as well as his control over the fire. Otherwise, she might not even have lasted to the late stages!Just how in the world do I master this d.a.m.n Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?!\"Again!\" Even though there were Tier 2 Qi Returning Pills to recover essence energy, in reality, Feng Ruoqing already could not hold on much longer from such an intense day of refining.Ye Yuan looked at Feng Ruoqing again and felt a little conflicted in his heart.\"What are you looking at?! Go prepare the herbs!\" Feng Ruoqing barked irately.Ye Yuan did not go to prepare the herbs but sighed instead. He walked to the table and grabbed a piece of paper and two brushes.Feng Ruoqing was curious about what Ye Yuan took the brush and paper for, so she went toward him.It was only to see Ye Yuan holding one brush each with his left and right hand, then he simultaneously drew two shapes on the paper. His left hand drew a circle, while his right hand drew a square.\"Don't train anymore. This way of training won't work. We will see again after you master this.\"After he finished, Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the two brushes over to Feng Ruoqing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What's the point of this training?\" Feng Ruoqing asked blankly.Ye Yuan shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Up to you whether you want to train or not. If you keep on training the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique like you did just now, then you might as well find a way to directly increase your soul strength. It isn't so easy to jump ranks to battle.\"\"Tch. What's so hard about this? I will draw right now for you to see!\" Feng Ruoqing refused to concede.Saying that she pushed Ye Yuan aside and also drew on the paper.But as she drew, the right hand became a circle. Furthermore, an uneven circle.\"I don't believe this!\"Feng Ruoqing drew again. She concentrated on making her right hand's drawing into a square. The result was that the right hand drew a square, and the left hand also drew a square!After a few more times, Feng Ruoqing was thoroughly defeated.\"Why is this so hard?! Not drawing anymore!\"Feng Ruoqing threw the brush aside in a fit like a little girl throwing a tantrum. Where was the proud and cold female teacher?\"It's because it is difficult; that's why I asked you to draw it. Train well. After you master this, you shouldn't be far from crossing the entry threshold of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. Alright. I've already taught you the secret. I don't need to be your a.s.sistant for the next few days anymore, right? I'm leaving.\"\"Halt! Do you think that you can hoodwink me by coming up with this c.r.a.p? If you dare to walk out today, I will make the dean expel you! If you don't believe me, just try!\" Feng Ruoqing was livid.Ye Yuan came up with some dubious thing and said that it would help in mastering the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. Was it not insulting her intelligence?\"Aunt, who are you arguing with?\" At this moment, a girl dressed in white martial outfit pushed the door open and entered.This person was similarly a stunning beauty, with watery almond-shaped eyes like a crescent moon, and a slender waist that looked like it had no bones. Silky hair flowed down her shoulders; she wore white colored martial clothing while carrying a sword, giving off a heroic spirit.Looking closely, this girl and Feng Ruoqing's eyebrows had some similarity. No wonder she called out 'Aunt.'It was just that the age difference between this aunt and niece pair was too small. They looked just like sisters instead.Ye Yuan had never seen this girl before, but he quickly figured out who this white-clothed girl was.The most popular instructor in the Dan Wu Academy was Feng Ruoqing, and the most popular female student was Feng Zhirou.Who could such a stunning beauty with the 'Feng' surname be other than Feng Zhirou?It was just that Ye Yuan previously did not link these two together, and he did not know that the two of them were actually aunt and niece.Feng Zhirou looked at Ye Yuan and looked at the disheveled looking Feng Ruoqing; she was stunned. She immediately cried out, \"You scoundrel! To actually dare molest my aunt! I'm going to teach you a lesson!\"Finis.h.i.+ng, she did not wait for Ye Yuan's explanation, and a sword already flashed in front of Ye Yuan's chest like lightning.Ye Yuan did not expect this girl to be so unreasonable; indiscriminately striking with her sword to harm him.He wanted to evade, but Feng Zhirou was rank three on the Martial Roll of Honor; a figure that Ye Yuan simply could not hope to match.Being locked down by Feng Zhirou's sword qi, Ye Yuan was actually unable to move. Even Instant Flash became sluggish.This was a lethal sword.This unforeseen situation occurred too quickly. Feng Ruoqing clearly did not manage to react in time either. Even if she wanted to help, it was already too late.\"Ah!\" Feng Ruoqing screamed and shut her eyes in fright.In the time of crisis, Ye Yuan could not be bothered to conceal his abilities. In a flurry, he executed an Absolute Yang Finger.Ding!Following the crisp sound was the sound of the sword's edge slicing open the skin.Ye Yuan pushed Instant Flash to its limit at the same time he used his finger, dodging this sword by a hair's breath. Even so, he still suffered some injuries. The sword's edge made a cut on his right arm.\"STOP!\" Feng Ruoqing was shocked by Feng Zhirou's action and hurriedly called out for her to stop.She had the intention to stop it just now, but she was way too slow.After practicing the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique for such a long time, both her essence energy and mental strength was already completely dried up. How could she possibly stop Feng Zhirou's attack?Watching Feng Zhirou's sword stabbed straight towards Ye Yuan's chest, Feng Ruoqing's heart leaped to her throat. Who knew that Ye Yuan would miraculously evade this lethal attack?Feng Zhirou also did not expect her sword to be evaded by Ye Yuan. She saw through Ye Yuan's strength at a glance, only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Someone at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm actually managed to dodge her sword?Even though Feng Zhirou only used 30% of her strength and not her full power, it should still not have been evaded by a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.Especially Ye Yuan's finger just now. The impact even made the web between her thumb and index finger go numb. How was this possible?!\"Zhirou! What are you doing?!\" Feng Ruoqing asked angrily.Only now did Feng Zhirou realized that she seemed to have gotten into trouble. She playfully stuck out her tongue and said, \"A man and woman staying together in a room. I saw you lose your temper, and your clothes were also disheveled, so I thought . . .\"Feng Ruoqing blushed heavily at what she said. \"If you continue saying nonsense, watch me tear your mouth! We have been refining pills all this while. Ye Yuan is the a.s.sistant that I invited! When will you fix your mischievous att.i.tude?! Otherwise, you will cause a disaster sooner or later!\"Feng Zhirou pouted her lips and said in an aggrieved tone, \"Aunt, I was wrong okay? I won't dare to next time.\"\"Why haven't you apologized to Ye Yuan yet?\" Feng Ruoqing asked furiously.Before Feng Zhirou even apologized, Ye Yuan erupted first.He really had enough of it today! He was driven like a duck onto a perch, forced to become some bulls.h.i.+t a.s.sistant for Feng Ruoqing. The result was that Feng Ruoqing was such a noob that he could not even bear to look on anymore.He taught Feng Ruoqing the method on how to dual-task. But the result was that instead of expressing her grat.i.tude, this woman refused to stop bothering him.And now, there was this completely unreasonable Feng Zhirou who jumped out, nearly killing him with her sword!Ye Yuan barely managed to get this life. If he were to die again, then he would be screwed.\"What apology?! I've really had enough of the two of you aunt and niece! One keeps pestering me, and the other is savage and unreasonable! I came here to help out of goodwill, and the result was that I nearly lost my life! Just who did I provoke?! This Young Master can't stand this frustration anymore! Feng Ruoqing, if you have the ability, then just get me expelled! If this place won't keep me, there will be a place willing to take me! Farewell!\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Ye Yuan strode out of the door.Feng Zhirou was originally ready to make an apology but was rebuffed by Ye Yuan; she could not help it but become angry. \"Who's that? He's so bad tempered! Just now, I didn't make clear of the situation. But didn't he only suffer some light injuries?\"Feng Ruoqing did not stop Ye Yuan this time. But after hearing Feng Zhirou grumbling, she inevitably became annoyed. \"Look who's talking?! That sword of yours nearly killed him just now, and you are still acting so righteous! Imperial Brother really spoiled you! When I go back this time around, I'll definitely report all of your misdoings in the academy to Imperial Brother to make him ground you!\"The moment Feng Zhirou heard 'ground,' she immediately grabbed Feng Ruoqing's arm and begged, \"Good Aunt, I was wrong, I really know I was wrong. Please, please don't snitch on me to Imperial Father. I don't want to stay in the palace all day.\"\"Humph! If you don't want to be grounded, then fine. Turn around and go apologize to Ye Yuan! Remember, it's apologizing! If Ye Yuan doesn't accept your apology, then just wait to be grounded. I will tell Imperial Brother all about your matters, one by one!\" Feng Ruoqing was in a panic now. If Ye Yuan were really killed by Feng Zhirou just now, then she would probably live in guilt for the rest of her life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will go, okay?! I will definitely apologize properly to that fellow and ask that great man to not harbor grievance for my past wrongdoing. Alright?\" Feng Zhirou did not have any choice, so she could only agree.\"That's much better! Oh right. Why did you suddenly come to look for me?\" This niece had always avoided her in the academy. She definitely came to find her today because of some matter.\"Aiya. If you didn't mention, I would have forgotten about it already. It's all because you interrupted me!\" Feng Zhirou looked like she was suddenly enlightened.\". . . . . .\"\"Actually, I came to say goodbye to you. I'm going back to the capital in five days to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Master test. After I pa.s.sed the test, I will be the same as you, an Alchemy Master!\" Feng Zhirou exclaimed proudly.\"With the way you are, you still want to be an Alchemy Master? Talk again after you pa.s.s.\" Feng Ruoqing took her down a peg without hesitation.Advancing as an alchemist was entirely different from the martial path. To advance to Alchemy Master, the first requirement was to cultivate and reach the Spirit Condensation Realm. But that did not mean that one could become an Alchemy Master just by advancing to the Spirit Condensation Realm!Feng Zhirou already reached Spirit Condensation Realm long ago, but she never pa.s.sed the Alchemy Master test, even though she was top three on the Alchemy Roll of Honor. From this, it was clear just how rare and respected the position of Alchemy Master was.Feng Zhirou pouted and said, \"What kind of aunt are you? You actually cursed your own niece to fail the test!\"Feng Ruoqing ignored her and muttered to herself, \" Oh. Is it a group test again? I wonder how far Ye Yuan can go. With his standard, becoming high-rank Alchemy Apprentice shouldn't be an issue, I think. Zhirou, I will go along with you tomorrow to visit Ye Yuan. I want him to go take the alchemist test together with you.\"\"Hehe. Aunt, you still said that nothing was going on between you two. Every time you open your mouth, it's all Ye Yuan.\" Feng Zhirou laughed at her.\"d.a.m.n la.s.s. It looks like you are really asking for a beating!\" Feng Ruoqing was totally embarra.s.sed. The aunt and niece pair started wrestling each other.After messing around for a while, Feng Zhirou suddenly thought of something and asked, \"Ye Yuan . . . I suddenly find this name really familiar. Oh right! Is it the Ye Yuan who fought in the deathmatch?\"\"You only realize this now? He is the hottest topic of discussion in the academy recently. I'm sure you aren't aware of it yet. Just this morning, he took on three tests consecutively and joined the ranks of the Earth Rank students with his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation. Zhirou, he might become a powerful rival to you in the not too distant future!\" Feng Ruoqing said solemnly.Feng Zhirou opened her mouth wide and exclaimed in amazement, \"He's that amazing? It looks like our State of Qin's Dan Wu Academy has been quiet for far too long. Looks like things are finally going to become interesting.\"Feng Zhirou left, and Feng Ruoqing unexpectedly picked up two brushes, and she started diligently drawing squares and circles on the paper over and over again.. . . . . .The next day, Feng Ruoqing and her niece went together to Ye Yuan's residence but was turned away at the door by Lu-er.\"My apologies to the two of you. My young master is recovering from his wounds, and he said that he won't meet with anyone,\" Lu-er said emotionlessly.Feng Zhirou immediately lost her temper. \"Hey! Didn't he just suffer from some light injuries?! My aunt and I already came here to apologize. What else does he want?\"Lu-er was lovable and adorable, but when it came to Young Master, she was completely stern.Yesterday, when Young Master came home with injuries, her heart ached for a long time. Now that Feng Zhirou was totally insincere with her apology and even swaggered around, she obviously did not need to be polite.\"Light injuries? I don't understand. You clearly injured someone, but you are still so stuck up in front of other people's house. Who taught you such manner? An apology like that is too precious, so save it for yourself. Our family's Young Master dare not accept it. I only pray that you stay further away from our family's Young Master. I'm not going to see you out!\" Lu-er directly chased them away.Feng Zhirou was about to retort when Feng Ruoqing quickly clamped her mouth shut. This la.s.s is only good at ruining things!\"Miss Lu-er, it's all our fault. Please don't be mad. Actually, Zhirou this la.s.s didn't have any ill-intentions. She is just straightforward and outspoken, and she is always rash when doing things and ended up injuring your young master. In reality, she feels really guilty in her heart. It's just that her mouth is unforgiving. You mustn't try to gain back face with her. One of the reasons we came to look for your young master was to apologize. The other is that we have some important matters to look for him. Just let us go in,\" Feng Ruoqing said amicably but was much more sincere.Right then, Ye Yuan's voice sounded from within the house. \"Lu-er, tell them that I'm not in!\"\". . . . . .\"\". . . . . .\"\". . . . . .\"The three people outside the house were collectively speechless.Feng Zhirou was infuriated by Ye Yuan's att.i.tude and was about to rush into to dice Ye Yuan into pieces, but she was pulled back by Feng Ruoqing.\"If you cause trouble again, just wait to be grounded when you get back!\" Feng Ruoqing warned coldly. It was clear that she was exasperated by this niece.Feng Zhirou could not muster up her temper anymore. Only then, did Feng Ruoqing called out towards the house, \"Ye Yuan, it was Zhirou's fault yesterday. I apologize to you on her behalf. And also I apologize for my att.i.tude yesterday. I won't force you to be my a.s.sistant in the future, alright?\"Creak.The door opened, and Ye Yuan appeared.\"You're the one who said it! A good woman is as good as her word. You can't go back on it!\" Ye Yuan was currently in high spirits. Where were there even any signs of injuries?\"Ye Yuan, you!\" Feng Zhirou took a look at Ye Yuan and wished that she could raise her sword to kill him again. But she was completely blocked by Feng Ruoqing.\"You, what you? Don't think that I'm scared of you just because you are some Martial Roll's expert! Wait until I break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm. I can kill you with one hand!\"Ye Yuan was very displeased with this woman!The Feng Zhirou in the legends was extremely cold and proud and would not spare a glance for anyone. Who knew that when he met her yesterday, she would actually be a complete lunatic!Ye Yuan had walked around the gates of h.e.l.l once again. It would be weird if he were pleased to see her!\"Aunt, let me go! I'm going to kill him! I'll see what he has to break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm!\" Feng Zhirou struggled desperately but did not manage to break free.\"Enough of this! Just try moving again if you dare!\" Feng Ruoqing really released Feng Zhirou, but her words made Feng Zhirou stop.\"Ye Yuan, if you don't want me to force you to be my a.s.sistant, fine. But you have to promise me one thing! If you can do it, I will let you off,\" Feng Ruoqing said calmly.Hearing her words, Ye Yuan raised his guard instinctively.This woman might look good-natured, but in reality, she was as unreasonable as Feng Zhirou deep down in her bones. Previously, she had already set a trap for him. Now, who could guarantee that it was not another trap!\"Say what it is first! Better not force me. At most, I will just go back to the capital to continue being a silkpants!\" Ye Yuan answered like a hoodlum.However, Feng Ruoqing did not seem to care. Instead, she gave a sweet smile. \"In four days' time, the academy will organize students to go to the capital's Alchemist a.s.sociation to take part in a group test. I want you and Zhirou to take the test together!\"\"Alchemist test?\" Ye Yuan was stunned. He did not expect Feng Ruoqing to actually raise such a request.Taking the test was not much. But he instinctively held some resistance towards the Alchemist a.s.sociation.In his past life, he, and his father had poor relations with the Alchemist a.s.sociation. The two were ostracized by all the other alchemists as deviants.Now that Ye Yuan was asked to take the test, he felt kind of weird.\"That's right. I want you to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemist a.s.sociation's Alchemy Apprentice test. And you must go all out! Don't tell me that you can't even pa.s.s an Alchemy Apprentice test?\"Feng Ruoqing knew now that Ye Yuan's level was definitely much higher than an Alchemy Apprentice. It was just that he was limited by his strength so he could not refine high-tier medicinal pills.But with Ye Yuan's Alchemy Dao prowess, would becoming an Alchemy Apprentice not be just like playing around?Ye Yuan did not immediately reply to Feng Ruoqing, but he paced around to ponder about it for a moment. Finally, he nodded his head and then answered, \"Fine. I will join.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I feel that the academy should nurture him well. The Ten Nations Compet.i.tion will be taking place in half a year's time. We had already lost for many years. If we are at the bottom three again this time, we would really have no place to put our old face in public.\"Within the loft, in a deep part of the Dan Wu Academy, Huyan Yong was standing respectfully in front of a middle-aged man.This man was the dean of the Dan Wu Academy, Jiang Yunhe. He was a figure that carried tremendous weight in the entire State of Qin!His position in the State of Qin was not even beneath His Majesty!But Jiang Yunhe was very low-profile as a person, and he rarely showed himself. He pretty much left it all to the a.s.sociate deans to handle things and did not do anything.During the few years which students spend in the Dan Wu Academy, they might not even get to see him once.Even among many of the instructors, Jiang Yunhe was a highly mysterious figure.Clearly, Huyan Yong was one of the few people in the academy who could meet with Jiang Yunhe.It was evident that Huyan Yong specifically came to report to Jiang Yunhe about Ye Yuan's matter.He recounted Ye Yuan's stunning performance to Jiang Yunhe. But Jiang Yunhe only listened quietly and did not comment anything.\"Oh Huyan, calm down. Victory and defeat are common for soldiers. There's no need to fuss over the details. Life is full of ups and downs. When it's time for us to rise up, other people cannot stop it,\" Jiang Yunhe said nonchalantly.\"But Dean! Ye Yuan, he . . .\"Huyan Yong wanted to say a few more words for Ye Yuan, but Jiang Yunhe gestured to stop him. \"I already said calm down. Sigh. Huyan, you are always like this. What are you anxious about? We haven't even started competing yet. Furthermore, we also have quite a few outstanding students this time around such as Long Tang, Zuo Bugui; oh , and also Feng Zhirou that la.s.s. They are all good seedlings. Well, this Ye Yuan that you mentioned isn't bad, but a genius that has not matured yet isn't a genius. Any genius who hasn't broken through and reached the Spirit Condensation Realm doesn't count as a genius, understood?\"After Jiang Yunhe said all that, Huyan Yong slowly calmed down. He seemed to have understood something faintly. \"Dean, are you afraid that . . . Ye Yuan is going down the unorthodox path?\"Thinking about it now, Ye Yuan was just a First Level Essence Qi Realm little rookie a month ago. In a month's time, he already reached the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm with actual combat power surpa.s.sing top geniuses at the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm. This sort of leap was a little too exaggerated.Without mentioning about others, even a genius like Long Tang would probably require at least a year's time to train from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm? But Ye Yuan did it in only a month.Such astonis.h.i.+ng growth was truly inconceivable. The most immediate idea was most likely that he had over exhausted his potential, right?And the price for over exhausting one's potential was sacrificing future growth!Jiang Yunhe smiled and said, \"I didn't say that. But let's observe for a period of time first. You don't have to worry too much about resources and what not. Didn't Ye Yuan plunder several tens of thousands of Essence Qi Pills? It shouldn't be a problem to train to the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"Huyan Yong sighed and took his leave.After Huyan Yong left, Jiang Yunhe walked to the window with his hands behind his back and muttered to himself, \" Oh Ye Yuan, I really hope that you are a peerless genius. Don't let me down!\". . . . . .The alchemist test would be taking place in the capital in four days' time. Ye Yuan figured that he might as well skip cla.s.ses, and brought Lu-er back home to stay for a few days.As he had just broken through not long ago, Ye Yuan planned to use these few days to properly consolidate his realm. The next step would be to directly a.s.sault the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.Within a minor stage in the Essence Qi Realm, Ye Yuan could completely disregard the bottleneck between realms and directly cross them.This was already after intentionally slowing down. If it was not out of fear that his foundation would become unstable, Ye Yuan could even break through several realms within a day.After all, the Essence Qi Realm was simply too easy for Ye Yuan who was once a Divine King.\"If Master and Madam know that Young Master became an Earth Rank student, they would be ecstatic.\" Lu-er was full of pride as if she was the one who became an Earth Rank student.\"It's just being a stupid Earth Rank student. Who cares?\" Ye Yuan curled his lips in disdain.\"Of course it's impressive! You don't know what kind of expression they had outside. Each of them stared at the light screen as if they saw a ghost. Initially, I didn't know how amazing Earth Rank students are. But afterward, I heard that there had never been anyone in the Dan Wu Academy who advanced and became an Earth Rank when they were at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. That's when I found out that Young Master is so incredible!\" Lu-er said excitedly.\" Haha. There will be plenty more times for them to be shocked in the future. If you are this way each time, wouldn't it be exhausting?\" Infected by Lu-er's mood, Ye Yuan also started laughing heartily.\"Why would that be tiring? If that were the case, I would be happy every day!\" Lu-er replied seriously.\"Then I will make my Lu-er happy every day, okay?\"\"Hehe. Young Master is still the best! Lu-er is already very happy right now! Yii? Why are there so few people in the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion? Normally in the past, the queue would be super long at this time.\"The master and servant pair arrived at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion without realizing it. But then Lu-er found that something was not quite right with the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.In the past, the entrance to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was always crowded with streams of people. But today, it looked a little deserted.\"Let's go in to check it out.\"Ye Yuan entered the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion with Lu-er and discovered that there were really much fewer people. It was not even half of the norm in the past. What was going on?\"Young Master Ye, why are you back?\"The shopkeeper was clearly idling today. The moment Ye Yuan walked in, he noticed this and hurried over to greet the former.\"Shopkeeper Feng, why are there so few people in the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion today? What happened?\"The shopkeeper was surnamed Feng and was the third-born; so he was called Feng San 1 . He was an old employee of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and was completely loyal. Even Ye Hang was very respectful towards him.Hearing Ye Yuan's question, he involuntarily let out a long sigh. \"Sigh . . . Isn't it all thanks to that Drunken Star Manor. Who knows where they got the pill formula of something called Essence Gathering Pill. The medicinal effects are 50% stronger than even the effects of a high-grade Essence Qi Pill! These few days, they released the new medicinal pills, attracting everyone over. As a result, our Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's business fell drastically. Sigh. With this sort of medicinal pill, the Drunken Star Manor is now undefeatable. The owner has also been troubled by this these few days!\"\"It's really Drunken Star Manor again! Essence Gathering Pill huh . . .\" Ye Yuan started to muse.\"That's right. The price of this Essence Gathering Pill is about the same as a high-grade Essence Qi Pill, but the medicinal effects are 50% stronger. As long as one is a martial artist, who could possibly resist this kind of temptation? Sigh. It looks like hard times are ahead for our Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.\"Feng San sighed and groaned. His face was full of worry. It was apparent that he spent the past few days distressed over it.This move by the Drunken Star Manor came too suddenly without any signs at all. The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was caught unaware. As a result, this led to the current situation.\"Don't worry too much, Shopkeeper Feng. It's just a tiny little Essence Gathering Pill. It can't cause any huge waves.\" Ye Yuan smiled as he consoled the shopkeeper.Feng San looked at Ye Yuan and sighed as he said, \"Young Master probably isn't aware of what this 50% medicinal effect means. This is something that can change the medicinal pills market in the State of Qin! With this, the Drunken Star Manor can become a monopoly power in the future!\"Ye Yuan knew that any explanation was futile, so he smiled and asked, \"Shopkeeper Feng, is my father in the shop? I will go look for him.\"\"Yes. The owner has been in a closed-door seclusion in the pill refinement room these past few days.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The medicinal pill in the pill cauldron was about to form as it gave off a faint light.\"Set!'Ye Hang gave a low cry, and the light on the medicinal pill dissipated, forming a dark green medicinal pill.Making a gesture of grabbing at it, the pill flew into Ye Hang's hand.\"Sigh. I was too overconfident. If it were so easy to invent a new medicinal pill, how could it be that it's my, Ye Hang's, turn to do it?\" Ye Hang shook his head and threw away the newly refined pill.Presently, Ye Hang looked utterly haggard. It was evident that he was greatly exhausted.He was attempting to develop new medicinal pills without getting any sleep or rest these few days in order to prevent the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion from declining. But all of his efforts were in vain.Even though Essence Qi Pill was not among high-tier pills, after countless years of development, it was actually incomparably mature.How could it be easy to develop a new medicinal pill which had even stronger medicinal effects than Essence Qi Pill to replace it?\"I didn't think that after working hard for so many years, I, Ye Hang, still can't escape the outcome of defeat. What a failure!\" Ye Hang sighed again.Unwittingly, Ye Yuan's figure suddenly appeared in Ye Hang's mind, and some clarity was restored in his hazy eyes.\"If I'm defeated, then I'm defeated. At least my son has that mysterious teacher. His future accomplishments will definitely be limitless.\"He was naturally aware of Ye Yuan's performance in the Dan Wu Academy these past few days, and he was delighted in his heart.But he was still not aware that Ye Yuan had already advanced to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, pa.s.sed the Black Rank Advancement test, and became an Earth Rank student.Ye Hang was originally a sanguine person and did not take defeat heavily. It was just that this bunch of old fellows at the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion had followed him for a long time. His individual success or failure was connected to the livelihood of many people. That was why he tried day and night to regain some lost ground.Perhaps their hearts were connected. Just as Ye Hang thought about his son, Ye Yuan's knocking on the door sounded. \"Father, this Child is back. May I enter?\"Ye Hang's heart shook slightly, and he went to open the door. Sure enough, it was Ye Yuan.\"Father, I heard that you were in a closed-door seclusion, so I came here directly. I didn't interrupt you, did I?\" Ye Yuan bowed towards Ye Hang and asked.\"Haha. What's there to interrupt? Yuan-er is back. Any important matter has to be put aside! Come, let us father and son talk in the study room. Tell me what happened in the Dan Wu Academy.\" Ye Hang pulled his son and headed out.Ye Yuan was touched. Ye Hang's love for his son really surpa.s.sed everything.Even at this time, Ye Hang was interested to find out about Ye Yuan's experience in the Dan Wu Academy rather than finding a way to save the situation. One could only imagine Ye Yuan's place in Ye Hang's heart.Before leaving, Ye Yuan swept his eyes around the pill refinement room and sniffed the medicinal fragrance lingering in the air. He already knew the goal of Ye Hang's closed-door seclusion.. . . . . .\"Yuan-er, I heard that you had a deathmatch with that brat from the Wan Family whose surname was Fei, right after you returned to the academy? And that you finished him off with your Third Level Essence Qi Realm strength? That is so satisfying! Yii? Y-you . . . already broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm?\"Just now, Ye Hang did not notice yet. But as he was talking, he discovered that Ye Yuan's aura was much stronger than before he left. Clearly, he already broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, so he could not help but be astonished.\"Haha. I was fortunate and broke through two days ago. I also pa.s.sed through three advancement tests consecutively yesterday. Now, I'm already an Earth Rank student.\"Ye Yuan was not showing off, but it was because he knew that his father was in a lousy mood. So he found something to cheer him up. It was clear just how much effort he expended from how worn out Ye Hang looked. Ye Yuan felt his heart ache just by looking at him.As expected, when Ye Yuan told him that, Ye Hang immediately perked up and exclaimed in delight, \"The heavens had opened their eyes! My son really became competent! That brat from the Wan Family only just advanced to become Earth Rank, but my son only used a month to do the same! What a resounding face-smacking difference! Hahaha!\"After a bout of hearty laughter, Ye Hang gradually quietened down. But the joy on his face could not be concealed.Suddenly recalling something, Ye Hang frowned slightly and asked him, \"Yuan-er, it's naturally a good thing for your strength to advance so quickly. But would it affect your future cultivation?\"Ye Hang's worry happened to coincide with Jiang Yunhe's. This concern was not without reason.Cultivating the Martial Dao always focused on moving along carefully each step of the way. It was cultivation's great taboo to neglect a solid foundation in pursuit of a temporary spurt of progress.Ye Yuan's advancement was truly too rapid. As a father, he was naturally concerned whether or not his son's foundation was unstable, and if it would affect future cultivation.\"Don't worry, Father. I know what I'm doing. The cultivation law that Master pa.s.sed on to me is highly mystical. If I didn't fear that my cultivation realm rising too quickly would affect my foundation, it wouldn't be a problem for me to cultivate to the Seventh or Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm right now,\" Ye Yuan replied indifferently.After he said that, Ye Hang calmed down even though he was still a little worried.The Master in Ye Yuan's dream was unfathomable and pa.s.sed him so many techniques. He most likely would not harm him.\"Then it's alright. Oh right. You just went to the academy a while ago. Why did you return to the capital again? Do you lack cultivation resources?\"The matter of Ye Yuan partic.i.p.ating in the alchemist test was only decided yesterday. Ye Hang did not receive the news yet.\"In four days' time, a party from the academy will undergo a group test at the Alchemist a.s.sociation. I'm here to take part in the alchemist test.\"\"Alchemist test? Oh. You can refine Heart Inch Fissure. So taking the Alchemist Apprentice test is obviously not an issue. It's just that the alchemist test only has three chances. Yuan-er, your experience is still too little after all. Are you confident?\"The way Ye Hang saw it, Ye Yuan definitely failed countless times before he succeeded in refining the Heart Inch Fissure back then.n.o.body knew him like his father. In the past, Ye Yuan basically never even touched alchemy before. How could one possibly increase the success rate of pill refinement without their technique being tempered through countless practices?\"I trained quite a bit these past few days, so it shouldn't be an issue.\" Ye Yuan smiled.\"Then that's good. Take these two days to adjust yourself properly to take the test in your best condition.\" Ye Hang encouraged him.Ye Yuan naturally nodded and acknowledged those words. Following which, he took the opportunity to ask,\"Father, when I just came back, I asked shopkeeper Feng. Are you worrying about the Essence Gathering Pill these past few days, Father?\"When Ye Yuan mentioned this matter, a trace of uneasiness flashed across Ye Hang's face. But it was quickly covered up as he smiled and said, \"Yuan-er, you just have to cultivate well in the academy. Don't worry about what's happening at home. Wan Donghai couldn't do anything to your father after so many years. This time around, it's obviously going to be the same.\"Ye Yuan let out a sigh and said, \"Father, I'm already grown up. This kind of low-level lie won't work on me.\"Ye Hang gave an awkward look. \"H-haha. Actually . . . this time around . . . it's a little bit problematic.\"\"Father, Master taught me many areas of alchemy in my dream. There is a type of medicinal pill called Explosive Yuan Pill. The medicinal effects are multiple times of the Essence Qi Pill. It should help you tide over the crisis this time,\" Ye Yuan said solemnly.\"Multiple times? You are talking about Tier 2 medicinal pills, right? Then it's useless.\" Ye Hang shook his head. He did not think that there were any Tier 1 medicinal pills with multiple times the medicinal effects of the Essence Qi Pill.However, Ye Yuan shook his head and said, \"Not a Tier 2. It's only a Tier 1 medicinal pill.\"\"What? A Tier 1 medicinal pill? Multiple times? How is that possible?!\" Ye Hang stared wide-eyed at him, with disbelief written all over his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was clear at a glance just how challenging that was.As for creating a new Tier 1 medicinal pill with medicinal effects multiple times that of the Essence Qi Pill? That was merely a fantasy. Otherwise, how could the Drunken Star Manor's Essence Gathering Pill possibly give Ye Hang such enormous pressure?And now, the fantasy really became a reality. Imagine the shock in Ye Hang's heart.Ever since Ye Hang stepped onto the Alchemy Path, he had never heard of any Tier 1 medicinal pills with medicinal effects multiple times that of the Essence Qi Pill over the past few decades!But Ye Yuan said that this Explosive Yuan Pill actually had such a miraculous effect!Ye Hang was extremely conflicted right now. Reason told him that this was entirely a lie. But the person who uttered this lie was his son. So should he believe it or not?After sucking in a deep breath, Ye Hang gave a pained look and asked, \"Yuan-er, you aren't joking with father, right?\"But Ye Yuan just smiled and said, \"Why don't you try it to see for yourself, father?\"Ye Hang quickly stood up and dragged Ye Yuan along. \"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go to the pill refinement room!\"\"Don't be anxious, Father. I still have something to tell you.\" Ye Yuan did not move.\"Aiya. If there's anything, we can talk about it later. Refining the Explosive Yuan Pill is the top priority.\" Ye Hang already could hardly wait.This concerned the survival of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Even though Ye Hang looked calm on the outside, he was actually incomparably anxious on the inside.The Fragrant Medicine Pavilion was the fruit of his life's labor. No matter how sanguine about it he was, he was not willing to watch the monkeys scatter overnight when the tree falls.However, Ye Yuan was not anxious at all. Pulling his father back to his seat, he smiled and said, \"Explosive Yuan Pill is just a minor thing. I have countless pill formulas that Master pa.s.sed on to me. What I'm about to say is the crucial thing. Just be a little more patient, Father.\"Ye Hang was a little perplexed. \"What could be more important than saving the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion? En, En, alright, you talk, I'll listen.\"Ye Yuan returned to his seat and said seriously, \"There were many miscellaneous things that Master imparted to me in my dreams. But there are two sets of techniques I need to inform you about, Father. The first is called the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. The other is called the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation. Father, you can switch to these two cultivation laws. 1 I believe that in the future, the Tranquil Cloud Sect would merely be a small sect to you.\"Listening to the names of the two cultivation techniques that Ye Yuan said shocked Ye Hang greatly. This time around, the shock that he felt was even greater than hearing about the Explosive Yuan Pill.\"Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation? Is that a cultivation technique for cultivating soul strength?\" A tremor could be heard in Ye Hang's voice. He was apparently very agitated.Ye Hang did not know what the h.e.l.l the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was. But he immediately connected the name Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation to a soul cultivation technique.It was impossible to use words to describe just how valuable soul cultivation laws were in a place like the State of Qin.Even if the lowest rank soul cultivation law came into being, it would set off a blood storm. It simply could not be measured using monetary terms.For martial artists, essence energy cultivation techniques were commonplace. It was just differentiated into whether it was good or bad. But something like soul cultivation technique was so rare that it made one's hair stand on end!In comparison to essence energy, the soul was more arcane and veiled in mysteries. Wanting to create a set of soul cultivation laws was even harder than reaching the heavens!Since ancient times, only major powers who had reached an exceedingly high realm in terms of soul cultivation and had an incredibly profound understanding towards the soul could create a soul cultivation technique that belongs to them.The number of soul cultivation techniques was not even one in one hundred thousand of essence energy cultivation techniques. One could imagine the rarity of it.However, the preciousness of soul cultivation techniques did not lie on increasing the strength of martial artists. In fact, how powerful a soul was had a very limited impact on the strength of a martial artist.The prestige of soul cultivation techniques laid in that it could ma.s.s-produce alchemists! And what did alchemists mean? It meant endless medicinal pills. It meant that a sect could swiftly raise its strength!Just imagine, if a sect had a large number of peak level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists, but these martial artists were unable to break through due to limitations of their talent; at this time, the sect's alchemists obtained a book on soul cultivation laws, and their strength soared, enabling them to refine medicinal pills capable of allowing Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists to break through.Just how terrifying would something like that be?Alchemist was an occupation with a very low entry threshold but was extremely difficult to raise further.The low entry threshold was because One Star Alchemist, commonly called as Alchemy Apprentice, had very low requirements toward soul strength. One could reach it with just the soul strength of an Essence Qi Realm martial artist.However, there was an enormous threshold from Alchemy Apprentice to Alchemy Master. That was because for Tier 2 medicinal pills onwards, there would be a drastic increase in the soul strength required for the alchemist!This threshold called soul strength had blocked countless potential alchemists outside its gate.Every time a martial artist advanced a major cultivation realm, their soul would receive the nourishment from heaven and earth essence energy and experience a substantial growth from there. However, this sort of growth could not catch up to the increase in soul strength requirement for alchemists.Feng Zhirou had been a high-rank Alchemy Apprentice for a long time and also broke through to the Spirit Condensation Realm long ago. Yet, she still could not become an Alchemy Master. The reason for that was insufficient soul strength.Now, a set of soul cultivation laws was in front of Ye Hang. How could he not be agitated?Ye Hang had remained a low-rank Alchemy Grandmaster for many years and was unable to break through all because his soul strength was lacking.With the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation, it was only a matter of time for Ye Hang to step into the middle-rank Alchemy Grandmaster!Ye Yuan was right. That Explosive Yuan Pill and other matters were insignificant when compared to this Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation.Even if he were beaten by Wan Donghai to the point where he could not retaliate right now, with this set of Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation, it would be as easy as flipping his hand to overturn the Drunken Star Manor in the future.\"That's right. This Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation is precisely a soul cultivation law technique.\" Ye Yuan gave his father an affirmative look.'That's excellent! Excellent! Excellent! With this Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation, Wan Donghai is nothing! Hahaha!\"One could tell just how excited Ye Hang was to say three 'Excellent' consecutively.After his exhilaration, Ye Hang suddenly felt that something was not quite right. He asked Ye Yuan, \"Yuan-er, these two cultivation laws were imparted by that expert. If in the future, he found out that you secretly leaked out his cultivation techniques by imparting them to me privately, wouldn't that make things hard for you? I-I better not learn them. You just tell me the pill formula for the Explosive Yuan Pill, and that would do.\"Ye Hang gritted his teeth and rejected Ye Yuan's good intentions. But anyone could see the reluctance in those eyes.However, Ye Yuan was shaken to his core.He knew clearly the temptation a soul cultivation law had among alchemists. If one placed the throne, beautiful women, and a soul cultivation technique together, an alchemist would definitely choose the soul cultivation technique!As an alchemist himself, Ye Yuan was all too clear on this point.One could say that with a soul cultivation law, fame, status, and beauties would come forth one after another. How could an alchemist be foolish enough to choose the others?After all, strength was the foundation for alchemists just like martial artists.But Ye Hang would rather forsake the opportunity to become a high-tier alchemist for his sake. How could this not shock him?Since reincarnating until now, every little bit that Ye Hang did for him came into his mind, heavily affecting Ye Yuan's heart. Unknowingly, tears started to fall . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though it was not during a matter of life and death, Ye Hang's selfless fatherly love deeply touched Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan had only felt this feeling from Zhenyang Zi before. Regardless of whether Ye Hang was his real father or not, that unconditional love for him was true.Qingyun Zi inherited and was influenced by Ye Yuan's body. So he naturally felt close to Ye Hang.In addition, Ye Hang's impression on the newly reincarnated Ye Yuan was pretty good. Ye Yuan felt guilty in his heart, so he acknowledged this father.But deep down inside him, Ye Yuan only treated him like somebody he was close with and did not have that kind of true father-son relations.h.i.+p.In Ye Yuan's heart, his real father was only Zhengyang Zi. Hence, he did not impart these things to Ye Hang previously.But now, Ye Yuan approved Ye Hang as his father from the bottom of his heart.Two lifetimes and both fathers had fatherly love akin to a mountain. It thawed Ye Yuan's heart.At first, when Ye Yuan took out these two sets of cultivation laws, he was actually still a little hesitant. However, if Ye Hang were 'eaten up' by Wan Donghai, his future cultivation road would become increasingly difficult.With Wan Donghai's personality, he definitely would not let the weakened Ye Hang off. Ye Yuan was currently still weak, and could not defend himself.Thinking over and over again, Ye Yuan finally made this decision.But now, Ye Yuan was wholly a.s.sured.Looking at Ye Yuan's tear-stricken face, Ye Hang was alarmed and quickly asked, \"What's wrong, Yuan-er? Did father say something wrong?\"Ye Yuan shook his head and said, \"I'm fine. I was just feeling touched. I wasn't sensible in the past and made you worry. In the future, I will definitely become your pride!\"Hearing this, Ye Hang calmed down and was overcome with emotion. \"Haha. Silly son. You even learned to become melodramatic. We are father and son. Aren't you treating me like a stranger by saying that? However, Yuan-er, do you know what made me relieved was not because you obtained some peerless expert's inheritance, but because you grew up and became sensible! Men should never look back, but to go forward with indomitable will until they break through this world!\"Ye Yuan was visibly moved when he heard that speech. It was rarely seen for someone like Ye Hang in a tiny mortal country to harbor such ambition.Ye Yuan knew that Ye Hang's talent was not mediocre. What he lacked were resources.As long as there were sufficient resources, Ye Hang's future accomplishments definitely would not be small.Ye Hang was not more than 40 years old this year. He was still considered young on the road of martial arts, so the probability was still relatively huge.Ye Yuan gave Ye Hang a bow and said, \"This child has learned well. However, Father still has to learn these two sets of cultivation laws. There's nothing wrong with it. When that expert imparted these things to me, he didn't say anything about not allowing me to pa.s.s it on. So clearly, he left it up to me to decide. Furthermore, I'm not imparting it recklessly. You are my closest kin. I believe that he wouldn't say much if I pa.s.s it on to you.\"\"This . . . is this really alright?\" Ye Hang was still a little hesitant.\"Just think, Father. Would a peerless figure like that possibly make such a low-level mistake? If he didn't allow me to spread these things, then he would definitely have warned me severely. But he didn't even mention anything, so he should have left it to my discretion. If he really wanted to find somebody to pa.s.s his mantle onto, he most likely wouldn't cripple me just because of this? At most, I will inform him of this the next time he comes to look for me. If he feels that it's inappropriate, then let us father and son shoulder it together!\"Ye Yuan said all that with a heroic spirit that soared, dispelling Ye Hang's misgivings.\"Fine. We, father and son, will shoulder it together!\" Ye Yuan also said valiantly.Although he said this verbally, Ye Hang actually thought otherwise.If that expert really comes to look for trouble for Yuan-er, then I will just cripple my martial arts as an apology! I can't allow Yuan-er to shoulder this matter.Of course, Ye Hang was not aware that the so-called expert did not even exist . . .. . . . . .The following days, both Ye Yuan and Ye Hang were in a closed-door seclusion and did not leave.Ye Hang spent all of his time on comprehending the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation, while Ye Yuan was consolidating his cultivation realm.Before entering a closed-door seclusion, Ye Hang instructed for the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to continue operating as per usual. Regardless of what the Drunken Star Manor did, they were not to do anything rash. Everything will wait until he exited his closed-door seclusion.Now that he had the Explosive Yuan Pill, he was not in a hurry to make his move. He would first let Wan Donghai toss and turn around for a while, and then beat him to death with a single blow!With the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's foundation, it was impossible to take down the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion in a short period of time even if Wan Donghai had those Essence Gathering Pills.Ye Hang wanted to make use of this time to swiftly raise his strength!In this world where the strong feasts on the weak, strength was the absolute truth.Ye Hang knew that the Explosive Yuan Pill's medicinal effects were multiple times of the Essence Qi Pill. But once it was exposed, the impact would not just be multiple times!Without sufficient strength, this Explosive Yuan Pill would instead become the root of a calamity!Ye Hang initially placed all of his attention on the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation and lacked interest in the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. However, he only knew the terrifying might of this Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art after cultivating it.In only three days' time, his cultivation realm that was stuck for a long time started to loosen. This was also the result of him cultivating the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation at the same time.Borrowing the power of medicinal pills, Ye Hang burst through the hurdle in one move, rising one minor cultivation realm.Above the Spirit Condensation Realm was the Crystal Formation Realm. In the Crystal Formation Realm, the difficulty of trying to break through a minor realm did not fall below that of training from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm!Some people might not even be able to break through a minor realm in five years or maybe even ten years! The difficulty could not even be imagined.But Ye Hang discovered that ever since he cultivated the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, the essence energy in his Dantian became much thicker. His crystallized essence energy seemed to show signs of liquefying and recondensing!As for the Thousand Augmenting Soul Incantation, that was the soul incantation which Ye Yuan cultivated in his previous life. The pricelessness of it was naturally without any question.Similarly, within three days, Ye Hang's soul strength broke through, and he successfully broke through to become a middle-rank Alchemy Grandmaster.However, Ye Hang still did not have any intention of exiting his closed-door seclusion. He wanted to continue and concentrate entirely on the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. Only then could he raise his strength.That was because Ye Hang was not certain what kind of a stir the Explosive Yuan Pill would cause once it surfaced.. . . . . .After four days, it was finally the day of the test. Ye Yuan exited seclusion and then headed to the Alchemist a.s.sociation to gather with everyone.When Ye Yuan arrived, the great hall of the Alchemist a.s.sociation was completely fully packed.He had not seen most of the people before, but he recognized a few of them, such as Feng Ruoqing, and her niece, as well as . . . Wan Yuan.Wan Yuan indeed came from a family with profound teachings. He was already a middle-rank Alchemy Apprentice long ago. This time around, he should be here to partic.i.p.ate in the high-rank Alchemy Apprentice test.Furthermore, it was said that Wan Yuan's soul strength was rather robust. It would not be an issue for him to become an Alchemy Master in the future. And because of that, Wan Yuan received a great deal of attention in the Dan Wu Academy.Currently, Wan Yuan was talking to Feng Zhirou about something, while Feng Zhirou was as cold as ice and gave him the cold shoulder.Wan Yuan did not feel disgruntled by Feng Zhirou's action, but instead, had a smile on his face.However, at this time, Feng Zhirou caught sight of Ye Yuan and suddenly showed an overjoyed expression. She shook off Wan Yuan and rushed over to Ye Yuan.\"Ye Yuan, why did you only arrive now? My aunt and I waited so long for you. We thought you were scared that you couldn't pa.s.s and decided to not come!\" Feng Zhirou said intimately.Ye Yuan knew that Feng Zhirou was doing this to shake off Wan Yuan and could not help looking over at Wan Yuan. As expected, he saw that face which turned the color of a pig's liver, along with a stare which could kill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But he and Wan Yuan were already at the stage where one of them had to die, so a little more did not matter.Ye Yuan had a headache. Why was Feng Zhirou's personality completely different from the sayings? To think that he even used her last time to annoy Liu Ruoshui.\"What's the point of coming so early? It hasn't even begun yet. No need to make a huge fuss over it. It's just a test.\" Ye Yuan grumbled.\"Humph! I already heard all about you from Aunt. All the way until now, it's just empty talk. Who knows where you saw a bunch of c.r.a.p from some records or books, to actually coax my aunt like this.\" Feng Zhirou snorted.Ye Yuan could not be bothered to explain to her, and he directly walked past her to greet Feng Ruoqing.This scene when reflected in Wan Yuan's eyes looked more like flirting between couples, making him gnash his teeth in hatred.Although he liked Liu Ruoshui, Feng Zhirou greatly outcla.s.sed her. If he could win the heart of this beauty, would that little Liu Ruoshui even matter?Feng Zhirou was the G.o.ddess of the male students, and that naturally included Wan Yuan as well. It was just that Feng Zhirou's status and his was too far apart in the past. So there was no opportunity to make contact with her.Presently, Wan Yuan was an Earth Rank student. Moreover, he was a middle-rank Alchemy Apprentice. He had full confidence in pa.s.sing the high-rank Alchemy Apprentice test this time.Wan Yuan believed that before long, he could stand on the same starting line as Feng Zhirou.With adequate strength, Wan Yuan naturally started having other thoughts.Wan Yuan did not expect to meet Feng Zhirou during this alchemist test. So he thickened his face and introduced his background. But Feng Zhirou did not even react to it.Within the State of Qin, a middle-rank Alchemy Master was absolutely a figure that everyone wanted to curry favor with. If that was not the case, why would Liu Ruoshui walk so closely with Wan Yuan?However, this t.i.tle did not seem to be very useful with Feng Zhirou. It was like she had never even heard of the name Wan Donghai.Wan Yuan was stunned for a moment, but he felt relieved after thinking for a moment. The future accomplishments of the top three figures on the Martial Roll of Honor would definitely not be beneath his father's. Being a little proud was normal.However, once these thoughts started to stir, it could no longer be suppressed.When chasing girls, the harder it was, the more it would arouse the fighting spirit of men.Except that Wan Yuan did not expect to see Ye Yuan here. Furthermore, Ye Yuan actually looked like he was on pretty good terms with Feng Zhirou. Besides, there were those vague rumors about Feng Ruoqing and Ye Yuan, making Wan Yuan's heart ablaze with the flames of jealousy.Who was Ye Yuan to even have such deep connections with the two great G.o.ddesses of the Dan Wu Academy?Although Ye Yuan recently rose up fiercely and even made Wan Yuan feel threatened, his scorn for Ye Yuan was deeply ingrained. He instinctively felt that Ye Yuan was not worthy to have all these.Feng Ruoqing's eyes lit up when she saw Ye Yuan and pulled him aside to talk to him quietly.\"I've pretty much mastered the left hand drawing a circle and right hand drawing a square training that you asked me to do. I didn't think that it would be quite beneficial for the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique!\"Feng Ruoqing was always calm and collected, but she was quite agitated right now. If not for the fact that this was not a suitable place, she even wanted to let out a cry of relief.The truth was, she already had practiced this Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique for a long time. But no matter how much she trained, she could not find a way to learn it.Now, after training for a few days according to Ye Yuan's method, her Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique unexpectedly improved by leaps and bounds.Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at Feng Ruoqing and then said indignantly, \"Didn't you say it was useless back then? Why did you pick it up again?\"Feng Ruoqing's excitement was abruptly cut, and she gave an embarra.s.sed look. At the same time, she cursed endlessly in her heart, why did this punk not have the slightest bit of tenderness towards women? He actually embarra.s.sed me right in front of my face!\"You didn't say anything back then. How would I know whether it's useful or not? You should have at least explained to me why I had to do it!\" Feng Ruoqing was somewhat aggrieved.Looking at Feng Ruoqing's pitiful appearance, Ye Yuan did not feel it was nice to deride her anymore. \"The essence of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique is dual-tasking. When you are using the technique, your essence energy was chaotic, and your two hands were not able to coordinate. It would be weirder for you to succeed! I asked you to train drawing so that you could learn how to dual-task. But this is just the initial step. You still need bitter hard work if you want your two hands to control essence energy to the point of Yin Yang harmony.\"Feng Ruoqing gave a look of sudden realization. \"So that's the case. No wonder I couldn't improve no matter how much I trained!\"In all matters, the beginning was the hardest. Although Ye Yuan said that Feng Ruoqing had just taken the initial step, as long as that step was taken, the path in the future would be much smoother.As an alchemist, Feng Ruoqing's talent was not bad. What was missing was outlook and experience.\"Alright. I don't need you to pay any tuition fees. But don't look for me to be an a.s.sistant in the future. I'm very busy.\" Ye Yuan waved his hands.Hearing this, Feng Ruoqing felt another wave of bitterness. Other people could not wait to become her a.s.sistant, but Ye Yuan avoided her like the plague. Was she really not that attractive?Women were mysterious creatures. Sometimes, the more you chased her, the more she found you irritating. But after you maintained a distance away from her, she would feel a sense of loss.These two people whispering to each other naturally drew a lot of attention.Even though n.o.body knew what they were talking about, Feng Ruoqing looked like a little wife getting scolded.The crowd could not help but wonder if there really was something going on between the two of them.At this time, several red-robed old men walked into the hall from the side door. Two of the old men even brought along a young lady each with them.Feng Ruoqing was the instructor leading the group for this test. She was swapped in at the last minute.This was obviously the time for her to step out.\"Haha. Are you well, Miss Feng? You haven't been to our a.s.sociation for some time. I'm afraid you are probably absorbed in researching alchemy again, are you? If you carry on like this, us old men are going to feel ashamed!\"An old man at the front seemed to be old acquaintances with Feng Ruoqing and started a small talk right away.At this moment, Feng Ruoqing recovered her demeanor as the beautiful, otherworldly instructor. She smiled lightly as she greeted the group of old men, \"Chairman w.a.n.g, Chairman Sun, and elders. How do you do? Chairman w.a.n.g is pulling my leg, the last time I was here was half a year ago. How was that long? With Ruoqing's measly cultivation, how would I dare to make Chairman w.a.n.g feel ashamed? You are the leading authority in the alchemist world in the State of Qin!\"\"Haha. Miss Feng really knows how to talk. But I, Old w.a.n.g, am not joking around. The way I see it, the State of Qin would probably have another Alchemy Master in less than three years.\" Chairman w.a.n.g did not seem to be faking it and was actually full of praise for Feng Ruoqing.Feng Ruoqing smiled faintly and said, \"Chairman w.a.n.g is too kind. Ruoqing is not worthy.\"Chairman w.a.n.g laughed loudly. \"You are worthy! Worthy! Yii? Isn't this Honorable Nephew Wan Yuan? I didn't think that you would also come to take part in the test this time. Taking the high-rank Alchemy Apprentice test?\"Instantly, all eyes turned to Wan Yuan. Clearly, they did not expect Wan Yuan to know the deputy chairman of the Alchemist a.s.sociation.Wan Yuan looked gloatingly at Ye Yuan and went up to greet them. He then said, \"Have you been well, Chairman w.a.n.g? This Little Nephew is here to take part in the high-rank Alchemy Apprentice test.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Good. Honorable Nephew really has profound family teachings to already have the strength of a high-rank Alchemy Apprentice at such a young age. Old Brother Wan has a worthy successor! Each new generation really excels the old one. I'm really old already.\"Chairman w.a.n.g ridiculed himself slightly.\"Chairman w.a.n.g is still in your prime. Why would you say that you are old? All the elders here are our State of Qin's alchemists, people who are supporting the cauldron. Chairman w.a.n.g and Chairman Sun are even the leading figures. We juniors still have a long way to go.\" Wan Yuan's flattering was so resounding that he threw everyone in.\"Haha. I'm old, old already. Can't compare to back then. Miss Feng, Old Sun and I brought along two juniors today. Do you mind us cutting your queue here?\" Chairman w.a.n.g turned to Feng Ruoqing.Feng Ruoqing nodded slightly and said, \"To let them witness your two accomplished disciples' power and know that there is always someone better is undoubtedly a good thing.\"\"Don't say that! This is my last disciple, Xu Feng-er. The one beside Old Sun is my granddaughter and also his proud successor, Sun Keyun. These two juniors are good-for-nothings, so don't laugh later, Miss Feng. The two of you, why haven't you come to greet Teacher Feng? She's only a few years older than you, but she is already a middle-rank Alchemy Master. You two have to learn more from her.\"Even though Chairman w.a.n.g belittled the two young ladies, he could not hide the satisfaction in his eyes.It looked like were it not for these two young ladies, with Chairman w.a.n.g's and Chairman Sun's status as Alchemy Grandmasters, they would not have personally came to host the test.\"Feng-er (Keyun) has seen Teacher Feng.\" The two ladies gave Feng Ruoqing a bow, their eyes filled with wors.h.i.+p.To become a middle-rank Alchemy Master at this age was absolutely a target worth prostrating to for all young people.Ye Yuan silently sized up these two la.s.ses. Their soul strength was indeed mighty. It looked like it should not be an issue for them to become Alchemy Masters after stepping into the Spirit Condensation Realm.\"Alright. Everyone is an outstanding student of the Dan Wu Academy. Some of you have already partic.i.p.ated in this test several times before so I won't go through the rules too much. The first test that takes place will be the Alchemy Apprentice test, followed by the Alchemy Master test. Each group will have five people entering the refinement room. Now, those partic.i.p.ating in the Alchemy Apprentice test stand on the left. Those taking the Alchemy Master test stand on the right.\" Chairman w.a.n.g organized them into groups.There were only twenty people from the Dan Wu Academy partic.i.p.ating in the test this time. Including Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun, there were only twenty-two people. The majority of them came to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Apprentice test, and only two of them are taking the Alchemy Master test. One of them was Feng Zhirou, while the other was one rank below Feng Zhirou on the Alchemy Roll of Honor, Cao Yu.After Chairman w.a.n.g said this, a large group moved to the left, while Feng Zhirou and Cao Yu stood to the right; leaving Ye Yuan standing in his original position and not moving.Seeing this, Chairman w.a.n.g frowned and was slightly displeased. \"This Young Friend, didn't you hear what I said?\"Everyone looked at Ye Yuan in amazement, while Wan Yuan had a gloating face. This punk was indeed still an eccentric. Was it not courting death to behave like that in front of a top figure like Chairman w.a.n.g?Seeing that Ye Yuan still did not move, Feng Ruoqing became anxious and called out, \"What are you still standing there for, Ye Yuan? Quickly move to the left!\"\"Uh . . . Actually, I want to ask if I can stand on the right side,\" Ye Yuan said a little helplessly.He did not want to be unconventional, but since he promised Feng Ruoqing to go all out, Ye Yuan did not plan on concealing his strength.When he promised Feng Ruoqing, Ye Yuan thought about it a little.In the future, with the increase in strength, he would not be able to avoid this hurdle called Alchemist a.s.sociation. If his Alchemy Dao was extraordinarily strong, but he did not take part in the alchemist tests all the way, then he would genuinely be a maverick.If at that time, it spreads to the ears of that traitor or the Alchemist a.s.sociation's Headquarters, then it would not be fun. It would be very easy to arouse their suspicion.\"Hahaha . . .\" There was an uproar of laughter.\"A Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm wants to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Master test? Are you joking or are you making fun of both Chairman w.a.n.g and Chairman Sun?\" Wan Yuan berated out loud, but he actually had the sinister intentions of making the two chairmen get a terrible impression of Ye Yuan.As expected, when the two of then heard what Wan Yuan said, their faces turned ugly.\"This Young Friend, didn't you hear clearly? The right side is for those taking the Alchemy Master test!\" Chairman w.a.n.g's face fell, and his words became less courteous. It was clear that he was unhappy.\"Ye Yuan! Why haven't you apologized to the two chairmen? This is the Alchemist a.s.sociation! You can't act wildly here!\" Feng Ruoqing repeatedly signaled with her eyes at Ye Yuan worriedly. Offending the two big heads of the Alchemist a.s.sociation at the same time was no laughing matter.The Alchemist a.s.sociation had always been an aloof existence. Even the Imperial family could not command them. n.o.body had dared to make fun of the Alchemist a.s.sociation's chairmen before.But now, Ye Yuan set a new precedent! Of course, this was how the others saw it.However, Ye Yuan did not seem to see it like that. Instead, he smiled and then said to Chairman w.a.n.g, \"This Junior has heard clearly, and I want to stand on the right side. I want to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Master test.\"\"You, a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, wants to join the Alchemy Master test?\" Chairman w.a.n.g indeed became angry.\"That's right.\" Ye Yuan remained fearless.\"Whose family's brat are you?! To actually be so impertinent! Did you come here today to beguile us elders?!\" Chairman w.a.n.g was already on the edge of exploding. If it was not for the sake of Feng Ruoqing's face, he would have thrown Ye Yuan out long ago.At this time, Wan Yuan came forward very naturally to follow up. \"Please calm down, Chairman w.a.n.g. This person has always been arrogant, and he never respects his elders. But speaking of his family, I believe Chairman w.a.n.g also knows his father.\"\"Oh? Do say, Honorable Nephew. Who is his father?\" Chairman w.a.n.g asked curiously.\"His father is Ye Hang, the owner of the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion,\" Wan Yuan replied respectfully.Hearing that, Chairman w.a.n.g frowned and said, \"He is actually Old Brother Ye's son? Old Brother Ye is a tiger father, how could he possibly beget such a shallow and frivolous son?\"Ye Yuan was around the same age as Wan Yuan but was only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Clearly, he was someone who made no effort to seek progress.If he was only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, then forget it. But he actually did not know what was good for him and wanted to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Master test. Did he think that Alchemy Masters were like cabbages?He had gradually advanced along the Alchemy Path for so many years now, but he had never heard of any Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm becoming an Alchemy Master, let alone a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.G.o.d knew how many Spirit Condensation Realms were stopped outside the gate of Alchemy Master, yet a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm shamelessly boasted that he wanted to partic.i.p.ate in the Alchemy Master test. If this was not causing trouble on purpose, then what was?\"I'm not bored enough to be here and entertain you. I just feel that taking the test one rank at a time wastes too much time, so it's better to just take the Alchemy Master test directly.\" Ye Yuan's words shocked everyone greatly.\"Humph! Taking into account that you are Ye Hang's son, I will overlook this sin of disrespect, but I think you can forget about this test. Miss Feng, it's not that this old man isn't giving you any face, but this brat is too mischievous. Men, throw this person out for me!\" Chairman w.a.n.g finally lost his temper.Wan Yuan was bursting with joy right now and thought to himself that the evil that people brought on themselves were the hardest to bear.\"Hold on!\" at that moment, Feng Ruoqing finally called out to stop this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed like the relations.h.i.+p between these two was becoming more apparent.\"Please calm down, Chairman. May I speak with him?\" Even though Feng Ruoqing was an instructor in the Dan Wu Academy, her qualifications were still somewhat lacking in the Alchemist a.s.sociation's territory.Chairman w.a.n.g pondered for a moment before nodding his head.Feng Ruoqing looked at Ye Yuan with complicated eyes, trying to see if whether he really had a plan or he was messing around. But after staring for a long time, she could not see anything.\"Let me ask you, Ye Yuan. Is our agreement earlier still valid?\" Feng Ruoqing asked in a low voice.It was just that this question seemed a little ambiguous, so apart from Feng Zhirou who knew the details, everyone's imaginations ran wild.Ye Yuan replied somewhat helplessly, \"If it wasn't for keeping our agreement, do you think that I enjoy being looked on by them like I'm a freak?\"Hearing Ye Yuan say this, Feng Ruoqing's state of mind somehow became relaxed.Other people did not know Ye Yuan's Alchemy Dao prowess, but Feng Ruoqing was very clear on it.To be able to casually instruct her, a middle-rank Alchemy Master, what Ye Yuan was lacking was most likely just cultivation realm.Feng Ruoqing had the feeling that what she saw was only a tip of the iceberg of Ye Yuan's abilities.Just what kind of a freak was this fellow? He was only fifteen years old!\"You mean . . . you are confident?\"Even though she had confidence in Ye Yuan, what Ye Yuan was about to do was too subversive of common sense. So she had to confirm again.\"Uh. That I'm not too sure,\" Ye Yuan replied very irresponsibly.Seeing that Feng Ruoqing was about to storm off, Ye Yuan immediately followed up and said, \"Will simply refining any kind of Tier 2 medicinal pill work?\"\"That's right. As long can you can refine any kind of Tier 2 medicinal pill within four hours, it counts as pa.s.sing the low-rank Alchemy Master test!\"\"I see. If that's the case, then it shouldn't be an issue,\" Ye Yuan said nonchalantly as if refining a Tier 2 medicinal pill was as simple as drinking water and eating rice.\"Since that's the case, I hope you don't disappoint me!\"After Feng Ruoqing finished, she pulled out a bottle of medicinal pills from inside her sleeves, and then said to Chairman w.a.n.g, \"Chairman, I have three Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pills that I will place here as collateral for Ye Yuan. If Ye Yuan is really here to cause trouble, then these three Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pills will be an apology to the a.s.sociation.\"When these words were said, shock could be seen on everyone's faces.The Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pill was a genuine Tier 3 medicinal pill. Furthermore, it was a highly sought and precious Tier 3 medicinal pill!That was because the effects of the Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pill was to strengthen a martial artist's divine soul. It was able to make a martial artist's soul more powerful!This type of medicinal pill was something that alchemists dreamed about.Chairman w.a.n.g was also astonished. He did not expect Feng Ruoqing to pull out such a precious item for Ye Yuan.As one of the major heads of the Alchemist a.s.sociation, he knew Feng Ruoqing's true ident.i.ty. That was why he was so courteous to her.If someone else were leading the team today, then with his status, he would not be bothered to talk so much c.r.a.p with them.\"Miss Feng really wants to take out such a precious item for an ignorant brat?\" Chairman w.a.n.g asked disbelievingly.\"Ruoqing knows that Ye Yuan's actions are unconventional, but I believe that he has the ability! Just because we have never seen something before, that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Things that we can't do doesn't mean that others can't do it as well!\" Feng Ruoqing said firmly.\"Fine. Since Miss Feng insists on it, then this old man won't be the bad guy today. But Miss Feng needs to know that I only agreed for your sake. If it were another person, I wouldn't accompany her to mess around even if she took out this Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pill,\" Chairman w.a.n.g said seriously.\"Thank you, Chairman w.a.n.g!\" Feng Ruoqing bowed slightly to express thanks.She knew that Chairman w.a.n.g was not lying. Even though the Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pill was precious, this kind of medicinal pills was not overly scarce with the Alchemist a.s.sociation's might.The main reason why he agreed was still taking into account that she was the Head Imperial Princess.\"Since Miss Feng is so insistent, then Ye Yuan, stand on the right. But this old man will say some nasty words first. If you are really making fun of old me, I can forsake these pills, but you will pay for this! Otherwise, if this matter spreads, people will think that my Alchemist a.s.sociation has become a place for children to mess around!\"Chairman w.a.n.g's did not speak quickly, but each word was loud and clear. It was evident that he made up his mind to give Ye Yuan a good one.Ye Yuan could not be bothered with him and went to stand beside Feng Zhirou.\"Hey! Did you make a mistake? Don't harm my aunt! How can you, a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, possibly refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill?\" Feng Zhirou said indignantly.Ye Yuan glanced at Feng Zhirou and then retracted his eyes. He said indifferently, \"You better take care of yourself. I think you are going to fail this time. Why is the academy's Alchemy Roll of Honor so weak?\"\"You!\" Feng Zhirou did not expect Ye Yuan to rebuke her and was so infuriated that she was speechless.On the other side, Wan Yuan gnashed his teeth as he looked at Ye Yuan hatefully.Why? Why did Teacher Feng take out such a valuable thing for him? Just what capabilities does he, Ye Yuan, have? Just wait and see. Right now, you are unbelievably arrogant. In a while, I will see just how you intend to wind up. Wan Yuan was yelling in his heart.. . . . . .Individual pill refinement rooms were used for this test. There were a total of ten pill refinement rooms. Five refinement rooms in a row at the east side, and another five at the west side. At the center was a great hall, and at the north of the hall was a light screen. The examiner could see everything happening in the refinement room through this light screen. At the south of the hall was a herbal warehouse.Alchemy involved many things such as controlling fire, medicinal theory, array formations, and etc. But in the end, it was all for refining the medicinal pill.No matter how strong in one aspect a person was, if they could not refine out a medicinal pill, then it was useless. There would not be any recognition.Hence, the Alchemist a.s.sociation's tests had always taken a completed medicinal pill's grade as the benchmark.Whatever pill one could refine meant that they belonged to that alchemist rank. This was the most straightforward way, as well as the most persuasive.Four hours were neither too long nor too short. It required the success rate of refining a medicinal pill to not be too low. This also reduced the likelihood of the alchemist being lucky.In this place, everything was decided by strength!\"The test officially begins now. Examinees can start choosing the herbs. The first two groups of students, make your way into the herbal warehouse.\"The host of the test changed to a middle-aged Alchemy Master. Under his instructions, the first two groups of students went into the herbal warehouse to choose their herbs.Selection of herbs being included in the four hours was actually also a form of test for the students.It was a basic skill for an alchemist to find the required herbs in the shortest amount of time, in order to save time for the preparation of the herbs and refinement process later.As a matter of fact, one could tell the strength of the students from this herbs selection stage.The faster and more accurate a person was when choosing the herbs meant that they had a more skillful understanding of medicinal theory. It also meant that they had a better grasp on the attributes of the various herbs when refining. The success rate of refinement would naturally also rise significantly.Feng Ruoqing's gaze involuntarily looked towards Ye Yuan, and she thought to herself that with Ye Yuan's extreme understanding towards herbs, he only needed to spend a short while inside the herbal warehouse.When she was refining the Qi Returning Pill, he could actually use his hands to flawlessly grab and prepare various herbs. It was truly heaven-defying!He was clearly only fifteen years old. Even if he started training alchemy in his mother's womb, how was it possible to reach such a level?Thinking up to this point, Feng Ruoqing gained a little more confidence in Ye Yuan.Perhaps Ye Yuan could really create a miracle?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Your Level Is Too LowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60: Your Level Is Too LowTranslator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorIn the first two group, the main focus was naturally Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun.Reality had proven that these two people truly could best the Dan Wu Academy's students.When the two of them walked out of the herbal warehouse, everyone else was still looking for herbs.As for Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun, the two of them were pretty much neck-to-neck and exited the herbal warehouse together.Watching Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun standing out like cranes among chickens, both Elder w.a.n.g and Elder Sun felt a pleasant warmth on their faces. Especially Elder w.a.n.g who was vexed by Ye Yuan earlier. Right now, he felt his mood turn for the better.Elder w.a.n.g was named w.a.n.g Jinfu, and Elder Sun was Sun Jianming. The two of them were veterans in the Alchemist a.s.sociation and also highly respected Alchemy Grandmasters who were second to none in the State of Qin.Both of them were the Alchemist a.s.sociation' deputy chairmen, but they were secretly competing by bringing their disciples to take part in this test this time around.\"Oh Old Sun. I didn't think that Keyun this la.s.s would improve so quickly. I'm afraid you expended no little effort on her!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu said as he stroked his beard.\"Haha. Your family's Feng-er isn't bad either. I remember that you only took her in as your last disciple the previous year. I didn't think that she was going to become a high-rank Alchemy Apprentice this quickly.\"\"That's right. Feng-er this la.s.s is quite intelligent. Just a little bit, and she would understand. She is a good seedling. During this herb selection stage, it counts as a draw between the two of them. But this is just the appetizer. The key point is still the refinement.\"Sun Jianming nodded in approval.It was apparent that between these two old men, w.a.n.g Jianfu was more talkative, while Sun Jianming was taciturn.After Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun entered the refinement room, they immediately started preparing the herbs.During the preparation stage, their actions were very swift and proficient. One could see that the two of them were frequently a.s.sisting the two old fogeys outside.However, these basic skills were normally not visible. The effects would only show itself when it really came down to it.Aside from some students who had greater emphasis placed on them, the Dan Wu Academy's students rarely had the opportunity to do miscellaneous tasks for the instructors. Thus, they obviously could not be compared to how fast Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun were.Furthermore, w.a.n.g Jianfu and Sun Jianming were Alchemy Grandmasters. With them teaching step-by-step along the way, it would be impossible for these two girls not to stand above the rest.The Dan Wu Academy students were worse off once again during this segment.What amazed everyone was that the two of them progressed in a synchronized manner without any clear distinction between them. It was like Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun discussed it beforehand.From selecting the herbs to finis.h.i.+ng the preparation of the herbs, these two girls took around an hour. One could see just how solid their fundamental skills were.Each student had three chances in the Alchemist a.s.sociation's test. So everyone would prepare three sets of herbs.Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun finished preparing their herbs and started on their first refinement.In the hall, Feng Zhirou watched the light screen in utter boredom. She was already a high-rank Alchemy Apprentice since long ago, so she obviously lacked interest in watching this kind of matches again.\"Hey, Ye Yuan. Who do you think will win between those two girls?\" Feng Zhirou moved over to Ye Yuan's side and started talking with voice transmission.In this hall, no matter how quiet she was, those two old men would definitely hear it with their strength.\"Sun Keyun,\" Ye Yuan similarly replied using voice transmission without even thinking about it.\"Eh? You already knew it? Why?\" Feng Zhirou was surprised.Feng Zhirou did not doubt Ye Yuan's words. She knew that Ye Yuan was really amazing. Feng Ruoqing's eyes were always at the top of her head. A youth that was so highly regarded by her aunt was absolutely no ordinary man.It was just that no matter how amazing she felt Ye Yuan was, she did not think that he could pa.s.s through the Alchemy Master test with his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"Because Chairman Sun is a notch above,\" Ye Yuan replied nonchalantly.\"Chairman Sun? What has it got to do with Chairman Sun?\" Feng Zhirou was confused by Ye Yuan.\"Chairman Sun is a man of few words and is more infatuated with Alchemy Dao. His abilities should be a notch above Chairman w.a.n.g's. Chairman Sun is pragmatic, so he is logically more strict when teaching apprentices. Sun Keyun inherited her predecessor's style, so she is obviously a cut above.\"\"No way. Just because of this?\"Ye Yuan rolled his eyes at Feng Zhirou. \"When they were choosing the herbs, the two of them seemed to be on par. But Sun Keyun was actually slightly faster than Xu Feng-er.\"Feng Zhirou was dumbfounded. \"How did you tell?\"\"Xu Feng-er is refining the Fierce Tiger Pill, while Sun Keyun is refining the Profound Clarity Pill. The Profound Clarity Pill has one more secondary ingredient than the Fierce Tiger Pill, but the two of them finished at the same time. The winner and the loser are clear at a glance.\"Ye Yuan's words left Feng Zhirou wide-mouthed for a moment. \"Y-you aren't talking rubbish, are you? You can tell what kind of pill they are refining just from the light screen?Ye Yuan gave a faint smile. \"Won't you know whether I'm talking rubbish or not after they finish refining?\"\"Fine then. I want to see if you are the real thing! If I find out that you were talking c.r.a.p, no need for Chairman w.a.n.g to take action. I will throw you out first!\" Feng Zhirou threatened him.\"Whatever!\" Ye Yuan said indifferently.\"Tch. Talked until it sounds so incredible. The final result of the test still lies on the refined medicinal pill. Even if they really refined the Fierce Tiger Pill and the Profound Clarity Pill, it still wouldn't be easy to determine the winner between these two pills, right?\" After a short while, Feng Zhirou found it boring and transmitted her voice over again.\"No, the winner has already been decided.\"\"Acting! Carry on acting! I don't believe that you can tell which one of them won from the light screen! Both of their herbs are only half-way refined and haven't condensed into a pill yet!\" Feng Zhirou was triggered by Ye Yuan's posturing att.i.tude and felt even more strongly that Ye Yuan was talking nonsense.\"Sun Keyun's refinement went smoothly. Without any accident, it should be a high-grade medicinal pill. But Xu Feng-er made a small mistake at the start of the refinement, Even though she corrected it right away, it definitely affected the quality of the Fierce Tiger Pill. At best, it can barely reach the high-grade standard. If later on she made another mistake, it wouldn't be surprising for it to become a middle-grade medicinal pill.\" Ye Yuan continued to a.n.a.lyze calmly.\"Did Xu Feng-er make a mistake? Why didn't I see it?\"\"Your level is too low, so you can't see it.\"\"Ye Yuan! You!\" If not for the fact that this was not the right place, Feng Zhirou would definitely stab him with her sword again.. . . . . .Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun finished refining virtually at the same time. Furthermore, they succeeded with one try and only used an hour.Among these two groups of students, they thoroughly deserved to be kings. It was already without any doubt that they pa.s.sed the high-rank Alchemy Apprentice test.What was left was seeing the quality of the medicinal pill that the two of them refined to determine who was better.The two of them carried the medicinal pill that they refined and walked to the hall. Bowing towards the two old men, they said respectfully, \"Master (Grandfather), please inspect.\"But w.a.n.g Jinfu laughed and turned to Feng Ruoqing instead. \"It naturally isn't nice for us to talk about our family. Can Miss Feng come and help us judge?\"Feng Ruoqing smiled lightly and said, \"It's better to accept than to stand on ceremony.\"Feng Ruoqing took the medicinal pill on Xu Feng-er's tray and inspected closely. \"A high-grade Tier 1 medicinal pill, the Fierce Tiger pill. It was completed outstandingly and has reached the standard of high-grade.\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Feng Ruoqing did the same with Sun Keyun's medicinal pill, and said, \"A high-grade Tier 1 medicinal pill, the Profound Clarity Pill. Similarly finished splendidly. The grade of the medicinal pill has also reached the standard of high-grade.\"At a corner, Feng Zhirou's jaw dropped and looked at Ye Yuan as if she saw a ghost . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some of them could not even be made out. At least, Feng Zhirou was unable to make it out.But Ye Yuan actually guessed the medicinal pills the two girls were going to refine just by looking at the light curtain!Just how did he do it?\"Haha. Don't be afraid of offending us two old crocks, Miss Feng. If there's anything, just say it. Our tolerance isn't small to that extent. Since I'm competing with Old Man Sun, there obviously needs to be a winner. In the end, there has to be a difference in quality between the medicinal pills refined by Feng-er and Keyun. Miss Feng doesn't need to have any misgivings; just say it.\"w.a.n.g Jinfu knew that Feng Ruoqing did not want to offend both sides, which was why she said it as if the two girls fought to a draw.But in reality, no matter how similar two people's Alchemy Dao prowess were, in the end, it was impossible for medicinal pills refined to be identical. That was because there were too many elements that could affect the finished product.Feng Ruoqing gave a faint smile, before saying, \"Then Chairman w.a.n.g and Chairman Sun mustn't blame this little girl, alright?\"\"Don't say that! Since you were invited to be the judge, it wouldn't be reasonable to blame you.\"Sun Jianming who had been keeping mum also voiced out.\"In reality, both Miss Feng-er and Miss Keyun are very outstanding. The two people's abilities are also on par. It's just that during Miss Feng-er's refinement process, there was a slight flaw, resulting in the medicinal pill to be slightly inferior in quality. I can see that this Fierce Tiger Pill's color is slightly dull. This should have been a result of a small error during the first step when tempering with fire.\" Feng Ruoqing's words were on point.\"Hahaha . . .\" w.a.n.g Jinfu laughed heartily, but there was no unexpected color change on his face. \"To think that the disciple you, Old Man Sun groomed is so incredible. It looks like you have a qualified successor! Feng-er, learn from this mistake. In the future, you have to be more diligent. Don't become arrogant just because you are my apprentice, understood?\"\"Feng-er understands,\" Xu Feng-er replied dispiritedly.\"Alright. It's almost time. Let the next batch begin,\" w.a.n.g Jinfu commanded.There was naturally someone to judge the medicinal pills refined by the others. Elder w.a.n.g and Elder Sun obviously would not stoop to do these sort of things with their exalted status.In this batch of people, the main focus had to be Wan Yuan.One had to say that Wan Yuan had the capital to be arrogant in terms of Alchemy Dao.He was only a few months older than Ye Yuan, but he had already possessed the strength of a high-rank Alchemy Apprentice. He could absolutely wander proudly within the same age group. His future accomplishments would most likely not be beneath his father's.Humph. Feng Ruoqing, Feng Zhirou, I'm going to let you see what a true Alchemy Dao genius is! That Ye Yuan is just a clown. On the day I step on the stage of Alchemy Master, would I even need to fear that you, Feng Zhirou, wouldn't be moved? Wan Yuan thought to himself.He had saved up enough strength in order to perform well in front of Feng Zhirou, just to make her see him in a different light.Wan Yuan felt unspeakable emotions watching Feng Zhirou and Ye Yuan making eyes at each other.. . . . . .Entering the herbal warehouse, Wan Yuan chose his herbs at top speed. The other students only came out of there after he had exited 30 minutes earlier.From this, whoever was superior could be instantly judged.Wan Yuan had the intention of showing off. The later phases were practically finished in one go.Especially after he started refining, his technique dazzled everyone, leaving them overwhelmed.\"Old Sun, it looked like Old Brother Wan has groomed a fine son. He even beat our two apprentices.\"w.a.n.g Jinfu was a veteran Alchemy Grandmaster, so his judgment was on point. As he watched Wan Yuan's refinement performance, he knew that Wan Yuan was much stronger than Xu Feng-er and Sun Keyun.\"That's right. Wan Donghai that punk really has some skill. These past few years, he suppressed Ye Hang completely. Who would have thought that the son he groomed was also this impressive? At this rate, Wan Yuan would probably surpa.s.s his father.\"Sun Jianming had always been a man of few words. To have given such an evaluation showed that Wan Yuan's performance had already conquered him.\"Indeed. The way I see it, Wan Yuan's Flowing Cloud Scattering Hands is already 70% of Wan Donghai's. What's lacking is only experience and cultivation realm. In the future, this child will surely do great things. Humph! Unlike Ye Hang's son. Trying to seek popularity through claptrap. Ridiculous!\"w.a.n.g Jinfu gave an exceedingly high evaluation to Wan Yuan, while at the same time he also dropped a timely disdain toward Ye Yuan. He was clearly very displeased with Ye Yuan causing trouble today.Every alchemist had their own unique refinement technique. And Flowing Cloud Scattering Hands was precisely the technique Wan Donghai was famous for.w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming did not deliberately cover up their conversation, so it naturally reached Feng Zhirou's and Ye Yuan's ears.Ye Yuan looked calm and relax, and he did not show any reaction.Instead, it was Feng Zhirou who had a gloating face. She transmitted her voice once again and said, \"Hey, how can you be so calm when they are praising your opponent like that?\"Having experienced the initial shock, Feng Zhirou could only use 'abnormal' to explain Ye Yuan's earlier performance.But deep down inside, Feng Zhirou started to faintly antic.i.p.ate Ye Yuan's performance later.Perhaps he really could do it?Hearing Feng Zhirou's voice transmission, Ye Yuan remained emotionless as he replied, \"Opponent? I've never treated him as an opponent.\"If it were in the past, Feng Zhirou would definitely snort in derision at these words.But now, Feng Zhirou felt that Ye Yuan might truly think this way in his heart.One had to know that earlier when Xu Feng-er made that tiny error, not even the two Alchemy Grandmasters present and her aunt saw it. Otherwise, they would not need to hold this compet.i.tion.However, Ye Yuan saw it long ago. And during Xu Feng-er's and Sun Keyun's refinement process, Ye Yuan already determined the grade of their medicinal pills. This was not something that an ordinary person could do.Feng Zhirou believed that even if Ye Yuan did not pa.s.s the Alchemy Master test, his horizons were not something that the two Alchemy Grandmasters could compare to.Could it be that Ye Yuan's theoretical standard was already on par with an Alchemy King?A fifteen years old youth with the standard of an Alchemy King? Feng Zhirou was frightened by her own thought.\"Tch! You really can act.\" Although she already agreed with Ye Yuan's words in her heart, Feng Zhirou still remained scornful on the surface.She did not know why, but she felt that Ye Yuan was very infuriating.Perhaps the reason was that she had always been pursued since young. No man had ever been so contemptuous toward her before.Seeing that Ye Yuan did not react, Feng Zhirou asked again, \"Hey, Ye Yuan. You said that I can't pa.s.s the test this time. Is that true?\"\"Of course it's true. I'm not so familiar with you as to joke with you,\" Ye Yuan replied casually.\"Hey! Why do you talk like this?!\" Feng Zhirou was upset again.\"Am I very close to you?\" Ye Yuan glanced at Feng Zhirou and asked.\"That . . .\" Feng Zhirou recalled that this was only their second meeting. They really could not count as being on familiar terms.\"Not only we are not close, but we're also even considered enemies, right?\"Feng Zhirou's face flushed red. She knew that Ye Yuan still bore a grudge again that sword. \"Ye Yuan, are you a man or not? Why do you keep harping on that small matter?\"\"Small matter? That sword of yours nearly took my life! Just how great is the hatred between us?\" Ye Yuan snarled irately.\". . . . . .\" Feng Zhirou knew that she was in the wrong, and so she kept mum in anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was wrong, alright? Don't tell me a grown man like you don't even have this bit of magnanimity and intend to remember this grudge for life?\"After keeping mum for a while, Feng Zhirou finally could not resist the loneliness and opened her mouth. It was just that her apology did not sound sincere at all.\"It's not that I'm bearing a grudge. I'm just afraid that I might accidentally offend you, My Lady. Then this small life of mine is gone. So I think it would be better for us to maintain a distance.\"Ye Yuan was really still a little afraid of Feng Zhirou. This la.s.s was too willful. Who knew if she might be unhappy someday and stab him with her sword again? Ye Yuan did not have the confidence to dodge again.He could disregard the Alchemy Roll of Honor's experts, but he could not disregard experts on the Martial Roll of Honor. Feng Zhirou was rank three on the Martial Roll. If she really came with her sword again one day, Ye Yuan's life might just be over.Feng Zhirou was so angry at Ye Yuan that she gnashed her teeth. No one had ever said something like that to her before.As long as they were men, regardless of high or low status, poor or wealthy, which one of them would not try everything they could to get close to her?But this Ye Yuan was something else. He could not even wait to hide from her!Feng Zhirou grew up in a 'honeypot' and was still rather cautious of men's approach. In the past, there had been a man who pretended to be enigmatic and deliberately maintained his distance to try to attract her attention.However, she could feel that Ye Yuan honestly found her to be a pain and did not want to get close to her. This made her feel a deep sense of defeat.\"Humph! Do whatever you want. But first, you have to tell me why I can't pa.s.s the test!\" Truth be told, this was what Feng Zhirou wanted to know most of all.\"Why should I tell you?\" Ye Yuan rolled his eyes. He had never seen someone ask for advice this way.\"Hur hur! If you don't tell me, I will . . .\" Feng Zhirou gave Ye Yuan a threatening look and drew her hand across her neck, making Ye Yuan feel a chill on his neck.Ye Yuan felt exasperated. Even if he was an Alchemy Emperor's reincarnation, the incarnation of a Divine King, but today he was only a little Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm rookie.Without question, this move from Feng Zhirou was the simplest, more direct, and also the most effective.Ye Yuan knew that once this wayward la.s.s lost it, she would go completely wild. If he really provoked her, she might just stab him again.He still intended on keeping this useful body to take revenge and did not want to die so dubiously.\"Fine! You win!\" Ye Yuan exclaimed helplessly.This was the first time Feng Zhirou had gotten back at Ye Yuan. She felt like she was cleared of all anxieties and flashed a gloating smile.As expected, this move worked well!Ye Yuan transmitted his voice helplessly, \"Is the cultivation law you are training in being of extreme yang and masculine?\"\"En? How do you know that?\" Feng Zhirou questioned in surprise.\"As expected! A girl training some extreme yang and masculine cultivation law? What an idiot!\" Ye Yuan was filled with disdain.\"Hey! Can't something nice come out of your mouth?\"\"That will have to depend on who I'm talking to! To a moron like you, I will be letting you down if I don't scold you! Women are inherently gentle yin, originally already in conflict with extreme yang and masculine cultivation laws. Yet, you actually chose an extreme yang cultivation law. If this isn't moronic, then what is?\"\"Humph! So what?\"\"Do you want to say that you are still top three on the Martial Roll of Honor?\" Ye Yuan mercilessly interrupted Feng Zhirou's bragging and gave a cold smile as he continued saying, \"Currently, you can still compete with Senior Apprentice Brother Long and the rest because your cultivation law is extremely high-level, and not because of your cultivation realm. Just wait and see the difference between you, Senior Apprentice Brother Long, and the rest after ten years! Other people develop their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. But you develop your weaknesses and avoid your strengths. Wouldn't you say that you are a moron?\"\"Hey! Do you believe that I will kill you if you scold me a moron again?!\"\"Moron! Moron! Moron! Important things need to be said thrice! Kill me then! If you kill me, then you can forget about breaking through the Spirit Condensation Realm for the rest of your life!\" Ye Yuan also lost his temper as he snapped back coldly.\"Humph! It will be strange if I believe you! Even if the cultivation law that I train isn't suitable, what does it have to do with pa.s.sing the alchemist test?\" When Ye Yuan's temper flared up, Feng Zhirou backed off instead.\"This world is nothing more than yin and yang. A divine soul that has the yin-attribute requires nourishment from freezing yin qi. Yet, you cultivate extreme yang laws instead. So your body produced all masculine yang qi. The masculine yang qi is suppressing the growth of your soul strength. Even if you eat Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pills like beans, the growth of your soul strength would be very limited.\"Feng Zhirou was furious at first, but after Ye Yuan said so, she started thinking about it.Ye Yuan continued explaining, \"Right now, your soul strength barely reached the level of a low-rank Alchemy Master, but the success rate of refinement is extremely low, so it's very hard to pa.s.s the test. If you continue cultivating like this, the yang qi in your body will acc.u.mulate even more, and the suppression of your divine soul will be even more obvious. Then you can forget about advancing and becoming an Alchemy Master for the rest of your life!\"\"Humph! You're just trying to scare me! Do you think you can trick me with just a few words?\" Although she already believed most of it in her heart, Feng Zhirou remained stubborn.\"Is that so? If I'm not wrong, is your cultivation currently getting increasingly slower? Every day at noon, do you feel uncomfortable throughout your body, your Dantian burning hot, and a swelling pain around your temple? If you feel that I'm just trying to scare you, then just treat it like I never said anything.\"Ye Yuan's casual words made Feng Zhirou feel ice-cold. What Ye Yuan said was completely right. In the past, her cultivation was a lot faster than those in the same age group. But ever since breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, her cultivation speed suddenly fell. Now, it was not even two-thirds of the original speed.Every day at noon, Feng Zhirou's entire body would always be uncomfortable. The symptoms were exactly the same as Ye Yuan described.Could it be that it was really as Ye Yuan described? Did she choose the wrong cultivation law?\"Y-you are talking rubbis.h.!.+\" Feng Zhirou's eyes became vacant. But her pride which was present since the start made her refuse to admit her mistake.\"Actually, it's not irreparable. At least, there's a method of letting you pa.s.s the test today.\"\"What method?\" The moment the words came out of her mouth, Feng Zhirou regretted it. Was this not equivalent to admitting that Ye Yuan had already convinced her?\"When you are refining later, suppress your essence energy to the First Level Spirit Condensation Realm, and at the same time eat a Soul Nouris.h.i.+ng Pill. You should be able to refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill. But don't force yourself. Just refine some of the easier medicinal pills.\"Ye Yuan did not fuss over the details. He believed that this la.s.s will be troubled for some time after this conversation and would not have the time or energy to compete with him. So he just told her the method directly.\"Will that . . . really work?\"\"I already told you the method. Whether you believe or not is up to you,\" Ye Yuan replied indifferently.Meanwhile, Wan Yuan walked out of the pill refinement room with a swagger.Wan Yuan's performance today was exceptional, and he surpa.s.sed his usual standard when completing the pill refinement!\"Hahaha! Honorable Nephew has indeed surpa.s.sed your predecessor! I can see that your alchemy skills already have some of your father's charm. The medicinal pill refined this time is probably at least a high-grade medicinal pill? Quickly bring it here for this old man to see!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu laughed heartily.Currently, an examiner already presented the medicinal pill. Wan Yuan gave w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming a bow as he said respectfully, \"Many thanks for the praise, Chairman w.a.n.g. What this junior refined this time is the Omen Breaking Pill. And luckily, I pa.s.sed.\"Even though his words were modest, the arrogance between his brows could not be concealed no matter what.However, the way other people saw it, Wan Yuan had the capital to be arrogant.w.a.n.g Jinfu took the medicinal pill to have a look, and his face involuntarily changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let me see. En? It's true! Although the Omen Breaking Pill is in the same rank as the Profound Clarity Pill and the Fierce Tiger Pill, the refinement difficulty is much greater! Honorable Nephew Wan is truly remarkable to be able to refine a quasi-superior-grade.\" Sun Jianming took a look at the pill, and it was undeniably a quasi-superior-grade Omen Breaking Pill.Looking at the amazement on w.a.n.g Jinfu's and Sun Jianming's faces, Wan Yuan suddenly felt a sense of pride.\"This Little Nephew was lucky. I didn't expect that I could actually refine a quasi-superior-grade pill today.\" Wan Yuan's words were modest, but the smile on his face could not be concealed no matter what. His way of addressing also changed from 'Junior' to 'Little Nephew.'w.a.n.g Jinfu looked at Wan Yuan thoughtfully and sighed. \"Honorable Nephew is too modest. Your alchemy skills are most likely number one among the younger generation in the State of Qin. If not for the fact that you are Old Brother Wan's son, this old man even wants to take you in as a disciple!\"Wan Yuan's heart shook with excitement. It was definitely highly beneficial to receive the acknowledgment of the Alchemist a.s.sociation's Deputy Chairman.The Alchemist a.s.sociation had always been a transcendent existence that could not be controlled by any influence.It was precisely so that everyone wished to strike up good relations with them. If he were accepted to be w.a.n.g Jinfu's disciple, then the Wan Family would have found a powerful backer from now on!It was true that Wan Donghai was impressive. But in the end, he was only a businessman, a rootless weed.Although the Drunken Star Manor was huge, it faced too many restrictions within the capital. If they managed to scale up this big tree called the Alchemist a.s.sociation, then would it not be simple to destroy the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion?Imagining this, Wan Yuan no longer hesitated. Bowing towards w.a.n.g Jinfu, he said, \"My father would frequently mention the two Lord Chairmen at home and is full of admiration towards both Lords. If my father were to know that I could acknowledge Lord Chairman as my master, he would be very pleased.\"w.a.n.g Jinfu chortled and said, \"But what a pity. I've already accepted Feng-er as my last disciple. Furthermore, you are a member of the academy. It isn't convenient for you to acknowledge other masters. However, there is no harm in taking you in as an in-name disciple. Are you willing?\"The first half of the sentence disappointed Wan Yuan greatly, but the second half made him overjoyed. w.a.n.g Jinfu's arrangement was indeed in consideration of taking him in as his disciple!A member of the Dan Wu Academy was the equivalent of a member of the Tranquil Cloud Sect. Acknowledging other masters would naturally be inappropriate, but an in-name disciple would not be an issue.Wan Yuan kowtowed. \"Disciple Wan Yuan pays respect to Master!\"w.a.n.g Jinfu stroked his beard as he smiled and accepted it calmly. \"Good, good. You and I are only master and disciple in name, so there isn't a need to stand on ceremony. Get up. The two of us had better not delay other people's tests. We will talk about this matter after the test.\"Anyone could tell that w.a.n.g Jinfu was highly pleased with this in-name disciple.Feng Ruoqing by the side furrowed her brows instead.It was not that she was unhappy with Wan Yuan acknowledging a master. In reality, there were many students like that in the Dan Wu Academy. However, Wan Yuan's background was too sensitive.As a member of the Imperial Family, Feng Ruoqing naturally had a different sensitivity to Wan Yuan acknowledging a master.The Wan Family and the Su Family had been in collusion all this while. They dominated over half of the State of Qin's medicinal pills and medicinal herbs businesses. The Imperial Family was apparently concerned about this, so they tacitly approved of the Ye Family's rise.But now that Wan Yuan was taken in by w.a.n.g Jinfu, this would mean that the Wan Family had struck up a relations.h.i.+p with the Alchemist a.s.sociation!The influence of the Alchemist a.s.sociation was even greater than the Tranquil Cloud Sect. Their branches spanned every corner of the continent. One could say that as long as a place had people living there, there would be an Alchemist a.s.sociation.To the Imperial Family, they had to be on guard now that the Wan Family was in league with this giant!\"The Alchemy Master test is starting now. Partic.i.p.ants, enter the herbal warehouse,\" the examiner called out.Ye Yuan was about to move when Wan Yuan walked in front of him smilingly. \"Ye Yuan, I advise you to not go out there and disgrace yourself. Master is a respected figure who isn't willing to dispute with a junior like you, so you should have a sense of propriety. You have never been in contact with alchemy since young. If you mess up later, you are not only going to lose face, even Teacher Feng and the Dan Wu Academy's people will be thoroughly disgraced.\"\"What? He doesn't know alchemy?!\" When w.a.n.g Jinfu heard that, he immediately blew his top.\"Master, I can be considered to have grown up together with Ye Yuan, but I was never aware that he knew alchemy. Although I don't know how he managed to sneak in, I'm afraid that he will make us all lose face. That's why I decided to speak up.\" Wan Yuan faked compa.s.sion as he explained.\"Ye Yuan, are you challenging this old man's patience?!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu snarled.Ye Yuan ignored w.a.n.g Jinfu and looked at Wan Yuan instead, smiling as he said, \"Read my lips.\"\"What?\" Wan Yuan was stunned for a moment and did not react in time.\"I~~~diot~~~\" Ye Yuan did not make a sound but mouthed the word exaggeratedly.Even though the audience did not hear anything, even a moron could see what Ye Yuan was mouthing.It was just that with this, the formerly tense atmosphere became a little weird. Everyone fought hard to hold back their laughter.\"Ye Yuan, I'm doing this for your own good! Don't be ungrateful!\" Wan Yuan burst out furiously.\"I'm really astonished by your idiocy! Who within the capital and the Dan Wu Academy aren't aware that you were at loggerheads with me since young? Now, you're saying that you're doing this for my own good? Do you think everyone is as stupid as you?\" Ye Yuan sighed helplessly.Wan Yuan did not expect Ye Yuan would lose all decorum with him right here. Being said like this, he was foolish enough to astonish everyone.\"Don't change the subject, Ye Yuan! Right now, I'm talking about whether you know alchemy or not. You are wasting the two chairmen's precious time!\" Wan Yuan did not lose himself in anger and managed to retort.Ye Yuan shook his head and sighed. \"Sorry, I insulted the word 'idiot' just now.\"\"Pffft!\" This time around, the audience could not hold back their laughter anymore. Especially Feng Zhirou, who convulsed in laughter exaggeratedly.Wan Yuan's face turned purple as he roared, \"Don't talk nonsense, Ye Yuan!\"\"Fine then. Someone who's even less than an idiot like you won't give up unless I make it clear. You said that you grew up together with me and was never aware that I knew alchemy? Don't tell me that you stalk me 24 hours a day? Do you follow me when I'm eating, sleeping, and on the loo? Or should I report to you when I'm learning alchemy? Yes, you have an Alchemy Grandmaster for a father. But I also have an Alchemy Grandmaster for a father! Why should you know alchemy, but I can't? You even incited the two chairmen to be your hired thugs to put me to death. Your intentions are so sinister! Oops. My bad. I accidentally revealed your true purpose. Sorry!\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Ye Yuan even bowed towards Wan Yuan mockingly, making the audience burst into laughter once again.With what Ye Yuan said, it was like yellow dirt had fallen into Wan Yuan's pants. Even if it was not s.h.i.+t, it became s.h.i.+t.Wan Yuan turned to look at w.a.n.g Jinfu. As expected, his face became sullen. Wan Yuan hurriedly explained, \"Master, don't listen to his nonsense! There's no such thing! He's trying to s.h.i.+ft the blame to me. Why would I make use of Master? Whether he knows alchemy or not, it will be clear once he enters the refining room!\"For a moment, w.a.n.g Jinfu was unable to tell if what Ye Yuan said was true or false, so he said, \"Fine. I will let you try!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want to see just what kind of Tier 2 medicinal pill can you refine! At that time, you had better not bring a pile of herbal dregs to serve as a stopgap!\"Wan Yuan wanted to embarra.s.s Ye Yuan, but he did not expect to throw himself in.However, he did not believe that Ye Yuan could refine any medicinal pill. Even if he really knew alchemy, it was impossible for him to refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill.As long as Ye Yuan could not refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill, then everything was good.At that time, could Ye Yuan even walk out of the Alchemist a.s.sociation's gates in one piece with him fanning the fire by the side?\"You'd better worry about your own intelligence first. Don't worry about my matters.\"Ending with those words, Ye Yuan directly ignored Wan Yuan and headed to the herbal warehouse.When he pa.s.sed by Feng Ruoqing, he suddenly flashed a smile and transmitted his voice, \"In a while, watch properly and don't blink!\"Feng Ruoqing's face twitched as she looked bewilderedly at Ye Yuan. But Ye Yuan had already entered the herbal warehouse.Could it be that he's going to use the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique? That's why he asked me to pay attention? He really knows the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?Initially, Feng Ruoqing thought that there had to be a powerful alchemy master behind Ye Yuan. That was why Ye Yuan possessed such immensely profound theoretical knowledge.However, the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique required extreme amounts of practice to learn. It was impossible without two to three years. As for mastering it completely, the time required was even longer. Even five years were considered short.But Ye Yuan was only 15 years old. Could it be that he started learning when he was 10 years old? But Ye Yuan most likely had not even stepped onto the martial path back then. Where would he have the support of essence energy?Thinking for a long time, Feng Ruoqing still could not figure it out, so she just let it go.When Feng Ruoqing came around, she realized that the atmosphere was not quite right. Everyone stared fixedly at the light curtain with unusual eyes.\"What's Ye Yuan doing? Is he choosing herbs haphazardly to refine randomly later?\"Wan Yuan watched the light screen with a cold smile. \"I said that he doesn't know anything, right? Just look. He doesn't even look and simply grabs a bunch of herbs completely indiscriminately as he goes. Who chooses herbs like that?\"\"That's right. Isn't this making fun of us? Many of the herbs in the herbal warehouse look almost the same. It's impossible to tell the difference without inspecting it closely. He's being too casual!\"At their seat, the faces of w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming did not look too good.They obviously knew that there were many herbs inside the herbal warehouse meant to confuse the public. This was to test the visual judgment of the alchemist.However, Ye Yuan's performance was too amateurish, giving them the feeling that they were being fooled.Looking at Ye Yuan's performance, Wan Yuan was secretly even more certain that Ye Yuan did not know alchemy.Observing the faces of the two leaders, he felt elated.Y e Yuan, since you are courting death yourself, then you can't blame me! Today, even if Ye Hang came here, he also can't save you! Wan Yuan laughed coldly in his heart.\"Miss Feng, this old man doesn't want to speak out of turn, but does he really know alchemy?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu could not resist questioning.Only Feng Ruoqing was aware of Ye Yuan's ability in this place, so she did not find it unusual.\"Lord Chairman, please look on patiently. Since the test has already started, just let Ye Yuan finish. If he really poked a hole in any basket, then I, Feng Ruoqing, will shoulder it!\"Although Feng Ruoqing spoke respectfully, she was firmly defensive of Ye Yuan.w.a.n.g Jinfu had some understanding of Feng Ruoqing and knew that she was a reserved person all along. He did not understand why she was accompanying a junior to mess around today.\"Miss Feng's abilities are already nearing a high-rank Alchemy Master. Can't you differentiate between a rookie and an expert? As long as you watch Ye Yuan choose his herbs, you'll be able to tell that he's a complete layman. Must Miss Feng continue to go along with his nonsense?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu frowned as he said this.Feng Ruoqing's ident.i.ty was special. In the future, she could possibly become another Alchemy Grandmaster in the Imperial family.Although the Alchemist a.s.sociation did not fear the Imperial Family, this State of Qin was ultimately the Imperial Family's territory. Unless they had no other alternatives, both parties naturally would not lose all decorum. Hence, w.a.n.g Jinfu continued to endure when speaking to Feng Ruoqing.But Feng Ruoqing just smiled and said, \"I still have those same words. Why don't Chairman w.a.n.g watch finish patiently? Perhaps it wouldn't disappoint you? Sometimes, what you see with your own eyes might not be true.\"Seeing Feng Ruoqing remain firm, he was also displeased. He wanted to see just what Ye Yuan could do. Since he had already made it clear that if Ye Yuan really dared to mess with the Alchemist a.s.sociation, then even if he was beaten to death, there was nothing that Feng Ruoqing could say.\"Look, guys! Ye Yuan's out!\"\"I-isn't this too fast?\"\"Isn't he a complete amateur?\"\"That's right. He came out after walking one round inside.\"\"You guys, look. He's carrying so little herbs. Most likely, there's only enough quant.i.ty for one refinement?\"\"Does he think that it's hopeless and is acting recklessly? Or is he extremely confident in himself?\"\"Bulls.h.i.+t. Of course, he thinks that it's hopeless and he's acting recklessly! Even an Alchemy Grandmaster wouldn't dare to guarantee that he could refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill each time. Don't tell me that Ye Yuan is so monstrous that his alchemy success rate is 100%?\"Ye Yuan's actions incurred a round of vicious words. But he could not hear them. Of course, even if he heard it, he would just treat it like a fart.Entering the pill refinement room, Ye Yuan threw the herbs casually onto the workstation and split the herbs evenly into two sets before starting the refinement of the medicinal essence right away. Even the process of preparing the herbs was forgone.Not even 30 minutes had pa.s.sed from choosing the herbs until now. His actions caused another huge commotion.In the hall, regardless of both students and alchemists from the Alchemist a.s.sociation, they all exchanged looks.\"I-is this Ye Yuan here to be a joke? Even if he only prepared one set of ingredients for the sake of posturing, was there a need to skip weighing and preparation of the herbs? How is he certain of the quant.i.ty of each herb?\"Another person looked at him like he was an idiot. \"You still have hopes that Ye Yuan could refine a medicinal pill even now? This fellow is a complete amateur who doesn't know anything at all! He's here solely for laughs!\"\"Look, guys. the ingredients that he chose was only enough for one portion, but he split the herbs into two halves. Half the quant.i.ty isn't even enough to refine a single medicinal pill!\"\"Hehe. This Ye Yuan is really b.a.l.l.sy. He actually dares to mess with the two chairmen. Is he courting death?\"Wan Yuan smiled coldly and said, \"I already said that he was all talk. To think that he really made everyone run around in circles. I want to see just how he intends to wrap up the situation later!\"Following which, Wan Yuan looked towards w.a.n.g Jinfu to check out what kind of expression he had.However, Wan Yuan did not see the expression he was looking forward to on w.a.n.g Jinfu's face.Suspicion was written all over w.a.n.g Jinfu's face. \"Old Sun, do you think that Ye Yuan this punk is about to use the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?\"Sun Jianming's expression was about the same as w.a.n.g Jinfu's. \"Theoretically speaking, splitting the ingredients equally into two parts is the approach to the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. But he . . .\"w.a.n.g Jinfu shook his head. \"I also think that it isn't likely. How old is this punk? How could he know the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?\"\"No need to guess anymore, Lord Chairmen. What Ye Yuan is about to use is precisely the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique!\"Right then, Feng Ruoqing's confident voice was heard.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:Are you ready for TGIF?? :PThis is not the TGIF chapter, but the first chapter for Friday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could he possibly know how to use the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique?\"Preparing herbs was something deeply ingrained in alchemists. Even w.a.n.g Jinfu who was an Alchemy Grandmaster would not skip it. 1After all, it was impossible to comprehend how an Alchemy Emperor refined pills with his realm. 2Hence, in w.a.n.g Jinfu's heart, Ye Yuan had long been determined to be a layman.\"Whether he knows it or not, just continue watching, and you will see. Honestly speaking, even I am looking forward to it!\" Feng Ruoqing said with a smile.w.a.n.g Jinfu and co's conversation reached everyone's ears. The students started gossiping among themselves.\"Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique? What the h.e.l.l is that?\"\"No clue. Never heard of it before.\"\"I'm also confused now. Is Ye Yuan the real deal or is he misleading us?\"\"Should be misleading? After all, he doesn't even know how to prepare the herbs.\"\"En, en. I think so too.\"Other people did not know about the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique, but Wan Yuan knew. It was exactly because he knew that caused Wan Yuan's disdain grew even greater.Although the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was very powerful, it was extremely difficult to train. He was all too clear on Ye Yuan's capabilities. How could he possibly know this?Most likely Ye Yuan saw it on some obscure books or records, and then he purposely took it out now to please the crowd by trying to impress them.Within the refining room, Ye Yuan swiftly completed the refinement of the medicinal essence. Next, was to open the furnace to refine pills.Similar to that day when he was a.s.sistant to Feng Ruoqing, Ye Yuan formed seals with both hands, and the flame obediently split into two parts to scorch the pill cauldron uniformly.Finis.h.i.+ng the preparation work, Ye Yuan waved a hand, and the medicinal essences flew into the pill cauldron.Meanwhile, Ye Yuan's hands were like flood dragons out in the sea. His left hand formed seals, and his right hand did so too as he controlled the two portions of medicinal essences.The entire process was not quick, but it was not sloppy at all.The essence of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was synchronization! Just based on this point, Ye Yuan's refinement since the start had been impeccable.Outside the refining room in the hall, Ye Yuan's refinement finally dispelled everyone's suspicions towards him.Ye Yuan really knew alchemy!It was just that . . . it was not easy to judge how high his standard was.\"I didn't think that this rascal really knows alchemy. It's just, why are his movements so slow? Could it be that he isn't familiar with the seals?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu was baffled.\"The Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique has seven by seven, 49 Yang Seals, and seven by seven, 49 Yin Seals. Each of them is supremely complex. Back then, I also tried to learn the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. But in the end, I failed. Ye Yuan has been on point since the first seal until now. I also can't see any areas where he's unfamiliar with. Logically speaking, it should be utilized proficiently. I also don't understand why he's so slow. Miss Feng, what do you think?\"Sun Jianming seemed to be rather familiar with the Yin-Yang Separation Flow technique. Most likely, he spent a great deal of time researching it in his youth.Feng Ruoqing had been staring unblinkingly at Ye Yuan's hands since the beginning. She knew the first 21 seals of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique by heart. Currently, the seals Ye Yuan executed were like playing it in slow motion for her to see.\"Could it be that he's specifically displaying it for me to see?\" Feng Zhirou quickly rejected this thought.The Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique was incomparably complicated. If he continued like this, the medicinal pills would definitely be ruined. Even if Ye Yuan were really at the level of an Alchemy King, it would be impossible to save it.Noticing that Sun Jianming questioned her, Feng Ruoqing also shook her head bitterly. \"I also don't know.\"\"En? The first pair of seals is completed. But isn't this speed too slow? At this rate, the medicinal pill can't even condense. The result will surely be a useless pill,\" w.a.n.g Jinfu said.Ye Yuan started to execute the second pair of seals. The two sets of medicinal essences jumped joyously about in the pill cauldron one after another; akin to fish frolicking.\"En? Old w.a.n.g, do you feel that the speed of Ye Yuan's seals is increasing?\" halfway through the second pair of seals, Sun Jianming suddenly asked.\"Is that so? I didn't notice it. It's still so slow! But Old Sun, did you notice that even though Ye Yuan's actions are very slow, the medicinal essences don't have any signs of dissipating?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu also seemed to have discovered something unusual.In reality, when alchemists were refining pills, most would finish things quickly in order to maintain the shape of the medicinal essence.It was just like a single log bridge. If you charge across in one breath, you would be able to properly grasp the direction and balance, so as to not fall down. But if you crossed it slowly, it would be easy to lose your center of gravity and then fell down.However, Ye Yuan's refining was the opposite. He clearly decreased the speed, but each step was very stable. There were no instances where the center of gravity was off.Sun Jianming took a look and was involuntarily astounded. \"It's true! Could it be that Ye Yuan already trained the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique to an extraordinarily high realm? Hence, he deliberately slowed down to allow for the various herbs in the medicinal essence to fuse better? But . . . is this possible?\"Right when the two were debating, Ye Yuan's seals had already progressed to the third pair.\"It's not right. It looks like it sped up again!\" Sun Jianming exclaimed.\"En. Now that you said it, it really looks like it's a little faster than at the start. He's increasing his speed!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu also discovered the change in Ye Yuan's hand speed.\"Don't tell me . . . he plans to keep increasing speed like this?\"Sun Jianming and w.a.n.g Jinfu exchanged glances and saw the astonishment in each other's eyes.Next was the fourth pair of seals.The fifth pair, sixth pair, seventh pair . . .Ye Yuan's seal forming speed became increasingly faster and even more elusive.In the beginning, everyone's eyes could follow Ye Yuan's speed. But towards the end, they could only see a blur.Ye Yuan's refinement gave people the feeling that he was using his fingertips to dance, dreamlike and mystical.Sun Jianming and w.a.n.g Jinfu no longer discussed Ye Yuan's seals. They were completely drunk on Ye Yuan's refinement and were not able to extricate themselves.At this moment, their hearts seemed to quiver along with Ye Yuan's hands, becoming excited. Their blood even felt like it was boiling towards the end.In this place, Sun Jianming's and w.a.n.g Jinfu's skill was the highest. But even they were completely immersed in it and unable to extricate themselves; let alone the others.Even Ye Yuan's enemy, Wan Yuan, was currently lost in it.Sun Jianming and w.a.n.g Jinfu were wholly enraptured as if they were brought into another realm. And this realm was a world that they had never heard of before in their entire lives.\"Yin-Yang! Combine!\" Just as that feeling reached its peak, Ye Yuan gave a low cry and suddenly placed his palms together, resulting in the two half portion medicinal pills, which had already taken shape, gathered in the center. A beam of white light shot out from the pill cauldron, blinding everyone's eyes.Sun Jianming and w.a.n.g Jinfu were abruptly woken. The two exchanged looks once again and saw an inexplicable feeling from the other party's eyes.The entire hall was silent. The students had not woken up from their stupor yet.Right then, the door of the refining room belonging to Ye Yuan opened, and Ye Yuan walked out slowly.Bean-sized sweat drops covered his forehead. It was evident that refining a Tier 2 medicinal pill was still too strenuous for him.\"The medicinal pill is already refined. This Little Lord is tired to death. I'm going back to rest first. You have to tell me later whether I pa.s.s or not!\"After he said that, Ye Yuan strode out, leaving behind the dumbfounded crowd.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:Check out note 1 and note 2 in this chapter.

When he recovered, Ye Yuan was already gone.Sun Jianming took a deep breath and sighed. \"If he doesn't leave, then what? His essence energy is already exhausted. If he doesn't recuperate in time, it might leave behind hidden dangers. Even though he managed to refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill using his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation, it was still overly forceful. It would be a pity for such a figure to leave behind hidden dangers because of a single refinement.\"\"Sigh. So what if it was forceful. He already has the strength to refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill. What's lacking is only the acc.u.mulation of essence energy.\" w.a.n.g Jinfu's words still contained deep shock.Sun Jinfu nodded in agreement.However, he suddenly became agitated. Trembling, he said, \"A miracle! Ye Yuan's refinement just now was simply a miracle!\"\"That's right. It was truly a miracle! Could it be that Ye Yuan's Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique had already reached that legendary stage?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu wondered.\"It's definitely the Legendary Realm! A Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm refining pills managed to affect even the mental states of us both. It's impossible to not be the legendary stage!\" Sun Jianming said in agreement.The various refinement techniques in alchemy had fundamental similarities with martial techniques. It was just that alchemy techniques did not possess attack power.However, refinement techniques were differentiated into five realms based on the level of mastery. They were namely: entry stage, small success stage, large success stage, great circle stage, and legendary stage!The distinction between realms was pretty much the same as martial techniques. The only difference was in the fifth stage's name.One was the breaking illusion stage, while the other was the legendary stage.The difference also showed the fundamentally distinct goals between martial techniques and alchemy techniques.Martial techniques pursued extreme destructive powers. What was necessary was breaking shackles and surpa.s.sing limits. Hence the name, breaking illusion.On the other hand, alchemy techniques pursued a type of boundless creation power. Endless possibilities lay hidden inside a tiny, tiny medicinal pill, and what alchemy methods chased after was the creation of even more possibilities. Hence the name, legendary.The moment one's alchemy technique stepped into the legendary stage, the refined medicinal pills would produce limitless possibilities and often would also increase the medicinal efficacy multiple times.An alchemy technique at the legendary stage could even bestow additional attributes onto the medicinal pill and yield unexpected results.w.a.n.g Jinfu seemed to recall something and suddenly bellowed, \"What are you still standing there for? Quickly go and 'invite' out the medicinal pill Ye Yuan refined!\"When w.a.n.g Jinfu spoke, he subconsciously used the word 'invite.'The Alchemy Master at the side only came to a realization now and rushed over to retrieve the medicinal pill.Meanwhile, Wan Yuan's face took on a grim expression. In his heart, he felt inexplicable shock and a strong sense of shame.He knew that the relations.h.i.+p he just struck up with w.a.n.g Jinfu was gone now. It was already impossible for w.a.n.g Jinfu to acknowledge him as a disciple.Things would be fine if Ye Yuan did not know alchemy. Taking advantage of w.a.n.g Jinfu's rotten mood from being messed with, he could 'throw dirty water' with all his might by the side.But now, Ye Yuan and his conflict already came out into the open. w.a.n.g Jinfu would most likely not have any good impression towards Wan Yuan as long as he slightly recalled Ye Yuan's words.What made Wan Yuan feel even more ashamed was that he was actually lost in that mysterious feeling brought by Ye Yuan and could not extricate himself. This showed that his Alchemy Dao was much more inferior to Ye Yuan's.How did this happen?A month ago, Ye Yuan was clearly still a good-for-nothing. Now, not only did he achieve dazzling results in the Martial Path, his Alchemy Dao standard broke the general knowledge, and he completed an impossible task.In this short while, Ye Yuan's medicinal pill had already been carefully brought out on a jade tray by an Alchemy Master. A fire-red pill appeared in front of everyone.\"This is . . . a low Tier 2 Strengthening Pill?\" Sniffing the overwhelming medicinal aroma, w.a.n.g Jinfu quickly identified the medicinal pill.\"That's right. It's really the Strengthening Pill! A transcendent-grade Strengthening Pill!\" Sun Jianming said with a grave expression.The Strengthening Pill was a very low-level medicinal pill which was frequently used by bottom-tier martial artists.The use of the Strengthening Pill was to increase the power in a particular area of the body. It was a medicinal pill that allowed a partial part of a martial artist's body to exceed their existing strength.Tier 1 Strengthening Pills were highly popular among demonic beast hunters as it could often help them defeat demonic beasts that were slightly stronger than them.It was very low-level but very practical.On the other hand, Tier 2 Strengthening Pills were not as popular as Tier 1's. This was because Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists were much wealthier than Essence Qi Realm martial artists. They were also much stronger so they could afford higher level medicinal pills.The difference between each minor cultivation realm after the Spirit Condensation Realm was huge. Even if one used a Tier 2 Strengthening Pill to partially increase their strength, the effects were severely limited. That was because the level of the medicinal pill was too low; barely reaching the level of low Tier 2.Hence, the position of Tier 2 Strengthening Pills became very awkward.But no matter what, a Tier 2 Strengthening Pill was a Tier 2 Strengthening Pill; it was a genuine Tier 2 medicinal pill. n.o.body was able to refute it.Of course, n.o.body would go and dispute it right now. Everyone was sizing up this medicinal pill curiously.w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming exchanged glances. w.a.n.g Jinfu opened his mouth and said, \"Old Sun, what are you thinking now?\"\"The same as you,\" Sun Jianming replied.\"Then . . . try it?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu asked uncertainly.But Sun Jianming shook his head instead. \"This medicinal pill was refined by Ye Yuan. According to the a.s.sociation's rules, this medicinal pill belongs to him. We don't have the right to test it.\"Currently, w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming felt like their hearts were being scratched by cats. They were highly curious about the medicinal effects of this transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill.However, the partic.i.p.ants who came to take part in the Alchemist a.s.sociation's test had already paid the test fees. Hence, the medicinal pills refined naturally belonged to them.Dan Wu Academy had already paid the test fees for their students. Both w.a.n.g and Sun obviously could not casually test the medicinal pill.w.a.n.g Jinfu suddenly recalled something. Slapping his thighs, he exclaimed, \"Miss Feng . . .\"Halfway through his sentence, he stopped abruptly. That was because when he turned his head, he found out that Feng Ruoqing currently had her eyes shut, and she had entered a strange state.\"Sudden enlightenment!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu sucked in a cold breath.No wonder he did not hear Feng Ruoqing speak until now. She had actually entered a sudden enlightenment state!\"Her soul strength is growing. She's about to break through!\" Sun Jianming clearly also noticed her peculiar state.'Everyone be quiet! Don't interrupt Miss Feng's breakthrough!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu said in a low voice.The test hall instantly quietened down. Everyone was focused on Feng Ruoqing's breakthrough.Feng Ruoqing had long held a studious mindset when watching Ye Yuan's Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. After Ye Yuan's refinement became dreamlike and mystical, she felt like she comprehended something. Following which she entered a state of sudden enlightenment.n.o.body here had more profound attainments than her in term of the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique. Also, n.o.body understood the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique better than her.Towards the end, Feng Ruoqing's divine soul and Ye Yuan's Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique developed a resonance, and under this resonance, her divine soul gradually grew stronger.Feng Ruoqing's soul strength was only a hair's breadth away from being a high-rank Alchemy Master. Relying on this resonance, she successfully crossed the threshold and finally became a high-rank Alchemy Master.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:TGIF!

Taking advantage of the sudden enlightenment to break through, not only did her soul strength broke through to the high-rank Alchemy Master realm, but her cultivation also broke through the Sixth Level Spirit Condensation Realm, directly rising to the Seventh Level Spirit Condensation Realm.Only after the essence energy in the hall recovered its tranquility did Feng Ruoqing slowly opened her eyes.\"Congratulations, Miss Feng, in advancing to high-rank Alchemy Master in one stroke!\"w.a.n.g Jinfu immediately went up to congratulate, and the others also came up to express their felicitations.Feng Ruoqing could breakthrough to high-rank Alchemy Master at such an age. In the future, it was basically a given for her to become an Alchemy Grandmaster.It was essential to be on friendly terms with a future State of Qin's major figure now.Except that while Feng Ruoqing returned the well-wishes perfunctorily, her eyes scanned the crowd, but in the end, she failed to find the person she was looking for.\"Many thanks for everyone's compliments. Ruoqing dare not accept it. For Ruoqing to be fortunate enough to breakthrough today, I still have to thank Ye Yuan. I wonder, where did he go?\" Feng Ruoqing asked in puzzlement.In the state of sudden enlightenment, Feng Ruoqing was completely dead to the outside world. She was still not aware that Ye Yuan had already left.\"Miss Feng, because Ye Yuan completely exhausted his essence energy to forcefully refine the Tier 2 Strengthening Pill, he went back to rest right after he exited the refining room,\" w.a.n.g Jinfu replied.Feng Ruoqing came to a realization. 'Then the medicinal pill he refined . . .?\"The moment she mentioned the medicinal pill, everyone's expressions became peculiar. Feng Ruoqing was baffled, but her heart jumped, and she asked anxiously, \"Don't tell me Ye Yuan failed? Impossible!\"\"Relax, Miss Feng. Of course, Ye Yuan pa.s.sed. It's just . . .\" w.a.n.g Jinfu found it hard speak up.In reality, it was somewhat impetuous to test the medicinal pill that other people refined. However, w.a.n.g Jinfu really wanted to know if this transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill had any special effects.\"It's just what?\" Feng Ruoqing asked curiously.w.a.n.g Jinfu sighed and said, \"I'm also not afraid that Miss Feng will laugh. Not only did that Ye Yuan refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill, but it was also a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill! His performance earlier was simply miraculous! So . . .\"Hearing w.a.n.g Jinfu said all that, Feng Ruoqing immediately understood in her heart.Transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill.These six words represented extraordinary significance in the State of Qin's alchemy world!Even a high-rank Alchemy Grandmaster could not refine a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill! Even if the medicinal pill was the lowest of the low Tier 2.Tier 2 medicinal pills and Tier 1 medicinal pills were two completely different concepts. The soul strength requirement was not high for Tier 1 medicinal pills. It was easier to refine in comparison.However, the complexity level of Tier 2 medicinal pills was several times, even dozens of times of Tier 1 medicinal pills!Because of that, a more powerful soul strength was necessary to advance to Alchemy Master.This gap also brought about a phenomenon. Tier 1 medicinal pills would occasionally come out as transcendent-grade. However, a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill had never appeared in the State of Qin before!Hence, w.a.n.g Jinfu really wanted to see just what effects this medicinal pill had.Seeing everyone look at her with expectant eyes, Feng Ruoqing obviously did not feel nice to reject. In reality, she was also curious just how mystical this so-called transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill was.Even if Feng Ruoqing was the only one who believed that Ye Yuan could refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill among this crowd, the shock that she currently felt was no less than the rest.Feng Ruoqing felt that it was extremely appropriate for w.a.n.g Jinfu to use the word 'miracle' to describe Ye Yuan's refinement just now.\"Since that's the case, then test it out.\"Hearing Feng Ruoqing said this, everyone let out a sigh of relief, and their eyes shone with antic.i.p.ation.\"Hahaha. I finally refined a Tier 2 medicinal pill! I'm also an Alchemy Master now!\"Right at this moment, a somewhat crazed laughter echoed out. The audience involuntarily turned to look, only to see Feng Zhirou.This made everyone recall that there were still two examinees who had not come out yet . . .Feng Zhirou caught sight of Feng Ruoqing and danced with joy. Rus.h.i.+ng in front of her, she shook her hands as she said, \"Aunt, I actually refined a Tier 2 medicinal pill! I didn't expect Ye Yuan that punk to really have a few tricks up his sleeves. He casually gave a few pointers, and I refined a Tier 2 medicinal pill. Now, I'm also an Alchemy Master!\"\"What? Ye Yuan gave you pointers?\" Feng Ruoqing asked in bewilderment.\"Yeah. He said that my cultivation law restricted my soul strength, so he told me not to refine with full strength. I followed his method and really refined a Tier 2 medicinal pill! Although what was refined is only the lowest Tier 2 medicinal pill, at least it succeeded! Yii? Where's Ye Yuan? Don't tell me he's not out yet?\" Feng Zhirou still had not sensed the unusual atmosphere and carried on talking by herself.Feng Ruoqing, w.a.n.g Jinfu, and Sun Jianming exchanged glances and saw the wordless shock in each other's eyes.Casually gave a few pointers and he could make Feng Zhirou advance to Alchemy Master?Just what kind of monster was this Ye Yuan?!. . . . . .Right now, the Alchemist a.s.sociation's training room was already packed with people.Two Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists stood in the center of the training room. They were the martial artists who would test this transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill.Testing a medicinal pill's effects was a highly dangerous matter. That was because n.o.body knew what kind of consequence would result from eating the medicinal pill.However, testing a very mature medicinal pill such as the Strengthening Pill would not be too dangerous. Furthermore, the medicinal effects of a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill would only make someone stronger. It naturally would not cause any harm to a martial artist's body.These two martial artists were decided after an intense debate. One was called Cheng Hua, while the other was called Zhu Qiang.Cheng Hua was at the First Level Spirit Condensation Realm, while Zhu Qiang was at the Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm. There was a difference of four minor cultivation realms between the two of them, which also meant a minor stage gap.This gap was huge.It was highly difficult to jump ranks and battle within the Spirit Condensation Realm. It was because the difference was very large even between one minor cultivation realm. Not to mention four minor cultivation realms.A Tier 2 Strengthening Pill, even if it was a high-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill, could not allow a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist to defeat a Second Level Spirit Condensation Realm even after the partial strengthening. Unless the Second Level Spirit Condensation Realm stood still there for him to hit.However, n.o.body had ever tried a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill's effects. Hence, as a precautionary measure, the powerful Zhu Qiang was chosen to be the sandbag to avoid accidental injuries.Zhu Qiang's mission was to stand there and take an attack head-on from Cheng Hua!Even so, Zhu Qiang did not feel that Cheng Hua could hurt him. The difference between them was not something that could be breached using medicinal pills!Even if it was a transcendent-grade medicinal pill!Under everyone's eyes, Cheng Hua consumed the transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill which Ye Yuan refined.Many people were envious of Cheng Hua. He was the first martial artist in the State of Qin to consume a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill!\"Haha. How's the feeling of eating a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill?\" Zhu Qiang asked with a laugh.Cheng Hua who initially had his eyes closed to sense the medicinal strength opened his eyes and flashed Zhu Qiang a smile. \"I feel am full of power! I'm attacking. Be careful, Brother Zhu!\"Zhu Qiang also gave a laugh as he said boldly, \"Come on. Even a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill can't compensate for the enormous difference in cultivation realms!\"Cheng Hua did not waste his breath and threw a punch.A single fist struck out, and then there was silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Clearly, he suffered internal injuries that were not light.Cheng Hua looked at his fist, and then looked at Zhu Qiang blankly.\"Did I really unleash that fist just now?\" Cheng Hua felt like he was dreaming.Just now, when the medicinal pill reached his stomach, he casually directed the medicinal strength into his right arm.Following which, he felt his right arm surged with a violent strength!This surging strength made him feel like he had to expend it.In accordance with the prior arrangement, Cheng Hua did not use any martial techniques. Just a simple punch. But this simple punch managed to injure a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm expert!\"Brother Zhu, a-are you ok?\" Cheng Hua did not have any intention of hurting anyone. But the fact was he had injured Zhu Qiang.\"S-still alright.\"Zhu Qiang did not expect the strengthened punch to be so incredibly powerful to actually injure him.Of course, this punch did not cause him any substantial injuries. After all, Cheng Hua did not use any martial technique, so this strength naturally was not fully unleashed.The defensive might of a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm was highly terrifying. Logically speaking, it was impossible for a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm to harm a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm, even if he ate medicinal pills.Yet now, Cheng Hua truly injured him!Currently, Zhu Qiang was terrified. Luckily just now, they stipulated not to use martial techniques. Otherwise, it would be hard to say if he could even stand up straight right now.Zhu Qiang did not underestimate him just because he was a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm. In fact, he already used the bulk of his essence energy to block.Cheng Hua injured him under this kind of circ.u.mstance.\"Quick! Let Zhu Qiang take this medicinal pill!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu was the first to react, and the first thing he did was to treat Zhu Qiang's injuries.\"A transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill is actually this horrifying. It actually allowed a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm to injure a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm!\" Sun Jianming muttered under his breath.This was his first time witnessing the might of a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill. That scene just now was too astonis.h.i.+ng.This was not some small-scale fight like back then with Ye Yuan and Fei Qingping. Cheng Hua and Zhu Qiang were both Spirit Condensation Realm experts. Wanting to jump ranks to battle was too hard.\"That's right. That's to say if a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm possessed such a transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill, they would be able to jump ranks to defeat a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm expert under specific conditions. As for Fourth Level Spirit Condensation Realm, there's virtually no chance of survival under that blow just now,\" Sun Jianming stated his a.n.a.lysis.After he finished speaking, Sun Jianming also jumped in fright at his a.n.a.lysis.w.a.n.g Jinfu sucked in a cold breath. \"If this sort of medicinal pills could be ma.s.s-produced, then wouldn't cultivation realms become a joke?\"It was true that even with this medicinal pill, it would be very challenging for a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm to defeat a Fourth Level Spirit Condensation Realm.The effects of the Strengthening Pill was only partial strengthening and would not increase the martial artist's overall strength.Theoretically, it could let him kill a Fourth Level Spirit Condensation Realm. However, the required conditions were too harsh. It was virtually impossible in actual combat.But even so, the significance of a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill was too great.That was because once someone consumed such a medicinal pill, it would be possible for a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm to jump ranks and challenge a Second Level Spirit Condensation Realm, or even a Third Level Spirit Condensation Realm. Furthermore, it would become a common sight.If that happened, cultivation would indeed become a joke. A person trained bitterly to advance one minor cultivation realm, and it was inferior to other people that ate a single medicinal pill.\"Don't joke around. How can this sort of medicinal pills be ma.s.s-produced? Our State of Qin has been established for so many years and hasn't only this one transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill appeared so far?\" Sun Jianming shook his head and said.w.a.n.g Jinfu thought the same as well. Ye Yuan was indeed monstrous, but it was most likely impossible to make him ma.s.s-produce transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pills.However, at this moment Feng Ruoqing voiced out, \"Both elders, don't forget, Ye Yuan is only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm right now!\"w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming trembled.That was right. Ye Yuan was only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. If he rose a few more minor cultivation realms, maybe even after crossing the threshold called Spirit Condensation Realm, would refining transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pills still be hard?Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique at the Legendary Realm lowered the soul strength requirement to the minimum.Even if Ye Yuan's soul strength after advancing to the Spirit Condensation Realm was insufficient to advance to Alchemy Master, would refining transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pills not be like playing for him?w.a.n.g Jinfu suddenly realized that Ye Yuan held extraordinary significance to the entire State of Qin. That was because in the entire State of Qin's alchemy world, only he alone could refine transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pills!w.a.n.g Jinfu's face suddenly turned icy. The aura of a Spirit Condensation Realm spread out, making everyone present feel tremendous pressure.\"All of you here listen up. n.o.body is allowed to go out and spread about the matter of Ye Yuan refining a transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pill today! Everyone swears a Heavenly Dao Oath right now. Chairman Sun and I will supervise you all! Of course, you can choose not to swear, but I can't guarantee that you'll be able to walk out of the Alchemist a.s.sociation!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu warned grimly.\"What? Heavenly Dao Oath? You want us to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath?! Based on what?!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu's words immediately drew some people's ire.Heavenly Dao Oath was different from ordinary oaths. Once a Heavenly Dao Oath was sworn, one could not violate it for life. Otherwise, the heavens would smite them dead.Regardless of whether in the Divine Realm or in the Lower Realms, n.o.body could go against a Heavenly Dao Oath!Wan Yuan was also present. Currently, he was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.He originally came here today wanting to show off. Who would have thought that all the limelight would be s.n.a.t.c.hed away by Ye Yuan alone!Wan Yuan did not expect that not only did Ye Yuan knew alchemy, but he was also even monstrous to such a degree!After watching the might of Cheng Hua's fist, he made the decision that he would definitely spread what happened today after he left. He believed that there would be many forces interested in Ye Yuan.But now, this plan fell through. w.a.n.g Jinfu actually forced everyone to swear a Heavenly Dao Oath!\"Zhu Qiang, Cheng Hua, the two of you lead everyone in swearing the Heavenly Dao Oath!\" w.a.n.g Jinfu commanded.\"Yes!\"These two people belonged to the Alchemist a.s.sociation from the start, so they obviously had to listen to w.a.n.g Jinfu's orders.\"M-master, do I have to swear too? I-I won't spread it!\" Gritting his teeth, Wan Yuan opened his mouth to ask.w.a.n.g Jinfu had long forgotten about this convenient disciple and did not expect him to jump out by himself now, so he said coldly, \"Even Feng-er and Keyun have to swear. Are you more special than them? Mmm?\"w.a.n.g Jinfu was a genuine Spirit Condensation Realm expert. Under his powerful pressure, Wan Yuan felt that his consciousness was about to collapse.\"I-I swear!\"Ye Yuan's words made w.a.n.g Jinfu come to realize the truth. He was already thoroughly disgusted with Wan Yuan. If not for w.a.n.g Donghai's face, he would definitely teach Wan Yuan a lesson.Just like that, under w.a.n.g Jinfu's coercion, everyone swore a Heavenly Dao Oath. Except himself, Sun Jianming, Feng Ruoqing, and Feng Zhirou.Even though everyone was furious about this arrangement, n.o.body dared to come forward.This was a world where the strong reigned supreme, and the Alchemist a.s.sociation was too strong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Except, it remained deserted like before.Feng San sat on a wooden armchair and held a book as he leisurely read.He was bored out of his mind these past few days. He worked in the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion for so many years, and it was always so busy that it made him dizzy. He constantly wanted to find time to relax.Now that he actually had free time, Feng San felt completely uncomfortable.His eyes were on the book, but his heart was not.What made Feng San curious was about Young Master Ye Yuan. Yesterday after he came back from the alchemist test, he was utterly exhausted. What medicinal pill did he refine to be so drained?What made him even more curious was that half-way through the night, Ye Yuan came out full of vigor. He even recovered most of his essence energy.Afterward, Young Master brought Lu-er back to the Dan Wu Academy that very night . . .Did Young Master get into trouble again, and returned to the academy to avoid a disaster?But Young Master went to the Alchemist a.s.sociation yesterday. He could not have turned the Alchemist a.s.sociation upside down, right?The more Feng San thought about it, the more he felt it was so. With Young Master's former personality, he could seriously do something like that.Did Young Master 'get well' for a few days, and went back to his old habits again?Just as Feng San's imagination was running wild, several old men entered the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion.Even though the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's business had become slow, there were still some people coming and going. After all, they conducted business fairly.Feng San did not pay any heed to the few people who came in and continued staring blankly at the book in his hands. There were naturally attendants to take care of these small matters.\"Are you the shopkeeper? The three of us wish to request an interview with Mister Ye Hang about something. Please pa.s.s the word,\" one of the old men said.Only then did Feng San gave him a glance lazily. But this glance made him jump in shock because the three stars on these three old men's chests were too blinding!Two of the old men had red color badges on their chest, while the three-star badge of the old man in the center was actually golden!Three Alchemy Grandmasters came here together!The Alchemist a.s.sociation would distinguish alchemists of the same star by using color. Blue as low-rank, red as middle-rank, and golden as high-rank!In the entire State of Qin, only one person possessed a golden badge. That person was the Alchemist a.s.sociation's Lord Chairman, Wu Daofeng!The ident.i.ties of the other two people were almost certainly Deputy Chairman w.a.n.g Jinfu and Deputy Chairman Sun Jianming!The three major heads with the greatest weight in the entire State of Qin's alchemy world came forth together. What major event happened?!Feng San hastily got up, went in front of the three to give a deep bow, and he asked respectfully, \"This lowly one welcomes the three Lords! May I ask why the three Lords are looking for the owner?\"\"Oh? You know who we are?\" w.a.n.g Jinfu felt very pleased with Feng San's att.i.tude.Feng San hurriedly said, \"You must be joking, my Lord. Even though this lowly one has never seen the three Lords, I still have some knowledge. Who could don those badges other than the three Lords?\"\"Haha. This Shopkeeper is indeed very considerate. No wonder Mister Ye Hang placed you in an important position. The three of us came here for Ye Yuan, and we wish to meet with your boss. Could you pa.s.s the message?\"w.a.n.g Jinfu was very courteous with his words, but Feng San's mind was blown!Recalling Ye Yuan's unusual action yesterday night, he immediately felt a chill down his spine.That rascal really acted up again!This time around, even Lord Wu Daofeng personally came to call him to account. Ye Yuan was poking a hole in the sky!Wu Daofeng had always been living a secluded life. Just how much trouble did that punk, Ye Yuan, cause to alarm this major figure!The Drunken Star Manor's issue already left them bruised and battered. Now, there was the Alchemist a.s.sociation. Did the heavens really want the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion to perish?Wu Daofeng kept quiet all this time. But seeing Feng San s.p.a.ce out, he could not help asking, \"Shopkeeper, is there any difficulty?\"Feng San recovered from his stupor, and then he pulled a long face and said, \"My apologies, three Lords. Our owner entered a death-seclusion a few days ago. I'm afraid . . . he won't be coming out soon.\"After saying that, Feng San's heart palpitated and could not resist sneaking a peek at Wu Daofeng. He discovered that the three of them exchanged glances, which revealed a deep disappointment.Feng San was a little curious. Looking at the three of them, it did not look like they were here to confront?But if they did not come to confront about something, then why did the three of them come together?Feng San was utterly baffled.\"Then . . . is your Young Master, Ye Yuan, around? We can also look for him!\" Right then, w.a.n.g Jinfu opened his mouth.Feng San felt a little guilty as he gave in. \"Three lords, Young Master returned to the academy yesterday night.\"The three people exchanged looks again. w.a.n.g Jinfu shook his head and sighed. \"Looks like that punk is intentionally hiding from us! How can that fellow, Jiang Yunhe, let Ye Yuan go after he returns to the academy?\"Wu Daofeng seemed to be pondering, but no one knew what he was thinking about either. After some time, he said, \"Shopkeeper, don't let your imagination run wild. We actually came here today to deliver Ye Yuan's badge. He pa.s.sed the Alchemist a.s.sociation's test yesterday. Since he's not around, then we will pa.s.s the badge to you. I have to trouble shopkeeper to personally go down and deliver this to Ye Yuan's hands.\"When Feng San heard deliver badge, he immediately relaxed. So Young Master really became promising, to have pa.s.sed the Alchemy Apprentice test. At least the owner had a successor now.However, he quickly grew suspicious again. It was just a badge. Why would it trouble the three major heads of the a.s.sociation to personally deliver it?Was delivering the badge a pretense and finding the owner to discuss a major matter was the actual intent instead?Thinking about it, there was only this possibility. After all, Ye Yuan was a junior. There was no way the three major heads would be dispatched.Although Ye Hang was not qualified yet, because of the Drunken Star Manor's Essence Gathering Pill, the entire situation in the capital had become abnormal. It was also understandable for these three major figures to come and find Ye Hang.After all, Ye Hang was also an Alchemy Grandmaster, an important figure in the capital.Connecting the dots, Feng San felt like he finally understood the other party's purpose of visit. He quickly said, \"No trouble, no trouble at all! To be of service for the three Lords is this lowly one's honor. I will go to the Dan Wu Academy right away and personally hand this badge over to Young Master.\"\"Jinfu, give the badge to the shopkeeper,\" Wu Daofeng said calmly.\"This . . . Why don't we go down personally? In case . . .\" w.a.n.g Jinfu did not take out the badge right away and was somewhat hesitant.\"No need. The a.s.sociation has never interfered with local affairs. We can't break this rule. With our status, it's not appropriate for us to appear at the Dan Wu Academy. Don't worry. In terms of alchemy, who can compare to the Alchemist a.s.sociation?\" Wu Daofeng said.w.a.n.g Jinfu's eyes lit up. \"Lord Chairman is still more foresighted. This old one understands.\"Finis.h.i.+ng his words, w.a.n.g Jinfu retrieved the badge, and then he handed it over to Feng San. He said, \"We have to trouble you, Shopkeeper. However, please don't reveal this matter of you delivering the badge. Although this matter can't be hidden for long, every moment counts.\"Feng San was confused. It was just an Alchemy Apprentice badge. Why were these lords taking it so seriously? Was this not blowing things out of proportion?However, when his two eyes landed on the badge in w.a.n.g Jinfu's hands, they became wide circles as his eyes were involuntarily glued to the badge.Only to see that two stars were sewn on that blue color badge!I-isn't this an Alchemy Master's badge?Was there a mistake?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You're saying that Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the Alchemy Master test with his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm strength?\"Jiang Yunhe had not lost his composure like this for a long time. But the news brought by Feng Ruoqing overwhelmed him.\"Yes. Not only did he pa.s.s the low-rank Alchemy Master test, he even refined a transcendent-grade Tier 2 Strengthening Pill during the test. Upon testing, a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm after consuming the pill would possess the strength to threaten a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm.\" Feng Ruoqing seemed like she would not give up until she shocked people to death with her words.\"Transcendent-grade . . . Tier 2 . . . medicinal pill? F-First Level Spirit Condensation Realm threatening a Fifth Level Spirit Condensation Realm?\"Jiang Yunhe's brain short-circuited. What Feng Ruoqing said had completely surpa.s.sed his understanding.Feng Ruoqing wanted to laugh watching Jiang Yunhe lose composure in such a manner. She had been here at the Dan Wu Academy for several years but had never seen Jiang Yunhe in this state.\"Could it be that Ye Yuan was born with a powerful soul strength that already reached the Alchemy Master realm?\" after some time, Jiang Yunhe finally asked.But Feng Ruoqing shook her head and said, \"That's not it. His soul strength isn't that strong. It's only slightly stronger than the average person. He could refine a Tier 2 medicinal pill because he used the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.\"\"Sssss! Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique . . . Even if it's the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique, isn't this a little too exaggerated?\"\"Mmm. Truth be told, Ye Yuan's Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique has already reached the legendary stage!\"Even now when Feng Ruoqing said this, she felt that it was inconceivable.Legendary stage, that by itself was a legend.It was virtually impossible to reach that stage.Even those old people who lost all their teeth in the Alchemist a.s.sociation did not manage to train any alchemy technique to the legendary stage, let alone the even more challenging Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.Jiang Yunhe who was already shocked until he was charred on the outside and tender on the inside, was shocked once more.He stared at Feng Ruoqing for some time before confirming that she did not lie. \"Just what lucky encounter did this Ye Yuan had? Isn't this too unbelievable?\"Feng Ruoqing seemed to be well-prepared. \"He obviously won't reveal this sort of thing. But my guess is there should be an extremely powerful alchemist behind Ye Yuan! And it's impossible for that person to be his father. The way I see it, this alchemist is definitely not limited to the Alchemy King realm!\"Jiang Yunhe paced about to digest the news that Feng Ruoqing brought back.It seemed that Feng Ruoqing's guess should be the closest to the truth. Otherwise, it could not explain how Ye Yuan possessed such monstrous alchemic talent at such a young age.After a long time, Jiang Yunhe said, \"Such a figure is too terrifying. It's best to not provoke. It's just that I don't understand. Since Ye Yuan has such an incredible master, why would he come to the Dan Wu Academy?\"Feng Ruoqing shook her head and said, \"I also thought about this question. Most likely, it's to train his disciple?\"\"Mmm. There is this possibility! d.a.m.n, you said w.a.n.g Jinfu and Sun Jianming, those two geezers, also knows about this. They definitely won't let Ye Yuan go! Come, let's quickly find Ye Yuan!\"As he was saying this, Jiang Yunhe wanted to rush out.Feng Ruoqing smiled and said, \"Relax, Dean. After returning to the academy, I'd already visited the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion. Ye Yuan has already returned to the academy during the night. Lord Chairman Wu Daofeng brought the two deputy chairmen in vain. Grandmaster Ye Hang is also coincidentally in a closed-door seclusion, so the three of them returned empty-handed. Finally, they could only request the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's shopkeeper, Feng San, to deliver the badge to the academy.\"Jiang Yunhe let out a huge sigh of relief. Laughing out loud, he then said, \"Haha. To think Old Man Wu would actually be denied entrance. I think his face back then would have been very interesting. Ye Yuan must have definitely predicted this situation, that's why he rushed back through the night. It looks like his feelings for the academy is very deep! Since Ye Yuan's back at the academy, quickly bring him to see me. No, I'll personally go visit him!\"Jiang Yunhe brought Feng Ruoqing to Ye Yuan's residence and did not alarm other people.Personally visiting a student with his status would definitely cause a huge uproar in the academy.Except, Jiang Yunhe did not manage to meet with Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan entered the training room after returning to the academy.But Jiang Yunhe saw Lu-er and Feng San at Ye Yuan's residence. However, they did not recognize Jiang Yunhe. Lu-er was very familiar with Feng Ruoqing though.\"Teacher Feng is here to look for Young Master?\"\"Yeah. Didn't he come back yesterday night? Where is he?\"\"Young Master said that he felt he was going to break through, so he entered a closed-door seclusion right away after returning. Shopkeeper Feng San didn't get to see him either.\"Jiang Yunhe was stunned. What breakthrough? This rascal was clearly hiding from everyone!It had only been a few days since he broke through to the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm, how could it be possible for another breakthrough so soon?Even though Ye Yuan's breakthroughs previously were indeed fast, but for every increment in cultivation realm in the Essence Qi Realm, the difficulty would also become greater.How could it be so easy to break through from the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm?Furthermore, even if he broke through, his cultivation realm rose too quickly would inevitably affect future cultivation growth. This way of doing things was just not worth it.There was such a powerful teacher behind Ye Yuan, how could he possibly make such a low-level mistake?Hence, Ye Yuan must definitely be hiding from everyone!This brat caused such a huge upheaval, yet he hid himself and avoided meeting anyone. How irresponsible!Jiang Yunhe felt very depressed. He came to visit a junior with his status and was actually denied entrance!Just now, he was still laughing at Wu Daofeng. He did not think that karma would strike instantly, and it was his turn so soon.But one had to acknowledge that a closed-door seclusion was an excellent excuse.When martial artists were cultivating, it was taboo for them to be interrupted during closed-seclusion.Even if Jiang Yunhe was the dean, he also could not casually interrupt Ye Yuan's closed-door seclusion.Feng Ruoqing did not expect this result either and so she said helplessly, \"Then . . . forgive our disturbance, Miss Lu-er. If Ye Yuan exits seclusion, could Miss Lu-er please tell him to look for the Lord Dean at the back of the mountain, Cloud Wave Court?\"Lu-er blinked her eyes and nodded, saying, \"Don't worry, Teacher Feng. Lu-er will remember.\"Lu-er was na\u00efve and did not understand Feng Ruoqing's meaning. However, Feng San was proficient in the ways of the world. His entire body quivered when he heard this, and his eyes sneaked a peek at Jiang Yunhe.Initially, he only faintly felt how powerful this person was, but at this moment, he was able to guess Jiang Yunhe's ident.i.ty!Feng San did not expect the dignified Dan Wu Academy's dean would come to look for Ye Yuan personally!Recalling this morning where Lord Wu Daofeng also visited personally to deliver the badge, Feng San was incomparably shocked.Ever since he received the badge in the morning, Feng San knew that Wu Daofeng did not come to look for Ye Hang. They came to look for Ye Yuan!Having been the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion's shopkeeper for so many years, n.o.body was clearer than him about what a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm Alchemy Master meant!The two most powerful, most influential big-shots went so far as to personally visit his Young Master!\"Huuuuuu . . . \"Watching Jiang Yunhe and Feng Ruoqing in the distance, Feng San let out a long breath.Young Master Ye Yuan really could not compare with the past. He had already gone from a silkpants to becoming a top genius in the entire State of Qin.Even major figures like Jiang Yunhe and Wu Daofeng were fighting to win over his young master!\"Oh Lu-er, our family's Young Master Ye Yuan has finally become capable!\" Feng San sighed emotionally.But Lu-er pouted her lips, and she said with a smile, \"Young Master has already been amazing. It's just that you all misunderstood him in the past.\"Feng San looked at Lu-er speechlessly . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he was really in a closed-door seclusion.Since his Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation had already been consolidated, he could not wait to increase his strength.Ye Yuan's essence energy was thoroughly exhausted in refining the Tier 2 medicinal pill. It was indeed an incredible burden on his body.Presently, Ye Yuan was recovering his exhausted essence energy in order to adjust himself to his peak condition. Following that, he planned to take transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills to breakthrough to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm in one stroke.Of course, the amount of time required to break through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm could not be compared with back then from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm.The second stage of the Essence Qi Realm.Every time one's cultivation realm rose, the essence energy required also increased by a large quant.i.ty.Although Ye Yuan had sufficient transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills, he still needed time to digest them.In addition, what he trained in was the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art, so the essence energy expended was several times of the average person.However, Ye Yuan was not in a rush. He had plenty of time.He will be in closed-door seclusion for a few days first to let those people get busy and leave him alone.Jiang Yunhe was certainly very busy. After failing to meet Ye Yuan, he left the Dan Wu Academy.In reality, Jiang Yunhe had always been busy. He actually spent very little time in the academy. n.o.body knew what he went out to do.He happened to be back at the academy these few days and found out that such a dazzling new star rose within a month.However, Ye Yuan required time to grow no matter how talented he was. After all, he was only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.As long as Ye Yuan was in the Dan Wu Academy, Jiang Yunhe need not worry about this genius running away.Since Ye Yuan chose the Dan Wu Academy, it was impossible for Wu Daofeng to come to the Dan Wu Academy personally to headhunt people.After making it through the initial shock and having thought through this part, Jiang Yunhe naturally had to get busy with his own matters. There was no way he would wait here specifically for Ye Yuan to exit seclusion.Yet at this time, Lu-er welcomed an unexpected guest. Someone who claimed to be a student from the academy's General Affairs Department was looking for her.\"This Junior Apprentice Sister is Lu-er?\" The student's att.i.tude was very haughty.Lu-er was a little perplexed, but she still responded, \"Yes. May I ask who this Senior Apprentice Brother is?\"\"I'm a student manager from the General Affairs Departments; the name's Zhang Heng.\"\"So it's Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang Heng. I wonder if you are looking for Lu-er for something?\"Although Lu-er was innocent, she was not dumb. This Zhang Heng would not find her for no reason, and looking at his att.i.tude it did not seem to be friendly.As expected, Zhang Heng opened his mouth and said, \"Of course I'm finding you for something! Since you already pa.s.sed the Entry Advancement test and became the academy's Yellow Rank student, why didn't you report to the General Affairs Department?\"Lu-er was at a loss. She never knew there was such a rule. One still had to report to the General Affairs Department after becoming the academy's student?\"Please overlook it, Senior Apprentice Brother. Lu-er has just been admitted, and there are still many things that I don't know. It's just, why must I report to the department after becoming a Yellow Rank student?\" Lu-er asked neither haughtily nor humbly.Zheng Heng gave a cold smile and said, \"Such a large Dan Wu Academy is accommodating for so many students. Are we just going to sit idle and eat? Since we became the academy's students, we naturally have to help out in the academy. Hence, all Yellow Rank students who pa.s.sed the Entry Advancement test have to do one month of miscellaneous tasks. This is the academy's rule. You became the academy's student, but instead of learning the academy's rules properly, you even want other people to help you complete your miscellaneous jobs. Simply shameless!\"This Zhang Heng did not lie. There was really such a rule in the Dan Wu Academy. But it was a little too much to speak to a girl like this.Furthermore, Lu-er did not neglect work on purpose. She really did not know anything. She had only arrived at the academy for several days, so even if she was absent from work, it was not a big deal.Zhang Heng was obviously here to find fault.Lu-er did not feel anything about doing a month of ch.o.r.es. Except, Ye Yuan was currently in a closed-door seclusion. If he exited seclusion and could not find her, he would definitely be worried.\"Can Senior Apprentice Brother allow me to wait for a few days? My young master is currently in a closed-door seclusion, and if he can't find me when he exits, he will definitely get worried. After my young master leaves seclusion, I will definitely report to the general affairs,\" Lu-er requested cautiously.Who would have thought that Zhang Heng would rage after hearing that. \"What a joke! Who do you think your young master is? Is he bigger than the academy's rules? You've already delayed for several days. How many more days do you want to delay? Every new student will be recorded in the books, and they would have the initiative to do their job. Are you the only exception?\"Hearing Zhang Heng verbally insulted her Young Master, Lu-er was so angry that tears were pooling in her eyes. But she knew that Young Master still had Wan Yuan, an opponent in the academy, and so she did not want to cause trouble for him. Hence, she held back her tears and said, \"Lu-er requests Senior Apprentice Brother to allow a few days' grace. I will definitely report there. At that time, even if you arrange two months of ch.o.r.es for me, I won't mind.\"However, Zhang Heng did not seem to have any intention of being tender towards women. He smiled coldly and said, \"Anyway, I've already informed you. It's your call whether you go or not. But I will say the nasty things first. If I don't see you report at the general affairs today, then don't blame me for reporting this matter to the instructor. In accordance with the academy's rules, you can just wait to be expelled!\"Hearing the word 'expelled,' Lu-er shuddered.Young Master was currently like the noon sun, if she were expelled, then would it not make Young Master a laughing stock?That was definitely not a result that Lu-er wanted to see!Without question, this word struck Lu-er's weak point.Seeing Lu-er's restless look, a ruminating look could be seen in Zhang Heng's eyes.Hur hur. What has it got to do with me after your Young Master comes out? It's because I know that he's in a closed-door seclusion; that's why I came to look for you and cause trouble! Zhang Heng was laughing coldly in his heart.Zhang Heng pretended to have lost his patience, turned around, and was about to leave.Looking at the situation, Lu-er did not dare to delay. She quickly called out, \"Wait, Senior Apprentice Brother. I . . . I will go with you to the general affairs. It's just . . . can you let me leave a note for my young master?\"One had to acknowledge that Lu-er was overly innocent. She even thought that this Zhang Heng was an upright and outspoken person, which was why he came to find her. Who would have known that he was scheming and came to find trouble!If Lu-er secretly left a token or note, then Ye Yuan would know what happened.But now that she told Zhang Heng she wanted to leave a note, how could Zhang Heng allow her to do that?Zhang Heng said impatiently, \"If you are leaving, then just go. Why are there so many things? I'm leaving. Handle it by yourself!\"Finis.h.i.+ng, he really turned around and left.Lu-er hesitated for a moment and returned to the house to leave a note before going.Of course, Lu-er was not aware that Ye Yuan would not see her note.. . . . . .Ye Yuan was completely unaware of everything happening in the outside world. He was currently at the critical juncture of a.s.saulting the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm.He threw transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills into his mouth like they were sweets, and continuously refined the medicinal strength with the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.The essence energy within his dantian became increasingly abundant, and he got closer and closer to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm.Finally, Ye Yuan burst through the barrier in one shot, and he broke through to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"Huuu . . . At this rate, these Essence Qi Pills aren't even enough! This stupid cultivation law is too voracious. This is still the Essence Qi Realm, and the consumption is already multiple times greater than the average person's. Won't it be h.e.l.l at the Spirit Condensation Realm? Old Dad might be rich, but even he can't sustain this torment!\"Ye Yuan watched the transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills being ma.s.sively depleted. He could not resist criticizing the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sweat beads dripped down her forehead, and her clothing also was somewhat in tatters. She looked very pitiful.However, this young lady's face gave out a stubborn expression, as she continued to grit her teeth and persevere.This young lady was precisely Lu-er who was forced to come here by Zhang Heng. She had basically been slogging in the medicine garden for the past two days without stopping.The formerly dainty and exquisite Lu-er was gone, and what replaced it was a haggard face full of exhaustion.Weeding was not a very tiring job for martial artists. Even if they did not rest or sleep for several days, they would not end up like this.However, weeding in the medicine garden was not such a relaxing job. The weeds in the spiritual fields were very deeply rooted because of nourishment from the thick heaven and earth essence energy.One had to utilize essence energy to remove them.Like this, weeding became hard labor.There was no one willing to do this job in the academy. Hence, they would let those newbies who just entered the academy do this sort of things.In reality, the majority of those doing these ch.o.r.es were commoners. The aristocrats just have to bribe a little, and they would be easily exempted.Zhang Heng used Lu-er avoiding her tasks as an excuse to arrange a much heavier workload for her compared to the others.Lu-er had virtually zero rest during these two days, but she only finished less than half of her workload.Due to her continuously expending her essence energy these two days, Lu-er's stamina was already depleted. That was why she appeared so fatigued.Two youths were currently sipping tea and chatting in the small pavilion overlooking the medicine garden. They looked very pleased.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, this Junior Apprentice Brother can't bear to torment such a dainty and cute beauty like this!\" Zhang Heng shook his head and sighed. However, there was no trace of unwillingness on his facial expression.The youth sitting opposite him was precisely Lin Tiancheng. And finding trouble for Lu-er was something he single-handed engineered.In the Dan Wu Academy, there were very few Heaven Rank students, and their status was extremely aloof. Generally speaking, the academy would not arrange for them to do anything specific. They just had to cultivate diligently.All of the ch.o.r.es in the academy were mostly handled by the Earth rank students.Just like Zhao Chunyang, he was sent out by the General Affairs Department to stand guard over the Scripture Library. Hence, the authority of the department was actually quite significant. There were plenty of ways to mess with people.What Ye Yuan did not know was that the head student of the General Affairs Department was Lin Tiancheng.Apart from an instructor who did not involve himself too much, Lin Tiancheng's authority was the highest.Ever since he was humiliated by Ye Yuan at the Illusionary Spirit Tower, and with Liu Ruoshui inciting things by the side, Lin Tiancheng started to resent Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan was currently like the noon sun in the academy, so naturally, he did not dare to seek Ye Yuan out. But it was not hard to find trouble with Lu-er.Two days ago, he heard that Ye Yuan happened to enter a closed-door seclusion, so he found a reason to send Zhang Heng over to find trouble with Lu-er and instructed her to remove weeds in the medicine garden.Lin Tiancheng sipped his tea and smiled as he said, \"Don't pretend to be a bodhisattva with me as if I don't know you. I let you take charge of this medicine garden, and G.o.d knows how many girls you have harmed. Would you pity this young la.s.s?\"Hearing this, Zhang Heng laughed and said, \"This is all thanks to Senior Apprentice Brother Lin's care! That's why when Senior Apprentice Brother Lin came to look for me, I didn't say a word and just did it.\"Lin Tiancheng nodded approvingly and said, \"At least you are sensible, punk! I'm very pleased with the way this matter was dealt with. You can do whatever you want with that chick, no need to give me any face!\"When Zhang Heng heard this, a trace of wickedness flickered across his eyes, and he asked, \"Really?\"\"Of course it's real! I really want to see what kind of expression Ye Yuan would have after he exits seclusion only to see that his maidservant was violated!\" Lin Tiancheng's eyes filled with hatred when he mentioned Ye Yuan.That day at the Illusionary Spirit Tower, Ye Yuan made him completely lose face.Afterward, many students secretly spread about what happened that day, which greatly diminished his prestige among the Earth Rank students. This was the reason why he wanted to take revenge so badly!Zhang Heng was thrilled. \"Since that's the case, then I, Junior Apprentice Brother, won't stand on ceremony. Senior Apprentice Brother Lin really gave this Little Brother a huge gift! Even though this girl is young, in terms of appearance, she is outstanding! It's just . . . I'm afraid that Ye Yuan would come to find me after exiting seclusion.\"Lin Tiancheng looked at Zhang Heng calmly and said with a cold smile, \"No matter how powerful that Ye Yuan is, he's only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. You are at any rate a Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm. Are you still scared of him? If he confronts you, then just let him come. When that happens, give him a brutal beating. You can help me vent this frustration at the same time! By the time he grows up, you would have graduated already. Why be scared of him?\"Zhang Heng gave heavy praises when he heard it. \"Haha. It's still Senior Apprentice Brother Lin who have great foresight. You've already considered everything! I'm somewhat looking forward to Ye Yuan's furious and exasperated expression now.\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Lin Tiancheng and Zhang Heng exchanged glances and started laughing in unison.Lin Tiancheng was naturally unaware of Ye Yuan's performance in the Illusionary Spirit Tower. He thought that he overconfidently challenged the Earth Rank Advancement test and ended up being instantly killed.He also thought that Ye Yuan had just barely made it past the Black Rank Advancement test. Hence, the way he saw it, Ye Yuan at most had the strength of an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm.Zhang Heng might be older, but he was already a veteran Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm who similarly had the ability to jump ranks and battle. So it was obvious he could not lose to Ye Yuan.. . . . . .This seclusion of Ye Yuan lasted four days.Presently, the essence energy in Ye Yuan's dantian was surging as he impacted the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm bottleneck repeatedly.Ye Yuan had already broken through to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm three days ago. After consolidating his cultivation realm a little, Ye Yuan continued eating transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills to impact the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!To him, there was not much difference between the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm and the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. It was just how many transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills he needed to consume.Ye Yuan consumed transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills non-stop and repeatedly tempered the essence energy using the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.Finally, after consuming several hundred transcendent-grade Essence Qi Pills, Ye Yuan broke through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm in one stroke!Ye Yuan felt like his entire body was bursting with strength after breaking through two cultivation realms consecutively. A feeling of discomfort had arisen unless he used his strength!Revolving his essence energy, Ye Yuan struck out a palm. The air in the training room was compressed to its limits by the power of his palm and gave off a 'puff puff' explosive sound.Boom!A large hole was dented into the wall of the training room.This big hole was way larger than the first time he used the Stacking Waves Layered Palm. It was an attack on an entirely different level.The walls of the training room were special. It could perfectly withstand a peak level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist's full blow.It could be seen just how terrifying Ye Yuan's attack power was to be able to smash such a large hole in the wall.\"Ooo. If I enter the Illusionary Spirit Tower again and use the Eighth Layer Wave, I should be able to kill three black-robed martial artists, right? Hehe. After I breakthrough to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, I will go to the Illusionary Spirit Tower to try it out,\" Ye Yuan looked at the big hole in the wall and muttered to himself.\"It should have already been four or five days? I wonder what happened outside. If I still don't go out, Lu-er will be worried. Time to exit seclusion!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each one would make Lu-er expend a great deal of strength to remove.Even so, Lu-er did not make any complaint these past few days.She did not wish to cause trouble for Young Master and did not want to smear dirt on Young Master's face anymore.The first two days, Lu-er's weeding speed was still very fast. But the next two days, her speed suddenly fell. It was because the essence energy in her body was drained.Every now and then, Lu-er had to meditate for a while to recover essence energy. But this essence energy was used up again very quickly.Like this, her weeding speed became drastically slower.Two days ago, she had already completed nearly half of it, but the next two days, she only finished 70%, and she was getting increasingly slower.Lu-er's stamina had already been over exhausted far too much. Her upper eyelid and lower eyelid had been trembling all these while. Only an obsessive thought compelled her forward.All of a sudden, a pair of feet appeared in Lu-er's sight. Lu-er's face lit up, and she could not resist lifting her head up to see.But she was greatly disappointed after looking up. The person who came was not Young Master but that hateful Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang!Zhang Heng saw Lu-er's disappointed expression and smiled coldly as he said, \"Why? Didn't see the person you wished to see?\"Lu-er kept silent.Zhang Heng was very displeased with Lu-er's att.i.tude and flew into a rage. \" Humph! I a.s.signed you the task to get rid of the weeds, but you only completed 70% of it until now. Did you leave so much for me to help you do?\"Lu-er wiped the sweat from her forehead, and she said weakly, \"I . . . I'm already working very hard. Just give me one more day, Senior Apprentice Brother. I can definitely complete it.\"\"One day? I think even if I gave you three days, you also can't complete it. Such a small task and you can't even complete it in four or five days. You must be slacking off!\" Zhang Heng snorted coldly.Lu-er hurriedly shook her head. \"I didn't. I'm really working very hard at weeding!\"\" Hehe. I will naturally know whether you are working hard or not. It's useless for you to argue! To punish you for slacking, you have to weed another stretch of the medicine garden!\"Lu-er froze when she heard that. \"What? W-weed another stretch of the medicine garden? I . . . I . . .\"\"You, what you? You don't want to do it? If you don't want to do it, then fine. Go back, pack your stuff, and be prepared to get lost from the academy!\" Zhang Heng did not intend to show any sympathy towards a girl.\"But . . . But I already . . .\"\"You already don't have any more strength to do, right?\" Zhang Heng suddenly smiled and said.Lu-er nodded feebly.\"If you don't want to do it, fine. But you have to promise me something.\" Zhang Heng suddenly changed the subject.Lu-er did not expect Zhang Heng to suddenly loosen up and naively thought that what he said was the truth. She asked him ecstatically, \"Is that true? Please say, Senior Apprentice Brother Zhang!\"A malicious smile suddenly appeared on Zhang Heng's face. Lu-er's face changed as she only just realized that Zhang Heng did not have any good intentions.As expected, Zhang Heng opened his mouth and said, \"I didn't think that Miss Lu-er was so astute! My condition is very simple. I just want Miss Lu-er to accompany me for one night, and that will do. How's that? Isn't this deal worthwhile?\"Lu-er was not a stupid person. She was just inexperienced and did not really know the ways of the world.Initially, she only thought that Zhang Heng was an unreasonable person. Now, it looks like he was simply a beast in human clothing! Perhaps he already decided and planned all these, which was why he repeatedly made things difficult for her.\" Pooh! So, you are this sort of filthy person. Watch me report you to the instructor!\" Lu-er said hatefully.\" Hahahaha! What a joke! You're just a newbie who refused to accept your Senior Apprentice Brother's punishment. And because you harbored a grudge in your heart, that's why you slandered your Senior Apprentice Brother. Why don't you tell me whether the instructor will believe you or me?\" Zhang Heng seemed to have expected it and laughed loudly.When Zhang Heng said that, Lu-er was stunned.Zhang Heng could manage the medicine garden for such a long time, which showed that the instructor definitely trusted him very much. Even if she went to complain, if Zhang Heng said that, the instructor might really think that she bore a grudge, which was why she defamed Senior Apprentice Brother.\"You! You're a really despicable man!\" Lu-er was so enraged by Zhang Heng that her entire body was shaking as she pointed at his nose and yelled.However, Zhang Heng did not care at all. He smiled coldly as he said, \"Lu-er, just think about it, if your young master exits seclusion and hears that his maidservant was expelled right after being admitted into the academy, what kind of feeling would that be?\"Lu-er was stunned, and her body started to tremble involuntarily.Seeing Lu-er's expression, Zhang Heng was even more pleased. He continued saying, \"Your young master is currently the academy's favorite. But his own maidservant was chased out of the academy. In the future, as long as he stays in the academy, there would be people pointing and gossiping behind his back. They would laugh that he couldn't even manage his own maidservant.\"Taking advantage of Lu-er being scared out of her wits, Zhang Heng slowly moved closer to Lu-er.As he got closer, he continued saying, \"Even though I'm not as talented as your young master, I'm still a respected figure in the academy. You won't suffer from following me. How about it? It's just one night!\"As he was talking, Zhang Heng wanted to use his finger to lift Lu-er's chin. But Lu-er abruptly came round and immediately jumped away.\" Humph! You should just give up. Even if I die, I won't bring shame on Young Master!\"After she said that, Lu-er lifted her hand and slapped towards the top of her head. If this palm landed, the result would definitely be the pa.s.sing of a beauty.Zhang Heng also did not expect Lu-er to be so decisive and would rather commit suicide than yield. He immediately became furious.Although Lu-er improved amazingly fast, when facing the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm Zhang Heng, she was still incredibly weak.Furthermore, her essence energy already depleted. How could she possibly succeed in committing suicide?Pah!Who knew when a whip appeared in Zhang Heng's hands, which coiled around Lu-er's arm, sending her flying.Just like that, Lu-er went cras.h.i.+ng out.\" Ah! \" Lu-er landed heavily on the ground and gave a m.u.f.fled groan.Pah!Another las.h.!.+This lash landed heavily on Lu-er's. A b.l.o.o.d.y streak immediately appeared on Lu-er's body, and blood seeped through her clothes.\"La.s.s who doesn't know how to appreciate favors! Want to die? It's not going to be that easy!\"Zhang Heng was infuriated. If Lu-er really committed suicide, he also could not escape responsibility.He was going to graduate soon. He did not want to lose any integrity.Lu-er's actions were making him irritated.\" Ah! \" Lu-er shrieked, but she ignored the pain as she crawled forward, wanting to grab a circular blue object.Just as Lu-er's hand was about to close in on it, that circular blue object was stepped underfoot by Zhang Heng.\"Give me back the badge!\" Lu-er endured the intense pain and yelled.Zhang Heng s.h.i.+fted his feet and glanced at the blue item on the ground, and it was indeed a badge. Two stars were embroidered on it. This was actually a low-rank Alchemy Master badge.\"I thought what this is. So, it's an Alchemy Master badge. I didn't think that you stole something so valuable after only a few days in the academy! Just with this, it's enough to get you expelled!\"Zhang Heng kicked the badge far away.He was apparently still unaware that Ye Yuan had already pa.s.sed the Alchemy Master test and officially became a low-rank Alchemy Master. Otherwise, even if he were to have an extra set of b.a.l.l.s, he also would not dare abuse Lu-er like this.Looking at Zhang Heng desecrating Young Master's badge, the pain Lu-er felt was even worse than her physical pain. Tears finally trickled down uncontrollably.Looking at Lu-er's delicate and pitiful appearance, Zhang Heng could no longer hold back the beast inside him. He reached out and tore off a piece of Lu-er's clothing.Afterward, he grabbed Lu-er and dragged her to a corner, and he started to make his move to violate her in broad daylight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lu-er!\" Ye Yuan exited and shouted for Lu-er. But there was no reply.Ye Yuan was very suspicious. Lu-er should have been waiting here for him to exit seclusion. Where did she go?Lu-er was very obedient. If there was really something, she should have left him a message. But Ye Yuan searched the place and did not find any clues.He also asked his neighbors, but n.o.body knew either.Zhang Heng was highly scheming. The time he picked happened to be lesson time, so basically, all the students were at cla.s.s.Ye Yuan was in a closed-door seclusion, so she did not have any mood to attend cla.s.ses. However, it just happened to give Zhang Heng the opportunity to strike.\"Strange. Where on earth did Lu-er go? Don't tell me someone dares to kidnap people within the Dan Wu Academy?\" Ye Yuan sat down at the table and started conjecturing.Could Lu-er have gone to look for Tang Yu?In this place, Lu-er only had Tang Yu for a friend.Thinking of Tang Yu, Ye Yuan relaxed and was just about to leave to find Tang Yu when there was a knocking sound.Opening the door to take a look, who could it be except Tang Yu?Tang Yu saw Ye Yuan and was overjoyed. \"I figured that Senior Apprentice Brother Ye should have also exited seclusion, so I came over to have a look. I didn't think that it would be so coincidental. Yii? Y-you are already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm?!\"Tang Yu stared with his mouth agape. Ye Yuan's improvement was too outrageous!He had only broken through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm with the help of Ye Yuan's pills not long ago.A month ago, when Tang Yu met Ye Yuan for the first time, he was only at the First Level Essence Qi Realm.A month later, Ye Yuan was already at the same cultivation realm as him!Thinking of how Ye Yuan killed Chou Ying with a finger, Tang Yu believed that if he fought with Ye Yuan, Ye Yuan could absolutely kill him in an instant!Tang Yu currently felt that the Ye Yuan in front of him was like a dragon that entered deep waters and then soared to the sky in one stroke. n.o.body could stop him anymore!While Tang Yu was immersed in his shock, he did not notice that Ye Yuan's facial expression did not look good.When Ye Yuan looked behind Tang Yu and confirmed that he came alone, his face turned ugly.He waved his hands and did not bother with Tang Yu's shock. Opening his mouth, he asked, \"Why did you come alone?\"Tang Yu was stunned and asked doubtfully, \"If I'm not alone, how many people could there be?\"Ye Yuan furrowed his brows. \"Didn't Lu-er go and find you while I was in a closed-door seclusion these few days?\"Tang Yu was alarmed, but he shook his head and replied, \"No. I've also been busy these few days and did not see Lu-er. She also never came to find me. Why, did something happen to Lu-er?\"Ye Yuan currently felt a little uneasy. \"After I returned, I spent the entire time looking for her, but I couldn't find her. I have a bad premonition. I keep feeling that something happened to her.\"\"Maybe Lu-er was bored of waiting for you, and in a moment of playfulness, ran out to play. This is the Dan Wu Academy. Nothing should happen. Don't need to worry, Brother Ye.\" Tang Yu rea.s.sured him.Ye Yuan gave a sigh and said, \"I hope so.\"The house momentarily became silent. But the uneasiness in Ye Yuan's heart grew increasingly stronger.He suddenly stood up and said to Tang Yu, \"Please return, Brother Tang. I'm still a little worried about Lu-er. I'm going to look for her.\"\"I'll go too. There's a higher chance with two people searching.\" Tang Yu offered.Ye Yuan shook his head and said, \"No need. Just I alone will suffice.\"After he said that, Ye Yuan casually grabbed a piece of Lu-er's clothing and went out.. . . . . .Ye Yuan did not go around hunting aimlessly. He came directly to Feng Ruoqing's pill refinement room.After returning from the capital, not only did Feng Ruoqing had a cultivation realm breakthrough, her insights in the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique also grew deeper.Ye Yuan was in a closed-door seclusion these past few days, so she naturally hid in the pill refinement room to practice the Yin-Yang Separation Flow Technique.Feng Ruoqing was surprised when she saw Ye Yuan, but Ye Yuan did not give her a chance to speak.\"I want to borrow your refinement room to use. Prepare a few ingredients for me!\"Ye Yuan casually threw Feng Ruoqing a piece of paper and directly entered the pill refinement room like this refinement room belonged to him.Ye Yuan's words were like issuing an order. Feng Ruoqing was very annoyed at his att.i.tude but surprisingly did not blow her top. That was because she had never seen such a frightening expression on Ye Yuan's face before.Feng Ruoqing was quick-witted and knew that something must have happened.\"Forget it, forget it. Who asked me to owe him.\"Feng Ruoqing let out a faint sigh and really went to prepare the ingredients Ye Yuan needed like a maidservant.If other people saw the dignified State of Qin's Head Princess does this sort of thing, their jaws would drop due to the shock.Before long, Feng Ruoqing returned. The ingredients that Ye Yuan required were all ordinary stuff and were not difficult to source. It was naturally easy to obtain with Feng Ruoqing's status.Except, Feng Ruoqing was very curious about what Ye Yuan was trying to refine.The ingredients that Ye Yuan needed were not all herbs. There were some other items. Refining medicinal pills out of these ingredients were impossible.Pa.s.sing the ingredients over to Ye Yuan, Feng Ruoqing could not resist asking, \"There are quite a few that aren't herbs. What are you trying to refine with these ingredients?\"Ye Yuan received the ingredients and answered indifferently, \"You don't need to bother. Just watch. Start the fire!\"\"You! You're really treating me like a servant?!\" Feng Ruoqing could not help losing her temper. This fellow had no respect for anyone!\"If you're not helping, then go to one side. Don't hold me up!\" Ye Yuan words grew icier.Not knowing the reason Feng Ruoqing walked to the Red Lotus Cauldron and helped Ye Yuan open up the earth fire.Seeing the situation, Ye Yuan did not express anything. Right now, his heart was burning with anxiety. However, he knew that the more impatient he got, the more he had to keep calm and not lose his reason.The fire started, and Ye Yuan began to refine.This time around, the refinement was not earthshaking. It was only a very simple-looking refinement method. But Feng Ruoqing had never seen this sort of method before.Without the process of preparing the herbs nor the process of refining the medicinal essence, Ye Yuan directed the fire to temper the ingredients while looking very relaxed.After an hour, the result of Ye Yuan refinement appeared. It was a chalk-like item, except that its appearance was grayish-black.\"What's this?\" Feng Ruoqing asked curiously again.\"Soul Guiding Incense!\"This time around, Ye Yuan did not reject answering. It was just that when he talked, he let out a long breath. His rising and falling chest showed his current state of agitation.\"Soul Guiding Incense? What's it used for?\" Feng Ruoqing had never heard of this thing before and asked inquisitively.Ye Yuan did not answer but threw the Soul Guiding Incense onto the clothing that he brought along. After that, he waved a hand to draw a wisp of fire. Earth fire had an exceedingly high temperature. Lu-er's clothes were burned into a wisp of green smoke instantly.However, the miraculous thing was that the green smoke condensed in mid-air and did not dissipate!The next instant, the green smoke moved, and Ye Yuan moved as well.\"Where are you going?\" Feng Ruoqing asked bewilderedly.But Ye Yuan ignored her and ran out following that strand of green smoke.Feng Ruoqing bit her lips as she watched. After hesitating for a moment, she also followed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could not even commit suicide.Lu-er became more and more terrified and increasingly becoming weaker.If she were tainted by a fellow like him, she would rather die!Pah!Zhang Heng slapped Lu-er's face and spat as he said, \"Little b*tch. You still aren't compliant when you are already like this? You're really asking for a beating!\"Lu-er suffered due to that slap, and one side of her face immediately swelled up. She laid there motionlessly as if she was resigned to her fate.Seeing the situation, Zhang Heng gave a nasty grin and said, 'That's right. Much better now. Don't worry. After today, you won't be able to leave this Senior Apprentice Brother! Hahaha!\"After saying that, Zhang Heng leaned over to carry out that b.e.s.t.i.a.l act.But right at this moment, all the pores on Zhang Heng's body stood on end. A feeling of danger came from straight ahead.Zhang Heng instinctively jumped away. An ice arrow grazed his face as it flew past.Luckily, his reaction was fast enough. Otherwise, that ice arrow would have already pierced through his throat.Withdrawing to the side, Zhang Heng broke into cold sweat. Who would have thought that this la.s.s who already did not have any strength to retaliate could actually release such a powerful attack?However, Zhang Heng instantly became furious. Lu-er nearly killed him!Lu-er struggled to get up. Presently, her entire aura had changed drastically. Her entire body gave off an ice-cold feeling.This sort iciness seemed like it could even freeze the air.A layer of white frost covered Lu-er's hair, and her face also turned abnormally pale.Zhang Heng looked at Lu-er's transformation and chortled as he said, \"So, it turns out that you have the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian! You actually dared to cultivate essence energy with your Nine Yin Absolute Meridian. You really can't tell life from death! Right now, the frost poison has burst forth, I will see how you suppress it!\"The sun was currently s.h.i.+ning brightly, but Lu-er felt as if her entire body was placed in an icehouse. The frost penetrated the bone and sunk in deeply.This was the ultimate move of the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul, Profound Ice Returns to Dust!This move was a forbidden technique in the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul. When Ye Yuan was teaching Lu-er, he had informed her that unless she had no other alternative, she must absolutely never use it!That was because this move triggered the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian, attracting the frost qi between heaven and earth into her body in exchange for a powerful strength temporarily.The name 'Returns to Dust' meant that after using it, from ashes to ashes, dust to dust. It was a move to perish together with your enemy.Currently, Lu-er's aura soared ma.s.sively, directly breaking through the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm threshold, past the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm, and finally stopping at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!The time Lu-er spent cultivating the Heaven Illusionary Ice Soul was still too short. Even though she improved at an amazing speed, her comprehension was not that profound.If the Spirit Snow Divine King was the one executing the Profound Ice Returns to Dust, even if she only at the strength of a First Level Essence Qi Realm, she would be able to directly raise her strength to the Great Circle of Perfection of the Essence Qi Realm!Although Zhang Heng was surprised at Lu-er's sudden rise in strength, he did not pay too much heed.The Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm was still a minor stage lower than him!But he was currently livid because Lu-er nearly killed him just now, making him feel incredibly ashamed.That ice arrow also extinguished his l.u.s.t. Right now, what he wanted to do was to send Lu-er to the afterlife.Directly killing was a definite no-no. He would be punished by the academy.But since this la.s.s had the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian, then he could not be blamed if she sought her own death.\"Die, lecher!\" Lu-er grabbed the air with one hand. An ice arrow formed once again and shot towards Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng laughed coldly as he easily dodged it.This ice arrow might have a high attacking power, but what was the use if it could not hit the target?He was unprepared just now, which was why Lu-er's sneak attack almost succeeded. Now that they were fighting head-on, he naturally would not fall for it again.After all, Lu-er was not Ye Yuan. She lacked actual combat experience and could not control the sudden rise in strength.This sort of straight-forward attack obviously would not cause any trouble for the powerful Zhang Heng.However, Lu-er did not care. Before she activated the Profound Ice Returns to Dust, she already had the will to die.Lu-er believed that even if she could not kill this guy, Young Master would take revenge for her!\"Trying to deal with me with these sort of attacks? You're underestimating Earth Rank students' strength too much!\" Zhang Heng said with a mocking face.\"Humph! Thousand Illusion Hail!\"Lu-er cried out as her two hands formed a round shape.Very swiftly, countless stones formed between her hands. Pus.h.i.+ng both palms out, a hailstone shot towards Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng was astounded. He did not think that Lu-er's attacks would continue without end.This hailstone was an area-of-effect attack. Zhang Heng's speed was fast, but he was still struck by many hailstones.But the attack power of this hailstone was much weaker than the previous ice arrow. Coupled with Zhang Heng's powerful essence energy protection, these sort of attacks were unable to cause any real damage to him.\"Humph! Don't blame me for courting death, la.s.s! Snake Shadow Whip!\"Zhang Heng's whip technique was very skillful. The whip shot towards Lu-er from a highly tricky angle.Right now, Lu-er knew that she was not Zhang Heng's match, and her heart already held the will to die. She did not evade this whip at all.A sneer suddenly appeared on Lu-er's face. Noticing this, Zhang Heng was startled.Only to see that Lu-er's hands moved at high speed, and she actually formed multiple ice arrows in an instant!Lu-er did not defend at all. She was actually going to make both parties lose!Zhang Heng did not expect Lu-er to not fear death to such an extent. He did not want to die, so he swiftly pulled back his whip, and whirled his whip around. Very soon, the ice arrows were twirled into broken pieces.His strength exceeded Lu-er's by far too much, and his combat experience was also much richer. For Lu-er to injure him head-on, it was harder than trying to reach the heaven.After Zhang Heng shattered the ice arrows, he struck with his whip once more.Lu-er's attack just now had already exhausted all of her essence energy. Right now, she could no longer continue, so she just gave up defending and closed her eyes to wait for death.\"Young Master, in future, Lu-er can no longer be at your side to serve you. You have to take good care of yourself!\"Two clear streams of tears fell and froze into ice beads.Zhang Heng was aware that Lu-er did not fear death, but he did not expect that Lu-er looked forward to death so much that she just stopped defending.He did not hold back on this move. If he hit Lu-er, then she was dead for sure.The attack was already released, and Zhang Heng could no longer stop it anymore. Just as he watched it about to land on Lu-er, a force shot out from diagonally!Chi!The force actually directly broke the soft whip!Zhang Heng was horrified.Although his soft whip was not a magical artifact, that attack just now filled the inside of the whip with essence energy. It could pierce straight through a person, and yet, it was broken with one move by someone!\"Who's there? You're really despicable to dare to ambush me!\" Zhang Heng howled.A youth dressed in azure clothing glided over and landed beside Lu-er.He did not even spare a glance at Zhang Heng. Picking up Lu-er, he took out a medicinal pill for her to eat.\"Lu-er, Young Master came late.\"Lu-er opened her eyes wearily and saw that it was Ye Yuan. A trace of light recovered within her eyes.\"Don't talk. Watch by the side. Young Master will stand up for you!\" As he spoke, Ye Yuan's words grew frostier.Ye Yuan supported Lu-er to the sides, and then he stood up straight and shouted, \"Right now, I really want to kill someone! Anyone who stops me will be my enemy! I will not give up until you die!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Anyone who stops me will be my enemy! I will not give up until you die!\"Ye Yuan's words were directed toward Feng Ruoqing. He knew that Feng Ruoqing also came.If Feng Ruoqing makes a move, it would be impossible for him to kill Zhang Heng.This was a warning!n.o.body responded, but this was already a sort of tacit consent.Zhang Heng burst out laughing like he had just heard a hilarious joke. \"Hahaha . . . . . . Kill me? You're that Ye Yuan, right? Just you, a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, wants to jump ranks to kill me? You two, master and servant, are equally unable to gauge your strength!\"Ye Yuan did not show any reaction and said coolly, \"Are you acting on your own? Or is there somebody instigating you? Speak, and I will spare your life!\"Ye Yuan had no connections with this Zhang Heng. It was even more unlikely for Lu-er to provoke anyone, so he did not believe that Zhang Heng would force Lu-er to such a desperate situation for no reason whatsoever.Just now, Zhang Heng recognized Ye Yuan immediately with a glance. This further confirmed his conjecture.\"What a joke! You, a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, are so f*cking arrogant! You think that after pa.s.sing the Black Rank Advancement test and increasing your cultivation realm, you have the capital to challenge veteran Earth Rank students? Spare my life? Why don't you try for me to see?!\"Although Zhang Heng was astonished by Ye Yuan's advancement speed, he did not feel that he could threaten him.He was three minor cultivation realms above Ye Yuan, and they were separated by a minor stage. This sort of difference in power was not so easily bridged.Zhang Heng admitted that Ye Yuan was a genius. But who among those who could enter the Dan Wu Academy and become an Earth Rank student was not a genius among geniuses?Ye Yuan sighed, and he said calmly, \"One really can't communicate with an imbecile. Since you don't want to talk, then I will beat you until you do.\"Ye Yuan did not waste his breath. He raised his hand and executed Stacking Waves Layered Palm.Eight Layer Wave!\"Humph! Reckless punk. You dare to look down on me and only use one hand?!\"Zhang Heng naturally would not fold his hands and await death. He threw his weapon aside and also used his bare hands.\"Prajna Palm!\"Zhang Heng raised his hands to unleash a high-rank martial technique.Zhang Heng had spent a great deal of time and effort on this Prajna Palm and trained it to the Great Success stage. Furthermore, he struck out with both palms together, so the amount of essence energy used was much greater.Zhang Heng curled the corner of his mouth as if seeing the image of Ye Yuan being heavily injured.Three palms collided, but the events did not play out as Zhang Heng imagined. He felt a colossal force coming from the Ye Yuan's palm, which immediately pa.s.sed through his two hands and spread throughout his entire body.\"Puu!\" Zhang Heng gave a m.u.f.fled groan, and blood sprayed out wildly from his mouth. His entire body flew out like he was heavily struck.\"Now, will you talk?\" Ye Yuan continued speaking calmly without any trace of emotion.The palm that Ye Yuan unleashed in anger was the Eight Layer Wave!Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eight Layer Wave. This was a palm technique that could even finish off a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm, and Zhang Heng chose to receive it head-on foolishly. There would be no justice if he did not die.But Ye Yuan deliberately held back on this move and only heavily injured Zhang Heng. The intention was to find out who was the mastermind.Ye Yuan took two steps forward and walked to Zhang Heng's side. Looking down on him, he asked icily, \"Now, will you talk?\"\"Puu!\" Zhang Heng coughed up another mouthful of blood.Right now, his arms were broken, and his internal organs also suffered extremely serious injuries. He looked incredibly wretched. If he did not receive medical treatment, he would soon die without Ye Yuan needing to move.\"Talk . . . Talk my *ss! Ha . . . haha . . . If you have the ability, then kill me! The Dan Wu Academy's rules state that students cannot kill one another! Come then! Kill me!\" Zhang Heng's blood stained his teeth as he laughed miserably.Ye Yuan looked at Zhang Heng pitifully, and he said coldly, \"Rules? Rules are only used to restrict mediocre people like you. A true powerhouse will break all the rules and establish his own rules! Someone like you can only live under other people's rules forever. How pitiful!\"\"Hahaha! Who doesn't know how to brag? If you have the b.a.l.l.s, then try breaking the rules for me to see! A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm punk talking nonsense about breaking the rules. What a joke!\"Zhang Heng clearly did not believe that Ye Yuan dared to go against the academy's rules. That was because, in the academy's history, all those who broke the rules were sentenced to death!Except for that person!\"Is that so? Then I will break the rules now. Except . . . you won't be able to see it.\"Ye Yuan raised his hand again, and essence energy hovered faintly within his palm.At this moment, Zhang Heng could clearly sense the killing intent coming off of Ye Yuan.To Ye Yuan, Lu-er was one of his closest loved ones, and Zhang Heng dared to force her until she used the Profound Ice Returns to Dust. Even his death was insufficient!In his precious life, Ye Yuan did not have the ability to protect his loved ones. In this life, he was set on never letting his loved ones come to harm. But he did not expect to encounter something like this.Ye Yuan's self-condemnation had already surpa.s.sed his fury!This palm slapped downwards without any hesitation. Zhang Heng no longer doubted Ye Yuan's determination.\"I'll talk! I'll talk! Don't kill me! I-I was only under someone's instigation!\" Zhang Heng finally could not withstand the pressure, and hurriedly shouted.\"Talk!\" Ye Yuan did not s.h.i.+ft his palm. He was waiting for Zhang Heng's answer.\"I'll talk, but you have to promise not to kill me. Otherwise, I'd rather die than say!\" Zhang Heng painfully made his decision and threatened him.\"Is that so? Then bring it with you inside your coffin!\" Ye Yuan channeled his palm strength and moved a little closer to Zhang Heng.\"Don't don't don't! I'll talk, I'll talk! I-its Senior Apprentice Brother Lin Tiancheng who instructed me. I was only obeying him! He's the head student of the General Affairs Department, so I can't disobey him! Junior Apprentice Brother Ye, I beg you, let me go. I will definitely help you testify against Lin Tiancheng!\"G.o.d knows where Zhang Heng got the strength from, to manage to crawl up and grab hold of Ye Yuan's leg as he cried out.\"Good. You can die now!\"Ye Yuan's palm struck down, and Zhang Heng died without even making any sound.Regardless of whether he was obeying others or not, he deserved to die ten thousand times over just for forcing Lu-er to such a state!\"Lin Tiancheng?\" Ye Yuan thought for a moment and recalled who this Lin Tiancheng was.He did not think that it was actually such a minor character that made Lu-er end up in such a sorry state. If he knew this beforehand, he would have taken preventive measures.Right at this moment, Lu-er's movement alerted Ye Yuan. He quickly rushed over to Lu-er.Lu-er already had no more strength to stand up. She was currently crawling forward!\"Lu-er, what are you doing?! If there's anything, just tell me! I will do it for you!\" Ye Yuan shouted as he rushed over.Lu-er continued moving forward bit by bit and finally crawled in front of that blue color badge.She reached out to grab that Alchemy Master badge and held it against her chest as if that blue badge was her everything.Ye Yuan hurriedly picked up Lu-er. After Lu-er got the badge, she could finally no longer hold on and fainted. Except, she still had a hint of a smile on her face, looking completely satisfied.Looking at the object in Lu-er's hand, he could not help feeling his heart ached.An insignificant badge to him was cherished so deeply by Lu-er!\"Thank you, Lu-er. Let's go home!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to the academy's rules, killing fellow students is the death penalty!\"Feng Ruoqing gave a faint sigh as she revealed herself and blocked Ye Yuan's path.Ye Yuan stopped, and then he retorted, \"If Feng Zhirou ended up like this because of someone, what would you do?\"\". . .\"Feng Ruoqing was speechless. The answer was obvious.\"Those people were sentenced to death because they weren't talented enough. If they had sufficient potential and had adequate strength, I think the academy would not kill them, but instead, heavily nurture them, right?\" Ye Yuan said indifferently.Ye Yuan's words were sufficiently arrogant. But what he said was logical and natural!Regardless of whether it was his past life or this life, Ye Yuan could look down proudly on all the pinnacle geniuses under the heavens!Just imagine how great of a genius he was to have been hailed as the one most likely to breakthrough to the Alchemy G.o.d realm in the Divine Realm, where geniuses were as many as oxen hair.Now that he transmigrated and lived once more, why would he give a s.h.i.+t about this tiny State of Qin?Feng Ruoqing remained silent for a while, but she still nodded and said, \"It's like you said. In reality, there are still people who weren't killed, but instead, became heavily groomed by the academy. Five years ago, a shockingly dazzling figure appeared in the academy. But because his brother was bullied by someone, he killed a student in a fit of rage. The outcome was that not only did the academy not dole out punishment, but he was also groomed heavily.\"\"Haha. Sure enough! Then what are you worried about? Don't tell me I'm inferior to him?\"Feng Ruoqing shook her head and said slowly, \"Because you aren't killing only one person!\"\"Just a bunch of trash. If they're killed, then they're killed.\" Ye Yuan could not care less.Anyone who dared to touch the people he treasured dearly, would have to be prepared to be killed. A tiny little Lin Tiancheng, if he was killed, then he was killed. What else could they do?\"But I've heard of this Lin Tiancheng before. He's a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm. Even though you advanced amazingly fast, are you his match? If you won, then that's fine. But if you lost, some people would not let you off so easily.\"Ye Yuan shook his head and did not explain anything. He just pa.s.sed Lu-er over to Feng Ruoqing.\"If you treat me as a friend, then just help me take good care of Lu-er.\"Feng Zhirou did not know why, but when she heard these words, she felt delighted in her heart.Ye Yuan was clearly her student. Was it not strange to be friends? But why was it so natural?\"I'm your teacher!\" Feng Zhirou put on a solemn face and said.Ye Yuan waved his hands like he was not willing to get tangled up on this question.\"Support Lu-er up. I'm going to help her suppress the frost poison in her body. Otherwise, she might not survive the night.\"Feng Ruoqing obeyed and lifted Lu-er up properly. Ye Yuan then rapidly struck over a dozen points on Lu-er's body. After that, he lifted up her palm and transferred his own essence energy over.In terms of extreme yang and strength, the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art that Ye Yuan cultivated was a cultivation law which pushed them to the extremity.When compared to his cultivation law, the cultivation law Feng Zhirou trained in was like a small witch meeting a great sorcerer.Ye Yuan's essence energy was incomparably thick, making it perfect for suppressing the Nine Yin Frost Poison. But this could only treat the symptoms and not the root of the problem.A Nine Yin Divine Link Meridian was an innate Nine Yin Absolute Meridian. Once the frost poison erupted, it would be like an ice blackhole, automatically sucking all the surrounding cold qi into the body, extremely terrifying.No matter how powerful Ye Yuan's essence energy was, it could not contend with the heaven and earth cold yin power. It could only temporarily suppress the frost poison in Lu-er's body.After Ye Yuan withdrew his hand, Lu-er's face became rosier. But she was still unconscious.\"I'll leave Lu-er to you. I'm going to kill some people!\" After saying this, Ye Yuan turned around and left.. . . . . .The entrance of the General Affairs Department was a rather busy place with streams of people coming and going.Ye Yuan stepped past the doorway but was stopped by two students.\"What rank are you? What's your purpose of coming to the General Affairs Department?\" one of the students questioned him.They did not stop everyone they saw. A single look and they could tell Ye Yuan did not appear friendly, and that something was wrong. That was why he was stopped.\"To kill people!\"Those three words casually popped out from Ye Yuan's mouth, sending a chill down the backs of the two students who heard it.\"A-are you joking?! The Dan Wu Academy forbids students from privately committing murder. Are you trying to violate the academy's rules?\"This student was also at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, but under Ye Yuan's pressure, his essence energy showed signs of becoming unstable.\"I don't have time to joke with you. Where's Lin Tiancheng? Ask him to come out and die!\"\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin? Were you hit on the head? Quickly leave! If you still don't go, then we won't be courteous!\" The other person was slightly better, and he just wanted to chase Ye Yuan away.A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm talking nonsense about wanting to kill a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm expert. If his brain were not damaged, then what was it?Ye Yuan simply ignored these two people and directly forced his way through between the two of them.These two people were in charge of guarding the entrance, so they naturally could not let Ye Yuan in like this. Hence, they used all of their power to try to stop Ye Yuan.Boom!Their hands did not even touch Ye Yuan before they were sent flying a long way out by the essence energy Ye Yuan released, which automatically opened up a pathway.Even though they were similarly at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, the difference was too huge!The thickness of Ye Yuan's essence energy was multiple times that of the same realm. How could these two people possibly be Ye Yuan's match?\"S-someone's causing trouble. Stop him! Quick! Notify Senior Apprentice Brother Lin!\"One of the students was very dedicated to his job. After landing on the ground, he ignored the pain on his body and shouted loudly.The activity outside alarmed the people inside. Now that he shouted like that, the students who just came out immediately knew what happened.An Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm student came up to stop Ye Yuan. He rebuked angrily, \"Who are you? How audacious. Do you know what place this is to actually dare to cause trouble here?!\"Ye Yuan did not bother with him and continued walking forward.\"Courting death!\"Seeing Ye Yuan's supercilious att.i.tude, that student immediately raged. He forced his way forward, wanting to teach Ye Yuan a lesson.Ye Yuan casually unleashed a palm, and that student flew out, landing heavily against the wall before he stopped.\"Siiii . . .\"Everyone sucked in a cold breath!Ye Yuan clearly only had the strength of a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, but a casual palm had such power, to send an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm flying.It was very obvious that Ye Yuan already showed mercy. Otherwise, that Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm student would be a dead man right now.\"Stacking Waves Layered Palm! H-he's Ye Yuan!\"Right then, someone in the crowd recognized Ye Yuan's palm technique, and he immediately deduced Ye Yuan's ident.i.ty.There was only one person who could casually unleash the Stacking Waves Layered Palm within the Dan Wu Academy, and that was Ye Yuan.Other than him, even Head Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang could not do it!\"Quick! Quickly inform Senior Apprentice Brother Lin! Say that Ye Yuan came to the General Affairs Department to make trouble! Let's stop him together. I don't believe that so many of us can't even handle a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\" a student who seemed to be a student manager shouted out.As expected, the others also perked up after his speech.That's right. No matter how powerful Ye Yuan was, he was still only one person. Many among them were Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm, and quite a few were at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm. How could he defeat so many people?Ye Yuan swept his gaze across everyone, making everybody shuddered.\"Have you all thought things through? Every wrong has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. I'm only looking for Lin Tiancheng alone. Are you all sure you want to be accomplices?\" Ye Yuan asked calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The middle court was where the student managers of the General Affairs Department managed work. The inner court was where important figures dealt with businesses.Presently, Lin Tiancheng was in the inner court a.s.signing tasks to the student managers.\"All of you, quickly handle the matters that I just instructed! Supervision of newly admitted students has to be reinforced. Make them obey submissively. If anyone causes trouble, then just directly suppress them. There's no need to be polite!\"Lin Tiancheng was issuing orders to a bunch of people with the air of someone of the upper echelon.\"Yes, Senior Apprentice Brother Lin. We will do it right away!\" Finis.h.i.+ng, several people turned around and left.Boom! Boom! Boom!A frantic knocking was heard.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, something bad has happened! Something bad has happened!\" Outside the door, a student kicked up a racket, making Lin Tiancheng frown.Lin Tiancheng had always been very strict with the rules. People at the lower levels had never dared to cause such a ruckus when entering. Today, there was actually someone who collided head-on with the tip of the spear!Creak!The door was opened by a student manager who reprimanded angrily. \"What's the commotion about? Don't you know that Senior Apprentice Brother Lin is busy? Is your skin itching for a whipping?\"That student ignored him and just went around him, crying to Lin Tiancheng, \"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, something bad has happened! That Ye Yuan is currently causing a commotion outside the department. Senior Apprentice Brother Hu went up to stop him, but was sent flying with a slap! He even said . . . he even said . . .\"When Lin Tiancheng heard Ye Yuan's name, his face immediately fell.Looks like he found out about Lu-er being bullied by Zhang Heng, and the flames of fury attacked his heart, which was why he came to the General Affairs Department to cause such an upheaval.Thinking of this, Lin Tiancheng gave a cold laugh. \"Do you all just eat rice and do nothing? Just a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm managed to frighten you all until this manner? That Hu Tie is also a trash, to be sent flying with a single slap from a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, Ye Yuan, h-he isn't only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\"Mmm? Not only Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm? Don't tell me he really entered closed-seclusion to breakthrough to the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm?\"\"A-also not the Fifth Level Essence Qi Realm.\" That student shook his head like a rattle drum.Looking at this appearance, Lin Tiancheng became infuriated. \"Can you not talk like you are out of breath?! Just what's Ye Yuan strength? He can't have been in a closed-door seclusion for a few days and reached the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, right?\"This time around, that student's head was like a chicken pecking for rice as he nodded non-stop. \"T-that's right! Ye Yuan is already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"What?!\"Including Lin Tiancheng, all the student managers in the room were astonished.They were, of course, aware of what strength Ye Yuan possessed. Around ten days ago, Ye Yuan had just made Lin Tiancheng lose face greatly. Back then, he was still at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.Just a mere ten days or so had pa.s.sed, and Ye Yuan was already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm?He jumped from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Third Level Essence Qi Realm. Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm could also be jumped?Just what was happening to this world?The crux was that not only did Ye Yuan increase his cultivation realm extremely fast, his strength also improved by leaps and bounds.Did they not just hear what this punk said? He sent Hu Tie flying with one slap! Hu Tie was an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm, and he could not even take a hit. Would that not mean that Ye Yuan possessed at least the strength of a Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm?After the shock, Lin Tiancheng's face grew darker.He did not expect that Ye Yuan would have the power to threaten him so fast. It looked like it was already hopeless for Zhang Heng.\"Humph! Just Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm! You are all veteran Earth rank students. Don't tell me every one of you are scared of a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm? Are you all even Dan Wu Academy's students? You, go out and tell them to attack together! If they can't even restrain a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, then what does the General Affairs Department need them for?\" Lin Tiancheng shamelessly used the people outside as his s.h.i.+eld.Lin Tiancheng was not really scared of Ye Yuan. But if he could use those people outside to diminish Ye Yuan's battle strength, then why not?\". . . . . .\"Have you all thought things through? Every wrong has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. I'm only looking for Lin Tiancheng alone. Are you all sure you want to be accomplices?\"Ye Yuan took a step forward. The students outside the department were affected by his aura and retreated a step in unison.Ye Yuan took another step forward, and the crowd stepped back once more.A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm managed to force a group of Seventh and Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm students back!If this were spread outside, there would no longer be a need for the General Affairs Department to exist.Right at this moment, the student who went to report to Lin Tiancheng just now rushed back. \"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin said to attack together and take him down first! He's just at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. If you all can't deal with this, then what do we need you for? If you all can't take down Ye Yuan, then forget about working in the General Affairs Department in the future!\"Once these words were out, everyone's faces changed.Lin Tiancheng had always lived up to his words. He would really replace all these people!Most of these Earth Rank students had no hope of advancing to the Heaven Rank, so they stayed here to do some work and fish for some benefits.If they did not work here, then they could possibly end up doing manual labor.That was obviously a result they did not wish to see!\"Fine! I don't believe that so many of us here can't take care of a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"\"Everyone, attack!\"Everybody gathered, surrounding Ye Yuan in the center.Ye Yuan did not stop them, and let them surround him.Finally, these people could no longer resist attacking Ye Yuan!From the front, an Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm student stabbed his sword towards Ye Yuan. Ye Yuan reached out and flicked a finger. That long sword immediately flew out of his hand.Another slap, and that Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm was sent flying.At the same time, a palm attack came from the back. It was like eyes were growing behind Ye Yuan as he evaded it by slightly s.h.i.+fting his body. Then, he slammed his arm backward, and that person also went airborne.For some time, the surroundings were filled with attacks, but n.o.body was able to really threaten Ye Yuan.Not only were they unable to pose any threat, Ye Yuan even moved forward as he fought. He was about to push past the outer court.People could be seen flying continuously out of the group surrounding Ye Yuan and landing heavily on the ground.In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan broke past these people's defense and pa.s.sed through the outer court.The majority of these people were at the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm and the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm. To the current Ye Yuan, there was completely no threat. Where his palm wind reached, a series of wailing sounded.The outer court was strewn with people lying on the ground and crying out shrilly.Ye Yuan did not stop. Grabbing a sword, he advanced inside like that with the sword in his hand.Entering the middle court, another group of people surrounded him. These people were the student managers of the General Affairs Department. Each one of them was like Zhang Heng; all existences of the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm!Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm was the pinnacle of existence in the Essence Qi Realm. It represented the apex of the Essence Qi Realm. Their strength was also much stronger than the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm.Ye Yuan would not care about a single person. But there were around seven or eight people now. They would not be a minor force anywhere.Ye Yuan looked at them and smiled coldly as he said, \"You guys are really loyal dogs. Wherever Lin Tiancheng points to, you guys would strike there! My words still remain the same. Every wrong has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor. I only want to kill Lin Tiancheng alone! If you want to be a dog, then you'd better be prepared to get beat up!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the Dan Wu Academy, n.o.body has ever dared to harp on about killing someone. I think you must be f*cking b.a.l.l.sy!\" 1Everyone found it extremely comical to see Ye Yuan behave so arrogantly.One could fight in the Dan Wu Academy and could also arrange for a deathmatch. But n.o.body had ever dared to talk about killing someone in such a dignified manner.The way they saw it, Ye Yuan was obviously posturing and wanted to use this sort of threat to force them back.Ye Yuan adjusted his sword in a showy manner and said coldly, \"Since that's the case, then there's nothing to talk about. I'll just have to beat up the guard dogs before going to beat the owner.\"With those words, Ye Yuan did not hesitate and then charged into the group with his sword.Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was executed, and his entire being became a series of afterimages as he pa.s.sed through these people.These student managers were all at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm. Apart from Heaven Rank students and a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm like Lin Tiancheng, they were virtually undefeatable existences in the Dan Wu Academy.But at this moment, they made a woeful discovery. They could not even touch the corner of Ye Yuan's sleeves.Ye Yuan's body moved elegantly like countless falling petals, completely traceless.These student managers were after all Ninth Level Essence Qi Realms, three minor cultivation realms above Ye Yuan. Wanting to defeat them was not so simple.Ye Yuan could naturally use brute force to deal with these people. But he did not wish to reveal his trump card too early.In the entire academy, apart from Feng Ruoqing who saw him use the Eight Layer Wave to kill Zhang Heng just now, n.o.body was aware that he could use the Eight Layer Wave.Lin Tiancheng was ultimately a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm. There was almost a major cultivation realm between him and Ye Yuan. It would not be a good thing if he got to know of his trump card beforehand.Using the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword to deal with the enemies could conserve essence energy and also numb his opponent. So why not?Even though Ye Yuan's flames of fury was soaring to the sky right now, he did not lose his reason.If he did not even have this shrewdness after living two lifetimes, then it was all wasted.The Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was created by imitating falling flowers. It paid particular attention to flowing with the wind naturally and elegantly, very economical on the usage of essence energy.Of course, the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword was not without weaknesses. The drawback was insufficient attack power.But in this sort of situation, Ye Yuan did not require much attack power.He made use of the elegant and nimble movements to give these students some injuries every now and then. As time pa.s.sed, their combat power dropped drastically.\"Aiyo! My arm!\"\"Ah! My leg!\"The curdling screams carried on incessantly. Unwittingly, many injuries had appeared on these student managers' bodies.\"Just what kind of a freak is this guy? Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm and he is this powerful!\"\"Stop! Stop! We admit defeat!\"\"That's right! Quickly stop! We surrender!\"One person was the first to speak, and everyone else's spirit immediately collapsed. Everyone quickly laid down their arms and surrendered.After breaking through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, it would be tough for Ye Yuan to find an opponent in the Essence Qi Realm anymore.Ye Yuan obviously would not slaughter everyone in a frenzy. Seeing that these people had the intention to back away, he threw down the sword in his hand indifferently and headed inside to the inner court.Grabbing a student doing ch.o.r.es in the inner court and forcing him to lead the way, Ye Yuan went to where Lin Tiancheng was.Ye Yuan kicked the door wide open with a leg, but the room was already empty, and Lin Tiancheng could not be seen anywhere.The back window was opened. Clearly, Lin Tiancheng escaped from here.Ye Yuan laughed coldly and took out a stick of Soul Guiding Incense. He came to the table and casually took up a book to burn. The Soul Guiding Incense became a wisp of green smoke and went with the wind.A martial artist's divine soul was powerful and would leave behind the scent of their soul in places where they frequently stopped by. The Soul Guiding Incense could differentiate these soul scents and track him down.When powerful martial artists were fleeing, they would conceal the scent of their soul. Hence, the use of the Soul Guiding Incense was not great. In his past life, Ye Yuan only found it fun, so he researched it a bit.But Lin Tiancheng evidently did not know how to hide the scent of his soul. It was useless no matter where he fled to.. . . . . .Ye Yuan's performance truly astonished Lin Tiancheng. Seven to eight Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm martial artists were defeated just like chopping vegetables.Although he did not believe Ye Yuan could really defeat him, at the very least, Ye Yuan already possessed the power to fight with him!Lin Tiancheng was one of those typical examples of people who bullied the weak but feared the strong. So he chose to run away.Ye Yuan had already wholly overturned the General Affairs Department. As long as the instructors found out about this matter, he would definitely be expelled. Hence, he had no need to fight it out with Ye Yuan.Right now, he was going to the back of the mountain to tattle to the instructor!\"What a brainless fellow! So what if he's a genius? Isn't he still screwed over by me, Lin Tiancheng?\" Being pleased with himself, the smile on Lin Tiancheng's face could not be concealed no matter what.Lin Tiancheng who was gloating did not notice that a wisp of green smoke spun a few rounds above his head, which then disappeared.The next moment, Lin Tiancheng's smile froze on his face. That was because his path ahead was blocked by someone. And that someone blocking him was precisely that hateful Ye Yuan.How was this possible?How did he know that I was here?Ye Yuan just stood in front of him coldly without even hiding his killing intent.Unknowingly, fear started to take place in Lin Tiancheng's heart as he looked at Ye Yuan's expression.\"Ye Yuan, don't push me too far! Do you really think that I'm scared of you?\" Lin Tiancheng was livid, trying to use this to cover up his guilt.\"Aren't you the one who forced me? Congratulations. You've succeeded in infuriating me. And the price for that is your life!\" Ye Yuan spoke slowly without any trace of emotion.\"Haha! You really don't know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! Don't tell me that you forgot what this place is? The Dan Wu Academy has never tolerated students killing students. Violators are sentenced to death! Do you wish to go against the academy's rules with your own strength?\" Lin Tiancheng guffawed.Ye Yuan shook his head and sighed as he said, \"You're really the same as that guy in the medicine garden, treating the academy's rules as your protective talisman! It's because something like the academy's rules that you guys dared to touch my people, right?\"Hearing Ye Yuan's sigh, Lin Tiancheng suddenly felt a chill arise from the bottom of his heart, and the ominous feeling in his heart would not go away.\"W-what did you do to Zhang Heng?\"\"Don't you know the answer already?\" Ye Yuan replied calmly as if he did something not even worth mentioning.Lin Tiancheng was like a cat whose tail was stepped on, and cried out in shock, \"Y-you really killed Zhang Heng? You really dare to kill people?! Are you insane? You'll be put to death! Hahaha! You are dead, Ye Yuan!\"Ye Yuan let out another sigh and said, \"So weak. All you talk about is the academy's rules. No wonder you kept failing the Earth Rank Advancement test. It's because . . . you don't have the heart of a powerhouse!\"Lin Tiancheng trembled. Ye Yuan's words directly struck his trauma and exposed his weakest area!\"You think that you're very exalted being the head student of the General Affairs Department. In reality, it's displaying your weakness! How many of the students who pa.s.sed the Earth Rank Advancement test came out of there? I came to kill you, but you made your subordinates become your fodders. Finally, you flee without fighting. You don't even dare to fight once. You want to tell the instructor that I'm causing a commotion at the general affairs, right? You are basically a coward! Someone like you would never become a true powerhouse!\"Ye Yuan's words were like a heavy hammer, striking Lin Tiancheng's spirit one blow after another, leaving him short on breath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A puny Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm dares to talk c.r.a.p about being a powerhouse in front of me? What a joke!\"Lin Tiancheng finally lost it and dismissed Ye Yuan's words.\"Is that so? Then what are you scared of? Quickly come and finish off me, this puny Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\" Ye Yuan words were filled with countless mocking.\"Humph! You think I can't detect such a low level goading action? Fine! I will do as you wish today, and let you witness what are a true expert is!\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Lin Tiancheng's half-step Spirit Condensation Realm aura was released and smashed towards Ye Yuan.Lin Tiancheng was not stupid. His biggest advantage was cultivation realm, so he obviously had to make good use of it.A Spirit Condensation Realm could rely solely on his realm's pressure to make an Essence Qi Realm's essence energy slow down and become stagnant. Although his half-step Spirit Condensation Realm could not fully unleash the pressure of a Spirit Condensation Realm, it already had quite a bit of power.Spirit Condensation Realm, was actually compressing the essence energy within the Dantian to its limits, achieving the realm where the acc.u.mulated qi becomes liquid; it was a one-time advancement of the body's essence energy.Hence, regardless of whether in terms of quant.i.ty or quality, a Spirit Condensation Realm's essence energy greatly surpa.s.sed that of normal essence energy!Wanting to defeat a Spirit Condensation Realm with the strength of essence energy was an extremely tough thing to do. One either required extremely powerful martial techniques to bridge the difference in cultivation realm or use heaven-defying medicinal pills to compensate for the difference in power.But regardless of the method used, the prerequisite was that this method was able to compensate for the difference in power between an Essence Qi Realm and a Spirit Condensation Realm!The so-called half-step Spirit Condensation Realm meant that the martial artist was in the process of liquefying their acc.u.mulated qi and already partially had the power of a Spirit Condensation Realm!The power of a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm was already sufficient to crush any Essence Qi Realm martial artist.Lin Tiancheng was pretty talented. He could have broken through to the Spirit Condensation Realm long ago but had always suppressed his strength at half-step Spirit Condensation Realm for the Earth Rank Advancement test.However, his comprehension was still a little lacking, so he had been unable to advance his martial technique's mastery. Hence, he had no way of jumping ranks to defeat the five black-clothed Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists.After all, he was only half-step Spirit Condensation Realm. There was still a very large gap compared to a true Spirit Condensation Realm.Seeing Lin Tiancheng used his cultivation realm's suppression to deal with him, Ye Yuan laughed coldly.\"Trying to use cultivation to suppress me? It's a shame that your cultivation realm is too low!\"If a Third Level Spirit Condensation Realm and above used this move to deal with him, it would really be troublesome. But a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm doing it was basically trying to scratch an itch through one's boots.Ye Yuan fully released the essence energy in his body right then, and his aura soared, pus.h.i.+ng Lin Tiancheng's aura back!Only an instant had pa.s.sed, and these two people's auras were matched with each other's. Neither of them was able to do anything to the other!This was originally a noisy place, and now, many students gathered to gawk. When they saw that Ye Yuan's aura was evenly matched with Lin Tiancheng's aura, they were stunned speechless.\"No way. Is that Ye Yuan really only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm?\"\"Absolutely! He can actually be evenly matched with Senior Apprentice Brother Lin under the suppression of cultivation realm. This is too sick!\"\"Doesn't this mean that his power's no less than a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm?\"\"That should be it theoretically. But doesn't that mean that even though Ye Yuan is only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, the thickness of his essence energy was already not inferior to a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm? I-isn't this too ridiculous!\"Of course, this was not a joke. The thickness of Ye Yuan's essence energy was really terrifying!Since the start of First Level Essence Qi Realm, the essence energy that Ye Yuan consumed during cultivation was several times of others.Under the acc.u.mulation of so many realms, the density of Ye Yuan's essence energy was already pretty impressive. That was why he could stand up to Lin Tiancheng in terms of aura.The density of essence energy was not about having a large reserve, but rather, having the purity of essence energy, which greatly surpa.s.sed that of the same realm.As an example, Ye Yuan and some other Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm executed the same martial technique. Other people required one unit of essence energy, while Ye Yuan only needed one-third of a unit or even a fifth!This was why Ye Yuan was powerful!Seeing Ye Yuan not losing in terms of aura, Lin Tiancheng's expression became extremely ugly.Since he could not suppress Ye Yuan using cultivation realm, Lin Tiancheng could only fight directly with him!However, Ye Yuan knew an abnormal martial technique like the Stacking Waves Layered Palm. A moment of lapse, and it would be serious injuries, possibly even death!At this moment, Lin Tiancheng naturally would not naively believe that Ye Yuan would have any qualms about some rules.This was a life and death match!\"Humph! So what if your aura is strong? Today, I will let you witness just what a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm is! Thunderous Fist!\"Lin Tiancheng's punch struck towards Ye Yuan. There were even traces of electricity on the fist. It was precisely a superior-grade Tier 1 martial technique which Ye Yuan saw in the Scripture Library, the Thunderous Fist!The power of a superior-grade Tier 1 martial technique unleashed by a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm was truly terrifying.Although this punch did not smash towards them, the surrounding students similarly felt enormous pressure, let alone Ye Yuan who was receiving it directly.\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin's Thunderous Fist is really scary. I'm afraid it's already trained to the great success stage.\"\"Yeah. Even though that punch wasn't aimed at me, I still feel short of breath now. He's really worthy of being the strongest in the Earth ranking. How frightening!\"\"Ye Yuan's really straining himself! At any rate, Senior Apprentice Brother Lin is a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm. How could he be defeated so easily?\"\"Listening to their conversation just now, it's actually a deathmatch. Just what kind of deep hatred do they have with each other? Even if they really killed the other party, they also can't escape the academy's punishment!\"\"Why do you care so much? Since there's a show, just watch. It won't implicate you anyway.\"Ye Yuan also felt the pressure coming head-on while facing Lin Tiancheng's lightning-attribute martial technique.A Half-step Spirit Condensation Realm was indeed powerful!Ye Yuan did not choose to clash head-on with Lin Tiancheng but decided to evade instead.Ye Yuan's feet s.h.i.+fted and executed Instant Flash, vanis.h.i.+ng in a blink of an eye, leaving behind an afterimage where he was initially at.Lin Tiancheng's punch was halfway there when he saw this. He laughed coldly and said, \"Afterimage? Humph! Paltry tricks! Seven-Star Steps!\"Lin Tiancheng also disappeared halfway.\"Low-grade Tier 2 martial technique, Seven-Star Steps! Ye Yuan's in danger!\"\"That's right. Tier 2 martial technique is too much of a bully!\"The crowd exclaimed in shock.Seven-Star Steps was a low-grade Tier 2 martial technique, while Instant Flash was only a middle-grade Tier 1 martial technique. The difference between the two was enormous!Tier 2 martial techniques were mostly used employed with Spirit Condensation Realm's essence energy. The effects were naturally different from Tier 1 martial techniques which were activated with essence energy of the Essence Qi Realm.Even if Ye Yuan's Instant Flash had already transcended the boundaries of Great Circle stage and reached the Breaking Illusion stage, it was still inferior to a Tier 2 martial technique. After all, the grade of Instant Flash was too low.Ye Yuan revealed himself, and at the same time, sensed an extreme danger coming from the back.Having no time to think, he used Instant Flash once more and vanished on the spot.However, that sense of danger did not fade and kept latching on him like a parasitic maggot.Only now did Ye Yuan realize that he underestimated Lin Tiancheng. The strongest among Earth Ranks was not for a laugh. His power was already bordering close to Heaven Rank and was much stronger than the average First Level Spirit Condensation Realm!Judging based on the Illusionary Spirit Tower's standards, Lin Tiancheng could most likely finish off four black-clothed martial artists with only a narrow margin away from pa.s.sing the test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The General Affair Department's head student, Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, and that genius Earth rank student who's recently in the limelight, Ye Yuan, started fighting. There's going to be a great show to watch!\"\"Ye Yuan? Isn't he only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm? Senior Apprentice Brother Lin was already at the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm a long time ago. How could Ye Yuan possibly be his match?\"\"Are you stupid? Didn't Ye Yuan enter a closed-door seclusion a few days ago? He exited seclusion and is already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"W-what? Closed-seclusion for a few days and Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm? That fellow is seriously a freak! But even if he's at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, he couldn't possibly be Senior Apprentice Brother Lin's match, right?\"\"Who knows? I also just heard from other people. There seems to be some great enmity between the two of them, which provoked Ye Yuan so much so that he wants to kill Senior Apprentice Brother Lin even knowing the academy's rule!\"\"There's such a thing? Come! Let's quickly go look!\"The news of Ye Yuan and Lin Tiancheng's deathmatch quickly spread throughout the entire Dan Wu Academy. Two students debated over it for a while in a corner of the academy and then they rushed over to watch the show.But their discussion reached another person's ear. Wan Yuan just happened to be nearby, and when he heard these two people's conversation, a hint of a cold smile flashed across his face.He did not think that Lin Tiancheng was so daring, to actually directly provoke Ye Yuan to violate the academy's rules!Now, no matter whether it was Ye Yuan who killed Lin Tiancheng or Lin Tiancheng who killed Ye Yuan, he could sit there and enjoy the fisherman's gains!Previously, he let Liu Ruoshui goaded Lin Tiancheng on, and that fellow really fell for it.Lin Tiancheng was narrow-minded. Just by sowing discord slightly, he became jealous and hated Ye Yuan.Wan Yuan was still having a headache these two days as Ye Yuan's improvement became increasingly faster. Not only was he reaching Wan Yuan on the Martial Path, he completely crushed him on the Alchemy Path.Who would have thought that Lin Tiancheng directly provoked Ye Yuan?After listening to the two people's conversation, Wan Yuan was excited but was also shocked.Ye Yuan went into seclusion and was at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm after coming out!He could pa.s.s through the Black Rank Advancement test at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm. Didn't that mean that Ye Yuan could already completely crush him with his current strength?Just a month plus!A month plus, and Ye Yuan and his position had totally flipped over.A month ago, he could easily crush Ye Yuan. A month later, Ye Yuan was already an existence that he looked up to.Preposterous! Just what the h.e.l.l happened?!Wan Yuan was so aggrieved. Nothing made someone sadder than being stepped underfoot by somebody they looked down upon.Bringing along this grievance, Wan Yuan also headed over.He really wanted to watch the sight of Ye Yuan being killed by Lin Tiancheng or Ye Yuan killing Lin Tiancheng, and then being sentenced to death by the academy.. . . . . .Lin Tiancheng's Seven-Star Steps was already trained to the small success stage. It was just a little bit faster than Ye Yuan's Instant Flas.h.!.+Currently, Ye Yuan was already forced into a perilous situation by him. If he were careless and got hit, then there would probably be no chance for victory!The Thunderous Fist belonged to the lightning attribute martial techniques category. It similarly leaned towards attack power and even had a numbing effect.The moment he got hit, Ye Yuan would basically no longer have the strength to retaliate!In terms of speed, Ye Yuan could not shake off Lin Tiancheng. In terms of attack, Ye Yuan had already lost the initiative now.He was currently in an extremely defensive situation.\"Haha! Run! Keep running! I love this sort of cat catching mice game the most! Overconfident punk, I thought you were very powerful. So you only have this bit of ability?\" Lin Tiancheng laughed wildly as he chased Ye Yuan.Lin Tiancheng seemed like he had the strength to spare!Ye Yuan appeared once more, and Lin Tiancheng appeared beside him at almost the same instant. The Thunderous Fist directly struck Ye Yuan's chest!However this time around, Ye Yuan unexpectedly did not run away. He raised his right hand like lightning, and essence energy in his palm spread out.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Four Layer Wave!Boom!One fist clashed with one palm, and the two people clashed and flew backward.Lin Tiancheng's body only flew backward almost seven meters, but Ye Yuan flew for ten meters!Very clearly, Ye Yuan had the lower-hand in this clash.Lin Tiancheng stabilized his body and laughed coldly as he said, \"So, you actually mastered the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Four Layer Wave. No wonder you dare to be so arrogant! However, this Stacking Waves Layered Palm can only deal with Essence Qi Realms. To handle me . . . you have a long way to go! Right now, do you feel like your hands are going numb, and your essence energy isn't circulating properly? Hahaha . . .\"As he spoke, Lin Tiancheng laughed wildly without stopping.Just now, Ye Yuan was still talking rampantly about the heart of a powerhouse. But now, he was suppressed by him. This made him very gleeful!Lin Tiancheng admitted that Ye Yuan was a genius. But so what if he was a genius? Did he not still lose to him?This feeling of crus.h.i.+ng geniuses was simply satisfying!Ye Yuan's right hand became a little numb, and the circulation of essence energy also became somewhat stagnant.This Thunderous Fist indeed had a well-deserved reputation. It was actually on par with the Four Layer Wave.Of course, Lin Tiancheng still had to give credit to his cultivation realm to be able to rely on the Thunderous Fist to draw with Ye Yuan. Half-step Spirit Condensation Realm was no joke. It was almost a major cultivation realm higher than Ye Yuan!In the past, it had always been Ye Yuan who used speed to crush his opponent. He did not expect that he would be completely suppressed by Lin Tiancheng in terms of speed today!Without the advantage in speed, he had no way of attacking with his full power. Lin Tiancheng would not give him the chance to strike.The situation was very unfavorable!Ye Yuan secretly revolved his essence energy to purge the lightning attribute essence energy entwined in his palm in order to relieve his numbed state.How could Lin Tiancheng give him this opportunity?\"Trying to relieve the numbness? Are you treating me as a three-year-old kid? Die!\"Right at this moment, Lin Tiancheng moved again!The Seven Star Steps was executed, and he crossed the several meters distance, arriving in front of Ye Yuan.Boom!Another exchange and the two people separated once more.This time around, Lin Tiancheng only retreated around six meters, while Ye Yuan backed over a dozen meters!It was apparent that after being affected by the numbness in his right hand, Ye Yuan's disadvantage grew even greater.Lin Tiancheng did not plan on giving Ye Yuan the chance to catch his breath. After adjusting his breathing, his Thunderous Fist struck out once more.Just like that, one heavy punch after another, Lin Tiancheng's advantage grew even greater!. . . . . .\"Sigh. Ye Yuan's improvement is quick, but he overestimated himself. I also know that Lin Tiancheng. He is, after all, a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm and known as the strongest student in the Earth rank. Ye Yuan wants to challenge him at only Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm? Isn't this just asking for it?\"In a pavilion, Zuo Bugui was complaining.Standing by his side was Long Tang. He was naturally also alerted to such a major event.\"I think Ye Yuan isn't such a reckless person. He might have some cards to play.\" Long Tang frowned as he watched the battle far away.However, Zuo Bugui did not agree, and he said, \"What other cards could he have left? I admit that he's truly a top genius that only appears once every 50 years. He even surpa.s.ses you and me, and he actually mastered the Four Layer Wave. But even his Four Layer Wave can't handle Lin Tiancheng. What other moves could he have left? Such a pity! Too bad!\"Long Tang's brows furrowed even tighter. His view was the same as Zuo Bugui. He really could not tell what other resort Ye Yuan possibly had.Regardless whether it was speed or attack, he was completely suppressed. A defeat was set!However, he did not know why, but he just felt that Ye Yuan had other cards he had not yet shown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Really? You also have the same feeling as me? This Ye Yuan is truly a genius, but he's too short-tempered and impatient. I reckon this has to do with his sudden rise.\"Zuo Bugui's words poured on unceasingly, but Long Tang seemed to pay no heed. The two of them seemed to have formed a tacit agreement. Every time they met, they would chat in such a manner.\"Perhaps what you said is right. But looking at last time when he went underwent the deathmatch with Fei Qingping, this Ye Yuan is somebody who plans first and then takes action. He definitely wouldn't rush to his death so carelessly.\" Long Tang was still very insistent.\"Sigh! I say, why are you so stubborn? Why don't we bet on it? I've been salivating over your Spirit Essence Pill for a long time.\" Zuo Bugui still behaved sloppily.\"A bet?\" Long Tang looked at Zup Bugui with probing eyes.\"That's right, a bet! Don't you think that Ye Yuan has some trump card that could save the situation? We'll bet on their victory and defeat. How's that?\" Zuo Bugui met Long Tang's eyes openly without hiding his desire for the Spirit Essence Pill in the slightest.Spirit Essence Pill was a Tier 2 medicinal pill that the Dan Wu Academy awarded to Long Tang. It could increase the success rate when a Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist was impacting a minor realm's bottleneck by 70%!To the Dan Wu Academy's geniuses, this sort of medicinal pill was undoubtedly a miracle pill for breaking through realms!Geniuses like Long Tang and Zuo Bugui already had a much higher chance of breaking through bottlenecks when compared to other people. With the help of the Spirit Essence Pill, breaking through cultivation realms was virtually settled.Even for a major bottleneck from the Third Level Spirit Condensation Realm to the Fourth Level, the Spirit Essence Pill also had a 40% effect. One could see just how powerful this medicinal pill was!However, the Spirit Essence Pill was extremely rare even in a place like the Dan Wu Academy. It was seldom awarded to students.It was because Long Tang became rank one on the Martial Roll of Honor that the academy awarded a Spirit Essence Pill.He could never bear to use it and did not think that Zuo Bugui had been eyeing this for a long time.Long Tang looked at Zuo Bugui and suddenly smiled. \"Fine. I'll bet with you! But what do you intend to use as a bet?Long Tang used the Spirit Essence Pill as the bet, so Zuo Bugui naturally also had to take out something of equivalent value to bet.Zuo Bugui was a little surprised by how quickly Long Tang agreed.He even thought that Long Tang would not have agreed, so he purposely used words to spur him on. He did not expect him to really agree.\"Haha. Since you are so straightforward, I also can't be too stingy. During the previous Endless Trials, I was fortunate enough to obtain a peak Tier 2 Sharp Horned Beast's inner core. How's that for a bet?\" Zuo Bugui laughed loudly, giving the feeling like his scheme had worked.Hearing this, Long Tang's face changed color. \"I didn't think that you had something so good! A peak Tier 2 Sharp Horned Beast's inner core is naturally enough.\"A peak Tier 2 Sharp Horned Beast was equivalent to a peak Spirit Condensation Realm human martial artist. But its combat power was much greater than a human martial artist of the same realm. It was very difficult to hunt and kill this demonic beast if one was not a Crystal Formation Realm martial artist.Sharp Horned Beast inner core could be used to refine Tier 2 and above medicinal pill, so it was obviously worth a fortune.Zuo Bugui smirked and had a proud look as he said, \"I didn't think you, Long Tang, would be clever all your life, but stupid this once! Your Spirit Essence Pill will soon be mine. Hahaha! Just look at Ye Yuan. He probably can't even lift his right arm now, am I right? What does he have . . .\"Zuo Bugui was talking halfway before abruptly stopping. It was because right at this moment, an unexpected change occurred between Lin Tiancheng and Ye Yuan's fight.Lin Tiancheng clashed with Ye Yuan seven, eight times consecutively. He had absolute upper-hand, while Ye Yuan's right hand was almost crippled already.Lin Tiancheng gave a cruel smile and unleashed another Thunderous Fist.But meanwhile, Ye Yuan could not even lift up his arm!Lin Tiancheng seemed to have seen the scene of a rising genius becoming a cripple under his fist.Ye Yuan appeared to have no moves left, and under the situation where his right arm could no longer move, he lifted his left arm.Ye Yuan's left palm struck out and clashed once more with Lin Tiancheng's Thunderous Fist.Everyone thought that Ye Yuan was definitely dead this time. But under their astonished eyes, Lin Tiancheng's body flew backward for several dozen meters!Puu!Lin Tiancheng directly spat out a large mouthful of blood in midair, staining his clothes red.\"E-eight Layer Wave! Just now, was that . . . Eight Layer Wave?\"\"H-how is this possible? He only used a month's time to comprehend the Eight Layer Wave? Is he still human?\"\"This fellow . . . completely doesn't belong in the scope of humans! Simply monstrous! Even if Senior Apprentice Brother Long were standing in front of him, he would be ashamed of his inferiority.\"Ye Yuan's Eight Layer Wave caused an uproar among the surrounding onlookers. Everyone was talking about it.Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eight Layer Wave. That martial technique virtually impossible to comprehend was grasped by Ye Yuan in a month!Who knew what they would think if they knew that Ye Yuan had already comprehended the Eight Layer Wave back when he killed Fei Qingping.It was not that Ye Yuan wanted to be beaten up, but rather, Lin Tiancheng was really too strong!If Ye Yuan had displayed the Eight Layer Wave from the start, Lin Tiancheng definitely would not clash with him.The moment Lin Tiancheng was on guard against it, Ye Yuan would not cause much threat to Lin Tiancheng even if he used the Eight Layer Wave.In the end, Ye Yuan's cultivation realm was too low!16 times the unleashed power of a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm was indeed enough to kill a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist. But Lin Tiancheng was not yet a dead person!Being hailed as the strongest in the Earth ranking, Lin Tiancheng was not some scrub like Zhang.How could someone hail as the strongest in the Earth ranking within the Dan Wu Academy where geniuses were like clouds be a good-for-nothing?Ye Yuan already noticed this when he matched up with Lin Tiancheng.Hence, he had been appearing to be weak so that Lin Tiancheng would lower his guard.Ye Yuan's Yin Yang Separation Flow Technique was at the acme of perfection, so the difference between left hand and right hand was not much of an issue to him.The power was not inferior to his right hand when he executed the Stacking Waves Layered Palm with his left hand!Ye Yuan had mustered up practically all the essence energy in his body for this blow. Lin Tiancheng was caught unprepared, and was severely injured by Ye Yuan!Ye Yuan could finish off a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist in the Illusionary Spirit Tower when he was at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm.Now that he was already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, one could imagine just how much power was in this palm!Lin Tiancheng was smacked flying backward for several dozen meters before landing heavily on the ground. There was no movement as he lay unconscious.The surroundings were completely silent. Everybody looked at Ye Yuan like they saw a monster.In the pavilion, Long Tang had a rare bout of a hearty laugh. \"What an Eight Layer Wave! An excellent tactic of appearing to be weak! Regardless whether it's scheming or strength, Ye Yuan ranks at the top! Such a terrifying opponent! I'm looking forward to you growing up quickly to fight me someday!\"Zuo Bugui opened his mouth and closed it again.Even until now, he dared not believe the scene before him. The contrast of before and after was too large!This was known as the most difficult Tier 1 martial technique in the Dan Wu Academy, the Stacking Waves Layered Palm!How could Ye Yuan that fellow possibly comprehends the Eight Layer Wave so quickly?\"Haha! Looks like you have no chance of getting my Spirit Essence Pill.\" Long Tang looked at Zuo Bugui with a smirk.. . . . . .Ye Yuan did not relax. He knew that this palm was insufficient to kill Lin Tiancheng. He was going to follow up another palm!Arriving in front of Lin Tiancheng with an Instant Flash, another palm struck out.Boom!A large cavity was blasted out in the ground!It missed Lin Tiancheng!Several meters away, Lin Tiancheng glared at Ye Yuan with venomous eyes. He howled angrily, \"Ye Yuan! You forced me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You forced me!\" Lin Tiancheng looked at Ye Yuan venomously.Lin Tiancheng's aura suddenly grew stronger, and the surrounding essence energy poured madly towards Lin Tiancheng.When Ye Yuan saw this, his face became very grave!\"Look, quickly! Senior Apprentice Brother Lin, he . . . he's breaking through! He wants to break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm!\"\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin could have broken through to the Spirit Condensation Realm long ago. He only suppressed his strength at half-step Spirit Condensation Realm for the Earth Rank Advancement test.\"\"Alas, Senior Apprentice Brother Lin is also forced to his wit's end by Ye Yuan. Who would have thought that he could master the Eight Layer Wave? That's 32 times the power!\"\"That's right. Ye Yuan's too strong. He's only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, and he could actually force the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm Senior Apprentice Brother Lin to such a state! But . . . it's over. Senior Apprentice Brother Lin's breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, and Ye Yuan's trump cards are all used up. There's no more chance of victory.\"The crowd was clearly pessimistic about Ye Yuan. When Lin Tiancheng was at the half-step Spirit Condensation Realm, Ye Yuan was already straining. Now that he was breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, what could Ye Yuan use to fight with him?Over 300 meters away, in the pavilion, Zuo Bugui patted his chest with a frightened look. \"Oh my G.o.d. Scared this little master to death. Tried to steal the chicken, but nearly ended up losing the rice. I almost ended up losing the Sharp Horned Beast's inner core which I had a hard time getting. I say, Old Long, now can you hand over your Spirit Essence Pill?\"Long Tang looked on and also sighed secretly.No matter how Ye Yuan calculated, he probably did not expect Lin Tiancheng breaking through at the last moment. He could only wait now!Even though he did not want to admit it in his heart, he knew that Ye Yuan's chances of victory were not high.But what he thought was one thing, what he actually said was another. \"What are you anxious about? It isn't over yet!\"\"Hehe. You really won't give up until all hope is gone! It's already like this. Ye Yuan doesn't even have 10% chance of victory. What are you still stubbornly holding on for?\"\"You already said that he has less than 10% chance of succeeding. As long as the chance isn't zero, then there's hope.\"Although he was stubborn, Long Tang was somebody like this. It was impossible for him to give up until it was truly hopeless.Zuo Bugui was dumbfounded and could only say, \"Fine! Let's just wait and see! After they finish fighting, won't you still obediently hand over the Spirit Essence Pill?\". . . . . .In another pavilion, a youth and a middle-aged man stood with their hands behind their backs.\"Second Uncle, what do you think?\" the youth opened his mouth and asked the middle-aged man.\"If this child's not eliminated, he will definitely be a calamity to the Su Family!\"\"I think so too! I also don't know what happened to him. This month's improvement was simply too terrifying!\"\"Regardless of what happened, this child absolutely can't be spared! Just Ye Hang alone is already very troublesome to deal with. If his son were allowed to grow up, the Su Family would likely have to exit the medicinal herbs market in the future!\"The youth was in full agreement. He nodded and asked, \"Second Uncle, over at the disciplinary hall . . .?\"\"Don't worry. I've informed the people downstairs long ago to treat this matter as if it didn't exist. We will let Ye Yuan and Lin Tiancheng fight first. No matter the result, Ye Yuan's definitely dead.\"Hearing that, the youth let out a sigh of relief. \"That bunch of old fellows can really remain patient. Second Uncle, you didn't make a move, and none of them showed themselves. Looks like they have the same intention as us, sitting on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight.The middle-aged man laughed coldly. \"Watching the tigers fight? Haha. Just two little cats, that's all.\"Among these two people, the youth was precisely the Su Family's new generation's talent, Su Yishan, while the middle-aged man was Su Yishan's second uncle, Su Yubai. And he was also the Dan Wu Academy's Disciplinary Hall's Elder!By right, they had received the news long ago. Stopping this fight in time was easy for them.However, no instructor had shown up until now. It was as if everyone had reached a silent agreement to let Lin Tiancheng and Ye Yuan finish fighting!. . . . . .Ye Yuan looked at Lin Tiancheng coldly without any intention of interrupting. Instead, he quietly took out a transcendent-grade Qi Returning Pill and swallowed it.When he returned to the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion a few days ago, Ye Yuan had refined more medicinal pills.With his strength, it was basically effortless to refine Tier 1 medicinal pills.After consuming a transcendent-grade Tier 1 Qi Returning Pill, Ye Yuan's essence energy instantly recovered to its peak state!This sort of treatment was not something that the average person could enjoy.\"What did Ye Yuan eat? His essence energy actually recovered in an instant!\"\"What rubbish. It's definitely the Qi Returning Pill!\"\"But, can the Qi Returning Pill recover so much essence energy?\"\"This . . . maybe the grade is higher?\"\"How high of a grade is needed to let essence energy recover fully?\"\"This . . . superior-grade? Transcendent-grade?\". . . . . .Ye Yuan's action of swallowing the medicinal pill attracted the surrounding onlookers' attention.Zuo Bugui seemed to have discovered something and said in surprise, \"Old Long, look at Ye Yuan's chest!\"Through the nourishment of essence energy, a martial artist's body would surpa.s.s that of the average person. A distance of several hundred meters was not considered far to Spirit Condensation Realm martial artists.Initially, everyone did not notice that Ye Yuan's chest had something extra.But his act of swallowing the medicinal pill drew people's attention to the badge adorned on his chest.Long Tang naturally also caught sight of that badge and involuntarily drew a cold breath.\"Sss . . . It's actually a low-rank Alchemy Master badge!\" Long Tang who had always remained calm became incessantly astonished.\"N-no way. He's only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm! Is that badge fake?\" Zuo Bugui's thoughts were identical with many others. They thought that the badge was fake.\"How's that possible? Who would dare forge a badge issued by the Alchemist a.s.sociation? That would make one the public enemy of all alchemists. They would absolutely die without a burial place!\"\"But how could he possibly refine Tier 2 medicinal pills with his Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm soul strength?\"\"I remembered. Several days ago, the academy organized a group test. Ye Yuan seemed to have joined! He seemed to have entered a closed-door seclusion after returning from the Alchemist a.s.sociation. That's to say, when he became a low-rank Alchemy Master, he was still only at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"Long Tang also jumped in fright at his a.n.a.lysis. If that was indeed the case, then Ye Yuan was seriously too monstrous.This discovery caused a huge uproar among the students, and everybody started debating. Of course, the general consensus was that . . . it was fake.Using a fake Alchemist a.s.sociation badge, this matter was much more serious than killing someone in the academy!Su Yishan's face became solemn. \"Second Uncle, what's with the badge? Did he really pa.s.s the Alchemy Master test?\"Si Yubai's face also did not look too good. But he nodded and said, \"If Ye Yuan isn't a fool, then that badge should be real! But . . . this punk can't be spared even more!\"\"A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm low-rank Alchemy Master. It isn't that easy if Second Uncle wants to kill him, right?\"\"Humph! A dead genius . . . is no longer a genius! Could those old fogeys oppose my Su Family because I killed a punk who violated the academy's rules?\" Su Yubai smiled coldly.\"Second Uncle's intentions are . . .?\"Su Yubai swiped his throat and said icily, \"Wait until they finish fighting. I will directly go there and finish off Ye Yuan!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, only Feng Ruoqing and those students forced to swear the Heavenly Dao Oath knew that he obtained the Alchemy Master badge within the academy.Initially, this badge was not indispensable to Ye Yuan. But this was something that Lu-er used her life to protect, so it naturally became extraordinary to Ye Yuan.After Ye Yuan handed Lu-er over to Feng Ruoqing, he put on the badge seriously in earnest.He had no intention of showing off, but it was currently causing a huge commotion.Ye Yuan and Lin Tiancheng faced each other from a distance. After adjusting for a short while, they recovered to their optimal condition.He did not interrupt Lin Tiancheng's breakthrough because it was useless.Lin Tiancheng had long comprehended the Spirit Condensation Realm and could have crossed this threshold at any time. He had only been suppressing his cultivation realm all along and did not complete the step of compressing essence energy into a liquid state.Even if Ye Yuan launched a surprise attack on Lin Tiancheng right now, he also could not stop his breakthrough. So he might as well make use of the time to adjust his condition.. . . . . .Following the dissipation of the essence energy storm, Lin Tiancheng's aura suddenly soared, and essence energy spread out wildly.\"Hahaha! This is the Spirit Condensation Realm! Ye Yuan, you asked for this! Now, let's see how you'll kill me!\"After breaking through, Lin Tiancheng felt his body bursting with power as if a floodgate had opened up.At this moment, he even felt like he was invincible.Breaking through a major realm was an extremely extraordinary thing no matter who it was.However, Lin Tiancheng failed to see any sort of panic on Ye Yuan's face, which made him somewhat disappointed.\"This is what you relied on upon? Do you feel that after breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, you got me?\" Ye Yuan said nonchalantly.\"Humph! So what if that's the case? What do you have to fight me now that we are separated by a major realm? You'll definitely die today!\" Lin Tiancheng smiled icily.\"Immature!\" Ye Yuan spat out this word coolly.\"What did you say?!\" Lin Tiancheng erupted.\"Isn't it just breaking through cultivation realm? I will breakthrough for you to see!\"Listening to what Ye Yuan said, it was like breaking through realms was as simple as eating and sleeping.Lin Tiancheng roared with laughter. \"You've just broken through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm and haven't even consolidated your cultivation realm, yet you still want to breakthrough cultivation realms? Fine, I will see just how you breakthrough cultivation realms!\"\"Then watch closely!\"After saying that, Ye Yuan retrieved a medicinal pill and swallowed it. It was precisely the Five Elements Spirit Link Pill!Seeing this, Lin Tiancheng's face changed, and he suddenly had a bad premonition.Initially, he thought nothing of it. But seeing that Ye Yuan actually wanted to use a medicinal pill to breakthrough cultivation realms, he could not help but regret his words earlier.Although Lin Tiancheng did not think that there was any medicinal pill that could directly breakthrough realms, he still reacted right away.This was a deathmatch. Lin Tiancheng could not be bothered with going back on his words and whatnot. Seven Star Steps activated in full force as his fist with lightning flashes around it smashed towards Ye Yuan.His actions drew a wave of jeering. Clearly, it was met with everyone's disdain.Just now, he was still talking about wanting to see him breakthrough. But now, he 'smacked his own mouth' and sneak attacked him.Simply shameless to the extreme!\"Senior Apprentice Brother Lin is at the very least a Spirit Condensation Realm martial artist. How could he be so shameless?\"\"Sigh. If a person is shameless, they would be invincible. What to do if their skin is thick?\"\"Don't talk c.r.a.p. This is a deathmatch! If Ye Yuan was just bluffing, then it's all good. If he can really break through cultivation realms and reach the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, that would be advancing another minor stage. The threat would increase greatly! If he unleashes the Eight Layer Wave then, just how horrifying would the power be?\"\"You're right. But I still feel that this is too shameless. A living person needs a face like a living tree needs bark. If you can't do it, then don't talk so much. There are so many people looking!\"\"I've never heard of any medicinal pill that could directly raise cultivation realms. Don't know if Ye Yuan is putting on a false show of strength. If he's really putting up a bold front, then it's really going to be serious this time.\"\"Something's not right. Senior Apprentice Brother Lin's martial technique doesn't seem to be the Thunderous Fist anymore!\"\"Sss . . . It's true! That's . . . the upgraded version of the Thunderous Fist, the low-grade Tier 2 martial technique, Ten-Directional Lightning Movement!\"\"The Seven-Star Steps plus the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement. isn't this simply bullying people?\"The low-grade Tier 2 martial technique, Ten-Directional Lightning Movement, was the upgraded version of the Thunderous Fist that descended from the same origin!It had not been one or two days since Lin Tiancheng cultivated the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement. He had long reached the small success stage!Wis.h.i.+ng to pa.s.s through the Illusionary Spirit Tower with the strength of a half-step Spirit Condensation Realm, Lin Tiancheng could only work on his martial techniques.Very clearly, a Tier 1 martial technique like the Thunderous Fist was unable to achieve that effect from the start.Unless it was some sick Tier 1 martial technique like the Stacking Waves Layered Palm or the Absolute Yang Finger, the threat to Spirit Condensation Realms was virtually zero.It was just that Lin Tiancheng's perception was lacking, and he was ultimately unable to comprehend the great success stage of the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement. Hence, he kept failing the Earth Rank Advancement test.In the past, he used the strength of half-step Spirit Condensation Realm to activate the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement, so the power was naturally greatly reduced.Presently, Lin Tiancheng was already a genuine First Level Spirit Condensation Realm. Unleas.h.i.+ng the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement could not be mentioned in the same breath!Ye Yuan laughed coldly. He had read countless people before and knew that a despicable person like Lin Tiancheng would not keep his word. So he had long been ready.The Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eight Layer Wave, versus the Ten-Directional Lightning Movement!One fist and one palm collided once more!Boom!This time around, the commotion was greater than any of the previous time. Huge explosive sounds occurred where the two people clashed.Lin Tiancheng and Ye Yuan flew out once again!However, Lin Tiancheng only retreated a few steps this time, while Ye Yuan lost his center of gravity and fell to the ground.\"Puu!\"The moment he fell, Ye Yuan's innards quivered, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.This was the suppression of cultivation realm!Unleas.h.i.+ng a Tier 2 martial technique using Spirit Condensation Realm had extraordinary power.Even if Ye Yuan had 16 times the unleashed power, he still received heavy injuries!If in the past, Lin Tiancheng was only a little bit away from pa.s.sing the Earth Rank Advancement test, then if he went to partic.i.p.ate now, he would be able to advancement easily!The difference in between was not just an iota!No matter how strong Ye Yuan was, he was just a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.The difference between the two people's realms was large to begin with. Now, they were even separated by a major realm!Ye Yuan only vomited a mouthful of blood after the two clashed. This was already d.a.m.n sick!\"F*ck! I can't look on anymore. This is too shameless!\"\"Yeah! A Tier 2 movement technique coupled with an extremely high attack power Tier 2 lightning-attribute martial technique. Ye Yuan's is at such a disadvantage!\"\"If the Stacking Waves Layered Palm was complete, Ye Yuan might still have a chance to win. Sigh. Such a pity. A genius like Ye Yuan actually fell just like that!\"\"Aiya! I'm dying over here! Is there any effect from the medicinal pill Ye Yuan ate? Quickly breakthrough!\"Ye Yuan's injury aroused the sympathy of many people. Lin Tiancheng's actions just now had already made him completely inhuman.The strong would always be admired by others!Ye Yuan used his Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation to fight a Spirit Condensation Realm to such an extent. One had to say, it was a miracle.After all, Spirit Condensation Realm battling Essence Qi Realm represented absolute suppression!Even if it was Long Tang, he could pa.s.s through the Earth Rank Advancement test back when he was at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm. But now he was certainly not the current Lin Tiancheng's match!Yet, Ye Yuan had subverted this sort of absolute!He won everyone's admiration!\"Your sister. This Ye Yuan was really bluffing. Gave me a scare! I thought the Spirit Essence Pill that had already landed in my hand had . . .\" Up in the pavilion, Zuo Bugui was talking halfway when he suddenly stopped.Because Ye Yuan's aura was soaring non-stop currently!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Yuan's strength would definitely have a huge spike!However, the astonishment that Ye Yuan brought to the crowd had not ceased.After breaking through to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, Ye Yuan's aura did not weaken. He continued charging to the peak of the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm.In one breath, Ye Yuan reached the peak of the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm.And then, he easily crossed the threshold of the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm!Only then, did Ye Yuan's aura gradually stabilize, stopping at the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm.\"Holy c.r.a.p! What medicinal pill did Ye Yuan eat? To actually directly breakthrough two minor realms!\"\"What the f*ck! If one had this sort of medicinal pill, then wouldn't jumping ranks to battle be like playing?\"\"Hehe. Looks like Senior Apprentice Brother Lin put himself on the spot! Just now, Ye Yuan's cultivation realm was too low, so even if he used the Eight Layer Wave, he could not threaten him. But now, Ye Yuan's Eight Layer Wave will be terrifying!\"\"Yeah. If they clashed again, the victor would be hard to determine!\"A Five Elements Spirit Link pill was a medicinal pill that belonged to the Divine Realm. A mortal country naturally had not heard of it before.This type of medicinal pill was indeed very powerful, but it was not without its drawbacks.After the medicinal effects fade, the martial artist's body will collapse because it could not handle a strength that did not belong to their realm.And the medicinal effects of the Five Elements Spirit Link Pill could only be sustained for the period of time it takes to burn one stick of incense.Once an incense of time is up, Ye Yuan would no longer have any combat ability, and could only let people carve him up.Hence, Ye Yuan must finish this swiftly now.\"Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm! Now, there's a good show to watch! How could there be such a medicinal pill? I've never heard of it before. It's too shameless! Ah! My Spirit Essence Pill! My Sharp Horned Beast inner core!\" Zuo Bugui recovered from his shock and pounded his chest in anguish.Long Tang, on the other hand, was staring as clearly as if gazing at a blazing fire. He frowned and said, \"This medicinal pill definitely has a time limit. If Ye Yuan can't finish off Lin Tiancheng quickly, then he will really be dead!\"Zuo Bugui exclaimed in surprise, \"So that's the case! Like I said if eating one medicinal pill could raise two minor realms, then what's the point of cultivating? But even if there's a time limit, this medicinal pill is also very terrifying. It's seriously a necessary medicinal pill for jumping ranks to battle!\"Long Tang said in agreement, \"That's right. Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm coupled with the Eight Layer Wave. Ye Yuan truly has the capital to battle with Lin Tiancheng now. However . . . they're at best on par. None of them can do anything to the other. If Ye Yuan doesn't have any other hidden cards . . . chances of victory aren't great.\"\"Doesn't this mean that your Spirit Essence Pill is going to enter my pockets again?\" Zuo Bugui laughed loudly.Long Tang smiled and kept silent.On the other side, Su Family's uncle and nephew were repeatedly shocked by Ye Yuan's actions.\"These medicinal pills are definitely not refined by Ye Hang. Otherwise, Wan Donghai would have been chased out of the capital long ago! There's definitely an extremely powerful alchemist behind Ye Yuan!\" Su Yubai said gloomily.Su Yishan's face did not look good either. \"If that's the case, wouldn't we have to spare the rat to save the dishes? What if . . .\"\"There is no what if! No matter how powerful that alchemist is, can he be stronger than the Tranquil Cloud Sect? With our Su Family's power in the Tranquil Cloud Sect, who dares to provoke us?\" Su Yubai directly cut Su Yishan's off.\"Second Uncle is wise! Since that alchemist let him enter the Dan Wu Academy, he would have nothing to say if Ye Yuan was sentenced to death after violating the academy's rules.\"\"That's the idea. This world has always been run by strength. As long as we are strong enough, then killing him means he's dead. What can he do to us? An alchemist's strength isn't that great, so what can he do even if he's an Alchemy King?\". . . . . .\"Do you see it now?\" Ye Yuan wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and said with a cold smile.Lin Tiancheng's face fell, but he remained stubborn as he said, \"Humph! It's just a temporary increase in cultivation realm. Flashy but without substance. What's the use?\"\"Whether it's flashy without substance or not, wouldn't you know after trying?\" Ye Yuan hooked his finger at Lin Tiancheng contemptuously.\"Putting aside the fact that you are a fake Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm, what can you do even if you're a real Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm?\"Lightning danced around Lin Tiancheng's fist, and his Seven Star Steps activated once more.Ye Yuan gave a cold laugh and smacked out with an Eight Layer Wave again. The aura was much stronger than before!After crossing the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm, Ye Yuan's strength rose another minor stage, and the Eight Layer Wave's power became extraordinary.One fist and one palm met in an instant.But right then, an abnormality occurred.Just as the two of them were only a few steps away from each other, Ye Yuan suddenly changed his palm into a finger. An absolutely powerful force blasted out from the fingertip.Initially, Lin Tiancheng was full of confidence. But now, his expression changed drastically as the scent of death pounced from straight ahead!He could feel the terror of the invisible force from Ye Yuan's fingertip. Even though the area was not large, that small radius of force was incomparably powerful.However at this time, his speed had already reached the limits, and there was no leeway to maneuver.The distance of a few steps was too short! There was not even time to blink.Lin Tiancheng wanted to evade this finger with all his might, but he could not do it with his body's reaction.Ye Yuan had long calculated the time accurately and did not give Lin Tiancheng the time to switch moves.He aimed to kill, not to spar. How could he possibly give Lin Tiancheng the chance to turn things around?\"Ah!\"Lin Tiancheng's protective essence energy was punched through like paper. The invisible force penetrated Lin Tiancheng's fist instantly, but the momentum did not lessen as it directly pierced through his heart!Lin Tiancheng's body collapsed weakly on the ground. He was no longer breathing!Absolute Yang Finger!This was Ye Yuan's real killing move!During this period, apart from cultivation, Ye Yuan spent the majority of the time on the Absolute Yang Finger.Now, his Absolute Yang Finger was already cultivated to the great success stage.This technique, the Absolute Yang Finger, was a complementary martial technique of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. It did not have a fixed grade. If one had to give it a grade, then it should belong to the boundary of Tier 1 martial techniques.It was just that regardless of cultivating difficulty or power, Tier 1 martial techniques could not be compared to it!The power of the Absolute Yang Finger trained to the great success stage was already not inferior to low-grade Tier 2 martial techniques.Only Ye Yuan could train it to the great success stage in such a short time. If it were somebody else, they might not even train it to such a stage even if they were given ten, twenty years.One had to know that Ye Yuan only used three days to cultivate the Stacking Waves Layered Palm, Eight Layer Wave!\"He . . . he really did it! Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm actually killed a First Level Spirit Condensation Realm!\"\"What happened just now? The move that Senior Apprentice Brother Lin was struck by didn't seem to be the Eight Layer Wave!\"\"Ye Yuan is seriously too scary! He can actually cross a major realm to do battle, and even kill his opponent!\"These students' vision prowesses were insufficient and did not see Ye Yuan changing his final move clearly.However, the result was evident at a glance! Ye Yuan did something they found it hard to imagine!After killing Lin Tiancheng, Ye Yuan was also exhausted. He could not even lift his finger.Throughout this entire battle, Ye Yuan held the lower-hand all along. His body was already covered with injuries.He even gave it his all for the final blow, which aggravated his injuries.\"Huuu . . .\" Ye Yuan let out a long breath.But right at this moment, Ye Yuan felt his scalp tingle. An aura powerful enough to suffocate people locked onto him.\"Insolent Ye Yuan! To dare kill your fellow student within the academy! As the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, I sentence you to death!\"A towering voice suddenly sounded out, which once again made everyone's nerves that had just loosen winded up tightly again.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:TGIF!

Even if he killed someone, he would at least have to go through the higher echelon's trial before he would be given the death penalty.And during all that was a period for him to turn things around!Which force would not wish to pull him over just based on the alchemic and martial talent that he displayed?However, no matter how much Ye Yuan calculated, he did not expect that such a powerful opponent would be lying in ambush to launch a sneak attack on him right after he killed Lin Tiancheng.Ye Yuan acknowledged that his greatest enemy in the academy was Wan Yuan. He had already broken through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm now, so even if he jumped out, he could easily crush him.What Disciplinary Hall's First Elder? Ye Yuan did not even know him!Who would have thought that he would harbor such a huge killing intent towards him, and directly attacked to kill?Ye Yuan knew that he was no match for him and already closed his eyes to await death.Seeing Ye Yuan close his eyes and wait for death, a cruel smile involuntarily flashed across the corner of Su Yubai's mouth.The timing he chose was perfect. Right when everybody was stunned by Ye Yuan's strength, he already unleashed his attack right away, all so that other people would not have the chance to react.As the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, Su Yubai was already at half-step Crystal Formation Realm. Was it not effortless to capture Ye Yuan who was already like a lamp without oil?A lion will use all its might when hunting a rabbit. Su Yubai was very clear on this logic, so he used his full power for this blow!He was only a few steps away from Ye Yuan. Many people closed their eyes as if they did not wish to see Ye Yuan's blood splattering everywhere.After all, he was a rising genius. Everyone could already confirm that as long as Ye Yuan was given enough time, he would sooner or later surpa.s.s Head Senior Apprentice Brother Long Tang!Now, a genius like that was going to plummet so quickly!Su Yubai was extremely fast and arrived in front of Ye Yuan in a blink of an eye.But right then, another abnormality occurred!Ye Yuan suddenly felt a strong gale sweep past from behind. By the time he reacted, a shadow had already circled past him.Boom!A violent collision occurred that was many times greater than when Ye Yuan and Lin Tiancheng fought.Ye Yuan was also baffled by this sudden change, but this was not the time for him to be dazed.He was closest to the two of them, so the impact he received was obviously the greatest.A ma.s.sive blast swept over. Even though that figure helped him withstand the majority of the attack, the aftershock was still very powerful.No time to do anything else, Ye Yuan swiftly raised his protective s.h.i.+eld.\"Puu!\"Ye Yuan was sent flying by the shockwave and spat out another mouthful of blood in midair.The full power blow of a half-step Crystal Formation Realm, even with most of the attack being neutralized, was sufficiently powerful to the current Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan fell heavily to the ground, and his internal organs s.h.i.+fted places, leaving him in agony. 1That figure also fell back greatly, only stabilizing himself after backing up more than 20 steps.\"Grug!\"That figure also spat out a mouthful of blood. It was clear that he also suffered internal injuries.But Su Yubai remained still where he stood without moving. One could see just how great his strength was!But currently, Su Yubai was looking at that figure with a very solemn face.\"Huyan Yong! You actually dare to oppose your superior? Do you think that my Disciplinary Hall is just for decoration?!\" Su Yubai questioned in a deep voice.Only now, did Ye Yuan clearly see that figure. It was actually Teacher Huyan!But . . . why did Teacher Huyan help him?Judging from this blow, Huyan Yong's strength was likely a level lower than Su Yubai's. He undertook a huge risk for this blow!Ye Yuan could not help but become confused. However, he was more touched.Without Huyan Yong throwing himself forward courageously, he would already be a corpse.Huyan Yong spat out the remaining blood in his mouth, and he said coldly, \"Opposing my superior? Just who is the one going against his superior? Since when can the Disciplinary Hall execute students without going through the approval of the dean? As the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, you ambushed a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm student. Do you still want face?\"\"Humph! Ye Yuan violated the academy's rules and killed his fellow students. Whether the dean is here or not, he's dead! Also, I just learned that before Ye Yuan killed Lin Tiancheng, he already killed the student manager in charge of the medicinal garden, Zhang Heng. Such a vicious homicidal maniac deserves to die!\" Su Yubai's face did not change as he responded coldly.As expected, when Su Yubai's words came out, it caused a huge commotion!Killing Lin Tiancheng alone was still not so bad. But killing two people consecutively in one day made some people unwittingly think that Ye Yuan was indeed a vicious homicidal maniac.\"No way. Did Ye Yuan's brain develop a problem after his sudden rise in strength, and he becomes a savage and cruel person?\"\"I heard that training demonic path cultivation laws allowed one's strength to suddenly soar, but the martial artist would lose his mind. Don't tell me that Ye Yuan really secretly trained in some demonic path cultivation laws?\"\"Very likely! He was still First Level Essence Qi Realm a month ago. One month pa.s.sed, and he's already at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, and he can even kill a Spirit Condensation Realm! This goes against all logic!\"\"I heard that demonic path cultivation laws have incredible power, much stronger than the average martial artist!\"\"If that's really the case, then Ye Yuan really deserves to die!\"Su Yubai's words were very provocative. Initially, there were still many people sympathizing with Ye Yuan. Now, there were already quite a few who felt that Ye Yuan cultivated demonic path cultivation laws and deserved to die.Listening to the crowd debating, Su Yubai chuckled to himself.As long as he was standing on the side of justice, n.o.body could say anything even if he forcefully killed Ye Yuan today.\"Do you hear that? I currently suspect that Ye Yuan cultivated some demonic path cultivation laws, and I'm going to carry out the execution on the spot. Does anyone else have any objections?\" Su Yubai had an awe-inspiring righteous appearance.Huyan Yong gave a cold laugh and said, \"Regardless of whether Ye Yuan trained in some demonic path cultivation law, it has to wait until the dean returns to decide! Are you trying to challenge the dean's authority by making a unilateral decision?\"Huyan Yong was also not someone stupid. Pus.h.i.+ng a 'large hat' down gave Su Yubai a huge headache.\"Humph! Everyone has the right to punish those from the demonic and unorthodox path! Ye Yuan has already killed two fellow students. Is this not enough for the death penalty yet? Huyan Yong, what intentions do you have for s.h.i.+elding someone from the demonic path?\"Su Yubai had the momentum and was unwilling to spare them. He continued to use words to exert pressure. The way he spoke, Ye Yuan had already been determined to be someone from the demonic path.Huyan Yong naturally would not fall for it. \"Someone from the demonic path? What right do you have to say that Ye Yuan is someone from the demonic path? You didn't ask why Ye Yuan killed people, and indiscriminately pinned labels onto him. You, Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, is truly so awe-inspiring!\"\"Humph! You're still stubborn! If he isn't someone from the demonic path, then how do you explain his sudden increase in strength? If he isn't someone from the demonic path, how do you explain his combat power which stands head and shoulders above all others? Everyone has the right to punish those from the demonic path! Huyan Yong, if you don't make way, I will take you down first, and then exterminate this scoundrel!\" Su Yubai shouted with an imposing aura.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:We just finished a ma.s.s release chapters event.

Su Yubai even had the heart to kill right now.However, Huyan Yong was an instructor of the academy. If he really attacked, then he could forget about being the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder anymore.Furthermore, while it was true that Huyan Yong could not beat him, Su Yubai also could not stop him if he really wanted to run.But he was standing in front of Ye Yuan, making Su Yubai feel that this was a very th.o.r.n.y matter.He must definitely kill Ye Yuan today. This punk's rise was too rapid!This was absolutely a potential threat to the Su Family.If Ye Yuan was left unchecked to continue growing. Most likely ten years, no, just five years, and he would become another Ye Hang!Just one Ye Hang was enough to give the Su Family a headache, and two Ye Hangs . . .\"Take me down? Fine! Bring it on! I want to see just how you will take me down!\" Huyan Yong taunted icily.\"Humph! You really think that I don't dare to touch you?\" Seeing Huyan Yong's manner like a dead pig which did not care whether the water was boiling, Su Yubai flew into a rage.Huyan Yong had always been Jiang Yunhe's hardcore follower and was never on good terms with Su Yubai.Normally, the two of them were already at odds. Now, it goes even more without saying.With Su Yubai's strength, it was impossible to capture the peak Spirit Condensation Realm Huyan Yong. Unless he killed him!Huyan Yong was certain that Su Yubai dared not kill fellow students.\"What a joke! You're the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder. You can touch whoever you want to. Why would you not dare to touch me? But if you want to kill Ye Yuan today, you will have to walk over my dead body!\" Facing the powerful Su Yubai, Huyan Yong did not yield in the slightest.\"Good! Good! Good! Everyone saw that. Huyan Yong is s.h.i.+elding the demonic sp.a.w.n, and so he's also my Dan Wu Academy's enemy! Today, I represent the academy to exterminate fiends and protect the Dao. I'll exterminate these two traitors!\"Su Yubai's fury could be seen from how he said three 'Good' consecutively.After he finished talking, Su Yubai's released his aura completely, crus.h.i.+ng everyone until they could not breathe.Just as Su Yubai was about to strike, a beautiful silhouette walked out from the crowd and stood by Huyan Yong.\"If Elder Su is insistent on making a move, then treat Ruoqing as someone from the demonic path as well, and kill me.\"Feng Ruoqing said these words nonchalantly, but the weight was sufficiently heavy!Other people might not know Feng Ruoqing's ident.i.ty, but how could Su Yubai be unaware of Feng Ruoqing's ident.i.ty?Even if Su Yubai had a higher status in the Dan Wu Academy, he would not dare to touch even a hair of Feng Ruoqing!The Imperial Family's Nanfeng Clan had always been low-key, but families with deep backgrounds knew that the Nanfeng Family Clan was the number one great family in the State of Qin and not one of the top!Everybody was astounded by Feng Ruoqing's appearance, including Su Yubai and Huyan Yong.Many of them could not help recalling some of the rumors which spread secretly. Now, it looks like it was not unfounded rumors!At this time, the looks which the students gave Ye Yuan became weird.So, what this Ye Yuan was capable of was neither in Martial Dao nor Alchemy Dao, but chasing girls!The Feng Family aunt and niece had always been lofty G.o.ddesses in the academy. There had been many pursuers, but n.o.body had honestly ever expected to succeed in chasing them.But, Ye Yuan did it!Standing out at this time to oppose the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, they would not believe that Feng Ruoqing and Ye Yuan had zero relations even if they were beaten to death!Of course, even more people felt that their G.o.ddess was defiled, and they wished that they could go up there and give Ye Yuan two tight slaps to show their indignity!It was just that it would never be their turn to do the slapping if they did it now.. . . . . .Feng Ruoqing turned around to look at Ye Yuan who was lying on the ground, unable to move. She quickly hurried over to help him up.Being in the embrace of a beauty was naturally something to be happy to be delighted about. But Ye Yuan was currently half-dead, how would he have these sort of beautiful thoughts?Except, sniffing the light fragrance coming off of Feng Ruoqing's body made Ye Yuan pull himself together.Feng Ruoqing on the other hand, frowned and asked, \"Are you ok?\"Ye Yuan laughed bitterly and said weakly, \"Do I look ok to you? Relax, I won't die. It's just that I can't move right now. Lu-er, she . . .\"Feng Ruoqing knitted her brows once more. \"You're already like this, and you're still concerned about your little maidservant!\"\"How's she?\" Ye Yuan brushed off Feng Ruoqing's rebuke and continued asking.Feng Ruoqing sighed. \"With you helping her suppress the cold qi, she's fine for now. I knew that you were going to cause trouble, so I pa.s.sed her to Zhirou, and I came here alone.\"Hearing Feng Ruoqing said this, Ye Yuan finally heaved a sigh of relief. \"Many thanks. I'll definitely thank you deeply in the future.\"Feng Ruoqing naturally would not take to heart other people's thanks, because she did not lack anything!But Ye Yuan was different. Just the fact that he could refine transcendent-grade Tier 2 medicinal pills at the Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm made his thanks priceless!\"I told you not to mess about, and you just wouldn't listen! Ten years isn't late for a gentleman to take his revenge. What's the rush? Now, you nearly threw away your life. Are you satisfied?\" Feng Ruoqing did not mention about the thanks but grumbled instead.However, these words did not sound like grumbling, but more like a little wifey's concern.\"Ah . . . Hahaha! Ten years isn't late? I can't wait even for a second! If I have to wait ten years for a minor character like him, then what should I do about other people?\" Ye Yuan seemed like he was triggered by something to have said this.Feng Ruoqing could not understand the meaning behind Ye Yuan's words. But at this moment, Ye Yuan's eyes were very complex. It was like an old man who had experienced many vicissitudes of life and not a 15-year-old youth.What on earth did he go through? How could he have such desolate and dismal eyes?Feng Ruoqing started to wonder about it involuntarily.But Ye Yuan recovered first and said, \"I have recovery medicinal pills on me. I can't move right now, could you help me take them?\"\"No . . .\" Feng Ruoqing instinctively wanted to reject, but thinking about Ye Yuan's current condition, she hesitated.Since when had Feng Ruoqing with her priceless body ever touched a man's body? Even if there was clothing in between, no way!\"Sigh. Forget it. I'll do it myself. Sss . . .\"As he was talking, Ye Yuan reached out to touch his chest and hissed in pain the moment he made contact.Feng Ruoqing hurriedly said, \"Alright, alright! I'll do it!\"Then, under the dumbfounded gazes of everyone, Feng Ruoqing's beautiful and slender hands slipped inside Ye Yuan's clothes.\"Ahhh! My G.o.ddess! Why?!\"\"Do you want people dead?! Don't, Teacher Feng!\"\"Quickly let go of that guy! Let me do it!\"Everybody was screaming in their hearts, but it was all to no avail.Feng Ruoqing rummaged around for a while before fis.h.i.+ng out a bottle of medicinal pills. Her face was currently a bright beet-red like she was intoxicated on alcohol.\"Is it this?\" Feng Ruoqing asked with a red face.\"That's it! There are still five medicinal pills in the bottle; take the pale-yellow one and pa.s.s it to me,\" Ye Yuan instructed.There was only one pale-yellow medicinal pill inside after Feng Ruoqing poured all the pills out. Then, she took the pill and fed it to Ye Yuan.After consuming the medicinal pill, Ye Yuan's face which was pale like paper gradually became rosier.\"Alright. Help me up, I want to refine the medicinal effects.\"\"You can already move so quickly?\"Even though Feng Ruoqing knew that Ye Yuan could not be judged by common sense, she was still very shocked. She had never seen before a medicinal pill that had such immediate effects.Ye Yuan nodded his head laboriously and started to refine the medicinal effects.Translator's Thoughtscelefoata_ celefoata_RegiusProfessor:This week I picked up Emperor's Gigolo and Gate of G.o.d.

But actions today have failed justice and failed the hearts of the public!\"Su Yubai was originally very displeased seeing Feng Ruoqing talking intimately with Ye Yuan like n.o.body else was around.But he was highly fearful of Feng Ruoqing's ident.i.ty, which was why he did not make a move.Now that Feng Ruoqing was rebuking him publicly, Su Yubai naturally could not pretend to be mute anymore.\"Snort! This old man is exterminating fiends and protecting the Dao. How did I fail justice? Teacher Feng is only momentarily hoodwinked by this fiend; that's why you are openly defending him. Why haven't you retreated yet?! Otherwise, don't blame me if I accidentally injure Teacher Feng later,\" Su Yubai snarled.It was also because Su Yubai was filled with trepidation about Feng Ruoqing's status that his words were filled with caution.If somebody else were to do what Feng Ruoqing did just now, he would have definitely turned violent already.However, Feng Ruoqing had no scruples about this. \"I know all about the sequence of events for this matter. Although Ye Yuan's way of doing things wasn't appropriate, there was indeed a reason for this whole thing! Does Elder Su have selfish motives for wanting to indiscriminately finish him off ruthlessly?\"Feng Ruoqing's words stirred up everyone's appet.i.tes.It had already been many years since anyone dared to kill people publically in the academy. Just what in the world did Lin Tiancheng and Zhang Heng do to have forced Ye Yuan to this step?\"What a joke! Ye Yuan violated the academy's rules and killed two people consecutively. This old man suspects that he's someone from the demonic path and moved to strike him down. What selfish motives are there?\" Su Yubai naturally had selfish motives, but he was being persistent.However, Feng Ruoqing continued nonchalantly without changing her expression. \"Some things become meaningless when it's exposed in front of so many people.\"When Feng Ruoqing's words came out, Su Yubai was startled.He had always believed that Feng Ruoqing was an alchemy idiot and did not care about other things. Who would have thought that her heart was as clear as a bright mirror!\"This la.s.s was so astute to actually see through his thoughts!On the surface, the Fragrant Medicine Pavilion and Drunken Star Manor were irreconcilable. But in reality, it was still the Su Family who was exchanging blows with the Ye Family in the dark.Ye Yuan's rise made Su Yubai sense an enormous threat. That was why he directly struck to kill.These things did not seem strange to people involved in the affairs, but it was very hard to connect these things together for people outside the state of affairs.Could it be that the Nanfeng Family had long taken precautions against the Su Family?This was no auspicious omen!\"No matter what reason he has, rules are rules. How can violations be tolerated?\" Su Yubai did not wish to hear any reason whatsoever.\"According to the rules, Ye Yuan should have been taking into custody temporarily after killing people and left to the dean and the Elders Council to make the final decision. Isn't Elder Su breaking the rules by directly killing people? I wonder what's the punishment for this in accordance with the academy's rules?\" Feng Ruoqing did not give in in the slightest.The Dan Wu Academy's rules were not directed at students only. The dean and elders similarly faced many restrictions.Killing people without authorization as the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, according to the academy's rules, was the stripping of the First Elder's position!Of course, the dean was the paramount existence in the Dan Wu Academy!Su Yubai was exasperated. This little la.s.s kept opposing him in every way, and now, he was actually reverse checkmated!Looks like it was impossible to kill Ye Yuan now. But his thoughts swirled, and he came up with another plan.\"Humph! Since you say that I'm not acting in accordance with the rules, fine! I'll do things based on the rules right now! Men, escort Ye Yuan to the a.s.sembly Hall behind the mountain. Inform the two deputy deans and all the elders to come to the a.s.sembly Hall for a joint hearing!\" Su Yubai suddenly changed his tune out of the blue.Feng Ruoqing frowned and thought to herself that this Su Yubai was really hard to deal with. It looks like he was determined to sentence Ye Yuan to death today!She could not reject Su Yubai's request. Otherwise, it would really become defending a demonic sp.a.w.n.According to the academy's rules, the Elders Council could jointly decide significant matters when the dean was not around!But in reality, even if Jiang Yunhe was in the academy, the Elders Council was the one deciding on the academy's matters most of the time.Jiang Yunhe rarely showed his face in front of everyone.Under Su Yubai's orders, two disciplinary hall's students wanted to take Ye Yuan into custody and headed for the a.s.sembly Hall behind the mountain.Ye Yuan's eyes suddenly snapped open, and he said coldly, \"I have my own legs to walk with. Get lost!\"The two disciplinary hall's students' strength was beneath even Lin Tiancheng's. Even though they knew that he was already an arrow at the end of its flight, seeing Ye Yuan's outburst still stopped them in their track in fear.After he said that, Ye Yuan got up. There was no problem with his mobility already!This scene left everyone dumbfounded once again. What kind of recovery medicine could have such immediate effects?Ye Yuan was seriously too lucky to take these unheard of pills and eating them like candy. He was merely like a c.o.c.kroach that would not die!Of course, they were unaware that Ye Yuan was once an Alchemy Emperor! If an Alchemy Emperor could not eat transcendent-grade pills like candy, then Ye Yuan this Alchemy Emperor would really be unworthy of the name.\"Insolence! You're a sinner right now! Who permitted you to walk on your own?\" When Su Yubai saw that Ye Yuan still dared to be so arrogant, he flew into a rage.Ye Yuan glanced at Su Yubai coldly. \"I'll remember this, you old fart! I, Ye Yuan, will repay today's grudge a hundredfold in the future! I will definitely take your head within a year!\"When these words came out, the crowd was stunned.A year? Take the head of a half-step Crystal Formation Realm powerhouse?This was a complete fantasy!\"This Ye Yuan has such killing intent! He hasn't really cultivated some demonic path cultivation laws, right?\"\"Bulls.h.i.+t! Didn't you hear Teacher Feng? There's definitely more than meets the eye about this! Change the scenario, if somebody nearly slapped you to death with one palm, would your killing intent be huge or not?\"\"Urh. That's true. But, I wouldn't dare to spew this sort of nonsense. Taking Elder Su's head within a year? How's that possible?\"\"Yeah. Essence Qi Realm is easy to pa.s.s, but Spirit Condensation Realm is hard to advance to! You have to expend ten times the effort each time you advance one minor realm in the Spirit Condensation Realm when compared to the Essence Qi Realm. Even then, you still have to rely on lucky chances to breakthrough. It has already been two years since Senior Apprentice Brother Long stepped into the Spirit Condensation Realm, right? He's still stuck at the Third Level Spirit Condensation Realm till today!\"\"Ye Yuan might be a genius, but I don't believe that he will have the strength to kill Elder Su within a year even if you beat me to death! After all, he's only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"Although I don't believe it either, then again, it seems like Ye Yuan only spent a month to go from the First Level Essence Qi Realm to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"That . . .\"Everyone naturally treated Ye Yuan's proud words like a joke.Advancing realms in the Spirit Condensation Realm was too difficult!The amount of essence energy required to advance a minor realm was extremely horrifying! No matter how much of a genius Ye Yuan was, it was impossible to break through to the peak Spirit Condensation Realm within a year.Furthermore, it would become even more challenging to jump ranks to battle in the Spirit Condensation Realm!Even if Ye Yuan was genius, he had to be at least at the Ninth Level Spirit Condensation Realm to defeat Su Yubai, right?Did he not see the peak Spirit Condensation Realm Huyan Yong vomiting blood after one palm by Su Yubai?In other words, the Spirit Condensation Realm and the Essence Qi Realm were two entirely different levels!Even Su Yubai was stunned, and he immediately erupted!What he was incensed by was not that Ye Yuan said he would take his head, but because he was scolded 'old fart.'Su Yubai had exceedingly high status in the academy and had real power. Who would be disrespectful when meeting him?Since when had he been pointed in the nose and scolded 'old fart'?\"b.a.s.t.a.r.d! You dare to scold me?!\" In his rage, Su Yubai wanted to attack.But right at this moment, Ye Yuan did something which made everybody's eyes fall out.With a dive, he fled behind Feng Ruoqing and cried out seemingly innocent, \"Teacher Feng, this old fart wants to hit me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Simply shameless to the extreme.But this move was really useful.No matter how insanely Su Yubai's flames of wrath burned, he did not dare to attack Feng Ruoqing!Ye Yuan had long seen through this point. This also made him curious about Feng Ruoqing's ident.i.ty. She was definitely not as simple as an ordinary instructor.However, Ye Yuan scoured his memories, and he could not think of any great family in the State of Qin with the Feng surname.\"Teacher Feng, I want to go to the a.s.sembly Hall on my own. Is there any problem?\" Ye Yuan said with a straight face.Feng Ruoqing sighed and nodded lightly.Even though Feng Ruoqing was elegantly beautiful, she was born with the arrogance of the Imperial Family in her bones. She did not know why, but she just could not refuse this young man in front of her.Having received repeated blows, Su Yubai no longer wished to lose face in front of everyone.He snorted coldly and turned around and left.He believed that they would not dare to not go to the a.s.sembly Hall!After Su Yubai left, Ye Yuan gave Huyan Yong a deep bow. \"Many thanks to Teacher Huyan's life-saving grace!\"Huyan Yong waved his hands dismissively and said casually, \"No need to thank me. If you want to thank someone, then thank the dean. Before the dean left, he specifically instructed me to not let anything happen to you and to take good care of you, \"Ye Yuan was dazed and completely baffled by this dean whom he had never met before.\"Actually, strictly speaking, you saved yourself.\" Feng Ruoqing suddenly opened her mouth.\"Oh? How so?\"\"I told the dean all about your performance during the alchemist test. The appreciation of a genius arose in the dean's heart, and that's why he arranged for Teacher Huyan to come to protect you,\" Feng Ruoqing explained.Only now did Ye Yuan came to a realization. But he begged to differ from what Feng Ruoqing said.Saving means saving. This favor that Ye Yuan owed was too great!Ye Yuan was not an ingrate. This favor naturally had to be returned.\"Teacher Huyan, after Ye Yuan breaks through to the Spirit Condensation Realm, today's grace will definitely be returned!\"Ye Yuan gave Huyan Yong a promise that sounded like in the indefinite future, but Huyan Yong could naturally sense the sincerity in it.It was just that he was still unaware of how heavy this promise of Ye Yuan's was!Jiang Yunhe only instructed him to protect Ye Yuan well before leaving. He did not know for what reason and thought that Jiang Yunhe had a change of heart.\"It's not necessary. I'm not doing this for any repayment. Today's round isn't considered over yet. It looks like Su Yubai still wants you dead!\" Huyan Yong thought that Ye Yuan was only expressing words of grat.i.tude, and he did not take it to heart.Feng Ruoqing faintly guessed something, but her eyes lit up unwittingly. But she did not expose it.She began to unwittingly look forward to just what level Ye Yuan's alchemy skills would reach after breaking through to the Spirit Condensation Realm.\"Ye Yuan, I saw how Su Yubai looked like just now. He's confident in settling this matter in stone at the Elders Council. You had best be cautious. Once the Elders Council sentences you to immediate execution, we can't go against it either,\" Feng Ruoqing frowned and said.\"The Elders Council is that powerful? Didn't you say that there was an exception, Teacher Feng? How did that person escape with his life?\"\"You are talking about Mo Yuntian, right? Although he escaped punishment, it was likewise almost certain death!\" Huyan Yong interrupted.\"Oh? Can Teacher Huyan enlighten me?\"However, Huyan Yong shook his head and said, \"You can't follow Mo Yuntian's path. Give up! Right now, the only method is to delay time at the Elders Council and wait for the dean to return!\"The more Huyan Yong would not say, the more curious Ye Yuan got.Since Huyan Yong would not say, he might as well ask Feng Ruoqing. \"Was there something behind it?\"Feng Ruoqing hesitated for a second, but she still answered. \"Back then, Mo Yuntian was number one on the academy's Martial Roll of Honor, Fourth Level Spirit Condensation Realm! When he was admitted, his close friend was unable to keep up with his footsteps. At that time, he was only a Black Rank student. But then, a student manager from the General Affairs Department was unaware of their relations.h.i.+p and he caused endless troubles for Mo Yuntian's close friend. Finally, the guy turned him into a cripple. In his rage, Mo Yuntian murdered that student manager!\"Hearing that, Ye Yuan snickered coldly. \"Looks like the General Affairs Department is truly a place where talents gather, and their 'virtue' was inherited!\"Feng Ruoqing sighed as she continued explaining, \"There are too many people in the Dan Wu Academy. Using students as managers are also something that cannot be helped. Not only do instructors have to teach cla.s.ses, but we also have to cultivate. If we are bothered by too many miscellaneous stuff, our cultivation would have been bound to be delayed. Hence, the general affairs had always been a place where the authority was the greatest. Therefore, it was also natural to breed these conceited students.\"Ye Yuan nodded to show his understanding. Instructors were also martial artists, and they pursued the martial path. They were obviously unwilling to be distracted by these mundane matters.Only by letting those students with insufficient talent managed the rest could the true geniuses have the time to cultivate. This was an acceptable method.\"Then what happened?\"\"Then Mo Yuntian did not wait for the academy to deal with him. Alone, he walked to the Nine Heavens Peak at the back of the mountain and stepped onto the Nine Heavens Road, which is almost a certain death. But he pa.s.sed through it! However, the Nine Heavens Road is absolutely not something that the current you can charge through!\" Huyan Yong followed up.\"That's to say, the Elders Council can't do anything to me once I pa.s.s through this Nine Heavens Road?\" Ye Yuan ignored Huyan Yong's words and replied with a question.\"Theoretically, yes. But you have to know that when Mo Yuntian made it pa.s.s the Nine Heavens Road, he was already at the Fourth Level Spirit Condensation Realm. Since the establishment of the Dan Wu Academy, there has been a total of 237 people who attempted the Nine Heavens Road. Among them were 194 Spirit Condensation Realm students and 43 Essence Qi Realm students, but only a measly five people made it through. In these ten years, only Mo Yuntian alone made it! Students who failed to make it either died directly on the Nine Heavens Road or lost their minds, and became a complete lunatic ever since. But most importantly, none of the 43 Essence Qi Realm students survived!\" Huyan Yong seemed to have also become jumpy, talking about the Nine Heavens Road.\"Just what is on the Nine Heavens Road?\" Huyan Yong's words seemed to have not changed Ye Yuan's mind.\"n.o.body knows what's on the Nine Heavens Roads. It's because before entering the Nine Heavens Road, students must swear a Heavenly Dao Oath to never reveal any information encountered on the Nine Heavens Road,\" Huyan Yong explained.\"Like that huh? Fascinating! Teacher Huyan, just now that old fart is surnamed Su. Is he someone from the Su Family?\" Ye Yuan suddenly enquired.\"That's right. Su Yubai is the second brother of the Su Family's Family Leader, Su Yulin!\"\"So that's the case. No wonder he had such thick killing intent towards me. Since that's the case, then I will go and try out this Nine Heavens Road!\"Huyan Yong was stunned by Ye Yuan's words. Was the long time he spent talking wasted?Seeing Huyan Yong's expression, Ye Yuan smiled and said, \"Just think about it, Teacher Huyan. Su Yubai wants me dead. He definitely has a way of making the Elders Council impose the death penalty on me. Since that's the case, why should I seek my death? I know that Teacher Huyan wishes to drag things out until the dean is back, but will Su Yubai grant you your wish?\"Hearing Ye Yuan's a.n.a.lysis, Huyan Yong's expression turned stiff.These few years, the dean stood aloof above worldly considerations and did not manage most of the academy's matters, letting Su Yubai fill in the void. The Elders Council was almost mostly his people already.Just as Ye Yuan said, going to the Elders Council now was no different from going to be killed.\"So, the Nine Heavens Road is my only way out!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could veto everything in the academy with one word.Because he represented the Tranquil Cloud Sect!\"Deputy Deans and Elders, an Earth Rank student was utterly lawless in the academy and brutally murdered two fellow students in broad daylight. Today, I've invited everyone to hold this meeting so that we can discuss how we should deal with this student!\"Su Yubai was the one who called for everyone, so he obviously had to stir things up.\"An Earth Rank student dares to be so audacious! What's there to discuss; just kill him right away!\" A deputy dean exploded after hearing that.\"That's right. According to the academy's rules, killing fellow student is the death penalty! What's the need for this meeting?\" another elder echoed in approval.\"Elder Su, I wonder who is this student?\" at this moment, the other deputy dean opened his mouth to ask.Su Yubai gave him a displeased look. This fellow always does not cooperate. Seriously irritating.There were two deputy deans in the Dan Wu Academy. One martial and one alchemy.The deputy dean who agreed just now was called Zhang Songtao, the deputy dean who specialized in the Martial Dao. The one who asked the question was the Alchemy Dao's deputy dean, Hu Changsheng.Hu Changsheng was Jiang Yunhe's die-hard follower and also somebody who did not like power struggles. He was someone who pursued the Alchemy Dao with all his heart. Hence, he basically had no presence all these years. Even in the Elders Council, he virtually abandoned his voting rights.He was not deliberately finding fault today. He just instinctively wanted to find out more.After all, students were the precious resources of the Dan Wu Academy. If they mistakenly killed a genius figure, then the loss outweighed the gain.Although killing fellow students was essentially the death penalty, he still wanted to figure out what was going on.Who knew if the State of Qin's Dan Wu Academy would have a second Mo Yuntian appear?\"This student's name is Ye Yuan, a complete lunatic! He already had a bad track record before entering the academy. Some days back, who knows what lucky encounter he had to have his strength suddenly soar. What's unexpected was that he brutally murdered two fellow students consecutively today. I suspect that he might have gotten some demonic path cultivation law, that's why he lost his mind and did such a cold-blooded thing!\"Su Yubai avoided the crucial points and dwelled on the trivial, describing Ye Yuan as a homicidal maniac.The majority of the elders already stood on his side, now, there was even less to talk about.\"Since that's the case, then there's no need to discuss. After he arrives at the a.s.sembly Hall, just directly sentence him to death,\" Zhang Songtao said nonchalantly.As a deputy dean, his words held a certain weight.These few years, Su Yubai gifted him countless treasures in secret to pull him over. The two are already of the same ilk.As for the other elders, they did not hold as much authority as Su Yubai nor were they as strong as him. Under his coercion and persuasion, they naturally became his va.s.sals.\"Seconded. Such a ruthless lunatic, what's the point of keeping him if we don't kill him?\" an elder said.\"I agree as well.\"Seeing everyone agreed in unanimity to kill Ye Yuan, whether Hu Changsheng casts his vote or not obviously did not matter, so he might as well stay mum.Su Yubai was secretly pleased when he saw the situation. Ye Yuan that punk was simply lawless, not only did he dare to kill fellow students, he even had the nerve to scold him an old fart.Even without the grudge between the Su and Ye Family, he would also sentence him to death today!As for the cause, Su Yubai was actually aware of it already. It was indeed Lin Tiancheng who provoked matters first and forced Ye Yuan's maidservant until she was seriously injured and on the verge of death!But so what? Ye Yuan was seeking death so others could not be blamed.Just like that, the few people chorused in unison and determined the life and death of an Earth Rank student without even asking for the reason.Except, they waited a long time, yet Ye Yuan did not arrive. Rather, it was Feng Ruoqing and Huyan Yong who came.\"What are you two doing? Where's Ye Yuan? Don't tell me you two helped him to abscond punishment?\"Feng Ruoqing and Huyan Yong did not even get to speak, and Su Yubai already judged them.Huyan Yong looked at Su Yubai and smiled coldly as he said, \"If he tried to escape punishment, wouldn't that fulfill your wish? Relax. Ye Yuan isn't that stupid!\"Initially, Huyan Yong was still oblivious to the state of affairs. Only after Feng Ruoqing pointed things out, did he become enlightened on the situation.In reality, he also considered helping Ye Yuan to escape, and return to the academy after the dean returns. But was rejected by Ye Yuan.If Ye Yuan ran away, the Su Family could seize this opportunity to apply pressure and ally with the Wan Family to deal with the Ye Family.Ye Hang was currently in a seclusion and could not be disturbed. Ye Yuan wanted to take on this matter all by himself!Huyan Yong was wholeheartedly devoted to martial arts and could not wrap his mind around these schemes.However, Feng Ruoqing was born in the Imperial Family and was inherently sensitive to these things.\"Since he didn't run, why didn't he come? Don't tell me he still needs this elder to go invite him?\" Su Yubai asked in a deep voice.\"Snort! Why should he come here? You probably already embellished the details and fooled the two deputy deans as well as the elders, and you sentenced Ye Yuan to death already. Am I right? Don't tell me he should come here and die?\" Huyan Yong scoffed.\"Insolence! You dare to question the Elders Council's authority? Do you not want to be an instructor anymore?\" Su Yubai flew into a rage.\"Is it the Elders Council's authority or your authority? Don't try to confound people's eyes!\" Huyan Yong did not give in at all and was diametrically opposed to Su Yubai.\"Alright, alright. You two, stop arguing. The main character isn't here; what's the use of quarreling? Huyan, you said that Elder Su embellished the details. Could it be that Ye Yuan did not kill anyone?\" Hu Changsheng interjected right then.Huyan Yong still had a good favorable impression towards Hu Changsheng, so he naturally would not rebut him.Huyan Yong respectfully saluted with his hands and said, \"It's true that Ye Yuan killed someone, but there's a reason for it, not because of what demonic path fiend that Su Yubai said!\"Huyan Yong recounted how Lu-er was nearly raped and about to die, which infuriated Ye Yuan, making Hu Changsheng knitted his brows after hearing it.Was not this incident a similar occurrence of Mo Yuntian's episode back then?Hu Changsheng turned to Su Yubai and said, \"Elder Su, looks like this General Affairs Department really needs to be properly reorganized!\"Su Yubai's position was inferior to Hu Changsheng, so he naturally did not dare refute. He replied, \"Dean Hu is right. Even if Dean Hu did not say anything, I will also clean up the General Affairs Department after this case. But the pressing matter at the moment is still to deal with Ye Yuan's case. Regardless of what reason he had, killing two people successively is challenging the academy's rules. This must not become a precedent! Even if he had a reason for doing things, the speed of his improvement subverts common sense. It's very likely that he's cultivating a demonic path skill. How can we spare such a person like him?\"\"That's right! The Dan Wu Academy forbids killing fellow students. The killers were already sentenced to death. Don't tell me we should make an exception for Ye Yuan? What capabilities does he have? My view is still to kill him!\" Zhang Songtao said.\"I agree with Dean Zhang's opinion. This must not be encouraged!\"\"I agree as well!\"Seeing the situation, Feng Ruoqing came forward and bowed towards a few people, and then she said, \"Ruoqing is here not to intercede for Ye Yuan, but to inform the two deputy deans and the elders that Ye Yuan is preparing to challenge the Nine Heavens Road three days later. So he will not be attending this meeting.\"\"What? He wants to challenge the Nine Heavens Road? Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm taking on the Nine Heavens Road? Hahaha! Did he think that he could escape the death penalty by doing that? Since he's looking to die, then I will watch just how he dies on the Nine Heavens Road!\" Su Yubai burst into laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Life Land?Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThe news of Ye Yuan challenging the Nine Heavens Road caused a stir once again in the academy.\"Hey, did you hear? Ye Yuan wants to take on the Nine Heavens Road!\"\"Nine Heavens Road? Is he mad? He's only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. It's certain death!\"\"He's originally a madman! Defying the academy's rules, even killing two fellow disciples in succession, scolding Elder Su an old fart right to his face, and even threatened to take his head within a year. If he isn't crazy, then what is? But this time around, he has no choice but to be mad. If he doesn't challenge the Nine Heavens Road, then he absolutely can't escape death!\"\"That's true. But isn't it still death if he charges into the Nine Heavens Road?\"\"At least he can seize the initiative in his hands by tackling the Nine Heavens Road. If he doesn't attempt this, he would be placing himself at the mercy of others. If it were me, I would also choose to challenge the Nine Heavens Road.\"\"I reckon that he still possesses a trace of confidence and thinks he can make it through? If he was given more time to reach the Spirit Condensation Realm, I believe that he can definitely charge through it! But what a pity. n.o.body has ever made it through as an Essence Qi Realm.\"In the Dan Wu Academy, the Nine Heavens Road was a synonym for death. It had already been a whole three years since anybody challenged it.Since the establishment of the State of Qin's Dan Wu Academy, which student who challenged the Nine Heavens Road was not an extraordinary genius?But only a measly five of them made it through!And these five people were all Spirit Condensation Realm without exception.Even if Ye Yuan already had the combat power equal to a Spirit Condensation Realm now, n.o.body thought highly of him.After all, his real strength was only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm.And one could not borrow the power of medicinal pills to raise strength while charging through the Nine Heavens Road!That was to say, Ye Yuan must use the strength of a Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm to take on a death road which made Essence Qi Realms despair!Essence Qi Realm students who challenged the Nine Heavens Road all died without exception.The survival rate of Essence Qi Realms on the Nine Heavens Road was . . . zero!It was the survival rate and not the pa.s.sing rate!Hence, Ye Yuan was not challenging it but committing suicide!It seemed like Ye Yuan had been continuously creating miracles after returning from being poisoned.But this time, n.o.body thinks that he could create another miracle again.. . . . . .Ye Yuan did not bother with the discussion outside. He adjusted his body condition and took care of Lu-er without letting her out of his sight.Ever since Lu-er lost consciousness, she had not woken up.Ye Yuan also did not have any solution for Lu-er's current condition. He could only use his essence energy to suppress the frost poison in her body.Nine Yin Absolute Meridian was no joke. Once it erupted, it would be like a volcano exploding; sweeping forth with irresistible force.If Ye Yuan were still an Alchemy Emperor right now, the Nine Yin Absolute Meridian naturally would not stump him. But his present cultivation was too low.\"Ye Yuan, Miss Lu-er, she . . . could it be that even you don't have any ideas to save her?\"Seeing the normally adorable and obedient Lu-er end up like this, Feng Ruoqing felt all sorts of emotions.Feng Zhirou by the side was also unexpectedly quiet today and did not quarrel with Ye Yuan blindly.Ye Yuan sighed and said, \"Unless my master was here, otherwise . . . Sigh. With Lu-er's current condition, I can only help her sustain her life for half a year at best. After half a year, the frost poison will thoroughly erupt, and I won't be able to control it anymore.\"\"That Zhang Heng really deserved to die! If it were me, I would definitely have diced him into pieces!\" Feng Zhirou gnashed her teeth bitterly.Feng Zhirou did not feel the slightest bit of pity towards someone like Zhang Heng.Feng Ruoqing's eyes, on the other hand, lit up. \"You really have a powerful master! Where is he? Why not invite him here? As long as he comes, not only can he treat Lu-er, even your problems would go away as well!\"Ye Yuan purposely said that he had a master because he was afraid that Feng Ruoqing and co would let their imaginations run wild.Feng Ruoqing was extremely intelligent. He was already facing imminent death, and his master did not show up, which unavoidably set off some ideas.In reality, Ye Yuan had long seen through Feng Ruoqing who wanted to ask but kept holding back her tongue. Which was why he said this.However, where would his powerful master come from?Ye Yuan gave a bitter laugh. \"Master is truly powerful, but he's somebody who can't sit still. After imparting all his knowledge, he left to travel the world. I also don't know where he is now.\"Hearing Ye Yuan said this, Feng Ruoqing was greatly disappointed.Somebody who could raise a monster like Ye Yuan must surely be an extremely powerful figure. He might even be an Alchemy King or even an Alchemy Sovereign from the legends!If he was present, how would Su Yubai dare to be unbridled?\"But, the Nine Heavens Road is a death zone for Essence Qi Realms. Isn't it equivalent to going to die if you enter the Nine Heavens Road?\"Even though Feng Ruoqing and Huyan Yong had been convinced by Ye Yuan, they still did not think well of Ye Yuan.It's not just them. n.o.body in the entire Dan Wu Academy had high hopes of Ye Yuan!\"That's right. Back then when Mo Yuntian entered, it was almost certain death. You're only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm! Why don't you take Lu-er and run?\" Feng Zhirou also joined in from the side.Ye Yuan shook his head and said, \"You think Su Yubai is a moron? How could he give me the chance to escape? I'm afraid that he already has people stationed at every single route out of the academy. As for my residence, there are definitely many people keeping an eye on it. As long as I step out of this house, all my movements will be within his grasp.\"\"This . . .\"\"Alright, thanks for your concern. I know what I'm doing. Even though it's not 100%, I have at least 30% confidence that I can pa.s.s through the Nine Heavens Road!\" Ye Yuan said confidently.\"What? You have 30% confidence? Are you joking? The Nine Heavens Road is a death zone for Essence Qi Realm! You actually say that you have 30% confidence? Are you trying to use these words to dismiss us?\" Feng Zhirou cried out.Although Feng Ruoqing did not say anything, looking at her expression, she obviously did not buy it either.The Nine Heavens Road was certain death for Essence Qi Realms, and Ye Yuan actually said that he had 30% confidence. This could not be regarded as anything but rea.s.suring words.\" Haha. You can choose not to believe me, but you can't not believe my master. Master's might surpa.s.ses your imaginations, so you should also have faith in me,\" Ye Yuan laughed and said.In reality, Ye Yuan's confidence level was way beyond 50%. He was just scared that it would be too insanely startling, which was why he chose to not be explicit.The reason why Ye Yuan dared to challenge the Nine Heavens Road was that he got to understand from Huyan Yong that this Nine Heavens Road was an enormous array formation!It was not going to be easy for a puny little Nine Heavens Road to try and kill him with his attainments in Array Dao.If not for Ye Yuan's cultivation being too low, breaking this array would not be much different than playing house with children.Of course, Ye Yuan was not entirely certain as well. Some array formations have incredibly powerful might, which is not something he could withstand at his current cultivation realm.As for the specifics, it would have to wait until entering the Nine Heavens Road before knowing them.Seeing Ye Yuan so self-a.s.sured, Feng Ruoqing and Feng Zhirou did not know why either, but they gained more confidence out of nowhere.Perhaps Ye Yuan could really create another miracle again?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Naturally, they did not wish to miss out on this grand occasion.The entire Dan Wu Academy was virtually a ghost town as everyone wanted to come and join in the fun.If not for the foreshadowing from earlier events, there might not be such a huge occasion today.A Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm challenging the Nine Heavens Road was just seeking death. What was there to watch?Nonetheless, the incident that Ye Yuan caused earlier gave rise to much debate, and practically everyone knew about it in the academy already. Now, everyone knew that the degree of Ye Yuan's genius had surpa.s.sed their imagination. Could he create another miracle?Even though n.o.body believed it from the bottom of their heart, there was still this faint trace of antic.i.p.ation!On another mountain facing the Nine Heavens Peak, there was a pavilion.This was the ideal spot to watch the Nine Heavens Road!Several people sat around a table in the pavilion. They were precisely Su Yubai and several elders.Many people were crowding around outside the pavilion. Aside from the academy's instructors, they were mainly genius students on the Martial and Alchemy Rolls of Honor. Their status was naturally different from ordinary students.Long Tang, Zuo Bugui, Su Yishan, and others shockingly were there too.\"Hey, Old Long. Why don't we negotiate a bit? How about you return that Sharp Horned Beast inner core to me? That matter previously was just a joke, no need to take it seriously right?\"Zuo Bugui pestered Long Tang incessantly, wanting to take back the Sharp Horned Beast inner core that he lost the previous time.Long Tang did not even look at him and minded his own business as he rested with closed eyes, patiently waiting for Ye Yuan's arrival.\"I say, why are you so unreasonable? You're already so powerful; what do you need an inner core for? It's better if you return it to me!\"\"Old Long, say something!\"\"Ye Yuan's here!\"Long Tang's eyelids quivered, but he quickly recovered his composure.\"Stop pretending alright? We don't talk about that; let's talk about Ye Yuan. Do you think he has a chance of making it through?\"\"Don't know.\"Zuo Bugui was utterly amazed when he heard that. Because Long Tang's reply was \"don't know,\" instead of \"can't make it.\"Long Tang actually had such confidence in Ye Yuan?Even though he and Long Tang had conflicting opinions previously, the result proved that Long Tang was right. But this time around, Zuo Bugui did not think well of Ye Yuan at all.Nine Heavens Road. Even Long Tang did not dare to try it!Although Long Tang thought highly of himself, he was aware that he did not reach that sort of monstrous degree like Mo Yuntian after examining himself.Even Mo Yuntian nearly died before charging through it. How could he make it through?\"You mean that he might make it? How's that possible?\"\"Didn't you say that he couldn't kill Lin Tiancheng before? And the result?\"\"Oh please. This and that aren't the same things, okay? Even a hundred Lin Tianchengs together can't make it past the Nine Heavens Road!\"\"A hundred Lin Tianchengs added up is also not as monstrous as Ye Yuan!\"\". . .\"Zuo Bugui had no words to retort with because what Long Tang said was true.Zuo Bugui suddenly discovered that Long Tang who had always been arrogant actually had signs of acknowledging his inferiority to Ye Yuan.Long Tang was an existence that all the students looked up to in the academy. He had always overlooked all, including him, Zuo Bugui.Yet, this existence actually lifted his gaze now, and looked at another student at eye-level, even looking up!This was simply inconceivable!\"Old Long, this isn't like you!\" Zuo Bugui suddenly felt like a fox mourning the death of a rabbit and said earnestly.Long Tang did not react heavily to it, and only said coolly, \"Did you forget the phrase that has been pa.s.sed down in the academy? Geniuses were meant to be surpa.s.sed!\"Long Tang sucked in deeply, and he slowly said, \"I . . . I'm inferior to him.\"\"Sigh. Even though I don't want to admit it, but what you said is the truth.\" Zuo Bugui also gave a long sigh.\"However, most likely he doesn't have the chance to surpa.s.s you and me anymore! He can't make it past the Nine Heavens Road!\" Zuo Bugui suddenly added.\". . .\"This time around, Long Tang did not retort. Truthfully speaking, he did not have much confidence as well.A survival rate of zero!This number was as difficult to surmount as a ma.s.sive mountain. Could Ye Yuan make it across?. . . . . .\"Humph! This Ye Yuan is putting on airs to actually make so many people wait for him!\" Su Yubai was a little impatient and grumbled.\"Yeah. Indeed, a brat who doesn't know the rules. He deserves to be killed!\" another elder said in agreement.Looks like he had already become Su Yubai's lackey.Hu Changsheng on the other hand smiled and said, \"Nine Heavens Road isn't a joke. He naturally has to make meticulous preparations.\"\"What's there to prepare? Don't tell me that he, an Essence Qi Realm, can make it through? He has to die anyway, yet he's delaying so many people's time. Simply outrageous!\" That elder was very displeased. It was clear that he was already tired of waiting.When he said this, n.o.body refuted it.Preparations indeed did not hold much meaning for Ye Yuan.The way they saw it, Ye Yuan just chose to end it himself, instead of letting them sentenced him to death. But the result was the same.As for whether Ye Yuan could survive, n.o.body had ever believed that.Those students down there have only heard hearsay about the horrors of the Nine Heavens Peak. But these elders and instructors had seen fresh waves of students filling in the gaps as they fell in the Nine Heavens Peak over many years.Even when many of them were still students, the peak talents of their generation had challenged the Nine Heavens Road. But n.o.body succeeded.As for the five who made it, they are already existences that they could only look up to now.No one doubted that Ye Yuan had the potential to pa.s.s through the Nine Heavens Road. But that was just potential. Ye Yuan was only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. He had not even stepped into the last minor stage of the Essence Qi Realm, so how could he pa.s.s?Who among those Essence Qi Realm students that dared to challenge the Nine Heavens Peak before were not peerless geniuses?And those Essence Qi Realm students who went to challenge the Nine Heavens Peak, who among them were not at the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm or even the peak of the Essence Qi Realm?All of them died. Could Ye Yuan make it?The answer was obvious that he could not!Right then, the crowd at the foot of the mountain stirred.Ye Yuan came!Behind Ye Yuan trailed the two girls, Feng Ruoqing and Feng Zhirou, as well as a black-faced Huyan Yong.Everyone directly ignored Huyan Yong and stared at the Feng Family aunt and niece behind Ye Yuan with absolute envy.Who did not want this sort of treatment!With these two girls escorting the road, they would even willingly die!Ye Yuan naturally was not pretending to be some big-shot coming late on purpose. He had to settle Lu-er down properly.Early morning, Ye Yuan transmitted essence energy once more to help Lu-er suppress the frost poison. After adjusting for some time, he let Feng Ruoqing arrange for someone to take good care of Lu-er before he could set his mind at ease and come to the Nine Heavens Peak. So naturally, he was a little late.Gazing into the distance, a road of green pebbles led straight up past the clouds, all the way to the Nine Heavens Peak.What looked like the road leading to the land of the immortals, was actually the forbidden land for martial artists.\"Such superlative craftsmans.h.i.+p! Looks like I can't look down on the experts of this world. This Nine Heavens Road isn't simple!\" Ye Yuan secretly gave his appraisal.Now that Ye Yuan arrived, the crowd automatically gave a wide berth.In front of the Nine Heavens Road, a stone tablet was erected there. On it, wrote a line of words.A martial artist blocked Ye Yuan. \"Before entering the Nine Heavens Road, swear a Heavenly Dao Oath according to the stone tablet first!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I succeed in making it through, I will not reveal any information about the Nine Heavens Road. Otherwise, may Heaven strike me dead!\"Ye Yuan swore once according to the words on the stone tablet and slightly felt his divine soul quiver.Ye Yuan knew that this was the feeling when one's divine soul signed a pledge with the Heavenly Dao.In the future, if he goes against this oath, the Heavenly Dao will make heavenly punishment descend, destroying his body and soul.\"Now, can I enter?\"The guard stepped aside to allow Ye Yuan pa.s.sage.Ye Yuan turned back to Feng Ruoqing and co, and he said, \"Help me take good care of Lu-er. I'll be back soon.\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Ye Yuan walked past the guard and stepped onto the Nine Heavens Road.Stepping onto the first step, the scenery suddenly transformed.The initially narrow Nine Heavens Road suddenly became a boundless horizon.Ye Yuan turned around. The road he came from already disappeared, and what replaced it was still endless steps.The entire strip of Nine Heavens Road had transformed into another world. A world const.i.tuted of countless green stone steps.\"Indeed a little interesting! Looks like every man has his edge. Even though the Lower Realms' martial prowess cannot compare to the Divine Realm, they still have undergone countless eons of development and derivation. They are many things aren't present in the Divine Realm. This Nine Heavens Road became an independent world. Looks like the person who set the array already had considerable accomplishments, and this array formation is a unique school of thought. 1 It's a different style from the Divine Realm. Tranquil Cloud Sect can't be underestimated!\" Ye Yuan gasped in admiration.This entire array formation was integrated into a harmonious reality. There were countless illusion arrays and killing arrays mixed into it. Even though its power was inferior to the Divine Realm's arrays, the complexity of this did not pale in the slightest.\"No wonder this Nine Heavens Road is so hard to pa.s.s through. If these illusion arrays and killing arrays were activated at full power, killing Crystal Formation Realm martial artists would be like chopping vegetables!\" Ye Yuan exclaimed in admiration once more.\"Well, there's not much hope of breaking the array. My strength now is really too poor. Let me test out this Nine Heavens Road's array formations' power!\"After he said this, Ye Yuan strode out with a large step.The step forward seemed to have activated the arrays. Countless strong gales howled towards Ye Yuan.These gales were abnormally piercing-cold as if it could annihilate all life on earth. But this world only had Ye Yuan alone, so naturally, he was the target.\"The concept of wind? Looks like this Nine Heavens Road was constructed to help students train. Much thought and care had been expended on this. Except, using this sort training method seems a bit too cruel.\"As Ye Yuan sighed admirably, he moved along with the wind. The strong violent gale was actually unable to cause any harm to Ye Yuan whatsoever!These strong gales were man-made through the creator of the array formations integrating his own understanding of the concept of wind inside it!After sensing the concept of wind amidst the powerful gales, Ye Yuan knew the intention of the creator of this array. He hoped to let students comprehend the concept of wind inside through these gales.However, how many people could comprehend the concept of wind at the Essence Qi Realm or the Spirit Condensation Realm?The way the other students saw it, these powerful gusts existed to hurt people, instead of helping them to understand some profound concept.If it were another student tackling the Nine Heavens Road, this Strong Gale round would most likely have already exhausted a great deal of essence energy.They were unable to be so at ease like Ye Yuan. They have to activate their essence energy s.h.i.+elds in order to withstand the power of these gales.Otherwise, these strong gales would be like blades, slicing their body into pieces.Even Spirit Condensation Realm students would have exhausted enormous amounts of essence energy after making it past this round; let alone those of Essence Qi Realms.If Essence Qi Realm students used essence energy protection to withstand this round, they would directly lose 30% - 40%, and this was only the first round!Under this sort of expenditure, if Essence Qi Realms did not die, where could they flee to?In contrast, Ye Yuan did not even use his essence energy for protection. He simply swayed his body along with the wind force, and the gale wind blades floated past his body easily.These gales were just like a giant wind blade technique, cutting wantonly in this s.p.a.ce; omnidirectional and with no blind angles.If students did not open their essence energy protection after coming in here, the consequences would be very severe.As to why Ye Yuan did not use essence energy protection, it was because his comprehension towards the concept of wind was way above these gales.The concept of wind encompa.s.sed within these gale winds, to Ye Yuan, was like a toddler learning how to walk. Wanting to hurt him was naturally hardly possible.Not to mention that Ye Yuan's Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword technique already encompa.s.sed an exceedingly profound concept of wind within.Except, Ye Yuan's Essence Qi Realm cultivation realm was too low and unable to unleash the true might of the concept of wind; that's all.Following the increase of his cultivation, the power of the Falling Flower Floating Zero Sword would also become increasingly stronger.Although Ye Yuan was only at the Essence Qi Realm currently, it was still more than sufficient to evade the attacks of these gale winds.. . . . . .Ye Yuan could not see the landscape outside, but the people outside could see Ye Yuan's situation.To be more precise, they could not see what was happening inside the illusionary world, but they were able to clearly see what Ye Yuan was doing right now.There were a total of 999 stone steps on the Nine Heavens Road. Right now, Ye Yuan had already walked across more than 20 steps.It was just that from the perspective of a bystander, Ye Yuan's condition did not seem to be too good.\"What's Ye Yuan doing? He's dangling and swaying about like he's drunk.\"\"Don't know. Is he being mesmerized by an illusion world?\"\"I think so! Look at him swaying around non-stop. Who tackles the Nine Heavens Road like that?\"\"En. I heard from some senior apprentice brothers that in the past when those people challenged the Nine Heavens Road, they opened up their essence energy protection right away as if there was something terrifying. But you look at Ye Yuan. He didn't even open anything, but rather, it's like he's drunk. Why is he totally different from how others challenging the Nine Heavens Road?\"\"Yeah. According to the seniors' speculations, the first 333 steps of the Nine Heavens Road might be some external force test which is extremely taxing on essence energy. Those who could walk past 333 steps would be completely fatigued. But why is Ye Yuan's perfectly fine? Could it be that what he encountered was different from the seniors?\"\"This Ye Yuan is really a wonder. Whatever he does is different from the rest. It's just that if he does this, would he lose his mind within the first 333 steps?\"\"I think there's really that possibility!\"\"Eh? Look! Ye Yuan seems to have recovered!\"That person fixed his eyes to take a look, and Ye Yuan was indeed no longer behaving like he was drunk. He continued walking up steadily.One look and onlookers could tell that Ye Yuan should have pa.s.sed through the first barrier.\"This . . . the first round is completed so effortlessly?\" Huyan Yong stared dazedly at Ye Yuan's figure with a dumbfounded face.As an instructor in the academy, he knew much more things than the rest of the students! These things were summed up using the experience from students' fresh blood.The first 333 steps on the Nine Heavens Road, and every 33 steps was a minor barrier.Although it was unknown what exactly these minor barriers were, regardless of who charged through these minor barriers, it would not be this effortless!What's more, some Essence Qi Realm students were directly annihilated at the first minor barrier!But Ye Yuan managed to pa.s.s through it just by swaying around like that the entire way!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He only crossed 33 steps by luck, the first minor barrier. Each and every one of them is behaving like he already cleared it!\"Su Yubai snorted coldly. Evidently, he was very displeased by everyone's astonishment.The way he saw it, Ye Yuan only pa.s.sed the first barrier by luck!Furthermore, pa.s.sing the first barrier did not signify anything. Many Essence Qi Realms were able to cross it.The true terror of the Nine Heavens Road was in the last 333 steps!\"Yeah. One look and you can tell that this Ye Yuan is a slippery punk. He probably excels in exploiting gaps. Most likely he took advantage of some loophole. That's why it was so easy for him.\" Another elder chimed in.\"Mm. No matter what you say, the Nine Heavens Road is a death zone for Essence Qi Realm. That is the truth that n.o.body can alter! Looking at the past, the highest record for Essence Qi Realm was at the middle 333 steps. Even if Ye Yuan's incredibly heaven-defying, his limit will at most be at the last 333 steps.\" Zhang Songtao also agreed.Unlike the other elders, Ye Yuan's performance gave Huyan Yong and Feng Ruoqing more confidence.\"The most terrifying aspect of these first 333 steps is the exhaustion of essence energy! Spirit Condensation Realms are a little better, but it's very difficult for an Essence Qi Realm's essence energy to sustain till the end. Even if they are lucky enough to bear through it, the middle 333 steps will only get more terrifying than the front part. In the end, they still die. But Ye Yuan didn't even use essence energy protection in the first round. He basically didn't expend much essence energy at all,\" Huyan Yong said agitatedly.Ye Yuan can really bring people limitless surprises. Perhaps . . . he might really make it? Feng Ruoqing muttered to herself.\"Tch. That fellow is smelly and hard. It's better if he's dead!\" Feng Zhirou recovered her fierce and unreasonable nature.Feng Ruoqing smiled and said, \"If he dies, you can forget about breaking through to the Crystal Formation Realm in this lifetime.\"\". . . Who cares!\" Feng Ruoqing remained stubborn, but her eyes kept following Ye Yuan on the steps.. . . . . .The Strong Gale round did not pose much difficulty to Ye Yuan. The instant he crossed the 33rd step and landed on the 34th step, the scenario suddenly transformed once again, becoming a stretch of fiery sea.The concept of fire!This was a flame road!The scorching flames roasted Ye Yuan until he was about to combust, but a cold smile flashed across the corner of Ye Yuan's mouth.\"I wonder what the Spirit Bristle Divine King will feel if he knew that someone was playing with fire in front of his cultivation law!\"Saying this, Ye Yuan revolved the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art not to activate essence energy protection, but to completely release his aura to let his essence energy erupt out!Then Ye Yuan made his strides and steadily went up. Where he pa.s.sed by, the flames automatically retreated!Playing with the concept of fire in front of the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was simply a joke!The Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art was the supreme fire attribute cultivation law in the Divine Realm. It had virtually reached the limits of the concept of fire!Back then, the Spirit Bristle Divine King relied on the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art's ultimate technique, Nine Suns Burning Heaven, and became renown in a single battle! He used the Nine Suns Burning Heaven during that battle, and he directly burnt the numerous Divine Kings attacking him into nothingness. Since then, n.o.body dared to provoke him.Even though Ye Yuan's current power was still shallow, it was still not something that a Lower Realm mortal flame could compare to.This was like a young, juvenile dragon. No matter how little he was, he would still be the king of all beasts. All laid dormant where he pa.s.sed!Ye Yuan continued forward steadily as the flames around him automatically gave him a wide berth.Just like that, Ye Yuan pa.s.sed through the second round, Flame Sea, with unbelievable speed.Ye Yuan had to waste around an incense of time to avoid the strong gales in order to pa.s.s the first round.As for this second round, Ye Yuan pa.s.sed it in a blink of an eye.Third round, Arctic World!This was a world of ice and snow, and it was extremely cold.Yet, this sort of cold seemed to be unable to pose any form of threat in front of Ye Yuan's Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art.Ye Yuan immediately cleared it once again!In a blink of an eye, Ye Yuan crossed 99 steps!Next was the fourth round, Gravity World. Fifth round, Thick Earth World. Sixth round, Water World . . . All the way until the tenth world, Ye Yuan came all the way here unimpeded.Ye Yuan's realm was much higher than the creator of these arrays. These barriers were simply unable to cause any great difficulty for him. He did not even expend much essence energy.\"I wonder who from the Tranquil Cloud Sect created these arrays. They actually integrated metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; these concepts of five elements as well as the other five types of concepts derived from them. Truly a genius! I wonder what happened to this person afterward. Did he ascend to the Divine Realm? I've never heard of such an array formations genius before in the Divine Realm. Could it be that he had long fallen?\" Ye Yuan was overcome with emotion.The world of martial artists was filled with countless dangers. Aside from the dangers on the road of cultivation, what was even scarier was the human heart.Since ancient times, regardless of whether it was the Divine Realm or the Lower Realms, geniuses were as abundant as the hair on an ox. However, only a remarkable handful was able to truly mature.Which of the figures standing at the pinnacle of the Divine Realm did not tread over countless corpses of geniuses to attain their current position?Even a peerless genius like Qingyun Zi plummeted after being harmed while in the process of maturing; let alone the others.. . . . . .Ye Yuan's speed of clearing the rounds caused a huge uproar in the outside world!He was too fast!From the first step to crossing the first 333 steps, Ye Yuan spent less than two hours. This was simply too harrowing!One student rubbed his eyes and asked in disbelief, \"Do I have something wrong with my eyes? Since when did this Nine Heavens Road become so easy to pa.s.s?\"\"Does your brain have holes? Why don't you try it, if it is easy to cross! I think you won't even know how you die!\"\"But Ye Yuan is only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. How could he possibly be this fast?\"\"I heard that this Nine Heavens Road is not a place that tests strength solely. What the test placed emphasis on, is potential! Looking from that perspective, this Ye Yuan's talent is truly so monstrous that it's inconceivable! But I don't know if he can cross the later 666 steps or not.\"\"Maybe he can really cross it?\"The two exchanged glances. They were both frightened by this thought!Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm pa.s.sing the Nine Heavens Road?This was impossible! Absolutely impossible! The Nine Heavens Road was a forbidden ground for Essence Qi Realm martial artists!They did not know why either, but once this thought arose, it was like a seed, buried at the bottom of their hearts. It grew roots and sprouted, and it could no longer be stopped!On the other hand, when Ye Yuan pa.s.sed the first 333 steps, Su Yubai jumped to his feet. He looked at Ye Yuan who was halfway up the mountain similarly with incredulity.One could not blame him for being so shocked. Ye Yuan's speed in pa.s.sing the rounds was too quick!He crushed all resistance along the way without any delay!There were only that few students who pa.s.sed through the Nine Heavens Road. Their performance was not kept a secret. As the Disciplinary Hall's First Elder, Su Yubai was naturally very clear on that!However, n.o.body among those who challenged the road had Ye Yuan's crossing speed, including those Spirit Condensation Realm students who pa.s.sed!Even the Mo Yuntian who was br.i.m.m.i.n.g with talent spent an entire day to pa.s.s the first 333 steps!But Ye Yuan only took two hours!Doesn't that mean that the degree of Ye Yuan's genius was several times, even tens of times that of Mo Yuntian's?Su Yubai did not dare nor was he willing to believe this thought!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I really don't know what to say about this Ye Yuan. Other people are filled with fear and trepidation before challenging the Nine Heavens Road, and he cleared it so effortlessly. Is there nothing that can stump him?\"Zuo Bugui looked at Ye Yuan halfway up the mountain and was likewise completely stunned.The shocks that Ye Yuan brought him these few days was simply too many.Jumping ranks and killing Fei Qingping. Consecutively breaking through five realms within a month. Becoming an Alchemy Master with a Fourth Level Essence Qi Realm cultivation. Leaping across a major realm to kill Lin Tiancheng. Each one of these matters, when placed on a single individual, was an impossible task.But Ye Yuan did them all!Now, was Ye Yuan going to clear the Nine Heavens Road, which no Essence Qi Realm had ever pa.s.sed through before? This was also simply inconceivable!Even if he could not clear it, just based on his speed in the first 333 steps, it was sufficient to look down on all genius students!\"Yeah. There's really nothing that he can't do, and nothing that he doesn't dare to do. Compared to him, we're all self-boasting geniuses. Such a joke!\" A deep shock was also plastered all over Long Tang's face.\"Old Long, I've never denied that I'm a genius. At least that's the case within the territory of the State of Qin. However, the degree of Ye Yuan's genius has already vastly exceeded the domain of genius.\" Zuo Bugui sighed in admiration.All this while, only Long Tang could steadily suppress Zuo Bugui's arrogance. But now, his arrogance was shattered by Ye Yuan's performance.The dazed look in Long Tang's gaze vanished, and what replaced it was incomparable determination!He shook his head and said, \"I'm not talking about his talent, but his heart of a powerhouse! Compared to Ye Yuan, what we lack the most is still the heart of a powerhouse! What a joke. I, Long Tang, have always prided myself on being able to look down on all experts. But in reality, I'm just a coward! Ye Yuan, thank you!\"Zuo Bugui was somewhat confounded by Long Tang's words. However, he could clearly sense some sort of transformation taking place in Long Tang's body.Like the feeling of . . . enlightenment!\"What are you talking about, Old Long? Heart of a powerhouse? Even though we aren't as monstrous as Ye Yuan, our desire to become strong has never changed all this while right?\" Zuo Bugui asked in puzzlement.Long Tang did not look at Zuo Bugui but stared at Ye Yuan who was halfway up and gave a confusing answer. \"Powerhouse? A true powerhouse is not about how strong his strength is but how powerful his inner heart is! Zuo Bugui, after this matter is settled, I'll also challenge the Nine Heavens Road!\"\"What?! You want to challenge the Nine Heavens Road? Are you tired of living?\" Zuo Bugui jumped in fright as he exclaimed.However, Long Tang just smiled lightly as if he had seen past life and death. \"If I can't even pa.s.s through a tiny Nine Heavens Road in the State of Qin, how can I talk about becoming a powerhouse? What qualifications would I have to look down upon this Endless World and ascend to the Divine Realm?\"This place Ye Yuan reincarnated in was called the Endless World.Endless World was named after the Endless Forest. Because it was truly endless and limitless, separating the Endless World into the North and South domain.\"Mad! Completely mad! No matter how powerful you are, Old Long, are you more powerful than Mo Yuntian? You will die if you attempt the Nine Heavens Road! What will you have to look down on the Endless World if you lose your life?\" Zuo Bugui was ruffled.Ye Yuan was a madman, and now, even the rank one on the Martial Roll of Honor, Long Tang, also went crazy along with him! Just what was happening to this world?Long Tang, on the other hand, was unmoved. Incomparable resolve could be seen in his eyes.\"Why should martial artists regret death? How can one talk about becoming a powerhouse without the realization of going to die?\" Long Tang said casually.\"But even when martial artists die, they have to die with significance! What's the point if you challenge the Nine Heavens Road just to die?\"Zuo Bugui was still unable to figure it out. The way he saw it, the Nine Heavens Road was just a large scale array. Dying inside the array was something utterly meaningless.\"What kind of death holds meaning? Only now do I understand that victory and defeat lie in one thought. Strong and weak . . . also lies in a single thought! Zuo Bugui, you and I are ultimately not from the same world.\" Long Tang finally looked at Zuo Bugui. The expression in his eyes was something which he had never seen before.Zuo Bugui was rank two on the Martial Roll. Apart from Long Tang, he was invincible in the academy. Even Feng Zhirou could not defeat him.Even when facing Long Tang, the disparity with Zuo Bugui was actually not that large.But now, Long Tang actually said that they were not from the same world? How could Zuo Bugui feel comfortable?\"What you meant is that you and Ye Yuan are people from the same world? Aren't your words too conceited, Old Long?\" Zuo Bugui kept away that trademark cynical smile and said somewhat unhappily.However, Long Tang shook his head and said, \"Ye Yuan . . . I'm afraid I have no opportunity to catch up to him in this lifetime. He and I . . . are also from entirely different worlds.\"After saying that, Long Tang kept silent and simply watched Ye Yuan halfway up patiently.Zuo Bugui also fell silent and started to muse.He felt that some sort of transformation had taken place in Long Tang's body. It was just that he could not understand what this transformation was even after cracking his head open trying to figure it out.Except . . . could this transformation separate both of them into two different worlds? How was that possible?Just because Long Tang was going to challenge the Nine Heavens Road?Why don't I also try taking on the Nine Heavens Road?Zuo Bugui swiftly rejected this idea. He was indeed strong, but he did not even have 10% confidence for him to challenge the Nine Heavens Road successfully. It was indeed almost certain death!Although Long Tang was stronger than him, he was not that much stronger. That was to say even if he went, it would be virtually certain death!Just what did this fellow come to realize?Such a low survival rate and he still dared to try it? Wasn't this courting death?Yes. Long Tang had truly been enlightened!He saw what was called the heart of a powerhouse from Ye Yuan.Ye Yuan's chances were actually not that great when he challenged Lin Tiancheng. But he went to do it.Ye Yuan's chances were even much lower than imagined when he went to take on the Nine Heavens Road. But he did it anyway.Even though he clearly understood that killing fellow disciples would result in the death penalty, Ye Yuan still did it without looking back.Even though he was clear that the Nine Heavens Road was certain death, he still did it without hesitation.Breaking the rules, challenging oneself, and surpa.s.sing oneself.This was the heart of a powerhouse!For a martial artist to cultivate was originally already going against the heavens. Without the consciousness of death, how could one sense the unparalleled Heavenly Dao and reach the paramount Deity Realm?Why should we rejoice over life, and why should we be bitter about death?The road of a powerhouse was filled densely with thorns. Even if one did not go and challenge the Nine Heavens Road, there might still be an Eight Heavens Road, Ten Heavens Road.A person could hide for a moment, but could he hide for a lifetime?Only by braving forward could one trample all these ups and downs underfoot. Only by continually surpa.s.sing oneself could there be a possibility to truly look down on all life under the heavens!Pursuing good fortune and avoiding disasters were the primal instinct of men. But if martial artists did not sever these instincts, how could they talk about being an expert?Long Tang could see from Zuo Bugui's eyes that he simply did not dare to give birth to the thought of challenging the Nine Heavens Road. Hence, he said that they were not from the same world.Long Tang was destined to walk out of the State of Qin; a person who would walk unparalleled throughout the entire Endless World.But Zuo Bugui was only an expert in the State of Qin. Even if he forced himself to the limits, he would only be an expert in the Tranquil Cloud Sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Except for Zuo Bugui.But even Zuo Bugui could not imagine just what kind of change Long Tang's transformation brought him.It was until many years later, Zuo Bugui then heard that Long Tang's martial prowess broke the void, and he ascended to the Divine Realm with the status of the strongest expert in the Endless World. At that time, he finally understood what these words meant back during the days of the State of Qin.Of course, this was all later on in the future.Just as Long Tang was conversing with Zuo Bugui, another commotion sprung out from the crowd again.\"Quickly look! Ye Yuan stopped advancing!\"\"Yeah. He stopped at the 338th step. It's only been five steps!\"\"He scared me to death! I thought that he would continue forth with an indomitable force.\"\"Are you dumb? This is the Nine Heavens Road, hailed as the death zone for all Essence Qi Realms. How could he possibly continue forth without any resistance? The true difficulty of the Nine Heavens Road starts from the middle 333 steps stage. The vast majority of those Essence Qi Realms who came to challenge the Nine Heavens Road fell at this juncture! How could Ye Yuan possibly fall to the first stage with how monstrous he is?\"\"So that's the case! His crossing speed just now was too frightening. It quickly swept me up. Hur hur. Then do you think Ye Yuan can make it through?\"\"Absolutely not! If Ye Yuan were at half-step Spirit Condensation Realm, I would feel that he might make it through. But he's only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm! The scariest part of the Nine Heavens Road is still the final 333 steps!\"Just as Ye Yuan landed on the fifth step of the second stage on the Nine Heavens Road, his fierce momentum finally halted.This action naturally drew everyone's attention. The crowd started clamoring.The people who were initially stunned by Ye Yuan's advancing momentum suddenly came to a realization at this moment.This was the death zone for all Essence Qi Realms, Nine Heavens Road! How could it be possible to pa.s.s through it smoothly without problems?When Su Yubai saw this scene, his initial shock turned into wild ecstasy.\"I've long said that he can't possibly pa.s.s through! A tiny little Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm dares to tackle the Nine Heavens Road? Conceited! Seeking his own destruction!\"Even though he was filled with wild joy, Su Yubai obviously would not be stupid enough to show it on his face. However, he did not hold back his words at all.Everybody knew that he wanted to eliminate Ye Yuan anyway, so he naturally had no need to pretend to be some hypocritical good person.\"What Elder Su said is right. This Ye Yuan would rather challenge the Nine Heavens Road than come to the elder's meeting. This is slighting us all! Such an impertinent brat! The way I see it, there's nothing to regret over his death!\" an elder echoed.\"Elder Lin's words are unreasonable. Challenging the Nine Heavens Road is the right of every student. Once you pa.s.s the Nine Heavens Road, you would enjoy the special privilege of the high sect's core disciple. This was set by the high sect. No matter how powerful the Elders Council is, it's not greater than the high sect's rules, right?\" Hu Changsheng raised his eyelids and said coolly.Like everybody else, Hu Changsheng was also astonished by Ye Yuan's performance. It was just that he did not show it. He kept both eyes lightly closed like an old monk in meditation.However, Hu Changsheng's talent loving heart was stirred, and he felt great pity for Ye Yuan.Such a genius might be able to pa.s.s the Heaven Rank Advancement test in the future and become the Tranquil Cloud Sect's inner disciple. He might even yield brilliant results in the Ten Nation's Grand Compet.i.tion and be chosen as a core disciple of the Tranquil Cloud Sect!But now, Ye Yuan was going to fall on the Nine Heavens Road. How could that not make people sigh regretfully?And what caused this sort of tragedy to happen was precisely these few so-called elders in front of his eyes who were playing politics!How could this not make him displeased?Hence, Hu Changsheng who was always a nice person finally blew his top!Yes. Even with Ye Yuan's spectacular performance, Hu Changsheng did not think that Ye Yuan could pa.s.s through the Nine Heavens Road!As the deputy dean, he naturally understood much more than the students. The further one went along the Nine Heavens Road, the more challenging it became. Especially at the last 333 steps, the difficulty basically reached an extreme level.It was impossible for Ye Yuan to pa.s.s it with his current realm!Hu Changsheng's words left that elder who was surnamed Lin dumbfounded. What could he say? That he was bigger than the Tranquil Cloud Sect? Was that not seeking death?. . . . . .Presently, Ye Yuan was already on an illusionary trip. He was currently in the pill refinement room at the Divine Realm's Medicine King's Hall.A pill refinement room so vast that it could be a training room for martial arts, tens of times greater than Feng Ruoqing's refinement room. It could be called extravagant!Ye Yuan would treat other aspects of himself shabbily with the sole exception of this pill refinement room and things related to it. No matter what he would not treat himself badly or underperform on this aspect.Because the Alchemy G.o.d realm was his life-long goal!Limitless Cauldron, one of the best pill cauldrons in the Divine Realm. It was formerly Ye Yuan's greatest love.Apart from that, various pill refining tools and herbal ingredients were all here. Everything here was so familiar.Ye Yuan spent over 300 years in this pill refinement room!To Ye Yuan, he was even more familiar with this refinement room than his bedchamber.There were no mirrors in his pill refinement room, but Ye Yuan knew that he definitely recovered his previous life's appearance.\"Appearance is born from the heart. This illusionary realm is seriously realistic. It can actually completely dig out the things buried within my heart so thoroughly! Even though I know it's an illusionary realm, I still don't wish to wake up!\" Ye Yuan sighed emotionally.After Ye Yuan entered the Nine Heavens Road's second stage, he suddenly felt his head was incomparably heavy. After a bout of dizziness, he appeared in his former refinement room.Ye Yuan already confirmed that he entered an illusionary realm nearly straightaway.Illusionary realms might look completely harmless, but it was extremely dangerous. Those students who went insane after challenging the Nine Heavens Road basically lost themselves after failing this second stage.The average person who ventured deep into an illusionary world would often unable to extricate themselves out from it. They would be swept inside instantly, and finally, lose themselves inside it.Only someone with a firm heart could free themselves from the illusion world and return to reality. However, this process was tremendously arduous. Even Mo Yuntian who was so powerful back then spent several days before he could awaken.To talk about a firm heart, the previous life's Qingyun Zi was not that powerful either.However, he had changed dramatically today and became countless times more mature than the previous life's Qingyun Zi in terms of mentality. In addition, his heart for vengeance was incomparably firm. How could ordinary illusionary worlds mesmerize him?Without talking about how Ye Yuan himself was a great array master, even if his strength today was lacking and unable to break the array, it was still insanely difficult for illusion arrays to make him fall for them.No matter how powerful this Nine Heavens Road was, it was nothing but an array formation from the Lower Realms. It was still considered as nothing in Ye Yuan's eyes.This was also his greatest reliance to dare to tackle the Nine Heavens Road!Except, seeing through the illusion world did not mean being able to break the illusion world, and it also did not mean willingness to break the illusion world.This Nine Heavens Road was extremely remarkable, to directly look at the human heart.Even somebody like Ye Yuan was unwilling to leave just like that after seeing this place filled with cherished memories.These things had accompanied Ye Yuan for 300 years!Every blade of gra.s.s and every tree was filled with feelings!With a casual wave, the Limitless Cauldron turned into a remarkably small and exquisite pill cauldron in Ye Yuan's hand. The feeling when his fingers came into contact with the Limitless Cauldron was exactly the same as back then.Of course it would be exactly the same. Because this illusionary realm was birthed from his inner thoughts!\"If time could rewind, how great would that be . . .\" Ye Yuan was overcome with emotion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Heart Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97: Heart Realm!Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorDong dong dong!Just as Ye Yuan was lost in his emotions, a knocking sound came from outside the door.\"Are you in there, Yun-er?\"That familiar yet foreign voice sounded out from outside the door. Ye Yuan could never forget this voice even if he turned to ashes. Because it was the voice belonging to his father, Ji Zhengyang.Zhengyang Zi and Qingyun Zi were only Dao-t.i.tles that the outside world dedicated to them. Qingyun Zi and his father were originally surnamed Ji.In the Divine Realm, any alchemist who reached the realm of Alchemy Emperor would be addressed respectfully with 'Zi.' Directly calling an Alchemy Emperor with his name was a great disrespect and could very well anger the Alchemy Emperor.And the vastness of an Alchemy Emperor's network was unimaginable to the average person!Even though he was clearly aware that he was currently inside an illusionary realm, Ye Yuan still shuddered uncontrollably.Casually firing out a spell, the door to the pill refinement room automatically opened revealing Ji Zhengyang's figure.Seeing this familiar figure once again, Ye Yuan's eyes immediately became moist.Ji Zhengyang entered with a faint smile. When he saw Ye Yuan's wet eyes, he could not help but be surprised. \"Why is your face covered in tears, Yun-er?\"Ye Yuan who had transformed into Ji Qingyun was fully aware that this was inside an illusionary realm, but he still could not resist explaining.\"Father, when Yun-er was preparing the herbs just now, I used the Melancholy Gathering Gra.s.s and accidentally got the fumes in my eyes. That's why I'm like this.\"Melancholy Gathering Gra.s.s was a ninth rank herb with extremely powerful stimulating effects. Even with Ji Qingyun's status as an Alchemy Emperor, if he got the fumes in his eyes, he would also cry nonstop.Ye Yuan did not know why he would inexplicably come up with a white lie even though he knew perfectly well that the Ji Zhengyang in front of his eyes did not exist.As expected, Ji Zhengyang laughed when he heard it. \"Yun-er is overly careless. Even father dares not to overlook this Melancholy Gathering Gra.s.s. How could you be so careless?\"Ye Yuan quietly received this teaching. \"Father is right. Yun-er will be more careful next time.\"Ji Zhengyang let out a sigh and said, \"Oh Yun-er . . . Father knows that you are infatuated with the Alchemy Dao, but there isn't only the Alchemy Dao in this world. Cooping yourself up in a pill refinement room all the time will do you no good!\"Ye Yuan once again replied respectfully, \"Don't worry, Father. Yun-er knows when to stop.\"Ji Zhengyang shook his head and said, \"You, oh you. What do you want me to say about you? The Alchemy Dao is boundless and everlasting. Even if we pour our entire lives into it, it would be hard to even glimpse a ten-thousandth of it. Even if you really stepped into the Deity Realm in the future and become an Alchemy G.o.d, it is but another beginning. When alive, one has to take note of many other things. You will see that the vastness of this world far exceeds your imagination when you step outside of the pill refinement room. You should learn more from your senior apprentice brother about this point.\"Ye Yuan's face changed upon mentioning his senior apprentice brother. The killing intent in his heart unconsciously welled up but was quickly pressed down.The current Ye Yuan could not be compared to the past. If he did not even have this bit of shrewdness, how could he talk about revenge?One had to know that what he was worse off than his senior apprentice brother was not limited to cultivation realm, but instead, he fell behind in all aspects!And wasn't this illusionary realm an excellent place for Ye Yuan to temper his heart realm?Although he knew that this illusion array was automatically activated, and n.o.body knew what was happening inside, Ye Yuan still did not wish to expose these things that were buried in the innermost part of his heart.Firstly, it was to temper his heart realm. Secondly, it was to prepare for all contingencies.After all, his origin was simply overly startling. If it was leaked, it might be hard to not arouse some big trouble.And Ye Yuan's current strength was far from being able to protect himself.However, Ji Zhengyang apparently seemed to have discovered Ye Yuan's flash of killing intent and was very puzzled.\"What's wrong? You had a conflict with your senior apprentice brother?\"Ye Yuan smiled and nodded. \"Don't worry, father. It's just a small spat. It will be fine after this period of time.\"Ji Zhengyang then smiled and said, \"So that's the case. Then it's fine. A peaceful family will prosper. Small fights and arguments are fine, but if you two brothers turn on each other, this Medicine King Hall will decline sooner or later.\"Ye Yuan secretly sighed. This was more than just turning on each other!This scoundrel killed the master who imparted to him all his abilities and raised him for several hundred years. He even murdered his master's only son!Such an unfilial son could not be tolerated by heaven and earth!Ji Canglan!When I return to the Divine Realm someday, I will definitely grind your bones to dust! '\"I will. I wonder why Father came to look for this child?\"Although the killing intent in his heart was billowing to the skies, Ye Yuan did not let out the slightest bit.Ye Yuan knew that he seemed to have broken through in terms of his heart realm.After hearing that, Ji Zhengyang smacked his own head and smiled wryly. \"You see, I'm already old and muddle-headed. I forgot about the proper business after talking to you. Father has refined a half-step divine pill and was about to convene a Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly. When visitors from all around come to congratulate a few days later, you and your senior apprentice brother shall arrange all the matters. Don't treat the guests discourteously.\"Hearing this, Ye Yuan's entire body trembled!Just now, he was immersed in past events and completely did not think about what time the illusionary realm brought him to.Only now that Ji Zhengyang mentioned it did Ye Yuan suddenly awakened. This so-called Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly was precisely when Ji Canglan revealed his fangs!What Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly was this? This was simply a Father and Brother Killing Grand a.s.sembly!The so-called visitors from all around were also single-handedly arranged by Ji Canglan.He really did not know how Ji Canglan operated over these few years to suddenly bring over dozens of Divine Kings. With the inside colluding with the outside, they swiftly brought down the Medicine King Hall!The Medicine King Hall was also a top-tier power in the Divine Realm. Just the Divine Kings under Zhengyang Zi's command numbered over a dozen. But Ji Canglan had handled everything for several hundred years, causing the Medicine King Hall to fall apart immediately.Ji Qingyun was oblivious to the outside world, so he was hoodwinked by everything that happened. Even after he reincarnated today, he still could not understand just how Ji Canglan did all those things under the eyes of the father-son pair.When he closed his eyes to await death, he was seized with remorse over his usual indifference. But it was already too late for regrets. Ji Zhengyang was dead and his Dao dissipated!Hence, the purpose of Ye Yuan's existence in this life was to do two things!The first thing was to personally kill Ji Canglan and avenge this immense hatred. The second was to figure out just what force was supporting Ji Canglan from behind!Ye Yuan believed that Ji Canglan would undoubtedly be unable to do this alone.Wis.h.i.+ng to overturn a colossal bring such as the Medicine King Hall? The force behind Ji Canglan must surely be powerful to the point it terrifies people at the sight of it.But so what?If he could not take revenge for Father, then what was the point of him, Ji Qingyun reincarnating?He, Ji Qingyun, lived his life proudly. How could he possibly lead this sort of ign.o.ble life?Even if taking revenge was harder than reaching the heavens, Ji Qingyun would still try reaching this heaven!Wasn't it just practicing martial arts?Since Ji Qingyun was able to be hailed as the alchemist closest to Alchemy G.o.d during his previous life, he could become the martial artist most likely to step into the Deity Realm in this life!How could a tiny little Nine Heavens Road thwart me, Ji Qingyun, on my heaven trampling journey?\"Don't worry, Father. It's only a small matter between Senior Apprentice Brother and me. This child will definitely work together with Senior Apprentice Brother and manage the matter of welcoming guests properly,\" Ye Yuan smiled and said.Even as surging waves billowed in his heart, Ye Yuan obstinately did not reveal the slightest bit!Ye Yuan did not permit even the slightest flaw in his heart realm. The more one was facing a powerful enemy, the more one had to maintain the steadiness of their heart state.When experts exchange blows, what was fought was not only strength but also the strength of the heart!\"Haha! Then I can rest at ease,\" Ji Zhengyang laughed heartily and said with a smile as he stroked his beard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Heart Like Still Water!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: Heart Like Still Water!Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorThere was complete silence at the foot of the Nine Heavens Peak.Ye Yuan had already stood at the fifth step for four hours, while he only used a total of two hours to clear the first 333 steps!The students looked at that figure halfway up the mountain. From the initial shock to excitement, then to dejection, and all the way until the current sighs of regret and pity.The fever fell from the highest point down to the freezing point.Ye Yuan's rus.h.i.+ng style involuntarily gave everyone a feeling of a strong beginning but a weak ending.The first stage was too quick, but the second stage was a failure right at the start. The difference between before and after was too great.At this point, n.o.body thought that Ye Yuan could make it anymore. Their confidence gradually faded along with the pa.s.sing of time.Standing for four hours on one step. There were still 328 steps behind!How would he pa.s.s?\"Humph! Playing tricks! He must have used some trickery to gain advantage previously. That's why it went so smoothly!\" Su Yubai snorted coldly.\"Based on past experiences, the second stage of the Nine Heavens Road could very well be an eternal illusionary realm. And the derivative of this illusionary realm would become increasingly terrifying along with the increase in steps. Finally, it would leave people unable to extricate themselves. Ye Yuan already sunk in so deeply at the fifth step, I'm afraid it's hopeless to save the situation.\" Zhang Songtao also made a rare remark at this time.Hu Changsheng looked at Ye Yuan with a grave expression.How could he not know what Zhang Songtao said? After so many years of fumbling about, even though the specific situations inside the Nine Heavens Road could not be confirmed, they were still able to conjecture many things according to the students' performance.Without a doubt, this second stage's content was the easiest to confirm.Because almost all the students who survived this round became insane. Clearly, they lost their minds inside the illusionary realm.And in this second stage, the earlier one fell for the illusionary realm, the more dangerous it became.This illusionary realm was able to continuously develop as it derived non-stop. The further it went, the more realistic it became, and the more they would not be able to extricate themselves.Basically, those who got trapped so early like Ye Yuan had virtually no possibility of escaping the illusionary realm.\"A pity. A pinnacle genius who could have been extraordinarily splendors actually plummeted here.\"\"Ye Yuan might be a genius, but somebody like him was destined to not walk far. Because he failed to show restraint.\"\"Yeah. Too tough, and it's easily broken. Ye Yuan doesn't know how to tolerate, that's why he challenged the academy's rules, which resulted to his end. To him, Lin Tiancheng was doomed to be a minor character. There would have been thousands of ways to mess him to death. Why did he have to be impulsive?\"\"Disperse then. Let's go. It's already hopeless for Ye Yuan. It's impossible for him to wake up.\"Quite a few people already lost their patience and faith and left in groups.. . . . . .In the illusionary realm, Ye Yuan saw Ji Canglan once again!\"Haha. You finally exited seclusion, Junior Apprentice Brother. This brother waited for a long time! There are more and more guests these few days; I already can't handle it anymore. If you don't come out, I would have gone to Master and washed my hands off this matter.\" Seeing Ye Yuan, Ji Canglan laughed.Ye Yuan's emotions were somewhat chaotic. Seeing this great enemy again, Ye Yuan was unable to keep a calm state of mind even though this was inside an illusionary realm.Ye Yuan had methods to break apart the illusionary realm. However, he did not do so.He did not wish to alter the direction the illusionary realm was heading to and fight to the death with Ji Canglan. Because that was meaningless.He wanted to make use of this illusionary realm to advance his heart realm!Heart realm was something fleeting and abstruse and looked like it was completely useless towards cultivation. Very few martial artists placed their thoughts on it as well.However, Ye Yuan knew that heart realm was extremely useful towards a martial artist's future cultivation road. It even determined to a certain extent the martial artist's potential and limit!To martial artists, heart realm was something akin to adding wings to a tiger!If two martial artists with the exact same cultivation strength were to battle it out, the final victor would definitely be the one with the higher heart realm!To Ye Yuan, even the slightest increase in strength was extremely valuable.\"My apologies. I've let Senior Apprentice Brother wait for too long,\" Ye Yuan forcefully suppressed the killing intent inside him and apologized.\"Since when have us brothers been so distant? Brother is only joking with you. Don't take it to heart, Junior Apprentice Brother. I know that Junior Apprentice Brother is pursuing the great Alchemy Dao and doesn't like to be distracted by mundane matters. I will do my best to take on what I can handle. Except, the a.s.sembly this time around is crucial to our Medicine King Hall. So I have no other options but to invite Junior Apprentice Brother out.\"Ji Canglan was filled with sincerity without the slightest bit of hypocrisy. n.o.body could have seen through his wild ambitions.Ye Yuan also smiled and said, \"I'll naturally help Senior Apprentice Brother share the burden.\"The following few days, Ye Yuan followed Ji Canglan and began to busy themselves with the various matters of the Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly.Even if these things were what he hated the most in the past, Ye Yuan still did them conscientiously, as if he was wholly immersed in the illusionary realm and subst.i.tuted himself inside.In the first place, it was himself. This posed no challenge at all to Ye Yuan.The Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly went according to the planned routine. Then Ji Canglan finally revealed his fangs.Due to the fact that they drank a poison during the Pill Appreciation Grand a.s.sembly which made people temporarily lose their abilities, Ji Zhengyang and Ji Qingyun were already currently lambs awaiting slaughter.\"Master, don't blame this disciple for being heartless. This disciple also can't help it.\" Ji Canglan pointed the sword in his hand at Ji Zhengyang.Ji Zhengyang's heart was akin to dead ashes. He shut his eyes and said, \"Now that things have come to this, no point talking anymore. I only wish that you can spare Yun-er's life.\"Hearing that, Ji Canglan smiled sinisterly. \"My apologies, Respectable Master, I'm afraid I can't satisfy this dying wish of yours. If the roots of the weeds aren't removed, they will grow again come spring. I don't want to leave behind an enemy with such potential. Junior Apprentice Brother Yun's talent is astonis.h.i.+ng. As long as he's given a chance, he will probably have the strength to threaten me after several decades.\"Finis.h.i.+ng, Ji Canglan swung his longsword. A gleam of sword light shot directly towards Ye Yuan.At this time, Ji Zhengyang's body suddenly moved. He blocked this sword light for Ye Yuan!Without essence energy to protect his body, Ji Zhengyang's body was instantaneously pulverized by the sword light!At the same time, the might of Ji Zhengyang's divine soul abruptly erupted and swept towards Ji Canglan!Seeing the situation, Ji Canglan howled, \"You miserable old fool! You actually ignited your divine soul?! Do you want your soul to dissipate?!\"Rumble!A violent clash. Ji Zhengyang's divine soul crumbled away, while Ji Canglang also vomited a large mouthful of blood. Clearly, he had also sustained injuries that were not minor.Ye Yuan looked on at this scene coldly and did not become agitated nor was he indignant. There was not even any trace of emotion.Having experienced once again this scene, which was engraved into his bones and heart, it was equivalent to prying open the scars in his heart. This sort of spiritual pain was something that the average person could not feel.Yet, when the illusionary realm reached this moment, it was also incredibly dangerous! If he could not make it through, Ye Yuan would no longer exist after today!Ji Canglan held the sword as he clutched his chest and walked towards Ye Yuan step by step.\"Don't blame Senior Apprentice Brother, Junior Yun. I also can't help it myself. Take care along the way,\" Ji Canglan said as he was walking.Ye Yuan looked at Ji Canglan and suddenly gave a light smile.Ye Yuan crossed his legs to sit and shut his eyes as if he totally gave up resisting.However, as Ji Canglan's approached, the aura on Ye Yuan's body gradually became fleeting; until towards the end, his aura could not be sensed at all, as if he had died.With a slash, the entire world gradually became dim.Fainter and hazier . . .Finally, it vanished . . .. . . . . .Ye Yuan slowly opened his eyes and felt the real world, muttering to himself, \"Is this Heart Like Still Water?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let's go. It's hopeless for Ye Yuan. I even thought that he had some reliance, to dare tackle the Nine Heavens Road. In the end, he only crossed five steps in the second stage and was done.\"\"I don't want to watch anymore either. Waste of time!\"\"Time to go, time to go. After such a long time, turns out it's a farce. I still thought that there was some show to watch. After messing around for the greater part of a day, he's still the same as the rest.\"Su Yubai walked off, and the other elders naturally lost interest and stood up one after another.They watched Ye Yuan stand there unmoved for four hours, and were actually bored out of their minds already.Now that they were a.s.sured Ye Yuan would not wake up, they naturally felt that there was no longer the need to watch on.Su Yubai circled past the stone table and led the crowd out of the pavilion.After just a few steps, there was suddenly a commotion coming from the students at the foot of the mountain.\"Quick, look! Ye Yuan moved!\"\"En? He's actually meditating on the spot? What's he trying to do?\"\"He's not thinking about cultivating on the spot, right? Or has he already run amok?\"\"Does running amok look like that? Doesn't seem so? Looking at this appearance, it seems more like cultivating. But what's the use of doing something like embracing Buddha's feet at his hour of need?\"\"Ye Yuan always exceeds expectations when doing things. I really don't know what he's trying to do. But looking at his appearance, he should have just escaped from inside the illusionary realm. But he only walked five steps. How is he going to cross the remaining steps at the back?\"Ye Yuan's actions finally let the frustrated crowd find a topic of conversation once again. All manners of speculations spread out among the crowd.The three people, Huyan Yong, Feng Ruoqing, and Feng Zhirou, who were initially already in despair, finally let out a sigh of relief right now.\"This rascal really scared me to death. I even thought that he won't ever wake up anymore!\" Huyan Yong exclaimed and wiped away his cold sweat.Feng Ruoqing, on the other hand, continued to watch Ye Yuan silently, as if she had discovered something.\"What is it, Teacher Feng? Is something wrong?\" Huyan Yong asked curiously.\"Teacher Huyan, do you feel that Ye Yuan's aura isn't quite right?\"\"Mm?\" Huyan Yong felt Ye Yuan's aura, and sure enough, he felt that something was amiss. \"This rascal, why is the aura of his body becoming increasingly weaker? Could some problem have occurred?\"Feng Ruoqing shook her head. Clearly, she also could not make clear of the situation.However, their perceptions were locked onto Ye Yuan. But they discovered that Ye Yuan's aura became increasingly weaker, progressively weaker until in the end, it actually directly vanished!The three people were completely stunned.\"Mm? His aura vanished? Could it be that he's already dead?\" Su Yubai had clearly also discovered Ye Yuan's transformation.Elder Lin suddenly opened his mouth and asked, \"Elder Su, that Ye Yuan's aura has already completely vanished. Did he already die on the Nine Heavens Road?\"With Elder Lin's words, Su Yubai became even more certain about his idea.Quas.h.i.+ng the wild elation in his heart, Su Yubai nodded and said, \"Although the situation is somewhat bizarre, his aura has indeed completely vanished. Looks like he's really dead already.\"\"Snort! Slighting the Elders Council! This outcome was deserved! Leaving a whole corpse can be counted as letting him off lightly!\" Elder Lin derided coldly.\"Haha. Dean Hu already said that this was a student's right. Since he chose this way of dying, and he's already dead now, it also counts as us Elders Council enforcing the academy's rules.\"Su Yubai current mood was evidently excellent and turned around to console Elder Lin instead.Although the process was a little winded, Ye Yuan finally still died. He had finally helped the Su Family to eliminate this hidden danger.Inside the pavilion, Hu Changsheng looked at Ye Yuan's 'corpse,' gave a long sigh, and also got up to prepare to leave.Majority of the Heaven rank students with higher cultivation also discovered Ye Yuan's abnormal condition. After feeling sorry for him, they involuntarily secretly breathed a sigh of relief.One Long Tang already crushed them until they could not breathe. With the addition of an even more monstrous Ye Yuan, their life in the future would be even worse off.\"Didn't expect it; I really didn't expect it. Ye Yuan actually died on the fifth step! Oh, Old Long, no matter how monstrous Ye Yuan was, he's already a has been. You also saw the terror of the Nine Heavens Road. Are you still going to challenge the Nine Heavens Road?\" Zuo Bugui said to Long Tang.Long Tang narrowed his eyes. Clearly, he did not really believe the truth in front of him.Ye Yuan charged through the first stage so smoothly, how could he possibly fall at the fifth step in the second stage?This was too absurd!Hearing Zuo Bugui's words, Long Tang nodded and said, \"Even if the Nine Heavens Road were a mountain of knives or a flaming sea, a dragon's lair or a tiger's den, I would still challenge it! Either I succeed or I peris.h.!.+\"\"You're seriously stubborn! Forget it. I know that you're proud and arrogant. I won't be able to persuade you. Since you're giving me your rank of the first place with both hands, I'll kindly accept it!\"\"First place? What the point of first place in the Dan Wu Academy? If you like it so much, then take it,\" Long Tang said nonchalantly.\"Sigh. You've really been 'poisoned deeply'! He's already dead. Are you still going to keep watching?\"\"Watch a while more. I keep feeling that Ye Yuan won't die so easily!\"\"Since when did you become like this, Old Long? He's clearly already . . . Mm? What's going on?\"While the two were talking, they suddenly felt some irregular movements happening to the surrounding essence energy.The students at the foot of the mountain already started preparing to leave when suddenly, a wild wind whistled past, and the essence energy around them started becoming thinner.\"What's happening?\"\"The Nine Heavens Peak is a land with extremely abundant essence energy. How come now the energy became so thin? Could it be that someone is breaking through?\"\"It's Ye Yuan! Ye Yuan is breaking through!\"Somebody shouted from within the crowd, drawing everyone's eyes toward Ye Yuan once again.It was only to see that the essence energy in the vicinity of the Nine Heavens Peak surged towards Ye Yuan frenziedly at this moment!With Ye Yuan as the center, it formed a storm of enormous essence energy! An essence energy vortex!Ye Yuan's aura also swiftly grew stronger!Huyan Yong and Feng Ruoqing exchanged glances and saw the astonishment in the other party's eyes.\"This is . . . Heart Like Still Water! Ye Yuan, he . . . actually reached the Heart Like Still Water Realm! This is simply inconceivable! Even among Crystal Formation Realms, there were only extremely few people who actually reached such level in terms of heart realm. This is a realm from the legends! Ye Yuan is only at the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm, so how did he do it?\" Huyan Yong sucked in a cold breath.Feng Ruoqing's eyes flashed. Clearly, she was also in the midst of shock. \"Pretty soon, it's not going to be Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm anymore. He's about to break through right now!\"\"This punk is seriously too shocking! He only just broke through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm a few days back, and now, he's actually going to cross a minor stage again and directly reach the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm! Truly terrifying!\" Huyan Yong was astounded.But seeing how Ye Yuan was so peerlessly talented, he also felt quite pleased in his heart. No matter what, Ye Yuan's relations.h.i.+p with the academy was sowed.He also felt extremely proud for such a genius to walk out of the State of Qin's Dan Wu Academy.Feng Ruoqing took a deep breath and questioned, \"Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm? Look at this amount of essence energy, Teacher Huyan; is it only the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Peak Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Peak Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm!Translator: celefoata_ Editor: RegiusProfessorOnly after hearing what Feng Ruoqing said was Huyan Yong stunned.Sensing the increasingly wilder essence energy vortex, Huyan Yong was once again shocked.The feeling of this essence energy vortex almost caught up to breaking through the Spirit Condensation Realm!Such violent essence energy, was Ye Yuan not afraid that he would be stuffed to death?\"However, Heart Like Still Water was a legendary realm. Perhaps Ye Yuan could really digest it!Thinking up to here, Huyan Yong could not help but look forward to it.\"Hehe. This rascal really brings people surprises repeatedly.\"Huyan Yong was secretly excited. However, Su Yubai's expression currently did not look good.He originally already confirmed Ye Yuan's death. Now, not only did Ye Yuan come back to life, he even started breaking through by taking advantage of the situation.It had only been a few days since he broke through to the Sixth Level Essence Qi Realm. He was actually going to break through again!Right now, Su Yubai could only curse that Ye Yuan was stuffed to death by this violent essence energy vortex!Also, Ye Yuan actually reached the Heart Like Still Water Realm from the legends on the Nine Heavens Road!He had lived for such a long time, and he did not even know what was called Heart Like Still Water, yet a fifteen-year-old brat like Ye Yuan actually reached such a level in heart realm!After raging, Su Yubai suddenly felt waves of uneasiness.He suddenly recalled the words that Ye Yuan said three days back.\"I'll remember this, you old fart! I, Ye Yuan, will repay today's grudge a hundredfold in the future! I will definitely take your head within a year!\"The words were still echoing in Su Yubai's ears. Back then, he only treated it as a joke.But now, Su Yubai's heart started to become uneasy.Within a year? He can't really do it, right?Thinking up to here, Su Yubai shuddered uncontrollably.. . . . . .The wild essence energy vortex started roaring with Ye Yuan as its center and shrouded a radius of several hundred meters. The students sensed that the surrounding essence energy was virtually sucked dry.Ye Yuan revolved the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art and greedily absorbed the essence energy surrounding the Nine Heavens Peak. His aura could be clearly seen as it rose swiftly.However, Ye Yuan who was residing at the heart of the vortex did not move even in the slightest, as if he was still a dead man.This movement and stillness gave everyone a huge contrast, making them felt the situation was very odd.Nevertheless, what people were most concerned with was what Ye Yuan was trying to do.Such an enormous essence energy vortex could completely let a martial artist break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm!Was this Ye Yuan trying to directly break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm?Under everyone's dumbstruck faces, Ye Yuan used Heart Like Still Water to revolve the Spirit Bristle Nine Yang Divine Art. The efficiency actually became several times faster than normal!He frenziedly refined the essence energy to bring it into his Dantian. His cultivation realm was also in the process of steadily rising!The cultivation breakthrough this time around was not Ye Yuan initiating the breakthrough, but rather, it followed naturally after the breakthrough in heart realm.As the saying went, when the water was full, it automatically overflowed. This was that logic.After 15 minutes, Ye Yuan's realm broke through to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm without any surprises, stepping into the final minor stage in the Essence Qi Realm.However, this was just the beginning. The essence energy vortex did not show any sign of stopping, and Ye Yuan continued to refine essence energy ceaselessly.. . . . . .\"Too maniacal! He absorbed so much essence energy and only broke through to the Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm. If it were me, it would probably be enough to reach the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm!\"\"Yeah. What he's cultivating is definitely not the academy's cultivation law. It's impossible for the academy's Tier 3 cultivation laws to have this kind of effects.\"\"When you compare people, people have to die. When you compare goods, goods have to be thrown away! I wonder if I can be as monstrous as Ye Yuan if I cultivate such a powerful cultivation law.\"\"Are you still sleeping? Don't talk about cultivating Ye Yuan's cultivation law; are you even able to cultivate the academy's Tier 3 cultivation laws? High-tier cultivation laws are incomparably profound. If everybody could cultivate them, then wouldn't everyone be able to ascend to the Divine Realm?\"\"That's true. But how is Ye Yuan trying to break through? Looking at his appearance, is he not going to give up if he doesn't break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm?!\"\"Initially, I thought that way too, but looking at his current performance, the amount of essence energy required to break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm must definitely be horrifying! Even though this essence energy vortex is powerful, I'm afraid it isn't sufficient for him to break through to the Spirit Condensation Realm.\"Under the crowd's discussions, Ye Yuan's cultivation steadily rose and rapidly broke through to the peak of Seventh Level Essence Qi Realm.Then, it directly broke through to the Eighth Level Essence Qi Realm!Following which, Ye Yuan's momentum did not slow down in the slightest. His aura became even more vigorous until he broke through to the Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm before finally gradually slowing.Finally, Ye Yuan's realm stopped at the peak Ninth Level Essence Qi Realm, just a single step away from the Spirit Condensation Realm!The essence energy vortex dispersed, and Ye Yuan slowly got up. He muttered to himself, \"In the previous life, I cultivated to the Divine King level without having any breakthrough in heart realm. I didn't think that while I'm currently only at the Essence Qi Realm, I would unexpectedly have such breakthrough. Martial artists placed emphasis on essence energy but disparaged heart realm. I didn't expect heart realm to actually be so important. Perhaps that intangible, abstruse Heaven Man Unity might even have some sort of connection with the Deity Realm!\"There was also the distinction between realms within the heart realm, except, it was not as systematic as cultivation realms. It was also somewhat hard to grasp.Heart realm was divided into three realms. They were respectively Heart Like Still Water, Heart Like Monolith, and the mythical Heaven Man Unity!Heart realm could not be trained. One could only rely on lucky chances and enlightened comprehension.Heart Like Still Water, akin to an old well without ripples.It was easy to say, but in reality, it was extremely difficult to achieve.The world was plagued with turmoil and confusion. How could it be simple to truly achieve Heart Like Still Water when in the midst of the pugilistic world.Those who could reach Heart Like Still Water Realm probably would not number more than ten in the entire Endless World.Ye Yuan initially did not expect to break through the heart realm either. He immersed himself inside the illusionary realm all so that he could rehea.r.s.e for when meeting Ji Canglan in the future.Ji Canglan's might was not something that the average person could comprehend. Even if he cultivated to the Divine King level once again, Ye Yuan also did not have confidence in killing him.If Ye Yuan was unable to remain calm and collected when facing Ji Canglan in the future, then the person who would be defeated would very well be himself!In reality, it was already extremely perilous for Ye Yuan just now in the illusionary realm. He was already at the edge of losing himself.However, when Ji Zhengyang died yet again due to protecting him, something flashed across Ye Yuan's heart, and he comprehended Heart Like Still Water at the moment of crisis. That was how he broke the illusionary realm and exited.Heart Like Still Water was actually not that amazing in the Divine Realm. Martial artists at the Divine King level could basically all reach this realm.Of course, with the exception of Ye Yuan.However, Heart Like Monolith was not so easy to attain. According to what Ye Yuan knew, there was scarcely anyone who reached that level even among the Divine Realm's Divine Kings.As for the mythical Heaven Man Unity, Ye Yuan had never heard of anyone who accomplished it.\"Looks like the person who created the Nine Heavens Road had reached the Heart Like Still Water realm in the past. He fused his understanding into the illusionary realm to help students sense it. Seriously impressive. Except, I'm afraid it would be difficult to comprehend this Heart Like Still Water if one didn't have ma.s.sive lucky encounters.\"Ye Yuan had already praised this Nine Heavens Road more than once.Ye Yuan must admit that the difficulty of this Nine Heavens Road had surpa.s.sed his imaginations.He even nearly lost himself while in the illusionary realm, let alone the other students.Even those students who had made it past the Nine Heavens Road most likely only forced their way through it. They were, however, unable to comprehend the true essence of the Nine Heavens Road.This Nine Heavens Road was actually a vast treasure trove!This middle stage of 333 steps no longer posed any more challenge to Ye Yuan now that his heart realm had already broken through to Heart Like Still Water Realm.He made his move and headed directly for the third stage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
