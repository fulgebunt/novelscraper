    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1585: Straight NorthThe orange cat laid on his back, exposing his round belly.\u2014-too full.He patted his stomach with his paws and couldn\u2019t help but sigh.As a culinary expert, he had always been strict with his diet and paid close attention to his portions.But this time, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t control his consumption, but that he had no choice but to eat this much.With that in mind, the orange cat turned to the War God UI.[Remaining Soul Points: 20,000]These lines of glowing text appeared at a corner of the UI, always reassuring.\u2014-finally, I have enough Soul Points.The orange cat barely managed to flip himself over and pulled a statue out from his chest.The colorful rooster statue.I can finally wake it up.The chicken shivered a bit and became animated again.\u201cAh, youngster, have you thought about why you replenished Soul Points so slowly in your cat form?\u201d the rooster asked.\u201cMEOW!\u201d the orange cat quickly waved his paws.The rooster grumbled: \u201cWhat? The information you wanted to know wasn\u2019t this? How sly\u2026\u201dThe orange cat turned back into Gu Qing Shan and replied: \u201cI replenished Soul Points so slowly because I didn\u2019t consume anything especially impressive\u2014\u2014- so please tell me something else, preferably information related to my current situation\u201dAfter that, he put his hand on the rooster\u2019s feathers.20,000 Soul Points were transferred.The rooster raised its neck and loudly clucked.It happily put its wings together in a heart shape and said with an extremely pleased tone: \u201cAhhhh\u2014\u2014 that felt good! I finally have Soul Points again! I was worried that my shopping cart would\u2014\u2014\u201dIt suddenly stopped talking and cautiously looked at Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t concerned about its jokes and said with a very serious expression: \u201cBrother chicken, I\u2019m currently looking for the frozen corpse\u2019s parts, now please tell me something useful\u201dThe chicken\u2019s expression changed and suddenly replied with a solemn and official tone:\u201cGu Qing Shan, to activate my power, you must provide me a corresponding amount of Soul Points, and this can only be used once per day\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll say this clearly first\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201d\u201cI can faintly sense two pieces of crucial information, one of them was related to the Apocalypse\u2019s current movements, the other was related to the life of a certain individual\u2014\u2014- someone that only you would be able to save\u201d\u201cNow choose which information you wish to know, then I\u2019ll use my ability to learn the corresponding situation\u201dGu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cI can only obtain one of them?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d the rooster replied.\u201cPlease tell me about that individual\u2019s safety\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.The rooster seemed surprised: \u201cYoungster, you normally kill people without any concern, so why are you suddenly concerned about someone\u2019s life?\u201d\u201cAnyone\u2019s life is important. If I knew about it without saving them, I would feel regretful\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.\u201cBut you\u2019ve never once held back when you kill people, you can even be considered a merciless murderer, so what\u2019s going on there?\u201d the rooster asked.\u201cThere are some people that if I don\u2019t kill, I\u2019d feel regret as well\u201d Gu Qing Shan shrugged helplessly.\u201cIf you want to save that person, then what about the Apocalypse?\u201d the rooster asked again.\u201cI\u2019ll have to deal with the Apocalypse sooner or later, so I can just worry about it later\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.The rooster looked closely at him.It pulled out a sheet of paper and put it on the ground, then handed a piece of paper to Gu Qing Shan and asked:\u201cI knew that your style would fit my tastes. Come here and sign this waiver, I\u2019ll make a compromise to see if I can help you find out more\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the waiver and saw its content:[Today, you owe the colorful rooster 20,000 Soul Points to be paid in instalments as follow:][A total of six instalments, one month between each payment][You must pay 10,000 Soul Points for each instalment]Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but retort: \u201cDon\u2019t I only owe you only 20,000 Soul Points? Why do I have to pay 60,000 in total?\u201dThe colorful rooster called out: \u201cOld Gu, this chicken is risking its life to help you this time, think of it as overtime pay, won\u2019t you?\u201d60,000 Soul Points to be paid over six months\u2014\u2014- that\u2019s not exactly an issue at all.Gu Qing Shan suddenly asked: \u201cIs the situation really that serious?\u201dThe colorful rooster faced his eyes head-on.\u201cHmph, that was you two\u2019s own handiwork in Space-Time, you know. One of you was the River of Life\u2019s Lord of Radiance, while the other was the Death God who commanded the River of Death, but now look what had happened? The Lord of Radiance turned himself into a dog\u2019s head, while the Death God is traveling the void looking for a corpse with a dog\u2019s head on his shoulder\u2014\u2014 do the two of you not understand what kind of existence the Twin Rivers of Life and Death are?\u201d the colorful rooster complained.Gu Qing Shan replied: \u201cI know that it\u2019s a world system similar to the Samsara\u201d\u201cListen to yourself!\u201d the rooster suddenly called out, \u201cYou already know that it\u2019s a crucial world system, so why aren\u2019t you quickly taking control over the dead in the River of Death? It\u2019ll already be too late\u2014\u2014\u201dIt suddenly stopped.Gu Qing Shan silently listened without saying a word.\u2014\u2014the colorful rooster has never mentioned something like a waiver or payments in instalments, nor has it ever actively danced around the rules to give me several pieces of information in the same day.But now, it was clearly eager to attempt this.It was the embodiment of the War God System\u2019s intelligence function, capable of sensing things throughout the void after activation.\u2014\u2014in other words, it was clearly cautious or worried about something.Just like\u2026How the lady of the Sacrificial Dance had urged me to quickly form my dance troupe.It was as if something very urgent was rapidly approaching.Gu Qing Shan suddenly realized something.Up till now, I\u2019ve never realized the importance of the Twin Rivers of Life and Death.They were a world system comparable to the Samsara.\u2014\u2014 and it had never been broken!Just how great would its powers be?Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart felt heavy, wondering why he had forgotten such an important detail.After carefully thinking about it, I\u2019m not actually under any sort of spell influence or had I actually forgotten this matter.I just simply did not have the time.Ever since I returned from the Age of Immemorial, I\u2019ve saved Fei Yue, entered the Wraith realm, met Demon Dragon, cut down the Wraith Lords, and fought a Deathmatch against Reneedol.Did I ever have a second to spare?There was never any free time for me to investigate the Twin Rivers of Life and Death!Fortunately, Su Xue Er had used an extremely skillful means to help me regain the power of the three coins.Gu Qing Shan sighed, then asked again: \u201cRooster, what exactly did you realize?\u201dThe rooster scoffed: \u201cI still haven\u2019t begun to investigate anything, but I have a feeling\u2014\u2014\u2013 no, I can\u2019t tell you my feeling either, otherwise, it would be considered a piece of information, and I will fall into a state of slumber as soon as I finish\u201dGu Qing Shan stopped asking.He crouched down and signed his name on the waiver.\u201cHere\u201d he handed the waiver back to the rooster.\u201cHm, then I\u2019ll begin!\u201dThe rooster called out, then stood on one leg and reached its neck upwards, observing the void with a solemn expression.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t have the courage to bother it, so he could only silently wait.The rooster looked around in every direction before it finally exited this state.\u201cOld Gu, I\u2019ll fall into slumber as soon as I finish telling you this, so listen carefully\u201d the rooster said with a serious tone.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m listening\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.The rooster took a deep breath and spoke with an unprecedented tone:\u201cThe signs within the flow of the River of Death are getting increasingly clearer. The Apocalypse had realized something and initiated their preparations hidden countless years ago in the void of space\u201d\u201cA wave of destruction enough to wipe out the entire Space Vortex is coming\u2026\u201d\u201cEverything will begin within the Doomsday Necropolis. Head straight North, the girl who had sent you here sincerely wishes for you to save that individual\u2014\u2013 if that individual survives, you will understand the origin of the secret\u201dThe rooster tiredly nodded to Gu Qing Shan.\u201cI\u2019ve informed you everything I can. In short, it\u2019s very dangerous, not only will you have to be careful, but you will also have to be fast, or that individual will die\u201dAfter saying that, it quickly turned back into a motionless statue.Gu Qing Shan silently put the colorful rooster statue away.He stood still, having fallen into deep thought.\u2014\u2014-straight North?Who would be in that direction?\u2018The girl who sent you here\u2019 should be Su Xue Er.There\u2019s no doubt about this.Then, who does she hope for me to save?Gu Qing Shan waved his hand in the void of space.The isolation barrier was dispelled.He quickly approached the mercenary corps\u2019 Heads.\u201cBoss, are we setting out now?\u201d the Bottle Caster Hei Suo asked.\u201cTime doesn\u2019t wait for anyone; we need to be on our way immediately\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.The Heads exchanged glances.\u201cWhere are we heading?\u201d Moon Song asked.Gu Qing Shan paused for a few seconds.The frozen corpse\u2019s part seems to be in the Northwest.While the individual that I have to save was straight North.We won\u2019t veer off-course too much.If this was something that Su Xue Er wanted, then\u2014\u2014Let\u2019s save them first.With that in mind, Gu Qing Shan replied: \u201cWe\u2019re heading North\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201d everyone responded.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

La0o9The rain continued for one day and one night straight, outside, in the military\u2019s dead pit, an arm suddenly stuck out.The night patrol got so scared he dropped his lantern and scurried back to the outpost to report to the Commander.The Commander and the night patrol went together, scimitar and lantern in hand, leaving the outpost to carefully survey what he saw.The two of them look out, only to see in the pouring rain, a silhouette silently sitting amidst the corpses.The Commander lifts his lantern for a wider view, revealing to silhouette to be a soldier, wearing tattered leather armor, leaning on a stack of skulls, his back turned to them.The Commander tightly grips his blade and asks in a low voice: \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dFrom the pouring rain, only a faint sound returns: \u201cI\u2019m from the Vanguard Legion, right now I\u2019m too heavily injured, unable to move\u201dUnable to move?The Commander\u2019s expression slightly relaxes, lowering his blade and walks forward: \u201cOh so you\u2019re a brother from the Vanguard, come, let me help you\u201d\u201cThank you\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, die\u201dThe blade slash separates the rain, gleaming a cold silver color, cutting straight at the soldier\u2019s neck.The Commander\u2019s slash is incredibly sharp, as well as being exactly timed, cleanly hacking off the soldier\u2019s head, sending it rolling straight back down the dead pit.One slash, no more nuisance!The Commander smirks and sheaths his blade, but immediately his face shifts: \u201cShi -----\u201cA silhouette jumps from the soldier\u2019s feet amongst the dead bodies, a cold silver gleam in his hand slashes through the Commander\u2019s arm.The arm, as well as the blade all got cut clean and flew off, a splash of blood shoots out from where the cut is, but is quickly drowned out by the screaming night rain and wind.An intense pain rushes through his head, the Commander\u2019s face shows disbelief, in his eyes, reflect a silhouette descending from a jump.A saber gradually grows bigger inside that reflection.A single second later, the saber stabs straight into his eye socket.The intense pain only lasted for moments, afterwards is nothing but blackness.A few breaths later.The young man pulls his saber from the Commander\u2019s eye socket.The Commander\u2019s corpse falls back, plopping straight into the muddy water behind.The young man keeps his grip on the saber, standing still.The night rain keeps pouring, wiping the mud from the young man\u2019s face, revealing a pair of shining pupils.Suddenly, his eyes become sharp.Right at his feet, the Commander\u2019s stomach inflates, letting out a strange gurgling sound from inside.The young man takes a deep breath, both hands on his saber, stabbing straight into the Commander\u2019s now-bloated stomach.A shriek that cannot have come from a human resounds, a black mist suddenly burst from the Commander\u2019s stomach, the inside clearly violent, like something is desperately trying to escapeThen, the Commander\u2019s stomach rips open, a dry, thin, black claw reaches out.Before the horrid demonic claw could even attempt anything, the young man already starts to intensely twist his saber handle.\u201cDie!\u201dOnly one word.The writhing corpse suddenly stop dead, the demonic claw also drops, no longer moving.Everything is silent again.A stinky black blood begins to leak from under the Commander\u2019s corpse.Seeing that black blood, the young man finally breaths out slightly, withdrawing his saber.He looks down at the creepy corpse, mumbling to himself at a low voice.\u201cSuch a strange scenario, I wonder what the reward could be?\u201dThe young man, seeming to hold a bit of anticipation, shouts in a low voice: \u201cSystem!\u201dOne breath, two breaths, three breath.Time slowly passes, but nothing happens.In the dark night, only the sound of unending rain and wind persists...The young man, seeming a bit surprised, turned his head, looking back and forth from the scene - behind him is the dead pit, under his feet is the demon\u2019s corpse, not far from there, a single militia is scared shitless, even his lips are trembling.\u201cStrange\u201d the young man mutters: \u201cThe Quest isn\u2019t cleared?\u201dThe System is still silent, meaning the Quest isn\u2019t cleared.The young man looks at the militia, suddenly feeling like there must something that he missed.The young man thinks hard, trying his best to move forward, but then almost fell down.Right then, he had to concentrate on killing the demon so he didn\u2019t notice, but now that he couldrelax himself, he found his whole body hurting, like having been stabbed with a thousand needles.His legs feel like lead, every step he takes would drain him of all his energy.This can\u2019t be right.When the Apocalypse came, he clearly used all his power to kill the last Demon Lord, but instead of getting ejected from the game, he now carry this body full of pain, dropped into this place who-knows-where.Where is this place exactly?The young man squints, slowly drags himself closer to the militia and proceeds with a salute.\u201cProud Steed Squad, Gu Qing Shan reporting for duty\u201d\u201cYou, you, you killed the Commander!\u201d the militia trembles.\u201cHe was not human\u201d Gu Qing Shan replies while evaluating the militia.He is wearing an old-type leather armor, this type of armor that doesn\u2019t even have a device to receive spirit energy \u2013 even the most hated squad in the military wouldn\u2019t use this old antique toy.Gu Qing Shan looks again at himself, only to see the same type of antique toy, all of his original equipment are all gone.This is strange.The militia leans slightly closer to the dead pit, the Commander\u2019s deformed corpse is still sitting in the mud.The militia hesitates: \u201cBut but\u2026 But when you killed him, how did you know he wasn\u2019t human?\u201dGu Qing Shan shrugs: \u201cI was only being careful, he attacked first\u201dGu Qing Shan went back, dragged the Commander\u2019s corpse straight in front of the militia\u2019s face for him to see.\u201cLook, this is a Skin-shedding Blood Demon\u201dGu Qing Shan use his saber to reveal inside the Commander\u2019s stomach, to see a monster with a scary face, body black all over, and strange vertical pupils.Seeing the monster\u2019s corpse with his own eyes, the militia is even more shaken.Remembering his comrades that have been strangely dying one-by-one for the last few days, he felt sheer cold down his spine, finally holding gratitude for the young man in front of him.The militia calms himself down and ask: \u201cYou said you were called Gu Qing Shan?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cFrom Proud Steed Squad?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cYour badge?\u201dGu Qing Shan takes out his badge, checks for himself then throw it to the militia to check.This badge is much heavier than he remembered.With the current level of smithing, a simple identification badge can be as light as a sheet of paper, why does the badge he had on himself weigh so much, almost a kilo.The young man becomes even more confused.The militia takes the badge and check carefully, on it inscribed 6 words \u201cProud Stead Squad Gu Qing Shan\u201d, looking full of life.The badge is real.The militia breaths out, no longer nervousness on his face, only a lot of fatigue: \u201cFinally a living person, come, we can\u2019t stay long outside, come with me into the outpost\u201dWhat he\u2019s saying is true, Gu Qing Shan lightly brushes his chin and replies: \u201cYes\u201dThe militia returns his badge, turns around to go back into the outpost.Gu Qing Shan receives the badge, carefully looks at it again.------- This badge isn\u2019t just heavy, it is also entirely made of bronze alloy, the outside only have a few words inscribed, with terrible workmanship that\u2019s hard to look at, clearly the obsolete kindThe obsolete kind\u2026Gu Qing Shan suddenly thinks of something, a fearful thought crosses his mind.He immediately looks up, his sight set on the militia in front.Old-type leather armor.The answer is so inconceivable, that Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t keep himself from asking: \u201cBrother, what year it is right now?\u201dThe militia looks back, slightly confused with his question: \u201cOf course it\u2019s the Last Peaceful Year\u201dGu Qing Shan is baffled.Suddenly, information streams as thick as a waterfall flows in front of his eyes, creating a clear-blue, tide-like filter.Click \u2013A cold mechanical voice.\u201cThe current time as confirmed to be the Last Peaceful Years\u201d\u201cTime flow is stable, confirmed to have escaped from space-time vortex\u201d\u201cConclusion: Successfully escaped from the Apocalypse\u201d\u201cIdentity reestablished, current identity: Human, Vanguard Legion, Proud Steed Squad soldier\u201dThe System is finally active again, but Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t feel happy at all, only absolute disbelief.Why is it the Last Peaceful Year, the game hasn\u2019t even started in this time period!This period is supposed to just be a setting of the game, bygone history, humans from Reality haven\u2019t even officially entered this horror game of a different world yet.When the first people started playing the game, it was already a whole year later.Could it be I\u2019ve returned to before the game starts?But then what about the real world, could I also have returned back in time in the real world?Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart starts pounding uncontrollably, he immediately looks around.In front, the militia is quite far away, already inside the outpost gates.Besides the gates, spirit energy from the Invisibility formation faintly drifts out.Looking past the outpost to afar, in the middle of the desolate countryside, you can almost see a gigantic silhouette amidst the rain, flickering in and out of sight.Gu Qing Shan slowly lifts his arm, and bites into it.Two lines of teeth marks clearly shows up on where he bit into, even a bit of blood drips out.It hurts!It\u2019s not a dream!Gu Qing Shan stood still like a statue, unmoving in the intense rain, not minding the chilling rain water soaking his body.Notes:-System: a younger genre in Chinese web novels, the term refers to a person-bound support system that basically only the MC possess, giving them an advantage over everybody else even if their starting point is low simply due to how Deus-Ex-Machina it sometimes is (MC needs a certain pill/scripture to advance to the next level in their cultivation, it'll give it to them either free or through a series of hoops that are there for plot purposes). Yao Lao from Battle Through the Heavens is one example of a System (albeit not for a long time).-Vanguard Legion: this isn\u2019t an actual name but rather a position for a legion, basically they\u2019re the first group that will enter battle in the war-Invisibility formation: formations in general are a main-piece in many Xianxia and even Wuxia novels. They are a Daoist concept that Feng Shui originates from, basically the process of harnessing natural power for one\u2019s personal use. However Formations have evolved over time and now generally refers to the art of arranging Power Items( items that inherently have power) in certain ways to achieve whatever effects the user want. Formations in novels are generally hard to grasp or use due to requiring a lot of calculations and set up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can you take me to get away from here as well?\u201dThat last part of his question is probably his real inner voice.If not for that, he most likely wouldn\u2019t even take out the Healing pills.Gu Qing Shan answers matter-of-factly: \u201cMuch better, but if I want to make a full recover, it\u2019ll take a few more days\u201d\u201cThen you keep resting\u201d Zhao Lu dejectedly stands up, turning to leave.After Zhao Lu left, Gu Qing Shan sits alone on the ground, contemplating.In his original time period, the demons and monsters from the game have already entered Reality and destroyed human civilization.The rest of humanity could only live on their dying breaths, unable to do anything as the Apocalypse came and went.Everything was at a dead-end.Now in hindsight, right as the game released, there were already clues of strange happenings.Back then, every single country was trying like mad to popularize the game.Food, money, beauty, power, everything can be given to you, as long as you are strong enough in the game.Everywhere in the world, there are strange things happening, but all of them were easily covered up by the top brass of humanity, while the populace knew nothing.It was only when the first-ever weapon was brought from the game into reality, that the populace finally found out that it wasn\u2019t a game, but a complete, real, and living, other world.Everyone scurried like mad to get into the game.But the demons and monsters in game were truly terrible, enough to make people become hopeless.Even though hundreds of millions of people all joined the game, helping the people of the other world fight against the demons, but in every single strategically deciding operation, humanity kept losing, and losing, and losing.Right down to the final operation, when the game released a server-wide notice, that when this operation failed, demon kind would then fully occupy the other world, using that as a springboard to move onto invade Reality.And Reality, would also be devastated by the demons.Of course, Reality went absolutely mad again.Every person aged 5 and above were mandated to create an account in the game.As propaganda, they said that even if you\u2019re the weakest of the weak, without any real power, you can still use your own bodies as shields to block on strike for the main fighting power legion.But even in that final operation, humanity still failed.Only Gu Qing Shan who headed his nation\u2019s strongest guild was able to complete the missions put out by the System, successfully cleared a path straight to the final Demon Lord.When all of his comrades had died, Gu Qing Shan finally knocked the final Demon Lord down his throne of flesh and bones, seeing the chance of killing this final BOSS right before his face.Right then, the heavy sound of the System voice resounded twice.\u201cHumanity\u2019s final Ascended has fallen, Humanity\u2019s final fortress has been breached, operation final verdict: Humanity had lost.\u201d\u201cThe game had ended, the protective barrier is broken, reality\u2019s destruction begins\u201dBOOM-A huge explosion resounded, everybody was forcefully logged off from the game, not being able to do anything but watch as the end of the world comes.Taking the small time when he still isn\u2019t forcefully logged off, Gu Qing Shan raised his weapon, put all his might into stabbing the final Demon Lord right where his heart is.Not being able to see the result, Gu Qing Shan then only felt his sight blackened, forcefully ejected from the game.But he didn\u2019t leave the Apocalypse to go back to Reality, but instead lost all his senses.Faintly Gu Qing Shan could hear a mechanical voice speaking.\u201cPlayer Gu Qing Shan finished off the final Demon Lord, for helping the despaired world that fell into the abyss leave a final spark, special final reward received\u201dGu Qing Shan could only feel that he had an extra something in his hand, but became senseless afterwards.When he finally reawakened, he was already inside the military dead pit.Remembering up to there, Gu Qing Shan shakes his head, breaths out in regret.It\u2019s weird, the game was out for a whole of 10 years, right until the end he never heard about any final rewards existing.So curious to know what it is.Wait a minute, that\u2019s not right.Gu Qing Shan suddenly remembered a crucial detail.Right when he awoke from the dead pit, he was holding something in his hand.----------- this saber!Gu Qing Shan looks back down.The saber is still there, stabbed on the ground next to him.A gold color saber, with the blade not having any extraneous details or decoration, only a well-sharpened edge.When Gu Qing Shan looks at it carefully, he can actually see a bit of faint gold color light on the blade.As Gu Qing Shan try to recall more and more, his heart beat also starts to quicken.Before he killed the Commander, this sword was already in his hand.Not knowing why, he only felt that the sword fit his hand extremely well, so he didn\u2019t bother to search the dead pit for any other weapons.Did this sword originally from the dead pit, or did it come with him from that fight?Gu Qing Shan holds the saber, hesitate for a long time, before finally pouring spirit energy from his Dantian into the weapon.Right when spirit energy touched it, the gold color light from the sword intensified and expanded into a huge area painted gold.A strangely sense of dignity and mourning emits from the gold saber.\u201cIllegal entry successful, begin activation\u201dA cold and mechanical voice starts.Not knowing if he\u2019s just imagining it, Gu Qing Shan feels that this cold System voice he\u2019s heard so many times, in fact, hold a bit of uncontrollable excitement.After only a minute, the gold saber in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand explodes into countless golden sprites.Each of them floating in the air for just a bit, circling around Gu Qing Shan twice, then all rush straight in between his eyebrows.Gu Qing Shan only hear a deafening exploding sound, his Thought Sea completely empty, his body at a dead stand still, unable to move.A while passed, the cold mechanical voice spoke with a tired tone.\u201cActivation successful, War God UI (user interface) turned on\u201dNotes:-Dantian: a fictional area around the stomach area that is used primarily to hold energy fromcultivation. A main-piece of any cultivation novels-Thought Sea: a sub-piece of many cultivation novels, a fictional space in between your eyebrows that primarily deals with thought. Depending on the novel, it would either power the process of thought (accelerating thought, finesse control, etc\u2026) or influence the outside world through pure thought (telekinesis, 6th sense, etc\u2026).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Worlds\u2019 Apocalypse OnlineCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated and edited by: La0o9In Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sight, the blue-ish UI that appeared isn\u2019t that different from before, the only difference being the list of buttons that appear below the UI.These buttons are as dark as blackholes, occasionally emitting some thin black mist.A line of neon-blue text appears right above the buttons:\u201cSuccessfully turned on War God UI, at this moment you can turn on the first feature for free\u201d\u201cWould you like to turn it on?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dRight as Gu Qing Shan confirms his choice, in the list of black-hole buttons, the first cleared up and shows its name.\u201cWar God Skills?\u201dGu Qing Shan took a look at the button\u2019s name, then immediately read through its description.A bit later.Gu Qing Shan walks towards the shelf of weapons in the corner, looking through the weapons remaining on it.A rusty spear, a damaged curved sword, a military bow covered in dust.Sadly there were no swords.In the game, the amount of players who choose to become a sword cultivator numbers at least in the millions, but Gu Qing Shan himself was among the top ten on the world-wide ranking, a Great Sword Saint. (TN: not Greatsword)He was part of the elite, the strongest players.Other than that, Gu Qing Shan was also the commanding officer of all guild operations. Normally, he would deal with every little thing there is. After the war operations broke out, he didn\u2019t even have a single minute of free time.Even in reality, he was frequently summoned by nation officials, constantly have to discuss strategies and plans with other nations\u2019 guilds, literally a one-man management center.There were so many elite players who griefed for Gu Qing Shan, saying that he had to waste his time concentrating on too many aspects, otherwise his sword skills wouldn\u2019t just be top ten, that he\u2019d be capable of getting to the very top itself.Seeing the weapon shelf have no swords, Gu Qing Shan can only regretfully shake his head, picking up the curved sword.From the War God UI, a message popped up\u201cMilitary-use curved sword (damaged), used skills include:\u201d\u201cNo.1, One Sweep A Thousand Enemies, user: Wang Jin\u201d\u201cNo.2, Cut The Gate, Split The Mountain, user: Zhang Kuo\u201d\u201cTo master both Scimitar skills, Soul Point cost: 1.\u201dThis information is so shocking that even Gu Qing Shan was struck speechless for a while.Immediately master martial skills, so this is War God Skills?This is only the War God UI\u2019s first function, the other functions are all blacked out at the moment, unable to be used.But this is already more than enough, if he can get whatever skills he can touch, then there isn\u2019t any skills that can be called secret to him is there?Gu Qing Shan breaths in, to calm himself down first, then try to ask: \u201cWhat are Soul Points?\u201dRight away, a small line of text appears on the UI.\u201cYou can get Soul Points from defeating any creatures, you defeated 1 Skin-shedding Blood Demon, received 4 Soul Points, current Soul Points: 4/5\u201dKilling a single Skin-shedding Blood Demon got him 4 Soul Points.Of course, Skin-shedding Blood Demons don\u2019t count as common demons, they\u2019re much stronger than regular demons and low-rank cultivators, not to mention being extremely good at hiding and assassination.Luckily Gu Qing Shan took the right chance to reverse assassinate the Commander, also killing this demon in the process.Otherwise, at the time when Gu Qing Shan had no spirit energy, if the outcome wasn\u2019t decided quickly, the one that died wouldn\u2019t have been the Skin-shedding Blood Demon.Gu Qing Shan lightly nods, so apparently, it\u2019s like that, but his current Soul Point is 4/5, meaning that the maximum amount he can carry is only 5?That\u2019s a bit too little.Just when he thought that, more text appears on the UI.\u201cThe higher your cultivation, the higher your maximum Soul Point count will be.\u201dSoul Points and cultivation are linked together?Gu Qing Shan suddenly felt an urge to look at his own level, finally noticing the four easily seen large letters on top: \u201cQi Training Level 1.\u201dThis is everyone\u2019s starting level when they enter the other world, his level from the previous life is already gone.Gu Qing Shan can only sigh, silently put the curved sword back, pulling out the rusty spear.On the spear, there is only a single \u201cBasic thrusting\u201d skill.Shaking his head, dropping the spear, Gu Qing Shan finally picks up the military bow.\u201cMilitary Bow, used skills include:\u201d\u201cNo.1, Stable, user: Zhang Wu\u201d\u201cNo.2, Rapid Fire, user: Zhang Wu\u201d\u201cNo.3, Precision, user: Zhang Wu\u201d\u201cNo.4, Swallows Fly Twice, user: Zhang Wu\u201d\u201cTo comprehend Stable, Rapid Fire, Soul Point cost: 2\u201d\u201cTo comprehend Precision, Soul Point cost: 4\u201d\u201cTo comprehend Swallows Fly Twice, Soul Point cost: 6\u201dFrom current memory information, Zhang Wu should be this outpost\u2019s general, his expertise being the scimitar and the bow, but during the last defensive battle, he died at the hands of a Blood Drinker Demon.Gu Qing Shan took a look at the four skills, slightly concentrating on \u201cDouble Swallows Fly\u201dThis skill alone takes a whole 6 Soul Points to master, already more than the maximum amount that Gu Qing Shan can carry.\u201cHah, only qi training stage 1, seems like I\u2019ll really have to cultivate again from the start, lets aim to quickly increase my maximum Soul Point.\u201d Gu Qing Shan can\u2019t help but shakes his head.Qi training stage 1, this is the lowest, as well as the first stage of all cultivators.After qi training, there\u2019s also \u201cFoundation Establishment\u201d, \u201cGolden Core\u201d, \u201cRejuvenation\u201d, \u201cAscension\u201d, and other stages, but that can be left for later.One good news, is that a player\u2019s cultivation can be brought to reality.Qi training stage one, means that you can already feel and use spirit energy.If he really did go back in time with the current status quo, even if all his equipment is lost, all his skills are gone, Gu Qing Shan is still 10000% willing.Because there was so much regrets and laments in his life, every night that he wakes up, Gu Qing Shan can only silently licks the wounds buried deep inside his himself, the wounds that just can\u2019t be closed.If he can really do it all over\u2026Gu Qing Shan shakes his head, regain control of his emotions, grips the bow and starts thinking.Right now to keep on living is most important.At qi training stage 1, even running away from demons is a tall order.Sword, scimitar, spear, all of them require close combat, but this body is already riddled with unhealed wounds, his cultivation is the lowest of the low, and by himself, how can he actually manage to wrestle for his life against demons?Against demons, even the slightest bit of distraction can mean death.I\u2019m no longer the Sword Saint from the previous life, and definitely not the legend who commands both attack and defense of a whole country like before.Right now in the outpost, there\u2019s only himself and another soldier, that soldier is only a normal human being who isn\u2019t even a cultivator, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s current cultivation, it\u2019s extremely hard to overturn the situation.This outpost\u2019s Invisibility formation also won\u2019t hold out for long, at most 2-3 days, the formation will run out of spirit energy and stop.If the Invisibility formation stops, all sorts of demons and monsters will definitely come crawling.Gu Qing Shan suddenly realizes just how dire his situation is.Seems like he\u2019ll have to give up on close combat, for now, change to using long-range attacks, taking advantage of the Invisibility formation of the outpost to quickly raise his character level.His thoughts clear, Gu Qing Shan makes a decision.\u201cI choose to comprehend Stable, Rapid Fire\u201dFor just a moment, a warm water-like feeling flows from the military bow to Gu Qing Shan, travels a whole cycle inside his body, finally nest and scatter in his Thought Sea.Gu Qing Shan is shocked for a minute, then suddenly lift the bow, setting an arrow in and fire straight away.Twock!The arrow digs deeply into the wooden support beam of the building.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand doesn\u2019t stop, arrow after arrow like streaks of light leaving the bow.Twock! Twock! Twock! Twock!Twelve arrows shot one after another, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s arm holding the bow is still as before, not moving an inch from where it was.This is \u201cStable\u201d together with \u201cRapid Fire\u201d, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s blood can\u2019t help but boil a little bit from excitement.\u201cWar God Skills\u201d is very potent!As long as there is enough Soul Points, I\u2019m immediately able to comprehend any skills that a weapon once used, if it\u2019s like this, what skills are there in the world that is out of my reach?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he answered, his eyes also took a glance at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s inventory bag.Gu Qing Shan noticed, but doesn\u2019t say anything.When he \u201creturned\u201d, his inventory also became as empty as everything else.Gu Qing Shan took a bowl of porridge in hand, both of them silently had their breakfast.\u201cYour wounds, how is it?\u201d Zhao Lu asks again, eyes carrying a bit of hopefulness.\u201cBetter\u201d, Gu Qing Shan stretches and nonchalantly asks: \u201cHey Zhao, which squad were you in? Which position?\u201dZhao Lu reluctantly smiles and answers: \u201cI\u2019m from Fireplace Squad, in a normal day I can make food for hundreds no problem\u201dOh so he was originally a kitchen staff, no wonder he could make even a bowl of bland porridge taste good.In this despair scenario, without Gu Qing Shan, a normal person like Zhao Lu only have a single fate of death waiting for him.But Zhao Lu doesn\u2019t know, Gu Qing Shan himself is only a qi training stage 1 newbie, if he runs into a squad of demons, Gu Qing Shan will also only end up dying.Gu Qing Shan silently thinks, glancing at the hourglass on his UI.There\u2019s not much sand left inside the hourglass, it\u2019ll run out any minute now.Players can stay in this other world for a whole day and only an hour will have passed in Reality, qi training stage 1 players have to return to Reality when this time ends, waiting for an entire day before they can come back here.Right now Gu Qing Shan really want to know, what year is it in Reality.Having eaten half their breakfast, both of them suddenly stop their hands.\u201cBrother Gu, seems like there\u2019s some commotion outside\u201d, Zhao Lu slightly shrinks his body, letting out a squeaky voice.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look\u201d, Gu Qing Shan replies, takes the military bow and heads outsideThe hourglass seems to only have about 10 minutes left, hope there won't be anything too big.As Gu Qing Shan leaves the room, he readies an arrow on his bow, slightly squints to check all sides.His eyes quickly dart around all the building, not leaving a single corner untouched.That said, the outpost have an Invisibility formation in place, so demons aren\u2019t going to get in here too easily.So what is happening really?Scratch, scratch, scratch, that sound again.This direction, it\u2019s the outpost\u2019s gates.Gu Qing Shan sticks close to the wall, silently moves to the gates.A huge demon beast, as large as two adults, shows up in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sight.The demon beast is wagging its tail, standing on the edge of the dead pit, carefully looking around.Even though the nonstop rain helps wash it away, the putrid smell of the dead pit still draws in demon beasts like this.Gu Qing Shan hides in the shadow of the roof, raises his bow and slowly pulls back the string.He knows this monster.This is a low-level demon beast, even if it looks a bit clumsy, if it starts going crazy, its running and biting attacks are nothing to make light of, even 2-3 normal soldiers can\u2019t defeat it.Gu Qing Shan can only thank his luck.Lucky that I chose to learn ranged attacks, together with the outpost\u2019s Invisibility formation, I just might be able to kill it.The demon beast slowly run around the dead pit, sometimes rolling on the ground as well.It\u2019s trying to bait, to find out if there are any traps, or other demon beasts lying in ambush.The hourglass only have 10 minutes left.Gu Qing Shan silently holds his bow, not moving an inch.Neighs!Neighs!The demon beast stops, breaths out from its snout, his large head still looking around cautiously.5 minutes left.Gu Qing Shan stayed completely still.The demon beast finally slowly lower its head, wanting to eat one of the corpses.Its snout hover over the dead body back and forth, finally deciding to open its huge mouth, showing the multitudes of jagged fangs inside.Right at this moment!Gu Qing Shan pulls the bowstring back fully, pouring spirit energy into the arrow.An invisible wind forms around the arrow head.An arrow that have spirit energy poured in, its destructive power is five-fold compared to a normal one.These arrows were all specially made, so not just spirit energy, they can even carry energy of the 5 Elements.The military bow pulled all the way back, Gu Qing Shan stays silent for two breaths, then finally loose his fingers.Whoosh!The arrow shoots out in a flash and makes contact with the beast\u2019s mouth, in pain, the demon beast jumps forward, rolling on the ground.One arrow shot, Gu Qing Shan fluidly pulls back his bowstring for the next one without hesitation.Rapid Fire!Each and every arrow turns into streaks of light, flying from the military bow at their target.The demon beast roars angrily, running straight at the direction of the outpost to attack.But in just a few steps, it starts to turn around, wanting to escape.The arrows stuck on its body numbers more and more, all precisely aimed at its weak points or vitals like the organs, joints, and stomach area.Its injury becomes servere with overwhelming speed, turning the demon beast\u2019s intense rage into immense fright.If it immediately decided to flee when first struck, then may be its speed could save its life, but already choosing to retaliate, halfway changing its mind to flee, then it\u2019s already too late.During that whole process, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face shows no emotion, both arms as steady as a rock, continuously pulling out arrows, pulling back the bowstring, and letting loose.The final minute.The demon beast lays flat on the ground, no longer moving.Its body full of arrows, fresh blood pours from all over its vitals, soaking the ground red.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s inner spirit energy already decreased by 40%.Even so, he still continues to draw his arrows, putting spirit energy inside them, aiming precisely at the beast\u2019s vitals and letting arrows loose.Demon beasts already have intelligence, they\u2019re no longer dumb and stupid, some are even craftier compared to humans.They also know how to faint death, how to lure enemies.7-8 breaths later, the demon beast\u2019s body keeps being riddled with more arrows, no longer able to keep up the ruse, it springs up to flee again.What it received, was an even more intense flurry of arrows.The demon beast tries it best to dash forward 5-6 meters more, crashing straight into a huge tree and falls down to the ground.This time it really is dead.Two lines of blue light shows up in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sight.\u201cSoul Point +1, current Soul Point: 1/5\u201d\u201cExperience enough, current Experience 5/5, you can now level up, please confirm if you would like to level up?\u201dEarlier when he killed the Skin-shedding Blood demon, he already received 4 Experience points, now he got 1 more, reaching the level up requirements.Not a single bit of hesitation, Gu Qing Shan: \u201cLevel up\u201dFollowing his voice, the Experience stat turns from \u201c5/5\u201d into \u201c0/10\u201dFrom qi training stage 2 to qi training stage 3, the amount of Experience required is doubled.On Gu Qing Shan\u2019s character status screen, his level \u201cqi training stage 1\u201d also changes, turning into \u201cqi training stage 2\u201dA flashy gold light emits from Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body.The warm flow of water-like substance circles Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body, finally concentrating at his Dantian, turning into excess spirit energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext

Go out!\u201d (TN: as in on a date)\u201cAccept already\u201d\u201cCome on dude, quickly!\u201dThe voices keep on going.Someone from behind tapped Gu Qing Shan on his shoulder and spoke: \u201cQing Shan, I\u2019m here for you man, just speak your heart out!\u201dGu Qing Shan slightly turned to look back.It was Zhang Ye, his best friend from high school.Gu Qing Shan turns to look around, his eyes finally stops on the girl in front of him.She really did look beautiful in any clothes, even if she doesn\u2019t wear any jewelry, only donning a pure white long dress, she can still be picked out with eyesight amidst a crowd of other girls.Su Xue Er, Goddess of Noble Private High School of Chang Ning county.A precious gem of the Su family \u2013 one of the 9 Great Nobles families.Gu Qing Shan closes his eyes, then open them again.The girl is still there.He really did come back to the past.Back to this moment that he would remember for the rest of his life.\u201cSu Xue Er, Gu Qing Shan have something to say to you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, he carefully picked his words for so long, finally having the guts to say it\u201d\u201cGu Qing Shan, speak your mind, we\u2019re all here as witness for you\u201dAmong the crowd, the people are still cheering loudly nonstop.Seeing Gu Qing Shan keeping silent and not speaking, Su Xue Er finally spoke first.\u201cGu Qing Shan, so what did you want to tell me?\u201dWhen the school goddess spoke, everyone finally quieted down.Everyone wanted to see, will Gu Qing Shan really do as the rumors say and confess this feelings right on this graduation prom night.Gu Qing Shan push down the turmoils in this heart, smiles and stands back up speaking: \u201cSu Xue Er, I sincerely hope that you will accept my one request\u201d\u201cThat is?\u201d inside the girls crystal clear eyes, there is a bit of complicated mixed feelings.Gu Qing Shan spoke with complete seriousness on his face: \u201cCan you accept my request, to visit my barbecue stall tomorrow night, and try out some of my handmade grilled meat?\u201dSu Xue Er is speechless.The cheering crowd is shocked dead silent.\u201cBarbecue? Just grilled meat? Nothing else?\u201d Su Xue Er ask again to make sure she didn\u2019t heard wrong.\u201cOf course, my expertise are only two things, mech piloting you\u2019ve already seen, there\u2019s only my cooking skills left\u201d Gu Qing Shan shrugs, \u201cSo do you want to try out my cooking?\u201dSu Xue Er opens her clear eyes wide, asks again: \u201cBut your friend, Zhang Ye told me, you wanted to \u2013\u201cGu Qing Shan stopped her worlds: \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him anything\u201d\u201cIs that so? So all this really wasn\u2019t your idea after all\u201d Su Xue Er face shows relief, as well as a small smile.Right then, a male student from amongst the crowd stepped out, hurriedly asks: \u201cQing Shan, didn\u2019t you tell me, that you wanted to confess to Su Xue Er today?\u201dThe crowd becomes noisy again.Gu Qing Shan turns around, coldly looks at the personThis male student is the same person who tapped his shoulder from before.His best friend, Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye and Gu Qing Shan, both came from poor origins, both relied on their academic excellence to get into this top-level high school.In these three years of high school, the two of them formed a close bond.Gu Qing Shan originally thought, this would be his good friend, close enough to be family.But he didn\u2019t know, on this very graduation prom night, Zhang Ye planned and dosed him with a strange medicine, tricking him into drinking it.The results was that during the time he planned to confess to Su Xue Er, the medicine acted up, forcing him in front of everyone here to attempt some low-life conducts to Su Xue Er.Finally it took Su Xue Er\u2019s personal guards, as well as a few student officers to hold Gu Qing Shan in place and stop him.This event shocked the whole school.Originally Gu Qing Shan had very good academic records, he also got his own talents, and a decent personality, so he was able to catch Su Xue Er\u2019s eyes, the two of them becoming not-so-bad friends.But after this, Su Xue Er completely gave up on him, slapped him in front of everybody, cried and left.After that was the Su family\u2019s rage, saying they wanted Gu Qing Shan to die for his sins, the school didn\u2019t even hesitate to immediately expel Gu Qing Shan, not even giving him the chance to take the university entrance exams.Finally it took Su Xue Er painstakingly begging him for three days and nights just for the Su family head to spare his life.For your information, the Su family head is the Lord that directly control all of Chang Ning county, and there are only a total of 9 Lords in the whole Confederate.From then on, Gu Qing Shan had to suffer all manners of jeers and cold shoulders, not a single person looking his way.The Technology Invention and Research company that originally hired him before graduation, immediately fired him.He tried everywhere to get into a school, but no school even dared to accept him, when looking for a job, he did not find even a menial labor job, finally almost starving to death in the slums.And all of that, was thank to his \u201cbest friend\u201d, Zhang Ye.Gu Qing Shan wallowed and despair and embarrassment, struggling every day to live, only when the other world and Reality connected, did he finally have the chance to change his fate.But for the rest of his life, countless times waking up in the middle of the night, Gu Qing Shan always remembered the events of this day, always grinding his teeth to the point of breaking them.Gu Qing Shan have had time to think carefully.Su Xue Er is the eldest daughter of one of the 9 Great Nobles families, him as a poor scholarship student, having her had the good will to become his friend is already thinking of him very highly.Before not yet having any real power, he shouldn\u2019t have delusioned himself with making their relationship going any further.Doing things that way will only make Su Xue Er embarrassed, and will only put Gu Qing Shan himself in a dangerous situation.He can only laugh at himself for being too young, having too many unrealistic dreams, as well as having the fraud Zhang Ye next to him, whispering sweet lies of \u201cSu Xue Er actually also like you\u201d as truth.Which led to the confession scene on prom night.Fortunately, this time he returned, Gu Qing Shan will not be stepping on fallen tracks.In front of everyone, Gu Qing Shan looks at Zhang Ye, whispering loudly: \u201cYou thought wrong, my true love is Xie Shuang Yan\u201dThe whole crowd burst into laughter, even Su Xue Er couldn\u2019t help but broke into a smile, holding in her laughter.Xie Shuang Yan is the lead singer of the most popular girl idol group in the world.Whether it is the Saint Orlank Empire to the North, or the vast lands of Fu Xi Republic, even the Freedom Federation of the South, countless people men or women, old or young alike are all fans of Xie Shuang Yan.There are simply too many people in this world that love Xie Shuang Yan, Gu Qing Shan using her as an excuse like this, not even Su Xue Er will believe him.Within the crowd, there are even a few of her male fans shouting out: \u201cGu Qing Shan, so turns out you want to join our Xie Shuang Yan fan club huh!\u201dZhang Ye\u2019s face constantly shifts, his heart sank straight to the bottom.He didn\u2019t think Gu Qing Shan would be so crafty, casually brushing off the issue like that.No, today he absolutely cannot fail, a chance like this, likely will never come again in his lifetime.Gu Qing Shan is his last chance to move up in the world.Zhang Ye bites his teeth and step forward, whispering into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s ear: \u201cGu Qing Shan, your peaceful days are over\u201dThen, using force, he slaps Gu Qing Shan on the shoulderA small pain.That came from a small needle Zhang Ye was keeping in his palm.Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t resist, only staring at him all the way until he\u2019s finished with everything.\u201cWhy?\u201d Gu Qing Shan calmly asks\u201cWhy what?\u201d Zhang Ye face relaxes like he just put a weight off his shoulders.The dosage on the needle is much stronger than before, only a minute later, Gu Qing Shan won\u2019t be able to keep his body instinct in check anymore.\u201cWhy do you have to do this to me? I remember we were friends\u201d Gu Qing Shan asks again.Zhang Ye can\u2019t help but lower his gaze, mumbling lowly: \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, poor people on this world, can only live better lives when they grasp their chance\u201dThen, he suddenly apply force, pushing Gu Qing Shan towards Su Xue Er.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body temperature keeps rising, his breath becoming shorter and deeper, staggering towards where Su Xue Er is.The medicine starts to act up.Gu Qing Shan feels his whole body becoming cold.He suddenly remembered, Su Xue Er once casually talked to him about Zhang Ye\u201cQing Shan ge, Zhang Ye and your eyes for judging people aren\u2019t the same\u201d (TN: \u201cge\u201d means big brother, but can also be used as an affectionate way to refer to a male friend by both male and female)Gu Qing Shan shakes his head internally.The more trust there was, the more disappointed he is right now.Let's stop here.Gu Qing Shan mind slightly move, the spirit energy in his Dantian flows like a river, easily restraining the medicine effect, his heightened body temperature also slowly cools down.As a cultivator, how could normal poison possibly harm him?Gu Qing Shan eyes regain their shine, lightly calls out: \u201cAunty Su, please come out\u201dImmediately, a mature and captivating woman, as well as a gray-haired elderly man appeared out of nowhere.These two are Su Xue Er\u2019s bodyguards.Su Xue Er is the eldest daughter of Su family, as well as the only daughter of this generation\u2019s main line, always loved by the whole of Su family, having two bodyguards always silently protecting her like this is completely normal\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201dThe mature woman sharply glares at Gu Qing ShanShe is by Su Xue Er\u2019s side every day, so of course she know this young brat.Originally she felt that this kid\u2019s head is bright, personality is also not too bad, but didn\u2019t think that he would suddenly make a confession scene like that.This kind of reckless behaviour would put immense pressure on Su Xue Er, so as a bodyguard she\u2019s very disappointed in Gu Qing Shan.Not to mention, since she was secretly protecting Su Xue Er, being called out to the open like this makes her even more annoyed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

La0o9Gu Qing Shan looks around.Right now is the official prom night for the graduating high school class, all the school officials are here, as well as quite a few big shots from several organization.Not few of them have already started noticing what\u2019s going on here.In a public place like this, I shouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous, better to borrow her family\u2019s power instead.Gu Qing Shan lightly smiles and spoke: \u201cForgive me, Aunty Su, I\u2019m just suspicious that there might be somebody taking advantage of me to hurt Su Xue Er\u201dNot expecting that answer, Aunty Su squints her eyes, the grey-haired elderly man also stop his gentle smile.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Aunty Su quickly survey the surround, lowering her voice and asks.\u201cBecause today something very strange happened\u201d Gu Qing Shan answers.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cZhang Ye sneakily put some sort of medicine in my drink, then also encouraged me to confess to Su Xue Er like that\u201dSeeing not only the two bodyguards but also Su Xue Er carefully listening in, Gu Qing Shan slowly explained things from start to finish.\u201cIn case I refused to do as he says, I thought he might try some other methods, so I decided to comply, staging a scene as before to see what he really wanted to accomplish\u201d\u201cYou mean, you\u2019ve already ingested the medicine?\u201d Aunty Su narrows her eyes further and questioned.\u201cThat\u2019s correct, there\u2019s also this\u201d, Gu Qing Shan extend his hand, placing it on his shoulder.A black needle covered in blood was pulled out!Aunty Su\u2019s expression clearly changed, both her and the elderly man became serious.Ever since the Su eldest daughter started to become friends with Gu Qing Shan, the Su family have already investigated his background carefully, after two years of friendship between them, they know very well what his personal values are like.So when Gu Qing Shan got close to Su Xue Er like normal, the two bodyguards didn\u2019t mind it.Who knew that the problem would have sprouted from him of all people.\u201cDo you feel strange anywhere?\u201d Su Xue Er worried her him and carefully asked.The two of them have a close enough relationship, so Su Xue Er didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to him.\u201cOf course, I feel my libido burning right now\u201d Gu Qing Shan half-jokingly answered.Unable to say anything to that, Su Xue Er\u2019s face burns up red.Aunty Su took out a dagger, swipe a small wound on Gu Qing Shan\u2019s finger and licked a drop of his blood.\u201cHmph\u201d Aunty Su tasted it for a bit, \u201cSo it really was an aphrodisiac, and a strong one at that\u201dHer eyes looking at him became a bit surprised: \u201cYoung brat, and you can still control yourself like this\u201dGu Qing Shan dryly laughs: \u201cI\u2019m barely hanging on right now\u201dIn reality, Gu Qing Shan only needed to circulate the spirit energy in his Dantian a little bit to restrain the aphrodisiac effects.This world doesn\u2019t have the thing called spirit energy yet, Gu Qing Shan also doesn\u2019t want his secret to leak out to other people.From the start, Su Xue Er was a bright girl, so she immediately understand everything from start to end.She quickly pulls at Aunty Su\u2019s sleeves and sincerely asked: \u201cAunty, you\u2019re a master pharmacist, please help him\u201dAunty Su took out a small bottle, giving Gu Qing Shan a white capsule from inside: \u201cSwallow it\u201dHer eyes looking at Gu Qing Shan right now is much gentler than before.This brat is both bright and careful, not bad.Gu Qing Shan received the capsule and immediately swallowed it, and continued: \u201cSeems like, his goal was to embarrass both Su Xue Er and I in front of everybody\u201dEveryone there turned back to look at Zhang Ye.Zhang Ye seeing everything already got exposed, felt a chill on his whole body.Suddenly he turns around, quickly wanting to get away.The two bodyguards having seen that, became angrier inside.Up to this point, everything is already clear.Gu Qing Shan usually gets along well with the young lady, so both of them wouldn\u2019t be too much on guard against him.During an official occasion such as a prom night like this, they\u2019re more focused on looking out for strange faces that appear.If Gu Qing Shan were to suddenly do something reckless, they might not be able to make it in time to stop him.In front of everybody like this, if the young lady was violated in any way by Gu Qing Shan, her reputation would definitely suffer, the two of them would also be confused not knowing what to do right away.If there were any other hidden cards in this prom, it would be very possible for them to take advantage of the chaos and find a chance to assassinate the young lady.The elderly man\u2019s figure flashed, already stopping Zhang Ye in his tracks.\u201cCome brat, living is miserable, why not fall into a nice dream instead\u201dThe elderly man chants, uses his big rough hands to take hold of Zhang Ye\u2019s heah, then slowly closes his eyes.Then something strange happened.As the elderly man closes his eyes, so does Zhang Ye close his.Continue chanting in a strange rhythm, the elderly man\u2019s voice is like the devil\u2019s whisper, luring mortals in: \u201cCome, come, come, you need only to tell your secret, I will then satisfy your every desires\u201dA mesmerized smile appeared on Zhang Ye\u2019s face, his mouth mumbling: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll tell you right now\u201dThis strange scene leads to the crowd around murmuring, discussing it between themselves.Gu Qing Shan also didn\u2019t expect that, asks: \u201cIs this possibly, a \u2018God\u2019s Chosen Skill\u2019?\u201dSu Xue Er standing beside him, quietly answers: \u201cThat\u2019s right, grandpa Lee is a God\u2019s Chosen who specialize in finding out the truth\u201dGod\u2019s Chosen are Professionists who hold a unique ability, their abilities usually are mysterious, usually manifesting by itself as a person matures.Their abilities simply cannot be gotten through any form of cultivation or training, its growth can\u2019t even be interfered with, just like they\u2019ve been decided by god from birth.Because of that, the people who possess these abilities are called God\u2019s Chosen.In Reality, humanity\u2019s top-brass fighting power is divided into 4 types, in order they are God\u2019s Chosen, Martial Artists, Supernaturalist, and Heaven\u2019s Descendants, each of them specialize in a different aspect.Aside from that, powerful mechs and the Interstellar-series warships are common war weapons of mass destruction.If what Su Xue Er said is true, then the elderly man\u2019s ability must be a hypnosis-type God\u2019s Chosen SkillSeeing everyone focusing on the elderly man\u2019s work, Su Xue Er lowers her voice and speaks: \u201cQing Shan ge, today I have to thank you\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me\u201d, Gu Qing Shan curtly replies, \u201cI\u2019m also doing this for myself, if I had really tried to do anything to you in this environment, my outcome would have been exceptionally terrible\u201dWhat he\u2019s saying is true, because that\u2019s what happened to his previous life.Su Xue Er shakes her head and sincerely speaks again: \u201cQing Shan ge, a maiden\u2019s honor is very important to her, I have to thank you for helping me keep mine. And also, later on if anything happen to you, Xue Er swears to do her best to protect you\u201dSu Xue Er isn\u2019t a bad girl, in the past life, even when she was absolutely disappointed in Gu Qing Shan, she still kneeled in front of the Su family head for three days, begging for him to spare his life.Because of that, even though Gu Qing Shan went through so much killing, having to risk his life amongst blood and tears every day making his heart already frozen cold to the core, right up to his very last moment in the Apocalypse, Su Xue Er still had a very important place in his heart.That\u2019s right, this girl is like this, once she thinks of someone as her friend, she will treat them with kindness from the bottom of her heart.Gu Qing Shan only smiles and not said anything else.Some things in this world, you don\u2019t need to speak to convey.Right now, what he\u2019s more interested in his why Zhang Ye would do this.During his past life, this is one of the things that he couldn\u2019t find out until the end.Gu Qing Shan silently thinks, not noticing the girl beside him sneakily glancing at his face.After a while, Su Xue Er stops her eyes, finding inside herself now contain some unknown emotions.She keeps feeling like Gu Qing Shan today is different compared to how he always is.On him, there seems to be something that changed.Note:-Professionist: a term used to describe people who have superhuman powers, literally \u201ca person with a profession\u201d, since this novel has more than one system of cultivation, the word Professionist is used to describe them all, while terms like Cultivators, Elementalists and such are used to describe specific types of superhuman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

finally started to speak\u201cSomeone paid 10 million, so that I dose Gu Qing Shan with aphrodisiac, and make sure that he confesses to Su Xue Er\u201dThe elderly man keeps his rhythmic voice: \u201cWho is that person?\u201dZhang Ye: \u201cThe person used an anonymous account, I don\u2019t know who he is\u201dThis is the truth.Unfortunately, the trail also goes cold here.The elderly man\u2019s expression became serious again.The person that did this is very careful, and very cautious.He dared to use the Su family young lady\u2019s friend to do his deeds, not only does he show a motive to harm the Su family young lady, he also showed no slack or opening to find him with, this just became much more complicated.Because, this area is Chang Ning county, and this is the Su family\u2019s main turf.The elderly man retracts his hand, Zhang Ye immediately regain his senses.Right away he drops down to his knees, face full of tears begging: \u201cI was tempted by the devil, Qing Shan, I\u2019ve made a mistake\u201dGu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t say anything.Zhang Ye keeps his kneeling position, slowly inches towards Gu Qing Shan, begging once again: \u201cQing Shan, we were best friends for many years, I\u2019ve wronged you only this one time, I beg you, please forgive me\u201dHe\u2019s also clever, knowing that he only directly tried to harm Gu Qing Shan, so he immediately goes to Gu Qing Shan and beg for forgiveness.Gu Qing Shan this person, in everyday life he\u2019s always a good person at heart, plus being this Zhang Ye\u2019s close friend, I\u2019m showing no dignity begging for his forgiveness in front of so many people, Gu Qing Shan probably will also not pursue this too far.Su Xue Er is also a big softy, as long as Gu Qing Shan forgive me, Su Xue Er will probably also won\u2019t pursue this matter anymore.This matter also didn\u2019t leave any lasting or irreversible effects, as long as Su Xue Er doesn\u2019t pursue it, then the Su family will also not stoop so low as to torture a penniless student such as himself.Just as he thought, Su Xue Er looks as Gu Qing Shan, hesitantly: \u201cHow do you want to deal with this, he\u2026 in the end is still a classmate\u201dAunty Su immediately stops her words: \u201cYoung lady, this matter isn\u2019t as simple as this, we have to pursue it to the end\u201dHer serious eyes turn to Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan keep silent for a while, then smiles.\u201cTo be honest, right now my thoughts are about the same as yours\u201d, he looks at the groveling Zhang Ye and speaks.Zhang Ye shivers, his face shows a clear sense of relief: \u201cDo you mean, you\u2019re willing to forgive me?\u201d\u201cNo\u201dIn front of the gaze of everybody here, Gu Qing Shan swiftly walks in front of Zhang Ye and whispers: \u201cRight now I feel that our friendship should just go to hell already\u201dJust as he finished, Gu Qing Shan suddenly lifts his leg and kicks Zhang ye right in his chest.Zhang Ye who got kicked flew a few meters away, slamming and crashing two tables full of alcohol, soaking himself in it.A large bottle of champagne drops down, conveniently smashing him on the head, knocking Zhang Ye out on the spot.Gu Qing Shan turns around, lightly speaks: \u201cAunty Su, the matters after this I\u2019ll have to depend on you, please find out who was behind him\u201dAunty Su looks at him with shining eyes: \u201cGood move brat, originally I feared that Su Xue Er becoming your friend would make her soft, seems like that was for nothing after all\u201dAunty Su swings her hand, and a beautiful helicopter quickly descends from above.This white steel alloy helicopter, in its front proudly carries a single letter \u201cSu\u201d, the symbol of nobility in this Chang Ning county.The elderly man takes Zhang Ye up to the helicopter.Aunty Su speaks: \u201cYoung lady, today we shouldn\u2019t remain here for too long, let\u2019s also leave now\u201dSu Xue Er nods her head, when passing by Gu Qing Shan, she spoke: \u201cTomorrow night, I\u2019ll come to your stall for a grilled meat feast, that\u2019s ok right?\u201dGu Qing Shan is shocked for a second, but replied: \u201cAlways welcome\u201dThis is the nonsense that he used to smooth over the confession earlier, he didn\u2019t think she would actually accept it.But Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t really have anything to worry about, since after school every day, he would always set up a stall to sell grilled meat, using the money he makes from that to pay for expenses.Su Xue Er smiles beautifully at him, then follow Aunty Su onto the Su family helicopter.The helicopter quickly goes away.Right after Su family left, many organization representatives also left, leaving a grand prom night to end prematurely just like that.This is probably the most catastrophic graduation prom night in the history of Chang Ning Noble Private High School thus far.But to Gu Qing Shan, this is the best prom night he could\u2019ve hoped for.He finally escaped from that dead-end scenario in which he had no way to explain himself, it wasn\u2019t like his last life, where the school expelled him.Just a few days later, he would be able to take the Confederate Common University exam.With his academic records, he can easily pass the examination, picking whichever university he wants.On the other hand, Zhang Ye\u2019s end won\u2019t be quite as good.Su Xue Er and Zhang Ye doesn\u2019t have such a close relationship as he does, plus the fact that this whole incident was orchestrated by Zhang Ye from behind, directly harming both Gu Qing Shan and Su Xue Er.Not only will Su Xue Er not be asking to spare Zhang Ye as she did for him, but the Su family will also use any and all methods they have to find out he really is behind Zhang Ye.What he suffered on his past life, Zhang Ye will suffer the same, or perhaps even worse.Everything has changed.Gu Qing Shan with his renewed mood, walks to the school exit.He\u2019s just an orphan at the slums, he can\u2019t afford a helicopter, not even a taxi ride home, each and every day going to school he can only do with his own two feet.Half an hour later.When Gu Qing Shan have left the busy district and about to enter the poor residence\u2019s main square, his feet suddenly stopped.In front of the alley, a 1.9-meter-long wingless type helicopter is packed there.A middle-aged man wearing a white shirt and black tie stands next to the helicopter, gracefully bow as if to welcome Gu Qing Shan as he approached.\u201cStudent Gu, our young master is waiting for you inside the helicopter\u201d, said the middle-aged man.Gu Qing Shan silently looks at the safety cameras on the street corner, the originally red blinking lights of the camera is no longer seen.Even this large square area, no one is approaching from all four sides.\u201cAnd who is your young master?\u201d Gu Qing Shan questioned.The middle-aged man doesn\u2019t talk much, only standing aside, making a gesture to invite him inside: \u201cPlease\u201dHow interesting, Gu Qing Shan smiles to himself, walking straight into the helicopter.The inside of the helicopter is decorated lavishly as expected, a single young man sits in his leather-made sofa, two girls kneeling at his feet softly massaging them.From the inside bar, a girl wearing cute bunny ears quickly whips up a cocktail, placing it in front of Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThank you\u201d, said Gu Qing Shan as he accepts the glass.\u201cQing Shan, come, sit\u201d, said the young man.Gu Qing Shan sits down right across the young man, casually placing the cocktail on the table, smiles and asks: \u201cPlease tell, what does our honorable student council president want, waiting outside my house at this late hour?\u201dThe young man shakes his head: \u201cCalling me that seems too distant, young master Yun is fine\u201dThis young man, is Chang Ning Noble Private High School\u2019s student council president, Nie Yun.Nie Yun is a member of the She family noble clan, to be precise, the grandson of She family\u2019s current patriarch.Of noble origins, in this school, aside from Su Xue Er, no one is more noble than him.Nie Yun brushes off his hand: \u201cGood, you all are dismissed\u201dThe girls quickly clean up the place, leaving the helicopter.Nie Yun then picks up a sheet of paper on the table, reading and speaking at the same time: \u201cQing Shan, your records really are excellent, every final exam you trounce both Su Xue Er and I\u201d\u201cJust seeing here, Elementary Mech Structure, maximum score; World War History, maximum score; Holo-Brain Technology, maximum score; Warship Piloting, maximum score; even your elective subject, Mech Power Source Study, you got maximum score, only in Physical Education is your score barely a passing grade\u201dNie Yun lowers the paper, exclaimed softly: \u201cYou are also an official staff at Chang Ning Steel Mech Research Center, this wasn\u2019t gotten using your relationship with Su Xue Er, but rather through your own excellence, even inside Su family many people probably can only look at your achievement in awe\u201dGu Qing Shan nonchalantly: \u201cI\u2019m only working for a better future for myself\u201dNie Yun shakes his head: \u201cIn this whole Chang Ning county, every poor sap wants to enter Su family\u2019s Steel Mech Research company, but only you actually succeed, this can only be talent and nothing else\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really impressed with your kind of people, so now I want to give you a chance\u201d, Nie Yun took from inside his chest pocket a letter, placing it in front of Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThis is?\u201d asked Gu Qing Shan\u201cSee for yourself\u201dGu Qing Shan opened the letter and took a look at what was inside.He whispers: \u201cNan Shi Lordship Institute letter of acceptance?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct\u201d, Nie Yun smiles: \u201cYou only need to agree, no need to even take the exams, you can immediately enter this university\u201dGu Qing Shan puts down the letter and spoke: \u201cThank you for your kindness, but I don\u2019t plan on joining this university\u201dNan Shi Lordship Institute is only a third-rate bottom rank university, and it\u2019s situated on the least populated area of Nan Shi province, their main major is underground mineral study, a subject few cares about.Gu Qing Shan himself have many choice universities, with his record, getting into one of the few State-sanctioned universities in the country is no problem, basically he has no need to even consider such a third-rate institute.\u201cNo need to be hasty and decline, just take a minute and think, is your own life important, or is being friends with Su Xue Er more important\u201d, Nie Yun\u2019s tone suddenly became cold.Gu Qing Shan looks up and asked: \u201cNow why would you say that?\u201dNie Yun\u2019s smile disappeared completely, sitting straight up: \u201cThe whole of Chang Ning county---- no, the whole noble community of the Confederate, all hope to have Su Xue Er marry into their own house, yet you, a pitiable insect of a poor student, dared to make a confession scene in front of everybody\u201dNie Yun sighs and continues: \u201cYou have no money, no power, not even a Professionist, anyone of them that wants to kill you can just squish you like a bug\u201dHe picks up the letter of acceptance on the table and hold it out for Gu Qing Shan.\u201cJust go, take this letter of acceptance and go far away, afterwards don\u2019t ever contact Su Xue Er again, then you

Seeing as we were fellow high school students for three years, I\u2019ll give you some advice\u201d\u201cHa ha ha, you, give me advice?\u201d, Nie Yun looks at him like looking at a clown trying his best to keep up an act.This brat is smart to immediately see through my intention, but so what?The two of us from the start are already not from the same world, after graduation, the difference will become like between heaven and the earth, no longer will I ever have to see him again.Fine, let the poor brat speak his piece, see what he has to say.Nie Yun smiles with eyes not smiling and asks: \u201cFine then, tell me, I\u2019ll listen\u201d\u201cGo and be your family\u2019s rich young master, and don\u2019t cross me\u201d, afterwards, Gu Qing Shan immediately left the helicopter, doesn\u2019t bother to look back.Nie Yun stands alone for a bit, then shakes his head: \u201cLike a locust trying to stop an elephant, pathetic and funny\u201dHe pushes a button on the table.Not long after the middle-aged man from outside the helicopter steps in, lowering his head: \u201cYes, young master\u201dNie Yun asks: \u201cWhat of the thing I told you to prepare?\u201d\u201cOur preparations are ready\u201d\u201cAny chance for failure?\u201dThe middle-aged man lightly smiles and replies: \u201cThe people we hired are all top-notch professionals, guaranteed to look like an accident, even if there are investigations later, the results will be nothing but that\u201dNie Yun coldly laughs: \u201cVery good, then do it\u201d\u201cYes\u201d, the middle-aged man took a look at his watch, then replies: \u201cYoung master can be assured, 10 minutes later, Gu Qing Shan will die by an unfortunate accident\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just a slight shift of his body and the man misses.The blonde man staggered for a bit before standing straight up.The fuck, how did he dodge that? The blond man immediately shouts: \u201cYou brat, you dare to hit me? Brothers, show him who\u2019s boss!\u201dRight as he said that, their looks of drunkenness immediately disappeared.\u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201dThe group shouts, each taking out their knives and rush forward.\u201cSo that\u2019s what it is\u201d, seeing that, Gu Qing Shan immediately understood.These people are clearly here for him.If it was just drunk fighting, they wouldn\u2019t pull out knives that quickly.Even if one person drinks too much and can\u2019t think straight, doesn\u2019t mean all of them are like that at the same time.These men all act really quickly, only taking a single breath for the first person to get close, knife aimed straight at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart.The plunge is as quick as it is deadly, if that connects he\u2019ll really die in one hit.So they were professional!Gu Qing Shan only took a single moment to think, his body quickly step in pass the knife, moving straight into the man\u2019s chest.\u201cHah!\u201dWith an open palm, he strikes the man in his chest.The man flew backwards, straight into the people behind.The thugs almost seemed like they got hit by a raging bull, letting out an ear-rending scream, rolling on the floor moaning nonstop.Especially the one that got hit and flew away, his chest already sank in, no longer breathing.Gu Qing Shan seeing that was a bit shocked, then reminded himself: \u201cI forgot, it\u2019s not the Apocalypse yet\u201dThe only man still standing suppresses the chill inside his body, shouting seriously: \u201cUse fire!\u201dOnly needing a single palm strike to kill a martial artist on our side, as well as knocking the rest of them down like that, just how much strength does that take?Don\u2019t kid with me, the weakest my comrades here is still a 1 or 2-star martial artist, yet they all got knocked down just like that.They don\u2019t even have the strength to get back up.This is a real monster!What\u2019s even scarier, is that they couldn\u2019t even see how he moved.This level of strength, he has to be at least a 7-star martial artist.Possibly even a Martial Master that broke through the 9-star shackles.He doesn\u2019t know that Gu Qing Shan only temporarily forgot to hold back and used spirit energy on his palms.A qi training stage 2 cultivator, without using spirit energy, their body strength is about equal to a 4-star martial artist.But if they do use spirit energy then that\u2019s a different story, their destructive force is increased by quite a few times.The faces of these thugs immediately changed, rushing to take out their guns, wanting to quickly deal with this scary martial artist.They originally only wanted to stage a drunken fight scene that resulted in an accidental death, that way no one would be able to find out anything.Who knew that a normal unassuming student would be so strong!Under such circumstances, they can only ignore the original plan, kill him first then think later.They acted fast, but Gu Qing Shan was faster.A military bow suddenly appeared in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands.The same military bow he brought from the game!\u201cSince you wanted to kill me, all of you can just die\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s hands moved so fast they left afterimages, fired six shots in a blink of the eye.Rapid Fire!Pssh pssh pssh pssh pssh!Five people\u2019s heads exploded almost at the same time.Only the last man standing from before, got his hands hit by the arrow, dropped his gun on the floor, shivering, struggling to stand straight.Feeling killing intent so strong it almost felt solid, the man hurriedly drops to the ground, begging for mercy: \u201cSpare me, spare me, I admit defeat, please spare me, if I can do anything to save my pathetic life I\u2019ll do it!\u201dGu Qing Shan asks: \u201cWho sent you?\u201dHearing that, the thug\u2019s sights darted around the headless bodies scattered about, inside his mind full of fright and anger.Fright, because he\u2019s facing a person as cruel as this, killing everyone on their side without any hesitation; anger, because the people who hired them were so horribly misinformed, or even purposely did this to send low-level assassins like them to death.No matter which case it is, he decided not to let those people get away so easily.Thinking that, he shakenly answers: \u201cThe person who hired us is Nie family, Xiong Hu\u201d\u201cVery good, I like honest people\u201dGu Qing Shan slowly walked forward, retrieving the arrows he shot.These arrows specially made for war usage can handle spirit energy insertion, having to use them on normal people is a bit of a waste.If not for the fact that Gu Qing Shan\u2019s cultivation is still too low, qi training stage 2 not being able to block bullets, he wouldn\u2019t have used these bow and arrows.It\u2019s very clear, Nie Yun was the one who did this.However, Nie family is also a big Noble family in Chang Ning district, many strong people work for them, not only Martial Masters, but also Supernaturalist and God's Chosen as well.\u201cNie Yun\u2026 with his the way he does things, he definitely wouldn\u2019t give up here\u201dGu Qing Shan recalls how he is from memory and mumble to himself.Having a person like this determined to kill him, this won\u2019t be easy.Gu Qing Shan stuffed the dead bodies into his inventory bag while scanning the surroundings with his Inner SightThe inventory bag can hold anything that isn\u2019t a living being, a common tool among cultivators for ease of bringing supplies and equipment, now conveniently acts as a way for him to get rid of evidence of the crime scene.The next time Gu Qing Shan goes to the other world, he can just chuck these bodies down the dead pit and no one will ever be able to find out they ever existed in the first place.Note:-Inner Sight: this actually have many names across different novels, as well as having different effects, in this case it refers to the ability to spread his perception away from his own body to look at things from afar, you can think of it as a built-in scanner, or something similar to Byakugan from Naruto, the ability to have perfect vision of everything 360 degrees around one\u2019s own body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sorry for your confusions.This area is the slums, not only are there no safety cameras on the streets, but also very few pedestrians.The location they chose is good, and the time is also suitable for faking an accident.Ironically, this instead helped remove Gu Qingshan's worries.In the distance, the shrill police alarm is heard.Gu Qing Shan looked up to see a small police shuttle quickly coming this way from the air.There isn\u2019t anyone around, so no one could have called the police, yet the police arrived just in time like this, obviously it had to have been pre-arranged.If everything had gone as normal, I would have been stabbed to death on the spot, the police would come just to collect a corpse, also taking the dagger as evidence, and everything would\u2019ve been glossed over.When Su Xue Er finally got the news, even if she sent someone to check, they wouldn\u2019t be able to find any evidence.Tomorrow, someone will naturally go confess to this crime, saying that they drank too much and got into a fight, and they couldn\u2019t control their strength.He\u2019s already dead, what else can Su Xue Er do?And that would\u2019ve been the end of that.Gu Qing Shan glanced coldly at the small police shuttle, grabbing the only thug still alive on the ground, his body quickly disappeared into the darkness, no longer visible.A casino.Nie Yun glanced at the cards in his hand and said: \"Dealer, hit me again, I\u2019ll Call\"The female dealer couldn't help but wipe the sweat from her forehead, taking a deep breath and dealt the cards to two players.\"Young master Nie, no need to go so big\" the big man with sunglasses opposite of him said.Behind the sunglasses man, a slim feminine figure is hiding behind the chair shivering, too scared to even show her face.Nie Yun without care: \"It's just 20 million. If you can\u2019t afford it, just Fold\"\"20 million is nothing, but you also want my red card girl, her I can't bear to lose\" the sunglasses man said. (TN: it's slang for \u2018top beauty\u2019)\"I don't want her body, just her life is enough\" Nie Yun coldly replied.Feeling the slight trembling of the figure behind him, the sunglasses man smiled and said: \"This red card girl isn\u2019t for sale. You let her go, I will give you two other masterpiece girls. How about it?\"Nie Yun: \"This woman dared to splash me with wine, I want her to use her life to pay for it\"The middle-aged man in a white shirt with a black tie walked in and whispered a few words in Nie Yun's ear.Nie Yun slapped him on the face and shouts: \"Didn\u2019t you say there weren\u2019t going to be any problems?\"The middle-aged man said : \"My apologies, young master, please give me an hour, I will personally solve the problem\"Nie Yun spoke: \"I\u2019ll give you half an hour, if it isn\u2019t done, I will recommend the family to withdraw your Stewardship\"The middle-aged man stopped a bit, then turned to quickly leave.\"What's wrong, young master Nie, if you have any troubles, how about letting me solve it\", the sunglasses man offered.Nie Yun snorted and asked: \"What do you want?\"The sunglasses man shrugs \"It's very simple. I solve a problem for you. You let my red card girl go\"Nie Yun thought for a moment, then suddenly smiled: \"How about we make it a bit more exciting instead?\u201dThe sunglasses man silently complained, but still showed a smile on his face: \u201cYoung master Nie please go ahead\u201dAny snot-nosed noble young master, the sunglasses man wouldn\u2019t even care to entertain, but Nie Yun is part of the largest noble family in this Chang Ning County, not counting Su family.The sunglasses man has been working between the black and white of this world for a long time. He knows that if he still want to do business on this land, he cannot offend this young masterNie Yun tinker for a bit with his personal Holo-Brain, finally projected the image onto the white wall.Nie Yun: \"This is my subordinate. I just told him to turn on real-time projection, here we can see that he is moving very fast\"The sunglasses man nodded. \"Indeed\"Nie Yun spoke again: \"He is going to kill a person, we will gamble on how many moves he needs to use to kill the target\"Sunglasses man hesitated: \"Who is the target?\"\"A poor student - right, I\u2019ll bet one move\u201d Nie Yun said as he gave an order to the subordinate through the communicator.The sunglasses man smiled bitterly: \"Your subordinate is a Martial Master, any 5-star or less martial artist would die in one move\"Only when a martial artist reaches 9-star, can they attempt to reach the rank of Master.Once you reach the rank of Master, you are no longer considered a mortal person, even normal army soldiers can't deal with such an existence. Unless a group of Mech fighters are dispatched, it is not possible to win against them.A Martial Master is treated the same as a noble, an existence for people to respect and society to admire.\"Are you going to bet or not, if not I won\u2019t bother with your games anymore, when that happen don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t give you face\" Nie Yun impatiently.\"Fine\" the sunglasses man took a deep breath, \"then I can only gamble that he can't kill the poor boy in one move\"\"That's right, if you win, I\u2019ll let your red card go\" Nie Yun\u2019s face shows triumph.\"And if I lose?\"Nie Yun: \"100 million, plus your red card's corpse\"The sunglasses man's face twitched, about to decline it, but then heard a voice behind him: \"Take his bet\"Sunglasses man lowers his voice and asks: \"What if we lose?\"The figure stopped trembling and whispered: \"If we lose then we\u2019ll kill all Nie clan members, strip him bare and let him burn on the fire for three days\"The sunglasses man\u2019s heart froze, he can tell that this personage does not intend to endure anymore.He looked at Nie Yun sitting across himself, seeming prideful and triumphant, and sighed. \"Fine, I\u2019ll take the bet\"Nie Yun snapped his fingers, smiled and picked up the wine glass. \"Good, then let\u2019s quietly enjoy seeing Xiong Hu go hunting \u2013 watching a Martial Master killing people is also a pleasure in and of itself\"On the other side, the Martial Master who was ordered to kill was moving at a rapid speed.The night is late, the dim streetlights on the road kept going backwards in his sight, the whole city was in a deep sleep, and his movements were light and flexible, without even a little noise, not disturbing anyone's sleep.He is a Grand Steward of the Nie family, known to be both fierce and cruel. Whenever he fought someone will always die. Forging such a reputation in his early years, he earned the name \"Xiong Hu - Fierce Tiger\" within the martial arts community.That brat lives in a building in the slum, on the 22nd floor, the third room from the left.Xiong Hu is very clear about his mission.Open the door, rush in and kill him, as simple as that.But he wouldn\u2019t let his guard down, after all, the group of people arranged before now isn\u2019t heard from, couldn\u2019t be contacted, and couldn\u2019t be located.That is simply strange.Just when he thought that, his communicator suddenly rang.\"Xiong Hu, we got the guy\"Xiong Hu was somewhat surprised, he asked: \"Didn\u2019t I tell you to kill him on the spot?\"\"No, no, I think the price should be raised a bit\"Damn it, so that\u2019s what this is about, Xiong Hu cursed to himself.These trash in the underground world dared to raise the price in the act. Is my reputation of Fierce Tiger not enough to get them in line anymore?Xiong Hu coldly laughed, tried to make his tone calm \"Naturally, the price can be discussed, where are you?\"\"I\u2019m waiting for you at the brat\u2019s place, I believe you know where it is\"The communicator hangs up.Xiong Hu groaned and broke the billboard on the side of the road with one punch.Daring to mention raising prices with me, just you wait, my name is not just for show.He sped up his steps, his visage became like a gray meteor across the night sky.Five minutes later, Xiong Hu stood on the 22nd floor of the building, checked the house number, and with one kick, broke down the security door.Note:-Stewardship: the term doesn\u2019t 100% convey the position, this is a common position in cultivation novels, where a big clan would essentially sponsor people who have strength to work for them. The relationship usually is not one of servant and master, but rather mutual respect. Stewards work for the clan in exchange for resources to continue their cultivation, and the clan provide excess resources in exchange for loyalty and fighting force. While this is a contract of mutual benefit and technically can be cut-off at any time, it usually isn\u2019t.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the narrow long room, you can barely fit a bed and a cabinet. Other things must be piled up on one side, otherwise there is no place to put them.There isn\u2019t even a toilet.Such living conditions are considered inferior even in the slums.Across from Xiong Hu, a person leaning diagonally on the window, the leader of the underground hitman gang.No one else is here, nor is the target.A little clever, but they don\u2019t understand that in the face of absolute strength, this kind of cleverness will only worsen their pain.Xiong Hu walked up and grabbed the man's neck, lifting him up and speaks: \"Trash, hand over the brat, otherwise I promise you all will die a very horrible death\"The man only stared at him without speaking.Xiong Hu raised his eyebrows in fury, preparing to let him taste a bit of pain.Suddenly, he felt a bad premonition.Xiong Hu suddenly turned around, his every muscles squirmed, turning his whole body taller and stronger.---- Almost instantly, he became a burly giant about three meters tall!\"Hah!\"Xiong Hu roared and slammed his hands into the air.A dull sound was heard, Xiong Hu was pushed backwards a few steps, slamming against the wall next to the window.Even the wall was cracked by his impact.Xiong Hu looked down at his hands.\"Bow and arrow? What a rare thing to see.\" Xiong Hu looked at the arrow caught in his hand and thoughtHe looked up, only to see in the darkness, a figure standing at the doorway, holding an antique-looking longbow in his hand.\"You are... that poor student?!\"As Xiong Hu recognized him, he was extremely shocked.That one arrow, he had to use all his strength to stop.Such extraordinary archery, definitely not what a high school student should be capable of.What is even more frightening is that after two years of investigations, he didn\u2019t find anything about such strength.This kid, hiding such power so well under his plain guise, what could he be planning?No, I must immediately go into close combat, only then do I have a chance to kill him!As soon as his thought, Xiong Hu stepped forward, his whole body rushes into a charge.Gu Qing Shan also moved at the same time!Another shot!This arrow is aimed at his chest and abdomen area, but Xiong Hu is in a rapid charge so he can\u2019t change direction to dodge.He had to stretch out his hands again and slammed into the air.A bang.The arrow was deflected, but he was also pushed back two steps by the impact of the arrow.But Xiong Hu didn\u2019t care, openly grinning.\"The power of your arrow is great, but with a thin body like yours, you probably can\u2019t even pull the bowstrings anymore\"Xiong Hu cracked his neck and mocked: \"How many more shots like that can you actually make?\"Gu Qing Shan slightly paused and answered: \"Hmm, quite a few\"He pulled the bowstring.Rapid Fire!Multiple streaks of gray lightning almost seem to appear between the two of them, from Gu Qing Shan heading straight to Xiong Hu.Xiong Hu leaned against the wall and used all his might to block.Each arrow shot is almost equal to a full power blow of a Martial Master, if he ignores them, his body will be riddled with arrows.Xiong Hu did not expect that a Martial Master like himself was actually being pressured by a high school kid.And this wretched scene was also being transmitted live to the young master through holographic video.\"Cursed brat, you can't kill me, when your arrows run out, it'll be your death\" Xiong Hu angrily roared.Gu Qing Shan hands doesn\u2019t stop, only saying: \"You don\u2019t have that long, goodbye\"He guided spiritual energy from his Dantian, pouring it all in the arrow.Crackle!The arrow whizzed through the air, creating a crackling sound from the friction.The shot directly broke through Xiong Hu\u2019s hands, and piercing into his chest.The walls behind Xiong Hu couldn\u2019t handle the impact, cracked open and fell down from the height of the 22nd floor.The entire wall fell down, behind Xiong Hu there was only the night breeze, nothing else to brace himself on.\"Damn it!\"Xiong Hu tried to regain his balance, stabilizing his stance again.However, he can only look in hopelessness as another arrow flew at him screaming.The fierce arrow finally took Xiong Hu with it, flying out from the 22-story height, drew a parabola across the sky, and fell down a bit far away.Not just a Master, even a Grandmaster falling from a 22-story height will die without any doubt.Unless you reach the rank of Martial Eminence, forging your bones to be as strong as golden steel that doesn\u2019t fear strong impact, can you survive.Gu Qing Shan walked to the place where Xiong Hu stood before and picked up the communicator that fell on the ground.\"Nie Yun?\"A mad screaming voice in the communicator: \"Bastard, you dare to kill my family's Steward, you\u2019re in big trouble now, prepare to die soon\"Gu Qing Shan looked at the image feed in the communicator, suddenly spoke: \"You seem to be at the biggest casino in the city district. If so, can you please stay right there for a while?\"Nie Yun baffled: \"What do you mean?\"\"Wait there for a moment, I\u2019ll come kill you right away\"Gu Qing Shan finished his words and threw the communicator out from the 22nd floor.He glanced at the thug curled up in the corner, then turned around to leave.When the thug saw that, he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \"I\u2019m no more use to you. You really won't kill me?\"\"What I asked you to do, you have already done, so you\u2019ve earned back your life.\"Done speaking, Gu Qing Shan continued to go out, soon disappearing down the stairs.The thug\u2019s face showed struggle, then he sighed and rushed out.He shouted: \"Wait, you can't go to your death, Nie family\u2019s Masters are as numerous as the clouds, there are also Grandmasters and Supernaturalists\"In the casino.Nie Yun just stared at the communicator, speechless for a while.\"Young master Nie, I\u2019m sorry to say but it seems that I won\" the sunglasses man said.Nie Yun suddenly stood up and ran out.A short moment after, a gorgeous droplet-shaped shuttle rose from the casino and quickly vanished.The sunglasses man stared at the shuttle leaving and laughed mockingly: \"Acting so high and mighty, yet scared away by a single sentence\"His face suddenly became serious, turned around and bowed: \" Your Highness, please show a little restraint during the mission.\"The beautiful woman behind him slowly stood up, looking down at the blazing flame in her hands.The flames gathered on her hands, forming a silent skull, exuding the heavy darkness of death.The beautiful woman looked at the skull in her hand for a while \"It\u2019s so troublesome having to hide my identity\"As she closed her palm, the flame also disappeared without a trace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is there to watch?\"The woman was silent for a moment and answered: \"That boy was a bit strange, I want to take another look\"The sunglasses man swiftly got the surveillance footage and started showing it from the beginning.\"Stop\" the woman saidAs the sunglasses man press the pause button, the image stops.This was the last moment of the battle, the split second that Gu Qing Shan used his full spirit energy to infuse the arrow.\"Look\" the woman narrowed her eyes, pointing at the arrowhead \"The air is always sensitive, any force that makes contact with the air will make it react.\"The sunglasses man carefully looked, barely seeing on the arrowhead, two transparent ripples are formed on both sides.He shook his head and said: \"I\u2019ve never seen such a thing before, is it another unknown super power?\"\"Very interesting, although this power looks weak, it gives me a unique feeling\" the beautiful woman stares at the screen \"we have to find a way to get in touch with this poor student\"The long night finally ended.Cheng Nan, a high-class residential district.\"You don't want to avenge your companion?\" Gu Qing Shan looked at the thug with a smile that\u2019s not smiling.Wang Ming the thug shook his head and said: \"We were all people lured by the reward money, working together was temporary, before that I didn't know any of them\"Wang Ming threw him a bunch of keys and said: \"You spared my life, but the only thing I can do for you is give you a secret place like this to rest. After all, the Nie family is too powerful\"Gu Qing Shan took the keys, looked at the man in front of him unexpectedly and said: \"Thank you for your kindness, then I will leave first\"Wang Ming was a bit confused, quickly asked: \"Leave to go where?\"\"To work\"\"To work?\" Wang Ming couldn\u2019t catch up with the conversation.\"Well, you have to work to earn money, to have food to eat, plus I heard there\u2019s all sorts of things in university that require you to spend money\" Gu Qing Shan seriously replied.As a civilian without any backers, wanting to go to a State-sanctioned university, not only is the tuition very high, but they also require a certain amount of Merit.Plus his elective major is Mech Study, whose tuition cost is several times that of other majors.Gu Qing Shan have took on several jobs to make money, at the same time accumulated a large amount of personal Merit to prepare for future education necessities.Wang Ming seriously wondered if his ears have gone bad and he actually heard wrong.This boy in front of him, capable of killing 5 hitmen in one breath. Even a Martial Masters got completely manipulated into a trap and died, falling from the 22nd floor and turned into mush.---- A person like that, still have to work an actual job to earn money to maintain their livelihood?

Nie family already failed once, so they likely will not move against me again without absolute confidence. But you are different. You\u2019re just a hitman that can\u2019t show himself in public. If you don't leave you could die at any time\"Gu Qing Shan continued: \"You\u2019re more suited to making friends and doing business, not this cold-blooded career of a hitman. If you stay here, even if you don't get killed by Nie family, you will still one day be killed by someone else\"Wang Ming stood silent for a long while, then said: \"Then I am leaving now, we\u2019ll meet again if fate allows it\"Swift decision without any hesitation or back and forth, this person's personality is not bad.Gu Qing Shan nodded, silently complimented him and left the room.Half an hour later, he arrived at a sky-high technology building.Swiping his card as normal and entered the building, swiped again to enter the underground facilities.After the iris certification and fingerprint authentication, changing into work clothes, he received his work ID card, headed into the elevator and went directly to the underground 50th floor.As the elevator door opens, a familiar electronic sound is heard.\"Chang Ning Steel Mech R &amp; D Department welcomes you, No. 41157.\"Gu Qing Shan swiftly walked in.Across from him, there were several 5-meter-high Steel Mech armors, many people in overalls were busy working on the mechs and discussing between themselves.This is the largest Mecha-based R&amp;D center in Chang Ning, and the core industry of Chang Ning\u2019s Su family. Even if they are Su family members, without expertise in this area, they will also be refused entry.Gu Qing Shan looked at the cold fighting machines, feeling a sense of excitement in his heart.This is the product of human civilization, the crystallization of science and technology born from the crossing of countless frontier sciences, and representing this world\u2019s most powerful fighting force.Shuttles and helicopters, in front of the War Mechs cast from steel are simply too dull to even look at.These fantastic ice-cold machinery have an irresistible appeal to every man alive.\"No. 41157, application for research.\" Gu Qing Shan said.\"Please describe the content of your work, so your Holo-brain can be registered\"\"Power control of electro-hydraulic drive of No. 2 machine\"\"No. 41157, your application has been approved, the time is six days, your accommodation room is 4009, please pay attention to eating on time, work and rest appropriately to ensure good health.\"\"Thank you \"Gu Qing Shan can finally relaxAs expected, he can stay here for six days in a row. If the project is completed well enough, there will also be corresponding rewards.This place is absolutely safe, unless Fuxi Republic suddenly comes to invade the Confederate, and the whole of Chang Ning County goes under siege.Nie family\u2019s hands could not reach even here.Six days later is already the university entrance examination.After finishing the exams, I can freely flee to wherever I want.As for now, let's fully concentrate on studying Mechs with absolute peace of mind!Gu Qing Shan, almost leaping with his steps, couldn\u2019t wait anymore and went straight to a mechanical armor.In the past life, I\u2019ve made quite a few good things too. In addition, humanity kept on advancing technology for more than 10 years, I also never stopped my research on Mechs. With so many years of constant study and research, my current expertise probably far exceeds this era.The facilities here are so good, some previous research ideas can probably be verified.Outside the Chang Ning Steel Mech Company, on top of another tall building.The sunglasses man stood at the highest point, opened the communicator and reluctantly reported the matters concerning Gu Qing Shan.\"You mean, he\u2019s also a serious Mech researcher?\"The cold female voice came from the communicator, accompanied by the sound of a tapping keyboard.\"Yes, your Highness, the security here is very strict. Even if I risk exposing my ability, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to bring him out. Worst case we might even risk a war\"\"That\u2019s ok, come back, no need to go through so much trouble, we can use the formal method\" the female voice said, contemplating.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018the formal method\u2019?\u201dThe sunglasses man cautiously asked.He can\u2019t help being so careful. The last time she said that, the formal method used was to declare war. Thinking about what transpired afterwards at that time, the sunglasses man still shakes in fear.\"You can rest assured, I am going to declare an official visit, that way I won't have to use a fake identity\"The sunglasses man was relieved, asked again: \"What about our mission?\"\"What mission?\"\"Taking some of the top talents from the Confederate, Your Highness.\"\"That\u2019s that we are doing\"Sunglasses man\u2019s face shows disbelief and said: \"This kid, can be regarded as top talent?\"On the other side of the communicator, the woman whose beauty knows no equal was quickly operating two virtual light screens as she answered: \"I\u2019ve calculated, his unknown ability increased the kinetic energy of the arrow by quite the amazing amount. In addition, you should take a look at the paper he published in the Federal Science and Technology Magazine regarding Mechs simulating human behavior.\"The woman stared at the information on the light screens, gently licking her lips, her face showed a hint of excitement, looking like a cat who was about to catch her favorite fish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Get the tools, we\u2019re bringing the demon beast back to the military camp\"Zhao Lu seemingly a bit more courageous, looked at the monster again and said happily: \"Motherfucker, this big one is enough for us to eat for a month.\"Gu Qing Shan nodded, his heart a bit more settled.Demon beast meat contains ample blood energy, even an ordinary person who eats it will be able to strengthen the bones and muscles, increasing strength.His wounds were only healed with two Healing pills, as soon as he returned to Reality, he fought two battles in a row. The second one was even against a Martial Master, almost completely exhausting all his mental power and strength.At this moment, Gu Qing Shan can detect the faint pain in his body.The wounds that just healed, once again showing signs of reopening.In this situation, if you can keep eating demon beast meat and rest for a while, it will benefit the body greatly.Zhao Lu quickly ran into the kitchen and taking out a large net bag, long rope, boning knife and other tools.The two were ready to go outside the outpost.Gu Qing Shan asked while walking: \"Why didn't you bury the dead people in front of the camp? In the end, they were all comrades\"Zhao Liu complained: \"Before, the Commander simply didn\u2019t care, what can a cook like me do? If I left the outpost alone to dig, if I happen to run into some sort of monster, I\u2019ll die for sure\"Gu Qing Shan patted him on the shoulder and said: \"When the monster is brought in, go with me to bury the dead.\"Zhao Lu hesitated, not saying anything.Gu Qing Shan said again: \"The putrid smell of blood from the dead pit is too strong. If it attracts a powerful demon that can see through the Invisibility formation of the outpost, you and I both will end up dead\"\"That is,--- fine!\"Zhao Lu thought about the scene, finally gritted his teeth and answered.The two walked to the gate of the military camp, Zhao Lu already half a step out of the outpost, but suddenly, Gu Qing Shan pulled his collar back, which made almost him fall down face-first.Zhao Liu annoyed: \"Brother Gu, what are you doing?\"Gu Qing Shan raised his hand and made a gesture of silence.Zhao Lu still wanted to complain, but seeing Gu Qing Shan's face full of seriousness, his heart sank and didn\u2019t say anything more.He stood up and lowered his voice and asked, \"What happened?\"Gu Qing Shan pointed to the otter outside the camp.After several days of heavy rain, a disc-sized puddle was formed on the ground.Right now, the rain suddenly stopped, but the ripples on the puddles continued, as if something was disturbing it from underneath.Gu Qing Shan pulled Zhao Lu and retreated 7-8 steps backwards.It\u2019s still silent outside the outpost.After a few more moments, the water in the puddle returned to calm.Zhao Lu held his breath and waited for a long time without seeing any movements. Right then, he breathed a sigh of relief, smiled wanting to speak.But he didn\u2019t say anything.Because Gu Qing Shan covered his mouth, immediately retreated a few dozens more meters, stopping all the way back at the other end of the outpostGu Qing Shan pressed him into the mud, himself also laid down and smeared black mud all over his body.A few days of rain have already softened the soil, Gu Qing Shan only need to grab to get a handful, while smearing it over himself, he also gestured to Zhao Lu to do the same.Although Zhao Lu is a kitchen staff, many daily chores are done by him alone, but after all, he has not been through this kind of suffering, so he can't help but want to stand up.He arched his back to stand up, but suddenly fell down in the black mud again \u2013 this time his whole body was covered with muddy water, no need to be smeared on anymore.Zhao Lu planted his hands on the ground, only to feel the ground shaking, he himself cannot do anything, not even stand up.The earth is shaking violently.Zhao Lu\u2019s horrified, opened his mouth to scream only to once again fall into the mud.Is the earth dragon turning over?Zhao Lu looked at Gu Qing Shan full of questions, but he only saw him looking at the direction of the dead pit, still fully concentrating.Zhao Lu followed Gu Qing Shan's gaze only to see an unforgettable scene.A foot.A giant foot so big it fills his entire line of sight, and is several times larger than the entire military outpost.As this foot stepped on a dense forest outside the outpost, all the trees were razed to the ground.Looking up the foot, the thick leg extends deep into the dark clouds, his eyes unable to see the end.Zhao Lu is stunned looking at this scene. Only then did he understand that there was no earth dragon to turn its body, it was simply this foot stepping on the ground, and the impact caused the earth to shake.Then, an even more insane scene unfolds.Note:-Huang Quan: literally \u201cgolden river\u201d, the equivalent of River Styx in Chinese mythology. It\u2019s more commonly used to refer to hell itself, rather than the actual river in hell which have a different name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In just a few steps, they already left the sight of Gu Qing Shan and Zhao Lu.Zhao Lu baffled, asked: \u201cWhat kind of monster was that...\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s heart sinks all the way to the bottom, muttering: \u201cSo even it already appeared...\u201dZhao Lu kept repeating himself: \u201cWhat monster was that... What kind of monster was that\u2026?\u201dGu Qing Shan ignored him, thinking silently.The Faceless Giant, an extremely rare demon, a powerful chaotic species.The Faceless Giant doesn\u2019t usually come out. Only when the demon army has encircled a humanity stronghold for too long, will it receive the order to attack and break the stalemate.From the memory of his past life, this is still the last year of peace, the first wave of demon invasion had only just begun, why did a powerhouse like Faceless Giant appear already?This was only the first all-out war between humanity and demon, one that took a whole year to reach a conclusion, Gu Qing Shan remembers this very clearly.In the final battle of this year-long war, hundreds of millions of players wasn\u2019t able to take down the Faceless Giant, and could only watch helplessly as the Faceless Giant destroyed the border town.At that time, the players have only just entered the game for half a year, both their level and gear were very unremarkable. The appearance of the Faceless Giant brought a deep sense of powerlessness to all players.In the end, it was a plot character called the first Immortal King, that finally defeated this demon.But at that time, the border town was already destroyed, human troops were already defeated and scattered, so they had to retreat from the map, giving up a large area of rich land as a buffer.In the first campaign, humanity was beaten into retreat just like that.However! However!Right now is still only the last year of peace, the war had only just begun, both humanity and demon kind were still testing out one another.For the Faceless Giant to appear at this time, the plot isn\u2019t right.Unless something that Gu Qing Shan doesn't know about happened.Gu Qing Shan felt a shroud of mist in his mind, himself unable to tear it open to see the truth.Zhao Lu\u2019s eyes are still dull, still repeating the same sentence.\"What kind of monster was that...\"Gu Qing Shan struck the back of Zhao Lu\u2019s neck and let him faint.Zhao Lu was stimulated too intensely, his mind already going haywire. It\u2019s better for him to take a break.The first time seeing a monster like the Faceless Giant, even players were deeply shocked. Not to mention, this is a real world and not at all a game, and Zhao Lu is just an ordinary person, suddenly seeing such a demon, he could very well have been scared mindless.Gu Qing Shan took Zhao Lu into the barracks, threw him on a marching bed, and turned back to the outpost gates.Since the Faceless Giant appeared, maybe its accompanying units will as well.Not even 15 minutes later, a demon squad showed itself.With a single horn on its head, the Grey Flame Serpent slithers across the forest, moving so quick that it was almost unseen, only leaving a burning trace on the ground.On its back, a humanoid monster sat, wearing gray heavy armor, both hands and feet made of claws, no facial features, only a big bloody mouth that splits open all the way to the back of the head.Mad Bloodthirster.If it is ever allowed to breach into the human army line, it can cause a small massacre.After the first Grey Flame Serpent appeared, more quickly followed, on the back of each of them sat a Bloodthirster.One, two, three... a total of twenty.Gu Qing Shan held his breath and stood inside the outpost, silently counting.The demon squad quickly swept past the outpost, chasing in the direction of the Faceless Giant, disappearing into the jungle.Through all that, the outpost was not discovered, which was really fortunate.But Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t feel any joy.Grey Flame Serpent is the king of assassination within demon beasts, their action silent, as well as being able to use Fire of the 5 Elementals by birth, extremely difficult opponents to deal with.Not to mention the Bloodthirsters demons that are controlling them.The general of this outpost was killed at the hands of a few of those Bloodthirsters.In the military, there is an unwritten rule, if the soldiers encounter a Bloodthirster demon while doing their mission, they can immediately give up the task without being punished by their superiors. Because only the generals can fight against this kind of demon.20 Grey Flame Serpents and 20 Bloodthirster can launch a devastating surprise attack on any army.Yet they\u2019re all follow the pace of the Faceless Giant, quietly moving.This is a big deal.Just as Gu Qing Shan was thinking that, suddenly he noticed a small bird perched on the tree branches outside the outpost.This bird has a human face, only looking to rest on the branch for a short time, and would then chase after the Faceless Giant again.\"So tired, so tired, go catch up!\"The strange man-faced bird complained.It spreads its wings, shakes off the blood on its body, using its short beak to tend to a long wound under its wings.The wound is very deep, blood still dripping out from time to time.Gu Qing Shan stared at the wound of the strange bird, after thinking for only a moment, raised his bow and pulled the strings.Rapid Fire!3 arrows in a row, followed by 6, and finally 12, cutting off all escape routes.Shooting these 21 arrows in one breath, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands are shaking even with his \"Stable\" skill.In that moment, Gu Qing Shan fully used all his power.Once you\u2019ve decided to act, you can\u2019t give the enemy any chance to live. Otherwise, this kind of intelligent bird monster will definitely alert the demon army.The sharp arrows turned into killer shadows, flying out of the outpost and straight at the strange bird.The first three arrows, only one of them hit the strange bird, forcing it to struggle to fly up, its two wings quickly rose and dodged the next six arrows, but ended completely surrounded by the twelve final arrows, turning into a sieve.\"Soul Points +2, current Soul Point 3/5\"\"You have mastered the skill \"Stable\", successfully broke through in battle, the skill is upgraded to: Solid\"A warm feeling flowed into his arms, not going away for a while after.A Growth Skill?Gu Qing Shan was mildly surprised, immediately took out an arrow, put it on the bowstrings and pulled.His arms were completely still, not even a slight tremble.Gu Qing Shan tried moving, running, and even rushed forward and backward, but no matter what he did, it didn\u2019t affect the stillness of his aim.His hands are steady, as if this was the correct and only aiming posture since ancient times.A great skill!Putting down the bow and arrow, Gu Qing Shan evaluated what he found out just now.It wasn\u2019t a legendary Growth Skill, but an evolution of a common skill.But that\u2019s still very good.\u201cStable\u201d is a primary skill, \u201cSolid\u201d is a slightly more powerful primary skill. War God Skills is able to transform a primary skill into another, more powerful skill, this ability really is full of surprises.The skill \"Solid\" at first glance seems to only increase the stability of his actions, but the practical effect of it is great.From now on, even if Gu Qing Shan is moving quickly in combat, his hands will not tremble even a little, giving him the ability to keep pressing his attack under various combat situations.In the face of a powerful monster with slow movement, he can employ a hit-and-run tactic, without worrying about his shooting action being messed up during violent, quick movements.Gu Qing Shan put away the bow, went out to drag the demon bird back into the outpost, made a fire and threw it in.No matter how strange and mysterious a demon is, after being burned to ash it will no longer be any trouble.\"Huh? What is this?\"Gu Qing Shan checked the ash after the flame burned out, mildly surprised.What he saw was a blood-color jade piece, lying in the ashes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When flying in full force, that bird can move as quick as lightning. If it wasn\u2019t already seriously injured, Gu Qing Shan would definitely not be able to strike it down.Without the real-time information and commands from the strange bird, the demon hit squad will definitely deviate from the targets they are tracking.Gu Qing Shan looked a bit at the blood-color jade piece and put it into his inventory bag.Who could predict that he actually ruined the dispatch of the demon army completely by accident.The demon bird is dead, that should be able to give the Faceless Giant and Bloodthirster some trouble for a while.My own cultivation is still too low, so I can only contribute so much, Gu Qing Shan sighs.This can\u2019t go on, I have to change my situation as soon as possible.Power, I need power!At this moment, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes are full of determination and desire.Washing off the black mud, he went to check on Zhao Lu, only to see that he\u2019s still passed out. Gu Qing Shan replenish his arrows, strap the military bow to his back, and left the outpost.It wasn\u2019t until evening that Gu Qing Shan dragged a demon beast back to the outpost.He didn't actually go too far, but because his cultivation was too low, he had to employ all of his hiding skills, went around the outpost\u2019s perimeter, dodging a few fierce demon beasts\u2019 sights, finally able to hunt a few low-level smaller beasts.These monsters are ranked the lowest of the low, suitable for the first few stages of qi training to take on.With the measly strength he has as a qi training stage 2 cultivator, it took all the arrows in the quiver, as well as adding some more wounds to his body for him to manage to kill a few.This can\u2019t be helped. In the past life, players that wanted to hunt demon beast at the start of the game also had to form large teams, using all their strength just to take down a single one.And even though it\u2019s called a smaller beast, it still easily weigh three or four hundred pounds, extremely hard for a normal person to even budge, let alone carry.The storage bag has limited space, and in order to keep his mobility, Gu Qing Shan only took one of them back.He just left the rest of them there on the spot.The jungle is always dangerous, the heavy bloody smell on the corpses of demon beast will quickly attract many predators.The War God System also seem to treat hunting low-level beasts with scorn, as a whole day of hunting only gave Gu Qing Shan a total of 1 Soul Point.He only has a total of 4 Soul Points right now, but his Experience value isn\u2019t quite as bad, having already reached 10 points.Meaning he can level up again.The smaller beast that was dragged back should be enough for him and Zhao Lu to eat for a while.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that there isn\u2019t enough Spirit Stone to maintain the Invisibility formation, they could stay for at least a dozen more days.When Gu Qing Shan returned to the outpost, Zhao Lu was already awake.Zhao Lu stood at the gate with a desperate look on his face, only when he saw Gu Qing Shan and the body of the smaller beast behind him did vitality returned to his face.Zhao Lu bowed his waist, staring straight at the smaller beast, almost unable to move his eyes.He said: \"Brother Gu, thank you for before, you can go rest, I\u2019ll deal with this beast, guaranteed you\u2019ll be satisfied with the meal tonight\"\"Take it\"Gu Qing Shan left the beast there, returned to the room, sat in a meditation position and closed his eyes.\"Current Experience points: 10/10. Do you want to level up?\"\"Yes\"With Gu Qing Shan's choice confirmed, his body's blood essence quickly rose, as well as his spirit energy also rising, but inside him a checkpoint was blocking the spirit energy flow, not letting them pass.Being able to sense the presence of the checkpoint means that the time to break through it is ripe.This is an opportunity to break through to the next level!Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body naturally went into a state of breakthrough.Fuu!Breathing out the blocked gas, Gu Qing Shan felt a wave of pleasure washing through his body.Success, he finally broke through to qi training stage 3!Gu Qing Shan immediately recollects the spirit energy, carefully spreading it around his body meridians, slowly taking care of his body.He has too many minor injuries, so he can\u2019t be careless.While caring for his body with spirit energy, he looked at the UI\"Current Experience points: 0/15.\"To level up again, he needs to go out and hunt again.Gu Qing Shan can only feel an unprecedented sense of urgency in his heart.The Faceless Giant is equal to a high-tier Rejuvenation-rank cultivator in strength, an existence that Gu Qing Shan can only look up to right now.With the strength of the Faceless Giant, the outpost should already be discovered, but since there are only two weak ants in the outpost, it simply couldn\u2019t be bothered to do anything.This feeling of your own life and death being in the hands of a demon, doesn\u2019t feel good at all.Gu Qing Shan walked back and forth for a bit and made up his mind.This won\u2019t do, I have to keep grinding to level up and rush to the rank of Foundation Establishment.From Qi Training to Foundation Establishment, from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core, pretty much at every major rank-up, there is a chance to gain a superpower, of course having a chance means you can also fail and gain nothing.There are four types of superpowers in this world, all of them exactly the same as Reality. They are in order: Martial Art, 5-Elemental Supernaturalist, God's Chosen, and Heaven\u2019s Descended.A Martial Art superpower stimulates the latent power in the body, and the power boost is nothing to laugh at. For Sword Cultivators and Body Cultivators, these are most suitable.5-Elemental Supernaturalist stimulates the spirituality of the body, which is used to open up the main 5-Elemental roots, or a Mutated Elemental root and enables their use in a fight.God's Chosen Skills have all sorts of shape and form, Gu Qing Shan himself knows only a few thousand of them.This kind of superpower is innate, completely depending on luck, it is impossible to predict, so no need to mention it here.As for Heaven Ascended, this is a title, specifically used to call people who have Divine Skills.The so-called Divine Skills are things that can flip the heaven and earth, perform incredible miracles, changing the common sense, to reverse the tide of fate, orchestrating the fall of the stars, causing the end of all things.Such skills are completely beyond the reach of ordinary players.Even in this other world, only the most powerful human cultivators have Divine Skills.Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t expect himself to awaken A God's Chosen Skill, not to mention Divine Skills, he doesn\u2019t even hope to open one of the 5-Elemental roots.He only wants to get a Martial Arts superpower to greatly increase his pure fighting strength.For the sake of his own life, he has to get a superpower!Gu Qing Shan is filled with a desire to be stronger, but is still very calm and collected, constantly using spirit energy to care for his injuries.His injuries is not yet healed, both his body and spirit are very tired, so he can\u2019t force himself to go out wrestling between life and death with demon beasts.Taking time to sharpen your blade won\u2019t dull your wood cutting skills, giving yourself time to rest is necessary. (TN: this idiom isn\u2019t translated that well, basically he\u2019s saying rushing things won\u2019t do you any good)About two hours later, Zhao Lu came.A whole table full of rich and juicy grilled demon beast meat, accompanied by light rice porridge.Gu Qing Shan and Zhao Lu had their fill, packed everything up appropriately and sat around the charcoal fire to talk.\u201cAre there any swords in the outpost?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.At qi training stage 3, you can slowly begin to practice the sword.A bow for ranged attacks and a sword for melee. This is Gu Qing Shan\u2019s vision of his way of fighting for this life.\"Sword?\" Zhao Lu shook his head. \"Only officers can carry a sword, but the officers in the outpost are already dead, their weapons were thrown in the dead pit together with them.\"---- The dead pit was swallowed whole by the Faceless Giant, not even a bit of slag is left.Gu Qing Shan could only sigh helplessly. Once he was a Sword Cultivator, yet after returning he hasn't even had a sword to touch, how laughable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

were empty, walking from start to end, all they saw was a half-broken machete on the final row.Gu Qing Shan furrowed his brows, checks around the wall again to find a hidden wall-sunken lock.Behind the sunken lock should be where the high rank officers keep high-grade items.This part is the same as in his past life.In the past life, whenever players find an abandoned cultivator stronghold, the first thing they do is to find leftover treasures, after a while, the methods and tricks were compiled into an actual science.Towards the later stages of the game, even a profession called treasure hunter was born.Gu Qing Shan looks a bit at the sunken lock and was sure.He said: \u201cThis place\u2019s sunken lock is relatively high-grade, probably only the commanding general had the keys\u201dZhao Lu a bit surprised, looking at the lock can\u2019t help but said: \u201cBut the general already died in battle\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cDo you know where his personal quarters are?\u201d\u201cI do\u201d\u201cCome, lets go check it out\u201dThe two of them searched the general\u2019s room for a while, finally it was Gu Qing Shan that found the key.Taking the key back to the reserve room, Gu Qing Shan opened the sunken lock, all that was inside was a small booklet and dirty-looking plateThe plate had numerous cracks, many of the inscriptions on it already started to fall off.\u201cA Formation Plate?\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s heart skipped a beat, quickly walked forward and picked it up.\u201cLow-level Formation Plate(damage), Psychedelic formation inscribed\u201d\u201cTo comprehend Psychedelic formation usage method, Soul Point cost: 17\u201d----17 Soul Points, much higher than the maximum amount Gu Qing Shan can have, basically impossible for him to learn right now.But Gu Qing Shan\u2019s focus isn\u2019t that.Flipping the plate around, Gu Qing Shan pressed a center crucial point on the plate, opening a compartment in it.Light-blue light droplets fell from the plate, scattering on the ground.Gu Qing Shan pressed another place on the plate, dropping even more light droplets.\u201cSpirit Stones!\u201dZhao Lu shouted in joy, immediately crouched down to pick them up.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart also relaxes a bit.Even though the Formation Plate was broken, the Spirit Stones placed for power were almost unused, even the spare Spirit Stone stored inside where untouched.It\u2019s likely that no one else but the commanding officer who died an unexpected death knew about this, and that\u2019s why these Spirit Stones still remain.What a pleasant surprise.After picking up all the Spirit Stones and counted, the total was a whopping 75 stones!This way, the Invisibility formation of the outpost can hold out for a couple dozen for days.Gu Qing Shan put the plate down, picking up the booklet and flipped through.\"Military qi training method\u201d\u201cFirst stage: Quchi\u201d\u201cSecond stage: Yinmen\u201d\u201cThird stage:

cost: 6\"This is the military cultivation method, the most common of all cultivation methods, incomparable to secret cultivation methods from big sects and clans.But this kind of cultivation method also has its advantages.First is that your foundation will be incredibly firm, aiding the breakthrough to Foundation Establishment realm, the second is that people who uses this cultivation method are everywhere, making it inconspicuous.This is like someone giving you a pillow just as you were feeling sleepy, but don\u2019t you usually use Experience Points to level up?How come Soul Points can be used as well?As Gu Qing Shan was thinking, his War God UI was already showing a shining line of text\u201cComplete cultivation method found, War God UI preparations complete\u201d\u201cFrom now on, the user can choose to use Soul Points instead of Experience Points to level up\u201d\u201cSoul Points have high exclusivity, once you used Soul Points, you cannot use Experience Points to level up anymore, please choose carefully\u201dTalk about flexible, as long as you have the method to, level up will be the same as comprehending skills, only requiring Soul Points.In that case, Soul Points just became much more important.Gu Qing Shan looks at his War God UI and contemplates.\u201cWhat exactly are Soul Points?\u201d he askedWar God UI responds: \u201cThe most fundamental power of all beings, the origin of the soul\u201d\u201cFundamental\u201d and \u201cOrigin\u201d those two words, are extremely rare in-game, always representing an extreme limit.This type of extreme power, must have its own characteristics.Gu Qing Shan began to seriously think about it.In later stages of the game, the amount of Experience Points needed for each level becomes an astronomical number, becoming invisible shackles for the large amount of players.But Soul Points seems to be a higher quality power, choosing Soul Points will naturally free him from the known shackles of Experience points, but what the road ahead is like becomes an unknown.However, thinking about the numerous players who can all be called prodigies. None of them could reach the highest peak of fighting strength in the other world until the very end. And Experience Points had to be the biggest culprit for that.He already had his chance to do things over, would he still need to walk on this failed path?But this is also a huge gamble.Gu Qing Shan finally decided and spoke with conviction: \u201cI choose to level up using Soul Points\u201d\u201cThe user has chosen Soul Points, going one step closer towards becoming War God, please keep working hard\u201dFollowing the cold System voice, the \u201cExperience points\u201d column on Gu Qing Shan\u2019s UI disappeared, leaving only \u201cSoul Points\u201d left.Gu Qing Shan silently stared at his UI, tucking the booklet into his chest.As the two people left the reserve room to go back to the barracks, Zhao Lu couldn\u2019t stop smiling.Separating, each of them return to their own room, Gu Qing Shan closed the door, sat down on the bed, leaving the military qi training method booklet on his knee.Gu Qing Shan already passed the first 3 ranks of Quchi, Yinmen, Shaoshang, so he went ahead and took a look at the 4th and 5th ranks.Already having a cultivation guide book, to increase his strength, to increase the maximum Soul Points, this is his best choice.Gu Qing Shan isn\u2019t an indecisive person, already made his choice, he said.\u201cI choose to comprehend \u201cthe 4th stage: Taiyin\u2019 breakthrough method\u201d\u201cComprehension began, consumed 2 Soul Points, current Soul Points: 2/5\u201dHeat flows from the booklet into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s Thought Sea.In only one breath, the spirit energy guiding method, the breathing rhythm required to breakthrough the checkpoint, the method to circulate blood essence, all deeply imprinted in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind.Gu Qing Shan closes his eyes, silently guided his spirit energy, attacking the checkpoint in his body.It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s already a stage 4 cultivator, only revisiting this process again.The military qi training method is simple and rough, but there\u2019s absolutely no mistakes or omissions, ensuring safe cultivation.His spirit energy gathers at the checkpoint, suddenly contracts, and then expand, easily breaking through his \u2018Taiyin\u2019Gu Qing Shan checks himself, seeing the spirit energy slowly turning in his Dantian already became one size bigger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)\"Precision\" can improve the hit rate and accuracy, a must-have skill, but \"Swallows Fly Twice\" is obviously a powerful Archery attack skill.For a player, no matter how high your level is, without a strong attack skill, you can't even make use of your vast spirit energy.Therefore, \"Swallows Fly Twice\u201d is more important.Gu Qing Shan silently thought to himself, stood up only to feel an overflowing sense of power in this body, enough to even punch through the earth.This is an illusion brought from breaking through too quickly, and having this feeling shows that his foundation has become somewhat unstable.That\u2019s obvious, breaking through two stages in a row is rare even in the cultivator world.Gu Qing Shan practiced a set of common military fist-fighting skill in his room, feeling no effect, he simply took the military bow and quiver, getting ready to leave.As he passed through Zhao Lu\u2019s room, he could hear a loud snoring noise, seems like Zhao Lu finally got a good night\u2019s sleep.Gu Qing Shan kept walking, soon leaving the outpost and disappeared into the night.He\u2019s going to hunt some of the stronger monsters, both to consolidate his cultivation while struggling between life and death and to farm some Soul Points.The jungle.A brown-gray large serpent fell from the tree, its thick body slamming on the ground and made a loud bang.The serpent is the hunter at the top of this jungle\u2019s food chain, having never failed a hunt.Even demon beasts that are stronger than it, after struggling for a while would still fall to its venomous fangs, becoming food in its belly.When hunting, this serpent monster has never felt impatience.But today, it has met an acute hunter.Only a few minutes after the battle began, both its eyes were shot blind, its 7-inch thick body was riddled with sharp arrows. Despite using all its strength, it couldn\u2019t deal any significant damage to the enemy.The serpent monster breathed its last, full of unwillingness.\"Soul Points +5, Current Soul Points 7/7.\"Gu Qing Shan came out from the shadow behind the branches, looking at the monster in front of him.He went here once when he was still qi training stage 2, got chased by this serpent for more than 10 miles and had to use everything just to escape.This time he\u2019s at qi training stage 5, his strength was more than doubled that of before, so he came back to kill it.Among the common monsters, serpent and snake-types are relatively rare, there probably isn\u2019t even a second one in this whole forest.The snake-type monsters whole body is a treasure trove, snake livers are an antidote for most poisons as well as being able to treat heavy wounds; snake blood can strengthen the five senses; snake meat when eaten can strengthen the body, snake teeth are great material for daggers and arrows.This serpent monster has probably lived for over a hundred years, so its material will most likely be quite exceptional.Gu Qing Shan took out a dagger, stabbed into the serpent\u2019s body and starts dissecting it.Two snake livers as big as a newborn baby rolled out, caught by Gu Qing Shan.The snake's liver is crystal clear, emitting a dull milky white shimmer.This is definitely high-grade material, because of its rarity and efficacy, even in the cultivation world these things can only be found and never asked for. (2)Gu Qing Shan carefully put away one of them, picked up the other and finished eating in just 2-3 mouthfuls.Just a few moments later, the wounds on his body already starts to itch.Gu Qing Shan was pleasantly surprisedI didn't expect it to work so quickly. Monster serpent\u2019s bile inside the liver can dissolve poison inside the body, as well as stimulating life force to close up wounds.At this speed, in just about 1-2 hours all his injuries will have healed.Gu Qing Shan went on to remove the snake teeth.This place is too far away, furthermore right now being night, the time when demon beasts are out to hunt, wanting to bring this back to the outpost alone is like talking in your sleep.Gu Qing Shan can only seize the time and choose the most useful parts to take.Both the liver and teeth are stashed away, and Gu Qing Shan took out his marching water bag, dumping the water out and filling it with snake blood.He tried to take a sip and is met with a disgusting taste.Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth, swallowed and closed the lid.Can\u2019t drink too much of this stuff, qi training stage cultivators can\u2019t handle it.After collecting all useful materials from the serpent monster, next is the real reason he came here.This serpent monster was the most difficult to tonight, giving him 5 Soul Points at once, plus a few that were killed before, now it is finally the time for his harvest.Gu Qing Shan took a deep breath, looking at the War God UI: \"Consume 6 Soul Points to comprehend Swallows Fly Twice\"\"Swallows Fly Twice comprehension complete, Current Soul Points: 1/7.\"Heat flows from the military bow into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s arm, spreading over this body.A variety of techniques: power control, spirit energy operation, hand movements, grasping the wind and distance, one after another appeared in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind.After the heat circulated twice around Gu Qing Shan's body, it flowed into this Thought Sea and gradually dissipate.It took so much work, but finally he learnt this powerful skill.Note:(1): \u201ceyes are still there\u201d: a common saying in chinese is \u201cthe higher you stand, the higher your eyes become\u201d, it\u2019s commonly used to describe how your view changes as you mature. Here it is used to say that his ability to discern good items is still there(2): \u201ccan only be found, but not asked for\u201d: an idiom in chinese, meaning something rare enough that you won\u2019t find it by asking around, but isn\u2019t very rare enough since you can sometimes find it randomly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

user is advised to train it more in order to raise its level as soon as possible\u201dThat\u2019s right, a regular skill\u2019s strength is dependent only on how much spirit energy is put into it, its output changes depending on how much spirit energy is used.But Growth Skills are different.A unique aspect of all Growth Skills is that, as a player train his Skill works more and more, its own power will also rise, all the way until heaven.These types of skills are so rare you can only pray and hope to get one.At later stages of the game, when Growth Skills have already reached a certain peak, some of them even started to be praised as \u201cSemi-Divine Skills\u201d.Anyone with a Growth Skill becomes a person for people to look up to in envy.Gu Qing Shan breaths in and solemnly raises his bow.Shifting Flurry!Pew pew pew pew pew, five consecutive sounds, five shadows quickly flew, just like a chaotic dance of snakes and dragons!Every arrow seems to be alive, drawing different arcs across the air, dodging every obstacle, finally hitting the same branch more than 200 meters away.Gu Qing Shan is completely stunned, stunned by his own Skill.After a while, he suddenly remembered something and asked: \u201cSystem, can I keep combining regular skills to make Growth Skills?\u201dThe War God UI is silent for a bit, then suddenly a line of text:\u201cComprehending others\u2019 skills is just an initial function, helping the user to constantly create more Growth Skills, that is the true purpose of War God Skills\u201dGu Qing Shan sighs, mumbling to himself: \u201cSo I was wrong this whole time, so this is the true value of War God Skills\u201dLooking at the row of buttons at the bottom of his War God UI, only \u201cWar God Skills\u201d is active right now.But this one function has already given him so much to be surprised about.If one day, all of my skills are Growth Skills\u2026Simply terrifying.Gu Qing Shan tightly grips the military bow, suddenly gaining greater a sense of confidence.Growth Skills and Soul Points, both of these are very unique things.Using Soul Points to increase his level and skills is already much more cost effective compared to using Experience points.At least in the short run, through the use of \u201cmilitary qi training method\u201d, the amount of Soul Points required for every level is still trivial.Gu Qing Shan can just use Soul Points to level up instead of being like the players in his past life, having to struggle and collect each and every bit of Experience point possible.At later stages of the game, every level requires a terrifying amount of Experience Points, greatly slowing down how quickly a player can increase their own fighting strength.Aside from that, there\u2019s also the War God UI, letting him create Growth Skills by himself.Gu Qing Shan suddenly had a feeling, he can definitely go much further now compared to his past life.Since his unexpected return to the past, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart was always under a constant pressure and a sense of urgency.This is a lost age, a part of history where players didn\u2019t exist.Since his return, he could see strange things that was different from his past life everywhere, many things that he didn\u2019t know about before are now quietly happening.Even the near-invincible chaotic species Faceless Giant already appeared.Gu Qing Shan could almost feel the grip of death inching closer and closer.This type of intuition is instinctive, having saved his life in the past numerous times.For the sake of the present, he has to desperately get stronger, so that in a future not far from now, at the time that death comes, he\u2019ll be able to find that one chance of survival.Gu Qing Shan sighs again, glancing at the War God UI to look at his skill column.Right now, on the skill column there are 3 skills \u201cSolid\u201d, \u201cRapid Fire\u201d, \u201cShifting Flurry (primary)\u201d.Swallows Fly Twice is already gone, completely replaced by Shifting Flurry.Unlike the first 3 Skills he got, \u201cShifting Flurry\u201d requires more spirit energy to control the arrows\u2019 flight, as well as having a \u201cprimary\u201d ranking.This is nothing surprising, stronger Skills naturally require more spirit energy.After this, I\u2019ll have to spend quite a bit of time to train this Skill, quickly raising \u201cShifting Flurry\u201d skill rank.Gu Qing Shan quickly packed up and prepared to leave.Not far from here, demon beasts seem to have already caught the bloody smell of the serpent\u2019s corpse, their roaring getting closer.Pfft!Without any warning, he suddenly coughed up black blood.Gu Qing Shan was shocked, but couldn\u2019t help himself and coughed up blood two more times.Wiping the blood off his mouth, Gu Qing Shan tried smelling it.A faint foul smell.This is poison.Why was there suddenly poison in his body? And why did it get forced out?Gu Qing Shan immediately became cautious, circulating spirit energy around his body to carefully examine himself.There was nothing wrong with his body, in fact, thanks to the snake liver\u2019s nutrition, you could say it\u2019s been rejuvenated.Even the spirit energy inside his Dantian became more fluid, more natural.This is thanks to the rare snake demon liver.He was fortunate.It seems that he unknowingly got poisoned by the serpent demon during the fight from before.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but sigh.The serpent really wasn\u2019t as simple as he thought, being able to poison him without him knowing.If the fight had dragged on any longer, it\u2019s hard to say who would be killed first.Luckily I didn\u2019t want the fight to drag on so I finished it off as quickly as possible.If he didn\u2019t kill it so quickly, if he didn\u2019t eat its liver right away, if the poison hadn\u2019t been revealed so quickly, who knows what would\u2019ve happenedEvidently, these kinds of rare demon beasts all have one or two aces hidden.Gu Qing Shan felt a little bit of fear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of good news?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.Su Xue Er breaths in deeply and spoke every word clearly: \u201cI got picked early by Capital University, I don\u2019t need to take the entrance examinations anymore, I can immediately go and be accepted!\u201dGu Qing Shan was affected by her bright smile, also excitedly replied: \u201cCapital University is the best University in the Confederate, congratulations\u201dSuddenly, Su Xue Er showed a slight pout: \u201cSadly, my family already arranged everything, they told me to leave for the capital right away, so tonight I can\u2019t visit your stall for grilled meat as promised\u201dGu Qing Shan lightly laughed: \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to worry about, when you come back I\u2019ll gladly make some for you any time\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, he continued: \u201cWhen you\u2019re officially 18 and can legally drink alcohol, I\u2019ll personally mix a cocktail for you ----you should consider yourself lucky, a normal person wouldn\u2019t be able to taste my drink even if they want to\u201dTo Gu Qing Shan, what he\u2019s saying is obvious, due to the influence of an acquaintance from his past life, whenever he has time with nothing to do, he would make some food, mix a few cocktails, treat himself to a nice evening of relaxation.The amount of effort he spent on researching cocktail and liquor far exceeds first-rate standard, during his later years he even started to use the other world\u2019s materials to brew his own liquors that have health benefits.Many strong people wanted to be his friend or companion, not because of his status as war supreme commander, but purely for the addictively delicious drinks that he crafted.But when Su Xue Er heard the word \u201calcohol\u201d, her face suddenly reddened and spoke with a low voice: \u201cQing Shan ge, do your best on the examinations, I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the capital\u201dTowards the end, her voice almost became too small to hear.But to Gu Qing Shan, a qi training stage 5 cultivator, he\u2019s capable of picking up even the smallest vibration in the air, not to mention such a soft and clear voice.Gu Qing Shan being a returner who lived two lives, how could he not notice the slight romantic feelings behind those words.He was surprised, as well as a bit unexpected ----we were just talking about eating and drinking, why did the conversation suddenly shift to that direction?Of course, facing the romantic feelings from Su Xue Er, his heart couldn\u2019t help but beat a bit faster.Just as Gu Qing Shan wanted to ask about it, he saw Su Xue Er avoiding his gaze, doesn\u2019t even dare to look at him and just used her hands to turn the phone off.So embarrassing, I can\u2019t believe I just said that!! Su Xue Er felt her mind going a bit erratic.Before when Gu Qing Shan wanted to confess to her in front of the whole school, it actually made her very sad and hurt, because she simply couldn\u2019t accept his feelings.If she was to accept Gu Qing Shan\u2019s confession in front of everyone, not only will the adults in her family not accept it, but even the useless aristocrat of other clans will also secretly be out for Gu Qing Shan.That isn\u2019t something Su Xue Er wanted to see.Who knows all that was just a misunderstanding, and it was someone else acting behind the scenes.At the prom night, Gu Qing Shan stay level-headed and dealt with everything well, bringing the case to an almost perfect close.Su Xue Er was able to relax herself, thus seeing Gu Qing Shan in an even better light.Which resulted in her actively contacting him today.On the other side, Gu Qing Shan just stared at the air absentmindedly for a while, only until his phone vibrate from getting a notification did he finally pull himself together.A message from Su Xue Er.\u201cQing Shan ge, do you remember your previous birthday gift?\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled a little, speaking into his phone: \u201cAt the time, you gave me a whole box of stars. You spent more than a week folding paper to make it, all 10 of your fingers had blisters, hurting so bad that you couldn\u2019t even pick up a pen, when you couldn\u2019t finish the test on time because of the pain, you were so worried that you cried\u201dHe spoke with warmth in his heart: \u201cDoing such a dumb thing, how could I forget?\u201d\u201cHmmph, you no-good bully, next week is my birthday so I want a birthday present!\u201dGu Qing Shan closed his eyes and thought for a while, finally replied: \u201cSure\u201dThe good memories of the past once again resurfacing, close enough to almost touch, Gu Qing Shan had to admit, he wasn\u2019t ready for it.\u201cTruly, they really are a good memories, hah\u201dGu Qing Shan mumbled to himself, but already decided.He left the lodging room, walked directly to the elevator and press the number 99th floor button.The elevator went straight up, all the way to Chang Ning Steel Mech building\u2019s highest floor.Gu Qing Shan went outside, stopped in front of the large central processor on the top floor and pressed his hand on the scanner.An electronic voice rang out: \u201cIdentity certified, No.41157, please state your business\u201dThis is the central Holo-Brain of Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology Building\u2019s System, every matter big and small within this giant corporation is single handedly managed by it.Gu Qing Shan answered: \u201cRequesting connection to Impartial Goddess\u201dAs he made his request, the electronic voice sounded again: \u201cConnecting to Impartial Goddess requires the most rigorous identity verification, as well as requiring verification of your personal Citizen Merit value of the to ensure the reputation of Chang Ning Steel Mech Research Institute will not be damaged by your personal actions. Do you confirm you want to connect to the Goddess?\u201d\u201cI confirm\u201d\u201cAs you wish, verification will begin in one minute\u201dThe electronic voice disappeared, but numerous mechanical arms shining cold light appeared from the floor, surrounding Gu Qing Shan and began a series of identification.At the same time, the 99th floor entered a sealed state, ensuring no one can intrude in anyway.\u201cIris identification passed\u201d\u201cBlood identification passed\u201d\u201cUnique biological signal match: 99.1759%\u201d\u201cTesting clone unique characteristics, verified not a clone, DNA identification passed\u201d\u201cUnique life vitality, records match, passed\u201d\u201cReading personal life records, concluded to be non-aggressive individual\u201d\u201cReputation records: good\u201d\u201cReading personal Citizen Merit\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan stood still, silently waiting for the long and complicated cross identification to finish.Impartial Goddess is the Confederate\u2019s central management system AI (artificial intelligence), in charge of keeping the Confederate running, responsible for all citizenship matters, and all her actions are done strictly in accordance to the Confederate Constitution of Rights.Impartial Goddess can be called the crystallization of all Confederate top-level sciences, the greatest creation of mankind, the most glorious fruit of civilization herself.Because Impartial Goddess\u2019 calculation speed is so horrifically high, her intelligence and warring expertise far eclipsing every other country, that no country dared to bare its fangs towards the Confederate for the last 100-year.10 minutes later.The electronic voice once again sounded: \u201cYour personal Citizen Merit value is sufficient, identification passed, Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology company\u2019s Holo-Brain officially requesting connection with Impartial Goddess, No.41157 is recommended stay where he is and does not leave\u201dPersonal Citizen Merit, the measure of contribution of a Confederate citizen to humanity\u2019s civilization and society as a whole.The more you\u2019ve contributed to society, the higher your Merit, as well as the better your privileges and treatment in society.Some State-sanctioned universities when picking students will even review their personal Citizen Merit, if it\u2019s not enough, even if your examination score is excellent, you will not be picked.\u201cImpartial Goddess has accepted your request\u201dSuddenly the electronic voice changes, turning into a solemn female voice.This female voice speaks every word with a unique sway, almost sounding like a special rhythm.\u201cConfederate citizen Gu Qing Shan, I am Impartial Goddess, please state your request\u201d\u201cPlease be noted, all manners of time-waste will reduce my current evaluation of you\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress will arrive at Chang Ning county airspace in 1 hour and 25 minutes, please be prepared to board the fortress\u201dAs Impartial Goddess finished speaking, a 3-meter tall Mechsuit was released from the wall and started walking forward.When it arrived next to Gu Qing Shan, the mechanical cables connected to it all detached and retracted, the Mechsuit\u2019s cockpit slowly opened.Gu Qing Shan looked at it for a bit, then said: \u201cI have an additional request\u201d\u201cPlease speak\u201d\u201cPlease keep what I do this time a secret\u201d\u201cIn accordance to the Confederate Constitution of rights, all citizens engaging in creation-centric scientific research should be given the right of Privacy, to ensure their own safety and intellectual properties are not at risk. Request accepted, from this moment forward, Impartial Goddess will keep your secret\u201dGu Qing Shan continued: \u201cAside from yourself, please ensure no one else is able to see the fruits of my research, and I want to be left alone for a bit\u201d\u201cAccording to the Confederate Constitution of rights, the culmination of your research shall be kept secret, but Impartial Goddess have the right to request and use Confederate citizen\u2019s research results, citizen Gu Qing Shan, do you accept?\u201d\u201cI accept\u201dEverything is properly prepared, Gu Qing Shan smiled.The technological level of this era is much more behind compared to 10 years later, but with Impartial Goddess\u2019 assistance, my ideas can probably be done more or less.This will be Su Xue Er\u2019s birthday present, as well as the greatest good will I have towards this world on the verge of the Apocalypse.Time flies quickly.Gu Qing Shan stepped onto the Mechsuit, controlled it to softly jump upward, and started flying straight up as the hatch above opens.In the sky, a mid-sized Warship was waiting for him.The Warship didn\u2019t have any personnel, controlled by Impartial Goddess herself.As Gu Qing Shan boarded the Warshop, it quickly rose up to space.An hour later.Among the dark and silent void of space was an eye-catchingly bright Giant Interstellar Fortress.Gu Qing Shan was standing alone in a sealed area.This place is as large as 4 football stadiums, the only thing on the empty field was a floating virtual reality projection device in front of Gu Qing Shan.\u201cBegin Mech creation\u201d, he said.Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice rang from all directions: \u201cMech creation preparations ready, please explain your creation intention\u201dSuddenly, Su Xue Er\u2019s beautiful face appeared Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind, making him silent for a bit, then said: \u201cI hope this Mobile Mech, even in the face of absolute despair, will be able to bring its pilot a hope of survival\u201dImpartial Goddess replied: \u201cIntention too abstract, please use mechanical construction terminology\u201dGu Qing Shan was speechless for a bit, then said: \u201cInitiate life structure algorithm\u201dImpartial Goddess immediately replied: \u201cUnable to initiate. Life structure algorithm is only a theoretical possibility based on current frontier Mech science, the algorithm in total have 2 rules unpassed, 7 formulas unestablished, 29 technical problems unsolved\u201dGu Qing Shan scratched his head.It\u2019s been so long that he doesn\u2019t know exactly which technical problems and theories are not yet solved.Gu Qing Shan said: \u201cPlease list them one by one\u201dAs he said that, a number of light screens appeared in front of him, each of them containing a different problem.Gu Qing Shan went to the first of them.\u201cAh, so it\u2019s the issue of standard metrics for multiple neuron transmission, I remember this problem being solved only just before the Apocalypse came\u201d\u201cWell then, let\u2019s start\u201dRolling up his sleeves, he starts the calculation on the light screen.This problem is very difficult, Gu Qing Shan had to use half an hour to deal with it.\u201cPlease check the equation\u201d Gu Qing Shan requested.\u201cInitiating check\u201d Impartial Goddess replied.The light screen slowly sank into the ground, no longer seen.10 seconds later, Impartial Goddess\u2019 sound is heard again.\u201cEquation correct, standard metrics established\u201dGood, after establishing the standard metrics, all the other ones are much easier to solve, Gu Qing Shan nodded satisfyingly, moving on to the next light screen.He very seriously checked all the problems on every light screen, then said: \u201cHmm, this problem, please help bring up the model, I\u2019ll enter the corresponding formula\u201d\u2026\u2026For a while after, Gu Qing Shan kept solving the technical problems one by one, gradually completing the life structure algorithm.Deep inside the fortress, on a large screen, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s equations, rules and form structures are being tested time and time again.When Gu Qing Shan\u2019s research reached the halfway point, a notification popped up on the large screen.\u201cTarget verified to fit the conditions for the 5th Article of Confederate Constitution of Rights, initiating corresponding plan, begin requesting authorization\u201d\u201cContacting Army General, Martial Saint Zhang Zong Yang\u201d\u201cContacting Navy Admiral, Sea King Lee Dong Yuan\u201d\u201cContacting Interstellar Supreme Commander, Song Tian Wu\u201dThree invisible lights emitted from the S.W. Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress, travelling to different locations.\u201cGeneral, highest priority contact requested\u201d\u201cHmm? The President?\u201d\u201cNo, from Impartial Goddess\u201d--Confederate Presidential Office, an immense ruckus was welling up.Three military men in full uniform are quickly walking towards the President\u2019s office at the same time.\u201cAdmiral Lee, why are you here?\u201d\u201cGeneral Zhang, welcome\u201d\u201cCommander Song!\u201dOn their way, many people greeted them, all carrying a face of fear and respect.The commanders of all three major military branches gathered here at once, did a big incident happen?Could it be Fuxi Republic have declared war and invaded them?Everyone couldn\u2019t help but become uneasy.The three generals didn\u2019t stop their feet and kept walking straight, unlike everyday, where they would stop to at least greet the officials that they have connections with.The President\u2019s office was already opened, all the generals entered at the same time, saluting.\u201cMr. President, Impartial Goddess is requesting you to immediately be connected\u201d General Lee said.The middle-aged man with grey streaks of hair turned around, his eyes questioning his secretaries.One of the secretaries, the head of them all, said: \u201cSir, it\u2019s an emergency connection, but not because of war\u201dThe elder man\u2019s face relaxes slightly when hearing that and commanded: \u201cGenerals, please connect the line\u201dOne of the generals stopped his salute, opened the heavy suitcase he brought along and put the simplified interspace communication device in front of the President.The interspace communication device lit up.Impartial Goddess\u2019 solemn voice could be heard.\u201cA conversation of Top-secret Level is about to begin, please dismiss all non-related personel, otherwise in accordance with the Confederate Secrecy Agreement, terminating all personnel without sufficient Access Level\u201dEveryone who heard that turned pale.Terminating means killing, what exactly happened that even Impartial Goddess would ignore the life of citizen just to keep a secret?Everybody quickly left the room.The only people left in the President\u2019s office are the 3 generals and the President.At this time, Impartial Goddess\u2019 voice once again sounded.\u201cPreparing to engage all highest security protocols for the S.W. Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress, requesting sir President and 3 Generals to authorize\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to engage highest security protocols?\u201d asked the President.Impartial Goddess respond: \u201cAccording to the 5th Article of the Confederate Constitution of Rights, every project in progress that have significance on the fate of humanity, or pushes the advancement of humanity civilization, is to receive the highest level of protection available\u201dThe President\u2019s face became serious, asking: \u201cWhat is happening on the S.W. Divine Temple?\u201dImpartial Goddess replied: \u201cFor the sake of secrecy, I\u2019m unable to reveal at the moment\u201dThe faces of the 3 General changed.The only people here already have the highest Access Level in the Confederate, yet Impartial Goddess still refused to tell them about it.Impartial Goddess is very rarely this careful when dealing with matters, what the heck is going on?Although \u201cactions that push the advancement of humanity civilization\u201d is supposed to be a good thing, from their past experience, things aren\u2019t quite as simple as that.The President thought for a bit, speaking: \u201cI remember the last time that highest security protocols were engaged was 30 years ago\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d General Song replied: \u201cthat time was regarding the advancement of interstellar warp jump technology, the results of the first time our fleet experimented with space warp, was that they met space monsters\u201d30 years ago, the first group of Confederate Interstellar-series warships that tried interstellar warp jump, succeeded passing through the wormhole, arriving at a galaxy 500 millions light years away, and witnessed a horrifying scene.A large soft-bodied looking monster was latched onto a planet, sucking something from it.This horrifying truth, together with interstellar warp jump technology, was both listed as top-secret information.The top-brass of humanity looks at each other, their faces serious as can be.Any breakthrough in humanity civilization will always come with danger of the unknown, for the Goddess to act like that, it\u2019s not surprising.The President sighed: \u201cIf even Impartial Goddess has already fully prepared for this, then we had better authorize her\u201dImpartial Goddess hearing that: \u201cS.W. Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress, SSS-grade security protocols completed, seeking authorization from sir President\u201dThe President: \u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cSeeking authorization from Interstellar supreme commander\u201dGeneral Song: \u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cSeeking authorization from Navy supreme commander\u201dGeneral Lee: \u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cSeeking authorization from Army supreme commander\u201dGeneral Zhang: \u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cAuthorization received, begin enacting SSS-grade protocols\u201dOn the interspace communicator, a grand sea of stars appeared in front of them.\u201cS.W. Xiong Wu Interstellar Fortress returning in full speed, using S.W. Divine Temple as base, in charge of patrol\u201d\u201cS.W. Shining Interstellar Fortress rising from the sea floor, using S.W.

Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress.Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t know anything about the ruckus that he had caused.After 7 long hours of struggle, he finally resolved all the issues in the algorithm.Gu Qing Shan breaths out and said: \u201cBegin creating Mech Fighter Armor, using the life structure algorithm as base\u201d\u201cAccepted, algorithm prepared, materials prepared, please construct Mech model\u201d\u201cThe model huh\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan thought for a while, then decided to connect to his phone, sending a message from it.\u201cMech Armors, what kind of appearance do you like?\u201dThe message sent, no replies for a while.Gu Qing Shan shrugs and said: \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for a bit\u201dImpartial Goddess remains silent.At that moment, on the planet, Confederate capital city, at an idol concert\u201cXie Shuang Yan!\u201d\u201cXie Shuang Yan!\u201d\u201cXie Shuang Yan!\u201dThe crowd shouted excitedly.That girl who\u2019s the dream of hundreds of thousands of people, microphone in hand, just about to respond to the excitement of her fans below.Suddenly a number of large Mech Fighter Armors, as well as over 20 squads of Special Force agents surrounded the crowd of people.The girl was speechless in front of the spectacle before her.In the sky, an Interstellar Warship that covered the sky hovered above the outdoor concert venue.\u201cSilent, everybody remain silent\u201d\u201cThe concert is temporarily on hold, we will now begin filtering for hidden criminal personnels\u201d\u201cEverybody is to remain silent, otherwise you will be immediately arrested and subjected to Impartial Goddess\u2019 step-by-step investigation\u201dThe Special Force agents starts to check each and every person in the crowd.At first the people were a bit annoyed, a few were even angry enough to shout curses.But as soon as they heard \u201cImpartial Goddess\u201d, everyone knew this wasn\u2019t a joke, and within a single minute, everyone has already calmed down and became silent.Su Xue Er who was sitting on her VIP seat could now finally hear her phone ringing.Before she could notice, the name on the phone had changed from \u201cImpartial Goddess\u201d back to \u201cGu Qing Shan\u201d.Su Xue Er looked at her phone, happily smiled after reading the message.\u201cQing Shan ge wants to personally craft a Mech model for me?\u201dIn spaceGu Qing Shan immediately received the message.He also smiled.That\u2019s correct, I\u2019m personally making it for you, except it\u2019s not just a model.Gu Qing Shan replied: \u201cAnswer me first, what appearance do you want your Mech to have\u201dSu Xue Er serious thought for a bit, then replied: \u201cI like the Blazing Angel\u201dGu Qing Shan a bit surprised: \u201cAngel? Why do you like them?\u201d\u201cBecause the Blazing Angel represent love and dreams, dummy\u201d at the end of the message there was even a \u201c ;) \u201d icon\u201cFine, fine, I get it, I\u2019ll get back to making your present now, see you later\u201d\u201cHow good are your handiwork skills?

Why did they all suddenly retreat, the Confederate must be mad or something\u201dIn the concert venue, many other people also didn\u2019t understand what had just happened.Only the girl standing on stage was slightly looking up at the sky, or perhaps more correctly, looking past it, at the stars.4 hours later.Gu Qing Shan silently returned to Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology Research company.Returning to his room at the 55th underground floor, he laid down to rest.This type of continuous heavy workload, even a qi training stage 5 cultivator like himself would feel tired.The Blazing Angel Mobile Mech Armor is already done, he\u2019s leaving it to Impartial Goddess for the series of quality tests, afterwards it\u2019ll be delivered directly to Su Xue Er.Due to the technological sensitivity used in building it, the Mech is only available for Su Xue Er herself to use.Impartial Goddess also requested his permission, for the next step in examining the Mech\u2019s capabilities, as well as to prevent the technology to spread, Goddess herself will dispatch the secret forces to protect both the Mech and Su Xue Er.That way, Su Xue Er\u2019s safety becomes guaranteed.Such a pleasant surprise, Gu Qing Shan gladly accepted.Besides from that, the technical skills that he contributed, will be compiled and re-categorized by Impartial Goddess, to make it a top-secret level scientific research results report.Done with the birthday present, Gu Qing Shan stretched his back, crossed his leg on the bed and started meditating.Circulating spirit energy around inside provides immense benefits, which includes slowly nurturing the body.Gu Qing Shan gradually sunk into deep meditation.At this time, the whole world was in an uproar.Numerous countries all contacted the Confederate, asking for reason for the mass military sortie that happened.The President had to do his best to cover things up, taking a lot of effort just to get them to half-believe him.Chang Ning country, the casino.The sunglasses man and the beautiful woman are standing in a secret room, both of them looking at the messages on their communication devices.The sunglasses man breathed out: \u201cScared me to death, I almost thought the Confederated wanted to declare war or something\u201dThe woman was still looking intently at the screen, speaking: \u201cDo you believe the Confederate President\u2019s words?\u201dThe sunglasses man replied curtly: \u201cA politician\u2019s mouth is always full of lies, something about a large-scale military drill to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Confederate\u2019s founding, like hell I\u2019ll believe that\u201dThe woman replied: \u201cThere\u2019s still 21 days until their 300th anniversary, so that reason really is a little bit hard to believe\u201dThen she asked back: \u201cBut what could have happened that would require the sortie of 2 Interstellar Fortresses, 3 Interstellar Warship squadrons, as well as the whole of the Interstellar Mech Fighter Legion?\u201dThe sunglasses man added: \u201cMartial Saint Zhang Zong Yang, Sea King Lee Dong Yuan were also dispatched, both of them were respectively stationed at the border and the sea border for 5 hours, only retreating just now\u201dBoth of them looked at each other, feeling this to be something big.Just what the hell happened in the Confederate?At this moment, the communicator suddenly lit up, from it a hoarse voice can be heard coughing.Both of their faces tensed up, stood up straight and bowed at the same time: \u201cYour Majesty\u201dThe hoarse voice coughed for a while, before slowly speaking: \u201cHm, both of you have been working hard outside, especially you, my dear princess\u201dThe woman spoke with a low voice: \u201cFather, it is my duty\u201dThe hoarse voice smiled a bit, then spoke: \u201cBoth of you go investigate, exactly what drove the Confederate so mad that they would gather that much military strength, only to disperse them all in just a few hours\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, my daughter, Anna, I give you temporary full control of the operation, you\u2019ll take full responsibility for whatever happens afterwards\u201dFull control, a right only given to General-rank officers.Anna opened her eyes wide, tried her best to make her trembling voice appear calm: \u201cThank you, father\u201dThe hoarse voice spoke: \u201cHm, take care of your body, and remember to stay safe\u201dThe communicator shuts down.\u201cYour Highness Anna, congratulations\u201d the sunglasses man whole-heartedly said.The woman called Anna looked at the communicator, still in shock, feeling all emotions from sweet to bitter rushing all at once.She had left the palace because she didn\u2019t want to be used as sacrifice for political influence, instead using her talents and effort for the best interests of the Empire.His Majesty the king also didn\u2019t want to force his own daughter, only saying that if she can\u2019t handle the struggle outside, then she must return to the palace for the political marriage with the Holy Church.The king had also let her find her way up the ranks from the bottom without any special treatment.And that meant immense risk, even if princess Anna was a stronger person than most, she still faced the threat of death many times over.Luckily, she finally made it to the top, furthermore gaining the acknowledgement of his Majesty.Quickly pushing her own feelings down, Anna became calm and spoke: \u201cLet\u2019s start working then\u201d\u201cYes\u201dAfter a night of toil, both of them still couldn\u2019t find any clues.Impartial Goddess\u2019 algorithm is already almost perfect, so they had no chance if they wanted to find out the truth from the Military sortie.After all, even the 3 main force Generals and the President knew nothing of what happened.Anna tiredly massaged her forehead, yet not taking her eyes off the holographic screen.\u201cYour Highness, coffee\u201d\u201cTo keep my spirits up, please give me a Brandy instead\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you drink a little less alcohol?\u201d\u201cNope\u201dAnna answered with a smile, taking the bottle of Brandy and got back to work.Under her feet, about 7-8 empty bottles are already neatly lined up.Suddenly, she thought of something, turned back and look at the images on the projection screen.\u201cWhat?\u201d the sunglasses man asked.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she asked.\u201cConfederate surveillance camera footage from all counties\u201d the sunglasses man replied.Anna blinked and asked: \u201cWhat about our member recruitment mission? How many drones did we send out?\u201dThe sunglasses man slaps his head and replied: \u201c691 drones in total, shit, I forgot that asides from tailing the target, the drones can also record real-time information of the area as well\u201dThe two of them quickly downloaded the footage and watched them one by one.Time slowly passes.Anna suddenly called the sunglasses man, pointing at the screen: \u201cLook at this\u201dThe sunglasses man looked at Anna\u2019s screen, seeing on it a Mobile Mechsuit, flying from the top of Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology company\u2019s highest floor.The sunglasses man quickly operated his Holo-Brain, both hands quickly typing on the keyboard.\u201cOpen the satellite images from space\u201dIntercept the image transmission from space satellites takes a bit more time, so they silently waited.A bit later, the images are shown.They saw the scene of over 10,000 meters in the sky, a mid-sized Interstellar Warship received the Mobile Mech, then flew straight up to space.\u201cAt that time, the S.W. Divine Temple Interstellar Fortress also happened to be straight above from Chang Ning\u2019s airspace\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s possible that this Interstellar Warship was used to carry someone onto the Interstellar Fortress\u201dThe sunglasses man mumbled to himself: \u201cThen the problem now is, who was on that Mobile Mechsuit?\u201dPrincess Anna suddenly asked: \u201cWhere was Gu Qing Shan at the time?\u201dThe sunglasses man\u2019s hands quickly typed again: \u201cI\u2019ll check\u201dA line of text quickly appeared on the Holo-Brain.\u201cBiological readings showed upwards movement, at the height of 19,217 meters, the radar could no longer track the signal\u201dBoth of them looked at each other and remained speechless for a bit.After a while, princess Anna slowly ordered: \u201cAnnounce the news, the day after tomorrow at 9 A.M, St. Orlank Empire\u2019s head princess will make an official visit to the Freedom Federation, her first destination being Chang Ning County\u201dThe sunglasses man hesitated for a bit and said: \u201cYour double is still at the farthest reach of the Empire doing her charity work, not counting information travel time, two days simply isn\u2019t enough to make it cross 3 countries to get here\u201dPrincess Anna continued: \u201cThen add another sentence, this time the princess will try using a super-speed flight shuttle\u201dThe sunglasses man asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a bit too rushed?\u201dAnna stared at the surveillance report on the screen, quietly muttered: \u201cNo, I\u2019m more afraid that we might be too slow\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

by: La0o9Morning.Gu Qing Shan changed into his work clothes, had breakfast at the worker cafeteria, then quickly went to his research room.Spending about 5 minutes, he finished the project he was working on, then started to drift in thought again.In a year\u2019s time, what realm of cultivation can he actually reach?Using the power of a single person, wanting to change the future is almost impossible.Is his fate resigned to just watch as the Apocalypse come, unable to do anything again?Su Xue Er\u2019s smiling face appeared in his mind.As he was thinking, an electronic voice suddenly rang.\u201cHello, No.41157, CEO Su is requesting you to go and wait at the company's main lobby\u201dGu Qing Shan was a bit surprised, stood up and walked out.Employees that are conducting research usually would not be bothered, except when summoned by the top-brass of the company.But this isn\u2019t right, Impartial Goddess herself promised to keep yesterday\u2019s matter a secret, so she definitely wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about it.Then what does the Su family want with me?Gu Qing Shan got on the elevator and rode up to the company\u2019s main lobby.Two men in black suits walked up as they saw him.\u201cGu Qing Shan?\u201d one of them asked\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d\u201cPlease follow me, Madame is inviting you to a party\u201dTo be called \u201cMadame\u201d by them, it can only be Su family current generation\u2019s main line lady, in order words, Su Xue Er\u2019s mother.Gu Qing Shan was a bit shaken, but answered: \u201cSure\u201dThe two of them went with Gu Qing Shan out of Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology company, got onto a shuttle and went straight to the Su family\u2019s estate.About 20 minutes later, the shuttle landed on a luscious grassy area beside a lake.Gu Qing Shan exited the shuttle, seeing a wonderful natural lake scenery in front of him.At the center of the lake as a small island, probably where the Su family is.\u201cPlease get on the small boat and ride to the lake center\u201d, after the guide said that, they went back to work.Gu Qing Shan said his thanks, quickly walking towards the lake shore.He didn\u2019t have anything to complain about, the rules of this place he can probably guess more or less, shuttles and other transportation of the same type are forbidden to fly over the lake.Part of it due to safety reasons, the other part is showing respect to the Su family.A small boat was waiting for him on the lake shore.On it, another young man was standing.\u201cYou must be Gu Qing Shan\u201d, the other young man smiled and greeted him.\u201cI am, and pardon me for asking but who are you?\u201d Gu Qing Shan said\u201cMy surname is Bai, Bai Hong Wu, from Bai Sha county\u201d, the young man showed a face full of pride.Bai Sha county, that place Lord\u2019s surname is also Bai.This young man, to be able to stand here, as well as having a chance to go to the Su family estate, he could very well be from one of the 9 Great Nobles families, Bai family.\u201cNice to meet you,'' said Gu Qing Shan, as he got ready to board the boat.Bai Hong Wu suddenly stopped him: \u201cWait a minute\u201dGu Qing Shan stopped his feet and looked at him.Bai Hong Wu raised his head high, speaking: \u201cThe Su family tea party, a low-born like you is better off not joining it, otherwise you\u2019d cause discomfort for all the aristocrat there\u201dGu Qing Shan calmly answered: \u201cIt was the Su family Madame that invited me\u201dBai Hong Wu sarcastically smiled and said: \u201cGo back, I\u2019ll tell Madame Su that you got sick and couldn\u2019t make it\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201dBai Hong Wu calmly: \u201cI come from Bai family of Bai Sha county, the head of Bai family is my father, I only need to say that much for you to know what would come to you if you don\u2019t obey me\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cPlease get out of the way\u201dBai Hong Wu calmly looked at him, like looking at a retarded person.He shakes his head: \u201cThis is the Su family estate, I don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019ll be rude, but I can guarantee, you\u2019ll regret this for the rest of your life\u201dGu Qing Shan smirked, laughed and said: \u201cI\u2019ll make you regret this for the rest of your life right now\u201dThe lake island.Su family\u2019s garden.A middle-aged woman was sitting elegantly in the main pavilion, deeply immersed in making tea.\u201cReport, Bai Hong Wu and Gu Qing Shan have both arrived at the lake shore, but there was an unexpected occurrence\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the middle-aged woman didn\u2019t bother to turn around and simply asked.\u201cThe two of them seemed to be in conflict, finally only one person got on the boat, and is on his way here\u201dThe middle-aged woman smiled a bit and said to herself: \u201cBai Hong Wu seemed to have really grown, being able to drive the other party off without fighting, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s what it means to be a part of high nobility\u201d\u201cMadame, it isn\u2019t as you think, the one on the boat is Gu Qing Shan\u201dThe middle-aged asked in surprise: \u201cWhere\u2019s Bai Hong Wu?\u201d\u201cHe was stripped by Gu Qing Shan and kicked into the lake\u201dThe messenger\u2019s voice became lower and lower: \u201cAll Bai family personnel who came with him was already on the island, only Bai Hong Wu who was following the proper procedures for asking for marriage was on the lake shore to wait for the boat alone, that\u2019s why Gu Qing Shan was able to do as he did\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be\u201d, the middle-aged woman closed her eyes, calmed down and ordered: \u201cBring Gu Qing Shan to me, take Bai Hong Wu to the back for a change of clothes, then bring him to the party, I\u2019ll be there to explain the situation later\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThe middle-aged woman also lost interest in making tea, coldly laughed and mumbled: \u201cA toad daring to dream of walking on the clouds?\u201dShe sat there silently, waiting for the detestable brat to come.As Gu Qing Shan arrived, he immediately recognized her in a single glance.Madame Su looked very much similar to Su Xue Er, as well as frequently appearing in the news, so it\u2019s harder not to recognize her.\u201cMadame Su, how are you\u201d, Gu Qing Shan bowedMadame Su only took a single look at him and said: \u201cDon\u2019t talk, come here and listen for a bit\u201dGu Qing Shan was slightly surprised, but indeed he could hear many voices not far from here.This would be the back garden, a little more forward and it would be the main party hall and the hunting ground.The sounds coming from that side travelled here were very audible.Within the noisy crowd, a few are talking about current world situations, a few talking in low voices about forming a business relationship, the female voices that are there were discussing which types of clothes and bags are more fashionable, or where to go for their vacation.Madame Su waited for Gu Qing Shan to listen for a while, and then spoke: \u201cWhat do you hear?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cA lot of military news and business conversations\u201dMadame Su curtly: \u201cThat\u2019s correct, the conversations regarding military are all at least lieutenant rank officers, the conversions in business are from our Su family and the Bai family, they\u2019re preparing to work together and invest a few dozen billions, forming a new company\u201d\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing, are not only advancing the progress of the Confederate, but also changing the lives of millions of normal citizens\u201d\u201cThose girls there, the clothes that they talk about, the bags that they want, all of them are luxury items that you couldn\u2019t afford even with years of hard work\u201dMadame Su looked at Gu Qing Shan: \u201cYou are not only low-born, but also poor and weak, if it wasn\u2019t because of Su Xue Er\u2019s recommendation, do you really think you could enter our Su family Steel Mech Technology Research company?\u201dGu Qing Shan was silent for a bit, then seriously replied: \u201cMadame Su, I assure you with my own skills, I\u2019m more than qualified to enter your R&amp;D department\u201d\u201cDo you still not understand?\u201d Madame Su shook her head.She picked up her phone and ordered: \u201cFire the Mech R&amp;D department\u2019s researcher Gu Qing Shan, effective immediately\u201dJust as Madame Su finished her words, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s own phone rang.The other side curtly spoke\u201cFrom

Bai family have been annoyed at your incessant attachment to Su Xue Er for far too long\u201dShe started raising for voice: \u201cBefore, I wanted Su Xue Er to get the chance to meet all kinds of people, to see the many kinds of people in this world, but you, I\u2019ve never seen as fit for her\u201dGu Qing Shan once again: \u201cSince becoming friends with Su Xue Er, I\u2019ve not harmed her once\u201dMadame Su as if hearing something laughable, looked at Gu Qing Shan from head to toe.Her eyes looking down on him like that made Gu Qing Shan very uncomfortable, but he held himself back from doing anything.Madame Su spoke again: \u201cNext week is my daughter\u2019s birthday, Bai Hong Wu\u2019s present for her is a personal-use island, valued at 80 milions Credits. And you? A pathetic Mech model?\u201d\u201cYou tapped our phone conversation?\u201d for the first time, Gu Qing Shan squinted his eyes, but still tried to explain: \u201cit isn\u2019t a Mech model----\u201c\u201cStop, no matter what tricks you use, no matter what you give her, it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d Madame Su once more cut short his words, her face full of contempt.She stood up, looking at him from above.\u201cI forgot to tell you, my daughter had awakened a mutated elemental power, she\u2019s a Wind Supernaturalist\u201dGu Qing Shan suddenly lifts up his face, looking truly glad.Metal \u2013 Wood \u2013 Water \u2013 Fire \u2013 Earth, these are the 5 primary elements, Wind \u2013 Lightning \u2013 Light \u2013 Dark \u2013 Sound, are mutated elements.Wind element is very good, extraordinarily useful, a Supernatural power that many desires.In the past life, Su Xue Er also awakened to her Wind element, but that was a matter of 2 years later.This time, she was able to awaken it early, and that\u2019s a good thing.Because the Profession called Supernaturalist, the sooner they are awakened, the more potential they have towards the end.Madame Su unhappily: \u201cWhat are you so happy about? I\u2019m warning you, from now on do not go near my daughter, do not contact her, a forever low-born commoner like you have to know their limits\u201d\u201cThis is my advice to you as the lady of Su family, as well as my last warning\u201dShe doesn\u2019t even want to look at Gu Qing Shan anymore, elegantly turning around, softly stepping out.This small matter taken care of, she now have other things to worry about --- after all, this is still a Su family party, as the lady of the house she have to host it.\u201cMadame Su, please wait a minute\u201dFrom behind her the voice of the brat spoke up.Madame Su turned around, coldly looked at him.Gu Qing Shan stood up and spoke with a sincere face: \u201cI have to tell you one important thing\u201d\u201cSpeak\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cI do not attach myself to Su Xue Er, never have and still have no intention of climbing up using the Su family, we are friends as equals\u201dMadame Su feeling herself almost unable to contain her anger, loudly laughed and said: \u201cEqual? I seriously doubt you even know what that word really mean you imbecile\u201dFor tone became incredibly cold: \u201cThis place doesn\u2019t welcome you, get out\u201dGu Qing Shan blinked twice, then silently left the pavilion.A while later, Madame Su let go of her clenched hands\u201cGo\u201d her eyes contained a sense of coldness \u201cTell the Nie family and Bai family, Gu Qing Shan is about to leave the lake island\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t care what they want to do, but it cannot happen near the lake island\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dAfter her order, Madame Su\u2019s mood finally lifted a bitLooking up at the morning sky, she mumbled: \u201cYou still didn\u2019t give up after all that, it\u2019ll be too late to regret once you\u2019re about to die\u201dThe day was coming to an end.As Gu Qing Shan went back to the slums, he suddenly found his apartment already sealed by the police.Even though the matter of Xiong Hu\u2019s death was concealed by Nie family, but a whole room on the 22th floor suddenly disappearing is still too eye-catching.Gu Qing Shan just stood there for a bit.He already lost his job at Chang Ning Steel Mech Technology R&amp;D department, so it seems he no longer have anywhere to go.Searching himself, the key given to him by the hitman Wang Ming is still there, so he turned around, about to go to that residential area.As he walked past a secluded alleyway, Gu Qing Shan suddenly looked down at his shadow.The shadow was waving to him, then escaped from his feet and ran towards a small alley.\u201cA God's Chosen Skill\u2026\u201dThis type of strange ability, Gu Qing Shan can immediately tell.Using this method to greet him is already very polite, even showing him what the ability is, seems like they bear no ill-willNo matter, taking a look won\u2019t hurt.Gu Qing Shan followed the shadow into the small alley, finally entered a bar at the street corner.As he entered, the bar door closed behind him, on it a sign that says \u201cClosed for business\u201dSoft and low music, a faint scent of cigarette in the air, dim lights.On the bar, two people sat.One of them a burly man with combed back hair, wearing sunglasses.The other a beautiful, slender woman with blazing red hair just reaching her shoulder.Both of them looked at Gu Qing Shan, wearing a friendly smile.\u201cAh? It\u2019s you\u201d Gu Qing Shan spoke, surprised.Hearing the unexpected words, the two people looked at each other, a bit confused.\u201cAh, my bad, I just felt like I\u2019ve met you somewhere before\u201dGu Qing Shan covered up his slip of the tongue, face unchanged.When they heard that, the two of them suddenly had a look of understanding.The red-haired woman stood up, reaching her hand out and spoke generously: \u201cGood evening, I am the eldest princess of St. Orlank Empire, Anna, you must\u2019ve seen me from the news on TV\u201dStraight forward, saying whatever she wanted to say, seems like it\u2019s the same familiar style that he knew.Gu Qing Shan face lifted into a smile, extended his hand, accepting a quick handshake and then pulled back.\u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Gu Qing Shan\u201dHe saidAs he remembers, she had a habit of liking to stay clean, always hated other people touching her directly.Sure enough, Anna slightly raised her eyebrows in surprise, her smile becoming more sincere: \u201cStudent Gu, please take a seat\u201dGu Qing Shan sat down directly opposite of them.He glanced at her for a bit.Who knew, after so many years, he would be able to meet her again, and this time in her youth.Gu Qing Shan silently sighed.St. Orlank Empire eldest princess, Anna Medici, the Thorned Rose of the Church, owner of the death flame, already awaken as a Fire Supernaturalist at birth, as well as her most famous title----Queen of the Apocalypse.She was a miserable person who fought against fate, a beautiful soul that struggled in despair, only to perish in the end.In his past life, when Gu Qing Shan was still in his early days in the other world, she was already a legendary character in both worlds.Unintentionally, she happened to save Gu Qing Shan\u2019s life once.For her, it was an unconscious action that held no significance, but Gu Qing Shan have always remembered it deeply.A few years later, when Gu Qing Shan had grown to become an existence that stands on the same footing as her, he came to return the favor: \u201cI don\u2019t have a habit of not repaying other people favors, if you ever need me to do anything for you, just say the words\u201dShe only laughed lightly and answered: \u201cFine then, if you want to repay me, how about making me a good drink\u201dHe then seriously went around, collecting the best cocktails\u2019 secret recipes and alcohols of both worlds, trained until he was a master at the mixing bar, and finally when he was ready to find her again.She had already faded away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Intense. Burning.Destruction. Loneliness. Sadness.Finally, a deep lingering hint of sweetness.Having closed her eyes for a while, Anna opened them again and looks at Gu Qing Shan in surprise.\u201cI like you\u201d, she said.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Feng Huo De stood up shouting.\u201cReally? Then let\u2019s go with a glass of Blood Thirster next\u201d Gu Qing Shan looked down, not letting her see his face, his hands quickly crafting the next cocktail.In a few moments, two more glasses are made.A light toast, as the both of them drank it down in one gulp.\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad person huh!\u201dAnna joyfully laughed, slapping Gu Qing Shan on his shoulder.Gu Qing Shan knocked her hand off, sincerely asked: \u201cDon\u2019t make a scene, I also have a glass of Hell\u2019s Flame here, are you drinking or not?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help it, he felt an urge to make all his creations in the past 10 years for her.Anna eyes almost seemed to gleam in delight, then neatly sat down: \u201cI\u2019ll drink!\u201dStaring intently at the young man quickly mixing the drinks behind the bar, she asked: \u201cHowever, the name Hell\u2019s Flame, why have I never heard it before?\u201d\u201cThis is my new creation, only made in the past recent years\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan spoke, he has finished a glass of mixed alcohol with ice and slid it over.Anna took it, as she lifted the glass to have a look, all she saw was an intense, silent black.Tilting her head upwards, she once again finished it all in one gulp.\u201cHow strong, seems like your mood must\u2019ve been not so good in the past few years\u201d Anna licked her lips, commenting.Gu Qing Shan lightly laughed, not saying anything.Feng Huo De on the side was panicking, not knowing what to do.Originally this was to pry some secrets from the Confederate, as well as stealing some talents away, but the talent hasn\u2019t even come over yet and they might possibly have already lost their princess.Gu Qing Shan also took notice of his mood.\u201cNo need to worry\u201d, Gu Qing Shan said as he gave him a bottle of whiskey: \u201cWe\u2019re simply drinking here, business can be seriously discussed when business time comes\u201dFeng Huo De took the bottle, his face unconvinced: \u201cHah! I\u2019m not hopeful\u201dOn the other side, Anna put down her glass and was carefully observing Gu Qing Shan again.Suddenly, a PING noise.And again, repeatedly.The three of them all took a look to see it was Gu Qing Shan\u2019s phone.Gu Qing Shan took out his phone, placing it on the table to look.\u201cConfederate citizen Gu Qing Shan, you are under suspicion of murder, please stay right where you are, law enforcers are on the way\u201d\u201cStudent Gu Qing Shan, because of your involvement in a murder case, as well as reported for theft by multiple nobles, Chang Ning County Nobles Private School hereby officially announce your expulsion\u201dThe light on the phone then turn off.Gu Qing Shan just sat there, as still as a statue.\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s too bad\u201d Anna tapped his shoulder a few times \u201cbut don\u2019t be discouraged, there\u2019s always an obstacle in life, come with me to the Empire, I guarantee you\u2019ll receive the highest possible treatment, no, how about I personally grant you a title of Baron instead?\u201dSeeing Gu Qing Shan not responding, Anna again spoke: \u201cThere seems to be quite a few people outside, how about you let me take care of them for you?\u201dFeng Huo De opened his eyes wide, looking at her Highness the princess in shock.The cold and distant princess herself would treat a man like that?The hell!Don\u2019t tell me this brat really is going to seduce their princess away!Gu Qing Shan suddenly laugh, then spoke slowly: \u201cI really just wanted some peace and quiet you know\u201dOutside, the deafening sound of police sirens rang.A huge commotion.Voices, footsteps, even the sound of shuttle engines, getting closer and closer to the bar.Gu Qing Shan stood up and said: \u201cI had even hoped to join the examinations, entering a University, to finally fulfil one of my regrets\u201dA bow suddenly appeared in his hand out of thin air, as well as three quivers full of arrows on his back.Holding the bow, he went towards the bar door.With every step, his body almost seems to glow a bit more.As he stood at the door, opening it, a flowing invisible aura surrounded his whole body, a pure gleaming light seem to be there.Just like a sword out of its sheath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!The face of the man who ran it first changed, his body shifted to one sideA grey shadow passed through where he stood before.\u201cNa\u00efve\u201dThe man\u2019s face showed a cruel smile, but before he could say anything else, another arrow had already pierced his chest.A large gaping hole in the middle of his body, large enough to see what\u2019s behind.The burly man fell on the ground, no longer moving.In the sky, more and more arrows are flying, faster and faster, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face still as cold as before, both hands not stopping for even a second, almost like he became a human shooting machine!As the rain of arrows fall, the martial artists all scurry to dodge, no longer having the leisure to move forward.But very quickly, they found themselves unable to dodge at all.Each grey shadow turned into their worst nightmare as it takes away their lives.One of the Masters seeing the situation turning unfavorable took out a suitcase from behind, pressing a button on it.An exoskeleton armor expanded from inside and quickly enveloped him.Exoskeleton armors have quite the good defense, not only does it increase the user\u2019s strength, but also comes with a firearm system, a standard for frontline army soldiers.He\u2019s a genetically modified Martial Master, essentially the same as taking steroids, even though his strength is that of a Master, his true skills aren\u2019t, so he doesn\u2019t care about using firearms.A true Martial Master would rather use their bare hands to wrestle in a fight than to bother with these things.Gu Qing Shan immediately noticed him, turned his aim towards the man and activated Rapid Fire.Pssh pssh pssh pssh pssh!After the sound of consecutive impacts mixed with the crackling of electricity, the martial artist spurt out a cloud of blood, fell on the ground and no longer moved.On the exoskeleton was a deep hole.This type of defense is a little bit stronger than a small-sized Mech\u2019s armor plating, but facing Gu Qing Shan\u2019s spirit energy infused arrows, it still isn\u2019t enough to make a difference.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Flung outwards by the thrusting force they flew through the air.\u201cGood target practice\u201dGu Qing Shan slightly squints his eyes and draws his arrows. Not even using a Skill, he simply infused them with spirit energy and released.The 3 Martial Master flying through the air got shot full of holes, as they made contact with the ground, they were already dead bodies.Gu Qing Shan stood on the streetlamp, held his bow and looked around.The 30 Martial Masters all got shot to death, their bodies scattered around the street.\u201cBastard, that was 30 Masters\u2026\u201dNie Yun\u2019s face changes nonstop, his legs already shaking, almost unable to stand.He gritted his teeth, went in front of his shuttle and bowed respectfully: \u201cUncle Ma, seems like I\u2019ll have to trouble you after all\u201dAn old man walked out of the shuttle, hands behind his back, back slightly hunched and looked out at the street.He\u2019s inspecting every single dead body very carefully.\u201cWhat a cruel brat, unfortunately the things called arrows are useless against me\u201dAs the old man spoke, his knees slightly bent, then a loud sound as his whole body shot like a cannon ball towards Gu Qing Shan!Not afraid to attack from the air from such a distance, seems like he\u2019s a Grandmaster-class opponent, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes are as sharp as ever, instantly recognizing his opponent\u2019s true abilities.The old man suddenly clasped his hands together, waving it in front.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face changed, jumped away without any hesitation, landing on another streetlamp.At the same time, while the old man was still in the air, still at least a few dozen meters away from Gu Qing Shan, but he already struck with both his fists.\u201cRushing Arm Cannon!\u201dBah----Boom!First a light impact, then a huge explosion sound as the streetlamp got struck and destroyed, only leaving half of it left.\u201cBrat, you sure run fast\u201d, the old man said as he pursued.Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t waste time for words, simple lifting his bow and shot.The old man simply waved his hand nonchalantly and all the arrows were struck away from their course.Gu Qing Shan frowned, a bit annoyed\u201cUsing bare hands to make shock waves, with this strength, it has to be a Martial superpower\u201dAdvancing to Martial Grandmaster rank also has a chance to awake a random superpower, the old man here clearly awoken to a Martial superpower, particularly in his hands.What he said isn\u2019t wrong, facing arrows that fly straight, he only needed to use the superpower in his hands to change their course.Gu Qing Shan kept retreating, the old man in nonstop pursuit, as they moved, the streetlamps on both sides became collateral damage.Bang! Bang! Bang!More and more streetlamps fall as the old man got closer and closer.\u201cDie, brat, I\u2019ll take your head here!\u201d the old man shouted as he leapt in.Gu Qing Shan still not saying a thing, only silently pulled his bow back into an arc.Then he suddenly turned back, shouting: \u201cShifting Flurry!\u201dThe longbow\u2019s string sounded again and again.Grey shadows that almost seemed alive, like dragons or snakes flew through the air, drawing unpredictable arcs.\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d the old man shouted, suddenly stopped his feet, cautiously looked at all directions.The 5 arrows arrived at the same time!The old man\u2019s body as flexible as a fish in water, twisting and turning, dodging the incoming arrows.The power of these arrows are much stronger than before, much more than he expected, together with the sly trajectory, the old man had to use all this strength to deal with it.A Martial Grandmaster naturally gains a bit of Spirit sense, whenever an arrow came close, he\u2019s always reacted on time, either by shifting his body, or using his hands to strike them away.Only fright without any real danger, he evaded all the arrows.\u201cWhat kind of Archery is this?\u201dThe old man was breathing heavily.He\u2019s also slightly regretting his choice, if he knew that the arrows could twist and turn like that, he wouldn\u2019t have rushed out like this.Slowly approaching the enemy would\u2019ve been much safer.But now, as the two of them fought they\u2019ve already arrived at an intersection, with plenty of room to maneuver, the enemy\u2019s strange Archery skill have an extreme advantage.Their current distance is also perfect for him to attack.Could it be this brat calculated this?The old man could feel a chill coming up his spine.\u201cArchery for murder\u201d as Gu Qing Shan answered, his hands moved, suddenly increasing in speed, consecutively activated his Skill.Shifting Flurry!Shifting Flurry!Shifting Flurry!Three consecutive \u201cShifting Flurry\u201d, numerous arrows turned into a deadly flower of shadow, completely surrounded the Grandmaster.Even dealing with one \u201cShifting Flurry\u201d already took everything he had, this time he could no longer get out unscathed.Pssh pssh pssh pssh!The sound of arrows hitting flesh isn\u2019t loud, but in the silence of night, it was heard clearly even from afar.The Grandmaster\u2019s body spurt out a shower of blood, he staggered, then finally fell down.His whole body was riddled with arrows like a porcupine, the spirit energy on them went into his body and already extinguished his life force.When the Grandmaster died, his eyes couldn\u2019t even close, in it you could almost see a sense of regret and unwillingness.Nie Yun was completely stunned.This is a Grandmaster, an existence that eclipsed Masters, a powerful existence that even awoke a Martial superpower.Even a Supernaturalist would not easily offend a Grandmaster.This is already the strongest fighting force of the Nie family, this time he was dispatched purely to get on Bai family\u2019s good side.Fuck, why is this brat so strong.Cold sweat soaked Nie Yun\u2019s body.Right now, preserving my own life is most important, when Bai family act it\u2019ll be the end of him.After all, Bai family is still the biggest of the 9 Lords, not someone his family could compare to.As he thought that, Nie Yun raised both his hands up, shouting: \u201cI\u2019m the eldest grandson of Nie family, I surrender, Gu Qing Shan you had better\u2026\u201dPew!A single arrow flew, hitting his chest.Nie Yun touched the arrow on his chest, staggered backward bit by bit, then fell on the ground.Blood leaked out from both his wound, his mouth and nose.I\u2019m going to die, Nie Yun suddenly realized.His privileged life, immense fortune, bright future, is all leaving him at this very moment.No, it can\u2019t be, why do I have to die!Like a demon, he raised a harrowing scream: \u201cGu Qing Shan! You\u2019re the same as me, you kill whoever you spite just because you have power, the more you kill the closer you are to death, I curse you! I curse you to receive the worst kind of torture before death, dying without a place to even bury your body!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not like you\u201d Gu Qing Shan lowered his bow \u201cmy whole life, I\u2019ve killed and gotten revenge by killing too many times to count, but I\u2019ve never used my power to look down on others\u201dLooking at all the corpses on the street, his face still remained unchanged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Calling for reinforcements!\u201d the commanding Mech quickly took the time to report.\u201cReinforcements?\u201dA voice was heard from the crater.\u201cSeems like the situation isn\u2019t too bad\u201dAs he spoke, a figure jumped out from the crater.It was a middle-aged man.Thick brows, sharp eyes, tanned skin and a body that stood as straight as a javelin.Dark green military uniform, black boots, on his shoulder, there was a sword and shield -----a sword and shield, the Rank of General.Standing across from the Mech squadron that was ready for battle, he spoke: \u201cI am Zhang Zong Yang\u201dAll the Mechs suddenly stopped, the soldiers from inside the cockpits jumped out, raising their heads in salute.\u201cMartial Saint!\u201d\u201cMilitary God sir!\u201d\u201cBai Sha county, 477th Special Force reporting sir!\u201dZhang Zong Yang looked at the people across from and spoke: \u201cAs military men, who was it that told you to pilot Mech Armors, go on the busy streets to kill a person?\u201dThe soldiers hesitated for a bit, as the leader responded: \u201cIt was the Bai Sha county\u2019s Lord order, sir\u201dAs the military force of Bai Sha county, they had the duty to work under the orders of the Bai Sha Lord.\u201cDog shit aristocrats\u201dZhang Zong Yang spoke with contempt, no longer disciplined the soldiers, turned around towards where Gu Qing Shan was hiding and shouted: \u201cGu Qing Shan, come out\u201dGu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then came out.Zhang Zong Yang looked at the young man, his face complicated: \u201cThe President wants to see you\u201dRewinding time a few minutes ago.Space.The S.W. Divine Temple.In the large room that Gu Qing Shan was in before.On hundreds of screens, numbers and symbols are flowing, not stopping for even a second.These screens are arranged into a sphere shape, surrounded by a specially designed Mobile Mech, analyzing each and every small detail of it.The Mech stood still unmoving.It\u2019s not like regular Mechs, big and bulky, also unlike other specialized Mechs that carry a whole arsenal on him.It looks much more streamlined and mobile.The screens glowed a deep white on the Mech, looking almost like flowing water.Suddenly the Mech\u2019s head moved.And then it moved again.That\u2019s right, the Mech at the moment is looking around the silent space.-----just like a real living entity.Suddenly, hundreds of screens all shut down at once.Only the large screen closest to the Mech is still operating.On it showed one word.\u201cPerfect\u201dAs the word faded, three more appeared\u201cAhead of time\u201dThen, lines of text appeared\u201cIn accordance with promise, hiding Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal data, research results are to be used by Impartial Goddess with consideration\u201d\u201cAdding citizen Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Merit, based on his contribution of 21 groundbreaking scientific researches, calculated as follow:\u201d\u201cGu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Merit total: 799,873,957,281,439 points\u201d\u201cIncreasing Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Authority Level\u201d\u201cIn accordance to the Contribution to humanity civilization algorithm, calculating Gu Qing Shan\u2019s Authority Level\u201d\u201cCalculations complete, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s increased Authority Level is: Highest Leader\u201d\u201cFound personal data to contain crimes: Murder, Theft.

confused.Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice could be heard from the screen: \u201cAccording to humanity's history of strife, to protect a young person still in his growth for a long period, a solid figure like you backing him is necessary sir\u201dThe President deeply sighed and asked: \u201cThe reason why this person must be protected, you can tell me that at least\u201d\u201cIn accordance with our

up, that\u2019s a good idea, from this angle they can find out more about him without violating Impartial Goddess\u2019s agreement.Sure enough, Impartial Goddess spoke: \u201cSir President\u2019s Authority Level is: Highest Leader, General Zhang\u2019s Authority Level is: Leader, authorized access to this information\u201d\u201cGu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Authority Level is: Highest Leader\u201dThe President spat out all the tea he was drinking just now in surprise.Impartial Goddess once again spoke: \u201cGu Qing Shan\u2019s life is under threat at the moment, requesting sir President to make the arrangements\u201d\u201cJust talking won\u2019t stop people from Bai family\u201d the President said as he tries to regain his composure, using a handkerchief to wipe his mouth, \u201cZhang Martial Saint, please personally go, if it takes too long I\u2019m afraid he might not be alive anymore\u201d\u201cThe Confederate suddenly got another President out of nowhere\u2026 Fine, I also want to see, what kind of person he is\u201d\u2026.When Gu Qing Shan came, the Presidential office was already neck-deep in work.Inside the President\u2019s office, there was only the President standing at the window, looking at the capital\u2019s night sky.From afar, he looked like a normal old man with grey hair, basking in memory of his glory days.\u201cSir President, the person is safely brought back\u201d said General Zhang.The President immediately got back his spirit, the aura on him changed into a solemn but dignified feeling.He looks intently at Gu Qing Shan, then said smilingly: \u201cGood evening, should I call you student Gu, or Mr. Gu?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already expelled from school, so you can call me Mr. Gu\u201d said Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThen Mr. Gu, it was under the request of Impartial Goddess that I brought you here, I hope you don\u2019t mind\u201d said the President.\u201cI don\u2019t mind, in fact, I have to thank you for saving me\u201d Gu Qing Shan sincerely said.Right now his strength is still in its growth phase, if he has to face enemies that are too strong, he might not be able to finish them off.Not to mention, he was using the power of one person to face two whole aristocrat families.They definitely had more people that haven\u2019t joined the fray yet.If it had continued, when the time comes for him to go to the other world, he would have no choice but to go there to hide, returning after an hour.Then afterwards, he could only leave Chang Ning county and the Confederate itself.The President smiles, then became serious again, asking: \u201cMr. Gu, I don\u2019t know if this is appropriate, but as the President of the Confederate, I have to know why you\u2019ve gained so much attention from Impartial Goddess -----never before have the Goddess been this serious about a 17 year old citizen, as such right now I have to confirm that your existence will mean no harm to the Confederate as a whole\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s simple\u201d said Gu Qing Shan \u201cplease connect to Impartial Goddess\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here\u201d a solemn female voice was heard.The three people looked around, to find Gu Qing Shan\u2019s phone was lit up.Impartial Goddess have the ability to connect to every information electronic devices, so the three of them wasn\u2019t surprised.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then: \u201cPlease show what we\u2019ve made to the President and the General\u201d\u201cCitizen Gu Qing Shan, please confirm your authorization\u201d\u201cI authorize\u201dIt\u2019s fine to show them, since a few days later, after the Mech is done testing it would be delivered to Su Xue Er anyways.When that time comes, it would definitely come to light.He\u2019s just showing it to the President a bit prematurely.In history, this President was a person of respectable character, his governing was also excellent, if he has the chance to make a good relationship with him, Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t mind showing a bit of Mech technology that\u2019s ahead of the era.Regarding the game that begins one year later, when the time comes, it would also be appropriate to prepare for when he needs to borrow the nation\u2019s power.That way, there would be much fewer people that die.A screen showed up in front of the 3 people, revealing the Blazing Angel Mech currently on the S.W. Divine Temple.\u201cWhat is this? A Mech?\u201d General Zhang closely stares at the screen, his eyes not wanting to miss a single detail.\u201cIt seems to be a bit different from normal Mobile Mech Armors\u201dThe President wore his glasses, also seriously evaluating it.\u201cAuthorize demonstration mode, Authorize form 1 weapon system demonstration\u201d Gu Qing Shan spoke\u201cAuthorization received, demonstration begins\u201d Impartial Goddess answered.10 minutes later.The President\u2019s office is opened, everyone was moving about busily, preparing for a live news announcement.\u201cGeneral, please let me borrow him for a bit\u201d a fashionably dressed female personnel said.\u201cBe my guest, I\u2019ll be outside waiting, call me when things are about to start\u201d Zhang Zong Yang answered.Gu Qing Shan immediately was taken away by the woman, and put in front of a make-up table.The woman looked at him for a bit, nodding her head: \u201cLooks decently handsome enough, but for these kinds of occasions, a bit more formal is better\u201dShe took the powder brush, giving Gu Qing Shan a bit more shade on his face, giving orders to her assistance to prepare a few formal suits, another to prepare a bunch of different ties.\u201cCome, we\u2019ll pick out one that fits you best, to leave a good impression the first time they see you\u201d she excitedly spoke.Gu Qing Shan reluctantly sighs, sat down to let the woman do as she likes.On top of a skyscraper outside the Presidential office.Martial Saint Zhang Zong Yang was taking one puff after another out of his cigar, like this is the only way for him to calm down.As the Army supreme commander, a Saint-rank Martial artist, he has seen so many strange and unusual things in his life, but he still couldn\u2019t contain his excitement.\u201cThis kind of science, this type of Mobile Mech technology\u2026 Those idiots, why would they want to kill him\u201d Zhang Zong Yang shook his head.He suddenly remembered something, took out his phone and called a number.\u201cYou lot have a family gathering today correct? Very good, turn on the TV, wait for the President\u2019s official announcement\u201d\u201cRemember, do everything you can to stay friendly with the person next to the President, become his ally if possible, hell, try and get him to come to Military Academy\u201dRight as he hung up, another person called\u201cHm?

For what reason?\u201d the old man turned around, his tone changed.His questioning shout was dignified but not angry, yet the one who got questioned was shaking, glancing at Madame Su.Madame Su bowed her head and replied: \u201cI fired him, because I didn\u2019t want him to use our Su family\u2019s company, using that to get climb up to Su Xue Er\u201d\u201cClimb up?\u201d the old man\u2019s brows furrowed, his mouth almost grinding that word.Suddenly the person who was supposed to check the profile uttered in surprise and reported: \u201cIt\u2019s strange, my Authority Level isn\u2019t high enough so I can\u2019t check his personal records\u201dThe old man spoke: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer part of our company, of course you don\u2019t have the authority, use my Authority instead\u201dHe went forward, putting his hand on the Holo-Brain.\u201cWelcome to the Confederate personal record database, venerable sir Su Xing Chao\u201d\u201cRequest access to Chang Ning county\u2019s records under my jurisdiction, 17 years old male Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal scientific research record\u201dThe screen stopped for a bit, then showed a line of red text:\u201cHighest Top-secret\u201dThe electronic voice also responded: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your Authority Level is not enough, considering your distinguished status, I recommend you seek direct authorization from Gu Qing Shan\u201d\u201cMy Authority isn\u2019t enough?\u201dThe Su family\u2019s head Su Xing Chao opened his eyes wide, a glimmer of life flashed through.\u201cFather, there must be a mistake, your Authority Level is only below that of the President and the 3 Supreme Generals, how could you not check the record of a low-born poor brat\u201d Madame Su said.\u201cNo, Impartial Goddess won\u2019t make that kind of low-level mistake\u201d Su Xing Chao picked up his phone and dialed another number\u201cElder Su, how are you\u201d on the other side, a confident voice is heard.\u201cZhang Martial Saint, there\u2019s a matter I would have to trouble you with\u201d\u201cNo need to say that, please talk, I\u2019ll try my best to help\u201d\u201cGu Qing Shan----\u201c\u201cI\u2019m sorry, elder Su, there\u2019s nothing I could say to you about this person, because the matters involved are too serious, I\u2019m very sorry\u201dSu Xing Chao put down his phone, became silent for a while, then suddenly spoke again: \u201cThis sly fox, I\u2019m sure he knows something\u201dLooking at the red letters \u201cHighest Top-secret\u201d on the screen, Su Xing Chao felt extremely annoyed.Then he slapped his hand the table, ordered: \u201cImmediately prepare 100 million credits, donate it to the Confederate\u2019s scientific research department, have them transfer it to support Gu Qing Shan\u2019s research, we\u2019ll prepare manpower to support him as well\u201dHis assistant quickly prepared then spoke: \u201cIt\u2019s been done, please authorize\u201d\u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cConnecting to the scientific research department ------hm? We were interrupted\u201d\u201cInterrupted?\u201dProblems one after another, Su Xing Chao couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed as he personally looked at the screen.A line of text appeared on screen: \u201cFrom this year onward, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal scientific research funds will be fully provided by Impartial Goddess, no other methods of donation is required\u201dSu Xing Chao\u2019s pupils contracted, then he tried another way: \u201cThen directly donate the money to him, as support for his further education\u201dThe assistant wiped his sweat, quickly operated the procedures\u201cIt was also rejected by the System!\u201d he frightfully said.Even a direct donation is rejected? This has never happened before.All the people in power here raised their faces, wanting to see exactly what\u2019s happening.Then another line of text appeared on the screen.\u201cFrom this year onward, Impartial Goddess and the President of the Confederate will take full responsibility for citizen Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal spending, no one else is to interfere\u201dSu Xing Chao was stunned.Everyone else didn\u2019t even dare to breath out, silently waited for the family head\u2019s orders.\u201cHow regretful, a Highest Top-secret level researcher was actively fired by our Su family\u201d said Su Xing Chao as he shook his head.Madame Su didn\u2019t know what to say, only tried to explain herself again: \u201cI was afraid that this poor brat would taint our Su Xue Er, wanting to take one step to climb up to heaven\u201d\u201cYOU IDIOT!\u201dSu Xing Chao shouted with a thunderous voice, slapping Madame Su flying with one hand.He couldn\u2019t hold his anger in anymore and shouted: \u201cUse your head a little, how many years has it been since the Confederate had another Highest Top-secret science researcher, do you know how long? What level and what kind of research it is, did you look into it at all?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, it was 30 years ago, the research was the Interstellar warp jump technology that changed the world!\u201d\u201cPoor brat? One step to heaven? Hah!\u201d Su Xing Chao\u2019s anger not yet soothed, sarcastically continued: \u201cThe President himself is using his name to protect him, the Martial Saint wouldn\u2019t leak a single word about him. What about Impartial Goddess? Impartial Goddess is straight-up using taxpayer\u2019s money to fund him!\u201dHe looked at the confused and tearful Madame Su, continued without stopping: \u201cSuch a person, and you\u2019re still afraid they\u2019ll taint your daughter? Afraid that they\u2019ll use her to climb up? Ridiculous! Open your god damn eyes and look, right now I can't even climb up to him if I wanted to!\u201d\u201cFather, little Ling was only worried about our dear daughter so she didn\u2019t carefully consider everything\u201d Madame Su\u2019s husband stepped up, trying to follow up for his wife.Su Xing Chao\u2019s anger subsided a little, but still looked at them disappointedly: \u201cWorried about her daughter? Hah, worrying about your daughter requires you to kill someone? What experts you are at killing people, but total fools at hanging on to them! Do you not understand? Killing people will only lose other\u2019s loyalty, and gaining loyalty is the only true way to continue a family line!\u201dHe shook his head: \u201cLooking at the results, even your daughter is a hundred thousand times better at this than you are\u201dSu Xing Chao tiredly rubbed his forehead, then ordered everyone: \u201cFrom now on, no matter who it is, no one is to interfere with Su Xue Er\u2019s matters, no one is to offer any help either, that will only make yourself seem too desperate and make them hate you even more\u201d\u201cAlso, the matter of Bai family\u2019s marriage proposal, put it off, no need to make any reply\u201d\u201cYes sir\u201d\u201cSmooth out everything, I want to personally go to the capital to see my granddaughter\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes sir\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No need to lie to me, I\u2019m already a man with half his foot in the grave, petty tricks won\u2019t work on me\u201dThe Bai family head smiled, then answered: \u201cFrom my sources, that brat might have created quite the significant scientific breakthrough\u201dHe sighed: \u201cOur Bai family have also investigated, and according to Confederate law, as long as he\u2019s alive, his breakthrough can only be under his monopoly\u201dThe Nie family head squint his eyes: \u201cHow selfish, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re not pleased?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very not pleased\u201d\u201cBut then what method do you have to get this groundbreaking result that even shocked the President in your hands?\u201dThe Bai family head opened his hands and shrug, saying: \u201cYou know young people, always thinking about the perfect love, rescuing the damsel in distress and all that, our Bai family will deal with the brat, but first, your Nie family need to secure the Su family little miss\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019re on the same page\u201d the Nie family head stood up, using his cane to slowly leave.Suddenly he turned around, asking: \u201cLast 2 questions, if your answer can satisfy me, I\u2019ll act\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead\u201d\u201cThat girl, isn\u2019t she originally your family\u2019s target for marriage?\u201d\u201cElder Nie must be joking with me? Comparing immense profit with that, your choice and mine surely are the same\u201d\u201cThe second, are you not afraid of the President\u2019s wrath?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that good with history, but in the 300 years of our Confederate, I remember quite a few Presidents being assassinated?\u201dThe Nie family head stood there staring at him for a while, then finally: \u201cI\u2019ll look for an expert to deal with the Su family girl, the brat is your responsibility\u201d\u201cPlease be assured, when the time comes to reap the benefits, I won\u2019t forget the Nie family\u2019s efforts\u201d Bai family\u2019s head stood up and solemnly said.The Nie family head nodded, leaving satisfied.The Bai family head lit a cigar, as he finished half of it, suddenly: \u201cCome\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here\u201d\u201cPrepare the men, and make sure to observe Nie family, when they\u2019re done with their end of the deal, swiftly massacre them all, leave no one alive\u201d\u201cYes sir\u201dThe President\u2019s office.Everyone has already left, including Martial Saint Zhang Zong Yang, the only people left here are the President and Gu Qing Shan.\u201cSo, you really won\u2019t consider taking a position at the science research department?\u201d asked the President.\u201cYes, I still want to go to University\u201d said Gu Qing Shan.The President: \u201cEven though I\u2019m adopting you as my son only because of Impartial Goddess\u2019 deduction results, but taking time off at every chance you get really isn\u2019t a good idea, the easier things are, the easier you are to forget what you originally intended\u201dHe smiled kindly: \u201cYour education, I can take care of, let me at least do my duty as a parent\u201dGu Qing Shan sincerely responded: \u201cThank you for understanding and helping me like this\u201dThe President picked up the communicator on the table, smiling and said: \u201cOf course, with matters that relate to you, it\u2019s better to ask the Goddess first before arranging it\u201dThe communicator quickly connected.\u201cI\u2019m deciding to send Gu Qing Shan to Capital University, what do you think?\u201d the President asked.On the other side of the communicator, Impartial Goddess\u2019 rhythmic female voice sounded: \u201cAfter deduction, together with your opinion, the best place for Gu Qing Shan to be would be the science research department, the second best place would be the Confederate Military Academy, even though Capital University is ranked number one, both the Mech research facilities and security measures are disadvantageous to Gu Qing Shan\u2019s research\u201dThe President looked at Gu Qing Shan questioningly.Gu Qing Shan shrugged, gesturing that he\u2019s not against it.Confederate Military Academy is also one of the top 3 Universities in the Confederate, although their overall ranking isn\u2019t as high as Capital University, but their Mech research major is their strongest suit, much more suitable for himself.More importantly, both these Universities are very close to each other, so if he ever needs to meet up with Su Xue Er it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.Entering a University like this to learn, that definitely fit Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart desire.The President seeing that also silently nodded, his impression of Gu Qing Shan became slightly better.His life experience is vast, having met so many talented people, he knows them to always be very prideful, looks down on everything and everyone because of their talent, not to mention willful.Gu Qing Shan is so young, yet he\u2019s willing to listen to others\u2019 opinions, and very capable of thinking objectively.This point is very important, enough to affect his whole career afterwards.\u201cThen let\u2019s go with that, I also agree\u201d the President spoke.Impartial Goddess spoke: \u201cPlease authorize\u201d\u201cI authorize\u201d said the President.Impartial Goddess spoke: \u201cBegin profile loading and placement, calculating Gu Qing Shan\u2019s Merit\u201d\u201cCompleting appropriate placement\u201d\u201cAs this matter involves relatively high Authority Levels, I will require several minutes for special treatment before completion\u201dSeems like it\u2019ll be fine, the President nodded his head, turning his eyes from the communicator and looked at Gu Qing Shan: \u201cCome to my house tomorrow for lunch and to meet everyone else\u201dGu Qing Shan nodded: \u201cYes, then I will be troubling you, sir\u201dThe President laughed: \u201cNo trouble at all, every day I\u2019m too busy so all the meals are made by my chef anyways, I don\u2019t have the time to learn to cook for myself\u201dGu Qing Shan also smiled.\u201cAfter you enter University, try and make a few friends, since it\u2019s the Military Academy, after graduation you\u2019ll all be comrades, better knowing them sooner than later\u201d the President reminded him.\u201cYes, I understand\u201d Gu Qing Shan seriously nodded.If the President doesn\u2019t want their relationship to just be for show, and would rather treat him sincerely like this, then Gu Qing Shan also won\u2019t be a person who\u2019s hungry but refuses food out of courtesy.Right then, there was a knock on the door.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked the President.\u201cThe senate meeting has begun 10 minutes ago sir; it will be your turn to speak soon\u201d\u201cAh, I almost forgot\u201d the President slapped his head and stood up.Gu Qing Shan also stood up, saying: \u201cIt seems I\u2019ve troubled you\u201dWho would\u2019ve thought, I would still be able to enter University.The Military Academy is a good choice, backed by the Confederate Military, militarized forces are always stronger than a single person, so later when signs of the Apocalypse starts appearing, he might be able to deal with them better.A daily life of listening to lectures, reading books at the library, if he\u2019s not in a rush he could also find Su Xue Er to hang out.To be able to live a life like this before the Apocalypse, how great it will be.Gu Qing Shan is in high spirits.Then another person came, asking if the President is in his office.The President reminded him: \u201cI\u2019ll be going first, remember to come to the estate tomorrow for lunch\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cYes\u201dAs both of them leave the office, the President and his secretaries went to the meeting, Gu Qing Shan went with an assistant to leave the building.After everyone had left, the President\u2019s office doors closed and everything fell back into silence.A few minutes later, the communicator left on the President\u2019s office lit up again.Impartial Goddess\u2019 voice rang from it.\u201cAccording to Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Merit, Confederate Authorization Level, scientific research expertise, combined with a history of past Confederate training of scientific talents, the corresponding placement has been made\u201d\u201cPlacement results: Confederate Military Academy Mobile Mech major, Special Professor, under Confederate honorary allowance\u201d\u201cGu Qing Shan\u2019s personal records change

What exactly happened?\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s expression tensed up and tried to ask.Zhao Lu doesn\u2019t really understand military terms so even after a while couldn\u2019t explain what he saw.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t do anything but be patient and questioned him slowly, for every 3-4 questions, Zhao Lu would give an answer from memory.After a few minutes, Gu Qing Shan finally pieced everything together.The demon\u2019s dispatch yesterday wasn\u2019t the main army, only small squadrons of unique demons.These squadrons all have intricate equipment and considerable strength, in Zhao Lu\u2019s own words: \u201cLooks scary as hell, even fiercer than the ones from before\u201dThe demon squadrons all used their highest speed, and passed by the outpost gate on their way.To ensure both mobility and secrecy, the demons\u2019 numbers aren\u2019t too overwhelming, they also acted in silence.If Zhao Lu hadn\u2019t woken up to go to the toilet in the middle of the night, he wouldn\u2019t even have found out.After hearing Zhao Lu\u2019s story, Gu Qing Shan remembered the Faceless Giant and Bloodthirsters that appeared yesterday, becoming even more suspicious.The demon army dispatched so many elite troops, but what for?\u201cThis is the last year of peace right?\u201d he spoke questioningly.\u201cYeah, the last year of peace\u201d Zhao Lu nodded in agreement.Gu Qing Shan became even more confused.He has confirmed over and over that this is the first time that war broke out, both demons and humans are still testing each other\u2019s strength, both sides still haven\u2019t dispatched their strongest troops for an all-out battle.These demons that only appeared during the later stages of the war, all suddenly showed up here at once.Gu Qing Shan went silent and began to seriously recall the details of the past.He\u2019s already feeling a sense of unease.During the past life, he was the supreme commander of China\u2019s national guild, as well as the World Alliance Army\u2019s strategic General, so he\u2019s especially sensitive to military dispatches. (1)He has carefully spent time to research each and every single military campaign that happened in the game.Before, he had only just returned, plus his cultivation was so low, as well as the wounds on his body, so Gu Qing Shan had placed more attention on himself.But now when the situation changed again, he\u2019s once again using the eyes of a strategic General to seriously consider everything.Gu Qing Shan threw away all useless thoughts and begin compiling the facts.If the dispatch wasn\u2019t the main demon army, then whatever happens isn\u2019t happening on the main battlefield.Then the possibility of a direct attack can be ruled out.If so, would it be a raid?Gu Qing Shan closed his eyes and reviewed the map in his map again.His own squad was stationed at the frontline, right now already considered the fallen sector.In the vicinity, would there be any humanity strongholds or fortresses that are worth the demons dispatching their strongest elite squadrons to attack?The closest humanity stronghold is right outside the border town, about 1000 kilometers away.So there\u2019s no humanity targets that are worth a raid around this area.If so, he can also rule out the chance of a raid.After ruling out two possibilities, Gu Qing Shan became even more nervous.Could it be, an assassination operation?Gu Qing Shan silently thought.During this one year, there were many strong cultivators of humanity that died in battle.During the sudden outbreak of war, which important human cultivators were assassinated by the demons?Names rushed through Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind one after another.As he recalls, he\u2019s also ruling them out one by one.Suddenly, Gu Qing Shan remembered two people.Two shockingly brilliant people, two figures that stood out in history.Many historians later came to the conclusion that if either of them were to not die before the war fully broke out, the direction of history could\u2019ve been turned.Gu Qing Shan suddenly asked: \u201cWhat month and date is it today?\u201dZhao Lu scratched his head and answered: \u201cThe 7th of June\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s heart jumped, that\u2019s it!The Holy Gates Grand elder, formation Grandmaster Gong Sun Zhi, fell in battle on the 8th of June.Heaven\u2019s Limit Sect, Heaven\u2019s Limit Saintess Ning Yue Xi, fell in battle on the 9th of June.Gong Sun Zhi was surrounded by 3 million demons and died of exhaustion inside his own formation.Ning Yue Xi was surrounded by 5 demon generals and fought a hard battle for one day and night before dying.Many players that saw this history record was completely flabbergasted, unable to understand.Because formations are known to be the best at hiding and evading, even at its weakest it could trap the enemy.Of all the clans and sects, Gong Sun Zhi was a man who brought formation to its very limit, a formation Grandmaster that almost rivalled the heaven itself.With his skills, accidentally trapping himself inside to be surrounded by millions of demons is completely nonsensical.Heaven\u2019s Limit Saintess Ning Yue Xi death was particularly tragic.Heaven\u2019s Limit Sect was one of the strongest sects in the world of cultivation, Ning Yue Xi being so young yet she was already its Saintess, her cultivation and talents are both considered top-notch in the whole world of cultivation.Such a talented and brilliant girl, was surrounded by 5 demon generals, fought for a whole day and night, finally died of exhaustion.If she could just send out any message at all, within that one day and night, there definitely would have been strong people who came to her rescue.But right until the moment she died, no one in humanity\u2019s top brass even noticed that she had been fighting the demon army for one day and night.A great cultivator once confirmed, if Gong Sun Zhi hadn\u2019t died, the first campaign\u2019s results might not have been a loss; and if Ning Yue Xi hadn\u2019t died, in just a few dozen years, she would\u2019ve had the ability to rival even the Nine Hells Demon King, changing the fate of humanity.But that is only a sigh of grief, as history had already happened, and the people in later years saying \u201cwhat if\u2026\u201d didn\u2019t change a thing.Gu Qing Shan paced back and forth, silently thinking.Today is already the 7th of June, in just 2 days, both of these legendary characters will have died one after another.The reason the demon army dispatched their elite squadrons, is probably this.The place where these two legends died was\u2026Gu Qing Shan silently recalled, very quickly remembered and cross referenced with his mental map.Sure enough, the place was not far from here, about 100 kilometers.That\u2019s right, Gu Qing Shan could feel his thoughts cleared up.If two human cultivators as powerful as them showed up in demon territory, it would definitely cause the demons to rush to surround and eliminate them.This level of an encirclement battle, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s measly qi training stage 5 cultivation, he couldn\u2019t even get close.Even the weakest demons on the outer ring used for alert could easily kill him.For him, the only thing that he could do would be to take the chance and run back to humanity\u2019s area of control.Take the chance when the demon\u2019s attention is still focused on the two legends and run away from this fallen sector.Gu Qing Shan quickly made his decision.Under a situation like this, as long as he runs the opposite direction of where they are, he should be able to avoid most dangers.A journey from this outpost to the stronghold outside border city would take about one day and one night.It isn\u2019t a short journey, and the dangers he could face on the way are numerous, but still much better than staying still at this outpost that\u2019s about to be destroyed.If he wants to go, he has to take this chance when the two legends are still in battle with the demon army to leave as quickly as possible!Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t even rest, quickly checked the items on his body.Snake blood, snake teeth, snake liver, all here; the military bow is still in good condition, not many arrows left, so he will have to replenish them before he leaves.The military machete won\u2019t do much, but at least it\u2019s a weapon, for the off-chance that he might get into close combat.\u201cPack up quickly, we have to leave now\u201dGu Qing Shan cleaned up his items, also telling Zhao Lu to prepare\u201cLeave? Leave where?\u201d Zhao Lu opened his eyes wide and asked.He was still holding the newly seasoned dried demon beast meat, about to dry it out under the roof.\u201cLeaving this fallen sector, towards humanity\u2019s stronghold, of course\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.Zhao Lu hesitated: \u201cBut\u2026 but we already found the spirit stones, using the formation, we can just hide here for another while\u201dGu Qing Shan spoke: \u201cThis Invisibility formation is effective for demons before Golden Core realm, above that, just one glance and they\u2019ll be able to see through it\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe demon called Faceless Giant from a few days ago, it already discovered us, but because it was on a mission, plus we were just ants to it so it didn\u2019t bother to do anything\u201dZhao Lu took a step backwards, then another, shaking his head: \u201cBrother Gu, why are you telling me lies, what good is there to lie to me\u201dGu Qing Shan kept patiently explained: \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, this area will soon become a battlefield, if we still want to live to have to quickly leave\u201dZhao Lu: \u201cDidn\u2019t you just go out to hunt beasts? How do you know these things?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cJust looking at the demon dispatches and I already know, don\u2019t worry, this is the only thing I won\u2019t be wrong about\u201dZhao Lu kept shaking his head: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong! You have to be wrong, the outside is too dangerous, I can lose my life at any time! If you want to leave so much then go, I\u2019m not leaving!\u201dGu Qing Shan thought about the Healing pills he received from him, sighed and tried to convince him again: \u201cCome with me, this place won\u2019t hold, losing your life will just be a matter of time\u201dZhao Lu still shook his head: \u201cGoing outside is more dangerous, the outpost has a formation, this place is very safe, and the human main army will soon reclaim this place anyways\u201dGu Qing Shan tried to convince him again, but seeing Zhao Lu\u2019s firm attitude, plus the begrudging look in his eyes, he gave up.\u201cI hope you understand your choice\u201d Gu Qing Shan serious said once more \u201cwhen the demons come, it\u2019ll be too late for you to regret\u201dZhao Lu stood firm, not saying a word.Gu Qing Shan seeing that reluctantly turned around and left, not looking back at the outpost any longer.Finally, when Gu Qing Shan\u2019s back couldn\u2019t be seen anymore, Zhao Lu spat out\u201cBullshit! Going out is more dangerous, those soldiers all died in the mouth of demons because they left in the first place\u201d\u201cEveryone else is in the dead pit now, only I\u2019m alive\u201d\u201cI thought you were reinforcement, but turned out to just be a newbie that got lost, fooling me into taking care of you for days for nothing\u201d\u201cRidiculous, if you want to die then go by yourself, trying to lie to me\u201dZhao Lu angrily got back into the outpost.Note:(1) China: in the raw it also said China, so I assume the author meant that China is a real country in this world and not that he made a mistake. Seeing how Gu Qing Shan was essentially considered a low-life criminal in the Confederate in the past life as well as how Impartial Goddess does thing, him becoming a strong character in the game wouldn\u2019t have changed that fact. The other 2 big nations also wouldn\u2019t have discovered or valued his talents too much, so it makes sense that he would be at another country (remember, it\u2019s an established fact that there are more than just 3 countries in this world, just that there are 3 big ones that more worth mentioning more than the others)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you have a badge?\u201dThe old man threw his badge at him, Gu Qing Shan took it and put in a bit of spirit energy.The badge immediately lit up, a flame rose from the badge, turned into a string of fire that spelled out a few words\u201cDing Yuan General Gong Sun Zhi\u201d (TN: Ding Yuan is a frontline general title)Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart sank.Human cultivator, alliance Ding Yuan General, the Holy Gates Grand Elder, formation Grandmaster Gong Sun Zhi!Why is it him!When I left the outpost, I clearly went in the opposite direction of where he was surrounded, so why is he here?He\u2019s going to die very soon, if I meet him right here, doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m also going to be surrounded by demons as well?Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind quickly moved, he suddenly had a bad premonition.He also threw his badge over for the other party to check.Both sides became slightly less nervous.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cSo it was General Sun Zhi, can I ask why you are here alone?\u201dGong Sun Zhi sighed, then took out a small intricate formation plate, placed both hands on it and shouted: \u201cSix-trigram Hidden formation, open!\u201dGu Qing Shan felt the scenery before him changed, everything quickly moved away, then as he blinked, he\u2019s already standing in front of a Daoist temple.Outside the Daoist temple, all four directions are empty, making him unable to tell what is near or far with the naked eye.So inside this mountain range there was a hidden Daoist temple!Such a high level of formation arrangement, this person is without a doubt Gong Sun Zhi.Gu Qing Shan followed Gong Sun Zhi into the Daoist temple, only to see another person sitting on a cushion, wearing gold color armor and a snow-white cloak.This person\u2019s armor isn\u2019t bulky but actually appeared to be flexible and delicate, showing the slender figure under it.The female slightly lowered her head, but when Gong Sun Zhi and Gu Qing Shan walked halfway, she found that he wasn\u2019t even a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator, and once again raised it up.As she raised her head, Gu Qing Shan saw on her face a silver mask that completely covered it.\u201cYoung friend Qing Shan, I\u2019m thankful that you made the Grounded Devil legion disperse, otherwise we would\u2019ve been stuck here\u201d\u201cHim? Dispersed a Grounded Devil legion?\u201d a clear female voice can be heard.The female in gold armor sound surprised, but her silver mask did not show any change in emotions.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d, Gong Sun Zhi said \u201cGrounded Devils awoken to Earth-element are able to change and control the soil, affecting my formations greatly, fortunately, they were fooled by him\u201d\u201cFooled?\u201dThe female in gold armor sounds even more surprised.Gong Sun Zhi told her everything from the start.The female in gold armor now looks directly at Gu Qing Shan and asked: \u201cHow did you know this demon\u2019s weakness?\u201dGu Qing Shan already thought of an excuse for himself, calmly replied: \u201cI was a soldier in the frontline, everyday meeting too many demons to count, so I observed their behaviors and became quite well-versed\u201d\u201cThe frontline? Then that explains it\u201d said the female in gold armor \u201cFrom what I know, the frontline was already defeated by the demon\u2019s main army, presumed to be wiped out completely, you might be the only one left alive\u201dGu Qing Shan took the chance and showed a look of sadness.Gong Sun Zhi on the other hand looked delighted and asked: \u201cThen, do you know about other demons well too?\u201dThe first time that the human and demon army clashed, since they couldn\u2019t tell the special characteristics of the demons yet, they were at a serious disadvantage.Quite a few army legions were completely wiped out, not even a bit of information could be sent back, and so the backline still don\u2019t have a clue as to how strong the demons are.If a surviving frontline army soldier were to return, and brought with him the intelligence regarding the characteristics of demons, the war could take a huge turn.\u201cI know quite a few of them\u201d Gu Qing Shan directly answered.The spirit energy on these two people feel as deep as the sea, plus Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t be sure how they would treat him, so he took the initiative to show them his value.Sure enough, Gong Sun Zhi and the female in gold armor looked at each other and lightly nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

by: La0o9\u201cCan I ask what your name is?\u201dGu Qing Shan was curious and couldn\u2019t help but ask the female in gold armor.The female hesitated for a bit, then answered: \u201cI am Ning Yue Xi\u201dSo it was her!The famous Ning Yue Xi, Heaven\u2019s Limit Saintess Ning Yue Xi, the brilliant and talented Ning Yue Xi.The dream lover of all male cultivators, Ning Yue Xi herself!Ning Yue Xi sat silently, waiting for the usual sounds of exclamation, the eyes boiling with desires, together with the nauseating pledge of protection.Each and every time she meets a male cultivator, no matter who it is, they always go through the same old script.Yet they always forget, Ning Yue Xi herself is stronger compared to the majority of them, and definitely would not need their protection.Of course they can\u2019t be helped, because the person in front of them is Ning Yue Xi.Gong Sun Zhi also waited a bit, leaving time for Gu Qing Shan to express himself.After all, he did trick the Grounded Devils legion to leave and helped them not be stuck here, this small favor he can do.But even after a while, Gu Qing Shan still didn\u2019t do anything, didn\u2019t say anything, he didn\u2019t even react.Hm?The two of them surprised, only to see Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face in deep thought, his brows furrowed to their utmost.What a strange person, Ning Yue Xi silently commentedYou really can\u2019t blame Gu Qing Shan, because what he\u2019s seeing right now is completely unexpected, having strayed very far from the history he knows.He\u2019s fallen into deep thought.------these two people that are about to die, why are they at the same place?What exactly changed history?Including Gu Qing Shan, no player knew that before they died, these two people were at the same place.In history records, the places where they fell in battle were very far apart from each other.But now that\u2019s no longer true.Gu Qing Shan became very nervous.The now-changed history contains so many mysteries that he can\u2019t explain, while the shadows of death keep creeping closer and closer.The fact that the Grounded Devils surrounded them means they have been discovered by the demon army once more.Even if Gu Qing Shan were to run away right now, even if Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi let him run away, with his speed he won\u2019t get very far.And afterwards, when the demon army starts their encirclement, a lowly qi training realm cultivator like Gu Qing Shan will die with the smallest of mistakes.How or what could he possibly do to save his life right now?Gu Qing Shan forced himself to calm down.The Holy Gates and Heaven\u2019s Limit Sect are at least 10,000 kilometers away from each other, so they don\u2019t exactly have a close relationship.Gong Sun Zhi is a senior cultivator, while Ning Yue Xi is a rising talent of this generation, from the history records, you could see that they\u2019ve seldom met during their lives, possibly not even once.If that\u2019s the case, then the only reason why these two are here together would be because they\u2019re on a military mission.Yes, definitely, they have to be on some sort of mission, or is accomplishing some sort of task.Whatever it is, it must be extremely important, enough for the demon army to dispatch so much force to fish them out like this.Tomorrow, Gong Sun Zhi would be the first to fall ---------dying in his own large-scale defensive formation.From the look of it, he did that on purpose, in order to draw the demon army\u2019s attention and give Ning Yue Xi room to retreat.A day after, Ning Yue Xi fell extremely close to a humanity stronghold.She had almost made it back to humanity\u2019s territory, but got caught up by the 5 demon generals, fought hard for one day and night until she died.During that one day and night, she couldn\u2019t even send a single communication talisman back, so no one came to save her.Gong Sun Zhi sacrificed himself to let Ning Yue Xi escape, while Ning Yue Xi was surrounded, not receiving any reinforcements and died.Such a strange thing to happen, if he didn\u2019t already know about it, then he wouldn\u2019t believe it either.And then there was another mystery ------what exactly did they do, to cause the demon army to go mad to this extent.In the past life, these shocking mysteries got lost in the long river of history together with their deaths.But now!But now!The location isn\u2019t right!This place is very far from where they\u2019re supposed to fall, even if Gong Sun Zhi were to rush there without minding death, he wouldn\u2019t make it to where he should die.This is ridiculous, doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.Wait a minute.Gu Qing Shan suddenly thought of something.\u201cGreetings, Saintess\u201d, Gu Qing Shan put his fist into his palm, couldn\u2019t wait and asked directly: \u201cWhen I was at the outpost, I saw a Faceless Giant and a squad of Bloodthirster Demons pass by, were they in pursuit of you?\u201dNing Yue Xi waited for so long, yet only received an interrogation-like question like that, completely not expecting it.Don\u2019t these males usually try to act all fancy when facing me before they could speak normally again?She didn\u2019t think too much of it and answered: \u201cAt first they were very close on our tails, but all of a sudden, they passed our location, giving time for us to change direction and escape all the way here\u201dGu Qing Shan confirmed his suspicion and took out the blood-color jade piece from before.So that was it.I killed that demon bird who was carrying the latest intelligence on the two of them.After I killed it I even burned the corpse, so the Faceless Giant didn\u2019t receive the orders.Purely by coincidence, Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi were able to get away at that time.And that\u2019s why they veered off the course of fate, appearing here.---------so the problem started with me.Just like a butterfly flapping its wings, he caused a very small deviation in a history that was supposed to happen. (1)Gu Qing Shan could only wryly laugh.My cultivation is so low, I really just wanted to stay as far from them as possible to find a way to survive.What unpredictable fate, who knew what I unintentionally did would really create a path for them to survive.All I wanted to do was avoid danger, yet here I am with both of these legendary characters.It\u2019s probably already too late to leave now.These two\u2019s fates are already tied to himself, if they die, Gu Qing Shan alone will not be able to get away from the encirclement of the demons.It\u2019s a dead-end.As soon as he saw the blood color jade, Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s face changed.He swiped the air, taking the jade in hand and infused spirit energy into it.A demonic raspy voice could be heard from the jade piece.\u201cTargets at moving Southward, Eastward 726, Southward 94; order: Faceless Giant, Bloodthirster on full pursuit\u201dGong Sun Zhi is a bright person, only needed to think for a bit before: \u201cThe Faceless Giant and Bloodthirster were chasing us, that means, you killed the messenger?\u201d\u201cIt was a coincidence, when I met the messenger it was already wounded\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied in detail.Gong Sun Zhi seriously observed the jade piece, breathed out slowly and confirmed: \u201cThe jade piece is real\u201dHe looked at Ning Yue Xi.Ning Yue Xi rubbed her chin: \u201cHe\u2019s not lying, my Spirit Beast was able to wound the messenger, but not kill it\u201dShe asked again: \u201cYour cultivation haven\u2019t reached Foundation Establishment yet, so you definitely couldn\u2019t catch up the demon army\u2019s messenger, how did you kill it?\u201dGu Qing Shan tapped the military bow and answered: \u201cI like to use the bow, after a while I became decently skilled, and so I succeeded\u201dLooking at the suspicion in their eyes, Gu Qing Shan knew he had to prove it to them.Taking the bow in hand, Gu Qing Shan drew some arrows and shot.Shifting Flurry!Rapid Fire!Grey shadows flashed quickly and turned into flying snakes and dragons.Thwock!Dozens of arrows made the sound at the same time, all hitting the Yin Yang decoration on top of the Daoist temple.(1): A butterfly flapping its wings: this is a reference to the Butterfly Effect. Essentially, it\u2019s saying that even a small flap of a butterfly\u2019s wings are capable of causing a huge domino effect in another place without the butterfly ever knowing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even your personal Inventory bags should have things like Healing pills and Antidote right?\u201dNing Yue Xi turned away and replied: \u201cAlready used up\u201dGong Sun Zhi wryly smiled and said: \u201cWe went into demon territory to find their secrets, but was found by the Nine Hells Demon King and chased for more than 20 days, everything we had on hand we already used ------right now I don\u2019t even have a Healing pill on me\u201dGu Qing Shan suddenly understood.So Saintess Ning Yue Xi\u2019s situation was that bad, even the most basic of supplies were cut off to them.That\u2019s why when she was surrounded by the 5 demon generals for one day and night she got exhausted and died.She really was the single most regretful death in the history of humanity.Gu Qing Shan searched himself, like he wanted to find something.When Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi saw that, their eyes also lit up for a moment.That\u2019s right, maybe this young man has some utility pills that they can use.Just as they thought that, Gu Qing Shan had already lowered his hand and said: \u201cMy apologies, I also don\u2019t have any more Healing-type pills on me\u201dThe two of them was a little disappointed.Ning Yue Xi was also a bit angry -------if you don\u2019t have anything then why even bother search!\u201cLet\u2019s go, we have no time to waste\u201d Gong Sun Zhi turned around and said.\u201cWait a minute\u201dGu Qing Shan suddenly remembered.He took out a leather bag and poured out a dimly shining snake liver.\u201cDemon snake liver, it\u2019s quite rare, possibly might be able to help with your poison and wounds\u201dGu Qing Shan said as he held the snake liver in hand.Gong Sun Zhi took a look and was incredibly pleased.\u201cIt\u2019s not just \u2018might be able to\u2019, it will definitely help! Demon snake liver can refill vitality and cure poison at the same time, just the right thing we need! Just the right thing we need!\u201dGong Sun Zhi quickly urged: \u201cSaintess, you\u2019re saved, eat it quickly\u201dNing Yue Xi looked at the snake liver in his hand in surprise.With her knowledge, of course she knows how valuable and critical this snake liver is to her current situation.But this scene also made her remember about an old painful memory.Ning Yue Xi asked: \u201cYou\u2019re giving me this snake liver, then what about yourself?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t expect that question, answered truthfully: \u201cI\u2019ll be fine\u201dNing Yue Xi was silent like water, spoke with a low voice: \u201cYour cultivation is so low, it\u2019s possible that something could happen to you, why aren\u2019t you keeping it for yourself?\u201dGu Qing Shan surprised again.My cultivation is too low?Something might happen to me?Miss, aren\u2019t we just chatting a bit here!Gu Qing Shan glared at her silver mask, couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cAre you going to eat or not, if not I\u2019ll throw it away\u201dEven if Ning Yue Xi\u2019s a well-mannered person, she couldn\u2019t help but glared back at him behind her mask.What\u2019s with that attitude, what do you mean if I won\u2019t eat you\u2019ll throw it again, what\u2019s with him?She bit her lip, unable to immediately decide whether to accept it or not.This snake liver is a hundred times more valuable than a normal Antidote, just eating it can cure the poison inside her body, as well as triggering her blood essence to rejuvenate her body.Snake demons aren\u2019t very strong, but they only come out to eat once a year, and after their meal they\u2019ll retreat into the heart of the mountain, sleeping for another whole year.After 365 years of this, when a snake demon evolves into a wyvern demon, it will leave its old nest to search for a place with 5-elemental spirits to nurture its soul, preparing to evolve into a dragon.It\u2019s incredibly hard to run into a snake demon.This snake liver, the quality looks about to be 300 years old, a rare treasure among treasures.Yet he\u2019s just giving it to her like that.If it was at any other time, if Ning Yue Xi wasn\u2019t in a state of exhaustion, her body already poisoned, and he just happens to give her a demon snake liver like this, Ning Yue Xi wouldn\u2019t have felt anything of it.But it\u2019s because of a situation like this, that made her recall the painful memory that she has.At the time, when she had just entered Heaven\u2019s Limit Sect, Ning Yue Xi already drew the attention of everyone with her cultivation talents.As she aged, her brilliant beauty also started to show for everyone to see.Time passed, and she was almost always surrounded by fellow cultivators in her sect, trying to gain her favor.It was when she was a teenager that she was impressed by an equally talented senior brother and agreed to start getting closer to him.But suddenly during a trial, the two of them got stuck in an ancient ruin that was surrounded by poisonous miasma, unable to escape for months.That senior brother had crudely planned a trap, to kill her, to steal the last Antidote pill that was remaining in her Inventory Bag.Ning Yue Xi could still remember the deranged face of that senior brother, his mad shouting.\u201cDamned bitch, give me the Antidote!\u201dThat, was Ning Yue Xi\u2019s birthday, as well as the first time she ever killed a person.From that day onwards, Ning Yue Xi shut off her heart, fully concentrated on the path of cultivation.But now, another time of crisis, another time that she got poisoned, yet a young man could nonchalantly give away the snake liver that would save her life and, and even said: \u201cAre you going to eat or not, if not I\u2019ll throw it away\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Could it possibly be Tianma\u2026\u201d (TN: lit. Heaven\u2019s Devils)He took out a small dark-red formation plate, moving his hands on it.The formation plate didn\u2019t react.Gong Sun Zhi calmed down, looked at Ning Yue Xi a bit, then at Gu Qing Shan and shut his mouth.If it\u2019s not a soul eater Tianma, Ning Yue Xi won\u2019t have any problems, this is just something between Ning Yue Xi and Gu Qing Shan, so Gong Sun Zhi won\u2019t interfere.All things contain karma, this time\u2019s favor of saving her life of course contains immense karma, so Ning Yue Xi will have to decide for herself, as no one else will be able to.Gu Qing Shan looked at Ning Yue Xi, a bit anxious.The demon army is already approaching, why is this girl just sitting there and not taking the time to recover?When the demon army comes, forget the other demons, even a Faceless Giant alone will make things extremely complicated.As Gu Qing Shan thought that, he couldn\u2019t wait anymore, just took Ning Yue Xi\u2019s hand and put the liver in it.He loudly shouted: \u201cWhy are you still just sitting there, if you don\u2019t want to die then quickly heal your wounds!\u201dGong Sun Zhi\u2019s face twisted a bit, looked at Ning Yue Xi nervously, about to say something to pacify her.This youth really dared touch Ning Yue Xi\u2019s hands, does he not know how Ning Yue Xi treats people that touched her without permission?In the last few years, everyone who dares do that already became crippled, unable to cultivate anymore for the rest of their lives.As the two of them stared at her, Ning Yue Xi finally moved.She just stared at Gu Qing Shan, then said: \u201cGive me half an hour, I\u2019ll need to expel the poison\u201dA bit unexpected, Gong Sun Zhi furrowed his brows.Since when was the Saintess Ning Yue Xi that easy to talk to?Hah, women really are fickle, even harder to understand than formations, Gong Sun Zhi silently shook his head.Gu Qing Shan satisfied with that, hurriedly said: \u201cThat\u2019s fine\u201dThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, to fight you must have a healthy body.Even though he doesn\u2019t know what realm Ning Yue Xi is at, but in the past life, even when she was heavily wounded and without any supplies she was still able to fight 5 demon generals for a whole day and night, so her strength must be quite considerable.Ning Yue Xi slightly bowed her head, spoke with a low voice: \u201cThank you very-----\u201cNing Yue Xi couldn\u2019t even finish her sentence as Gu Qing Shan already wasn\u2019t looking at her anymore, instead pulling Gong Sun Zhi to one side and talked to him:\u201cSince we have some time, senior Sun Zhi, I have read a few military books, being a bit knowledgeable on this matter, I have a few things I would like to ask you about\u201dThis is a formation Grandmaster, a Ding Yuan General of humanity\u2019s alliance, a legendary person in history.There\u2019s even historians who said that he had died too soon, otherwise the flow of war would have changed.Gu Qing Shan was also a strategist in the past life, meeting Gong Sun Zhi like this, he felt like he\u2019s met his match, already eager to polish his skills since a while ago.Gong Sun Zhi seeing the boiling look in his eyes, a bit confused but still answered: \u201cVery well\u201dGu Qing Shan immediately: \u201cYou\u2019ve been at the frontline since the start, in the Southwest stronghold, why did you decide to station 2 squads of 5-Elements spell users?\u201dGong Sun Zhi: \u201cThis, I felt that it had 3 main advantages\u2026\u201dThe two of them quickly got into gear.Ning Yue Xi went back to the cushion, hesitated for a bit then decided to take off her mask.As her inner sight flowed out to observe the other two, she could tell they didn\u2019t turn around, nor did they use their inner sight to observe her.Gong Sun Zhi is a world famous Dao idiot, his whole life only devoted to study the art of formations, he didn\u2019t even bother to find a Dao companion, saying that it wastes too much time. (1) (2) (3)She wasn\u2019t surprised that Gong Sun Zhi didn\u2019t take notice of her, but why is that damn guy also like that?Ning Yue Xi ate the snake liver bit by bit, occasionally glanced only to see that Gu Qing Shan was very seriously asking Gong Sun Zhi about issues of military formations and strategies.As Ning Yue Xi eavesdropped for a bit, she could tell he\u2019s not just doing it for show, as the matters he asked are all very deep, even Gong Sun Zhi had to think for a bit before he could answer.However, that also piqued Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s interest, as he was discussing with Gu Qing Shan about a certain strategy.Gong Sun Zhi himself is a talented person, his eyes are even higher than his head, so he doesn\u2019t even bother to respect the masters of many sects, yet here he was seriously discussing strategies with a youth back and forth, extremely excited.This is rare.Ning Yue Xi at first was surprised, then a bit annoyed.--------right now I\u2019m not wearing my mask you know.So many cultivators hesitated on the battlefield and lost their lives simply because they wanted to see my face for a bit longer.The mask was worn to prevent others from seeing it, but now that she\u2019s taken it off, why isn\u2019t he looking?Ning Yue Xi after finishing the snake liver silently wore her mask again.She could feel a hint of dissatisfaction in her heart.But very quickly, Ning Yue Xi closed her eyes and started to treat her wounds, these strange thoughts quickly dissipated._________The outpost.Zhao Lu dismantled about half the rooms, stacking the wood neatly to one side.The cold winter is coming so he\u2019s preparing the wood to keep warm.Even though there aren\u2019t much supplies left in the outpost, freshwater and spice are still plenty enough.The demon beasts that were hunted are still stored here, when Gu Qing Shan left he only took a bit to use as rations, the rest were carefully seasoned by Zhao Lu and preserved here.The formation is still active, Zhao Lu counted the time and quickly changed out the Spirit Stones.Zhao Lu could feel his life here to be decent and safe.Humanity\u2019s alliance only need to organize a counterattack in the next few days, and he will be saved.A military cook, alive, alone in the fallen sector of the frontline, that would probably cause a huge uproar.This kind of heroism, just wait until he comes back home, he will definitely be welcomed by his family.At that time, thanks to his awesome reputation, he will be able to marry a decent wife, living the rest of his life proudly.As Zhao Lu was thinking, suddenly there was a loud bang outside the outpost.A giant foot stepped down from the sky, causing the earth to shake.And then another foot.Just a few moments later, the roaring has already gone away.Zhao Lu looked at the giant creature walking away, he suddenly felt that he has become a bit braver after seeing it for so many times.That guy said this was a chaos species demon, called Faceless Giant.No matter what kind of demon you are, as long as I have the Invisibility formation I\u2019ll be safe.After seeing it so many times, Zhao Lu even started to feel like the demon isn\u2019t much to fear.It\u2019s just that, this demon\u2019s started to appear more often.Almost like it\u2019s looking for something, but unable to find it.As Zhao Lu was thinking, the earth shaking sound could be heard again from afar.The sound of footsteps approaching again.Zhao Lu sighed, a bit annoyed, he\u2019ll just wait until the footsteps disappear and go back inside the barracks to rest.Not long after, the footstep sound went away again.Zhao Lu yawned as he went towards the barracks.Accidentally looking at the outpost gates, he immediately stopped his feet.The horrible giant feet were standing right outside the outpost.The sky became dark, as the whole outpost was covered by a shadow.Zhao Lu looked up only to see a terrifying giant hand that covered the whole sky reaching down towards him.The thin layer of spirit light surrounding the outpost popped like a bubble in front of the giant hand.No.Zhao Lu looked at the giant hand coming closer and closer, suddenly hearing Gu Qing Shan\u2019s persuasion again.Endless regret rushed to him as Zhao Lu screamed.\u201cPlease no! Please don\u2019t eat me!\u201dThese were the last words that Zhao Lu uttered in this world.Note:(1) Dao: this is probably a familiar term to everybody, but just in case. Dao is a system of belief in ancient China, known for its pursuit of the mystics, similar to alchemists in the West, most Daoist seek to create the philosopher's stone in order to attain immortality, but Daoist are also known to hold power over the mystics, dispelling ghosts and demons and the likes. Nowadays, and especially in novels, Dao have many different meanings, but essentially it is the seeking of the truth of the world, whatever that might be.(2) Dao idiot: this is a liberal translation, just like sword idiot or battle junkie, the word means someone that only care about pursuing the meaning of Dao. A literal translation would be \"a person obssessed with Dao\"(3) Dao companion: essentially a spouse, a word only used for cultivators.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

by: La0o9Half an hour passed quickly.Ning Yue Xi opened her eyes to hear Gong Sun Zhi was talking.Gong Sun Zhi said: \u201cAs soon as we came back, we already sent out communication talismans asking for help\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cThat\u2019s strange, I was at an outpost for several days but I\u2019ve not seen any dispatched troops from humanity\u2019s army\u201dGong sun Zhi angrily: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing strange at all, because we found out by chance during this investigation that there were traitors in humanity\u2019s top brass\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why!\u201dGu Qing Shan was shocked.No wonder, the two legendary characters had to fend for themselves amongst the demon\u2019s army, yet the human\u2019s army didn\u2019t even send out a single soldier to aid them.It\u2019s possible that both their communication talismans were already intercepted and disposed of by those traitors, so no one knows about their dire situation.It could also be that the human\u2019s army have already been dispatched elsewhere, thus not having the time to go into the demon\u2019s territory.If that\u2019s really the case, then this situation just got a lot more dangerous.Gong Sun Zhi was observing Gu Qing Shan, suddenly asked: \u201cYoung man, are you a part of any sect or clan?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cI\u2019m just a lone cultivator, if this time we are able to return alive, I was planning to join the early spring semester test next year\u201d (1)Gong Sun Zhi then said: \u201dDuring the semester test, go straight to The Holy Gates and tell them my name\u201dNing Yue Xi glanced at him a bit surprised.What\u2019s this, he actually caught Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s eyes?As the two of them noticed she has woken up, they looked at her as if to ask if she was better.Ning Yue Xi: \u201cThe poison has been expelled, my wounds are also healing\u201dGong Sun Zhi happily: \u201cThat\u2019s great to hear!\u201dAs long as there is no poison to complicate things, with Ning Yue Xi\u2019s cultivation and the snake liver\u2019s revitalizing effects, her body will soon recover to its peak.Ning Yue Xi slowly stood up and bowed respectfully towards Gu Qing Shan: \u201cFor saving my life, thank you!\u201dIn this crisis situation, to be able to expel poison in her body as well as slowly heal all the wounds isn\u2019t that much different from getting another life.Gu Qing Shan quickly waved his hand dismissively and said: \u201cWe can talk formalities later, right now we have to immediately leave\u201d\u201cShould we use an airship?\u201d Gong Sun Zhi suggested.\u201cWe can\u2019t\u201d, Ning Yue Xi answered \u201cAs soon as the airship lifts off the whole demon army will notice, right now we\u2019re key figures that they want to pursue, it\u2019ll be more complicated that way\u201dGu Qing Shan asked: \u201cElder Sun Zhi, you are a Ding Yuan General, as well as humanity\u2019s formation Grandmaster, surely aside from the alliance you also have a different place to call for help from?\u201dGong Sun Zhi looked at Ning Yue Xi for a bit and said hesitatingly: \u201cWe do have another communication talisman that\u2019s more trustworthy, but we can\u2019t just use it whenever we please --------------Saintess, what do you think?\u201dNing Yue Xi was just about to speak when they felt an earth shaking tremor.With a swing of his hand, Gong Sun Zhi revealed the scene outside.Two horrifying giant legs are slowly coming closer, in their sight they could only see the two legs, the rest of the body is completely hidden by the clouds, unable to be seen.Faceless Giant!So that\u2019s the real reason!Fuck, why am I so dumb that I only understood everything now.At this moment, Gu Qing Shan finally cleared the smog and understood the truth of it all.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face changed immediately, shouting: \u201cElder Sun Zhi, please use your talisman quickly, if the Faceless Giant make it here then the talisman won\u2019t be usable anymore!\u201dGong Sun Zhi questioned: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be usable?\u201dAs they spoke, the pair of legs are getting closer and closer.Gu Qing Shan hurriedly shout: \u201cPlease trust me this once, quickly use your communication talisman\u201dGong Sun Zhi was still hesitating when Ning Yue Xi tapped her Inventory Bag and took out a communication talisman covered in mist, opened her mouth and quickly said:\u201cHeaven\u2019s Limit Sect Ning Yue Xi, we\u2019ve gotten the list of traitors within humanity\u2019s alliance, also successfully located Shen Wu world, humbly requesting help from the Saints\u201dAs she finished and let go of the talisman, it slowly floated up by itself.Gong Sun Zhi seeing that can only sigh: \u201cTo bother the saints like this, I\u2019m afraid our sects will lower our evaluation\u201dThe Saints, are the strongest cultivators of this world.To understand, cultivation realms are divided into Qi Training, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Rejuvenation, Ascension and Sainting, anyone who\u2019ve broken through all these realms and become Sainted are known to all as Saints. (TN: As in Knighting and being Knighted, but Saint instead of Knight)Humanity into total only have 3 cultivators of this level, called the 3 Saints.Under normal circumstances, very few people have the right to contact the Saints.What Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi have on hand is a single talisman used for contacting the Saints, which were gotten from their own sects through exchanging 300 years\u2019 worth of supplies.The reason why their sects give it to them was to guarantee safety during this time\u2019s infiltration into the demon army.The Sect masters of both reminded them many times that they are not to use these talismans unless they\u2019re in an extremely dire situation.Ning Yue Xi stared at Gu Qing Shan and replied: \u201cIf anything happens, I\u2019ll take responsibility\u201dGu Qing Shan still haven\u2019t breathed out, still looking intently at the talisman flying up, about to deliver the message.Suddenly, from above the talisman, a huge shadow was seen.In just a second, the shadow descended, squatting the talisman from the sky back down.It was the Faceless Giant\u2019s hand.Gu Qing Shan risked jumping forward to catch the descending talisman, only to see the light on it became dim, finally shattering into pieces of paper.We\u2019re done for, Gu Qing Shan felt his brain became numb from fear.Behind him, Ning Yue Xi and Gong Sun Zhi faces both paled.\u201cWhy did this happen? This is a Saint\u2019s communication talisman!\u201d Gong Sun Zhi asked.Gu Qing Shan replied: \u201cThe Faceless Giant can devour all objects that contain spirit energy, when the talisman flew up, it sucked all the spirit energy from it, turning it into a normal piece of paper\u201dHe sighed: \u201cIt seems we\u2019re not getting away\u201dNot just the traitors in humanity\u2019s top brass, but also the Faceless Giant in the demon territory to stop them from calling for help, of course they couldn\u2019t escape.The more they struggle, the tighter the net coils around them.The situation has already turned into them walking on a tightrope of life and death.Could it be that only the details of history has changed, while the results remained the same?No, I have to do something, but I\u2019ve only just returned, my strength won\u2019t suddenly change, what can I actually do?Gu Qing Shan thought hard.Gong Sun Zhi suddenly understood: \u201cSo that\u2019s it, no wonder why the 5-elemental formation i used before couldn\u2019t do anything to it\u201dNing Yue Xi slowly stood up, standing next to the two of them and said: \u201cIf we can\u2019t run, then we can only fight\u201dNing Yue Xi tapped her Inventory Bag again, taking out a longbow and gave it to Gu Qing Shan.She said: \u201cYour military bow is too weak; I\u2019ll give you this\u201dGu Qing Shan was a bit surprised, asked: \u201cWhy give it to me?\u201dNing Yue Xi with a straight face: \u201cYou killed the demon army\u2019s messenger and gave me the snake liver to heal myself, I\u2019m giving you this bow as a show of gratitude\u201dGu Qing Shan looked down, to see a bow at least half an arm longer than his military bow, asides from that, it seemed very simple without any superfluous decorations.After observing it for a bit, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face became very serious.This longbow is grand without needing to show off, its killing intent was hidden, not leaking a single bit.Even using inner sight, he still couldn\u2019t feel the bow, as if it wasn\u2019t there at all.If he were to use this bow, no one would be able to feel their death coming.This bow has already reached the realm of having self-defense, like heaven and earth compared to the military bow he brought from the outpost.In a dangerous situation like this, to be given such a good bow, Gu Qing Shan will definitely not refuse.Ning Yue Xi this person really understands how to repay others, what she gave was also something he was able to use, both considerate and careful.Seems like she\u2019s someone worth making friends with.As Gu Qing Shan thought that, he took the bow and sincerely thanked her.Ning Yue Xi was silently observing him, saw that he didn\u2019t decline out of courtesy or showed overwhelming pleasure, only kept calm and thanked her sincerely.Ning Yue Xi silently nodded in satisfaction, her impression of him increased a bit more.Her voice became a bit softer: \u201cThis bow is called the Night Rain, it was passed on to me by my father, so I hope you can use it well\u201dNote:(1) Lone cultivator: a more literal translation would be loose cultivator, meaning a cultivator that does not belong to any sects or clans, most protagonists in Chinese novels are like this. Lone cultivators have the advantage of not needing to share their findings with the sect/clan, but doesn\u2019t get protection and other cultivation necessities because they\u2019re alone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Qing Shan instinctively looked at the Long Blade. (1)From what he can see, this Blade is about 2 inches longer than a normal Blade, with a thinner shaft and a straight back from the handle to the top of the Blade.This would be a Straight Blade for female use, more intricate and flexible compared to a Machete that male cultivators would use.\u201cWind Shadows!\u201d\u201cHowling Steel!\u201dNing Yue Xi shouted as she readied herself.The Straight Blade in her hand emits layers and layers of blue light, covering both her and itself.Around the blue light, thin golden strings appear out of thin air, then suddenly disappeared, only letting out an occasional metallic howling sound.At this moment, her whole body itself looks just like a Long Blade crafted from killing intent.Gu Qing Shan was very shocked.Twin Elements!And a very rare Wind and Metal combination that complements each other!Mutated 5-elements Wind spirit energy, if you categorize them, from weakest to strongest would be \u201cQuicken\u201d-\u201cRapid Combo\u201d-\u201cWind Shadows\u201d-\u201cHurricane Storm\u201d-\u201cWorld-ending Wind Catastrophe\u201dNing Yue Xi has already awoken her Wind element to the 3rd tier, if you consider her age, that\u2019s already quite the feat.Many Wind elemental cultivators who reach Rejuvenation Realm couldn\u2019t go further than that for their whole lives.Not to mention, even her Metal element was awoken to its 3rd tier, \u201cHowling Steel\u201dVery few people can awaken 2 elements at the same time, even if they do, they could only focus on one of them, not being able to get both to the same strength, let alone getting them to perfectly complement each other and get 1 plus 1 to be greater than 2.Ning Yue Xi was able to do so, and from her calm look, it seems she didn\u2019t waste too much effort on them either.Gu Qing Shan silently sighed.This girl really is a monster, no wonder people used to say that if she had lived, in just a few dozens years she would be able to fight one-on-one with the Demon King.The only sad thing is, there aren\u2019t too many Blade-type Secret arts in this world, so most Blade users aren\u2019t anything special.That being the case, rather than the Blade, other weapons are much better.Ning Yue Xi raised the Blade, her eyes staring at the incoming Faceless Giant, her fighting spirit increasing more and more.Gu Qing Shan looked at the Blade, couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhy choose the Blade?\u201d\u201cSpears and Javelins are clumsy, Swords are two-faced liars, only Blades go on a path straight, becoming unbeatable\u201d Ning Yue Xi answered seriously.\u201cSpears and Javelins being clumsy I understand, but why are Swords two-faced liars?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked in surprise.Ning Yue Xi glanced at him, saying: \u201cI forbid you from using Swords\u201dAs she finished talking, she lowered her body and jumped straight up into the blue skies.Afterwards, inside the cloud, the Faceless Giant\u2019s roaring can be heard.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it\u201d Gu Qing Shan lightly patted Gu Qing Shan\u2019s shoulder \u201cShe used to use Swords once\u201d\u201cThen why did she change into a Blade user now?\u201d\u201cA senior brother that she used to be very close with was a Sword Cultivator, he trained with her daily, even instructed her with the Sword -----------but that person betrayed her, from then on, she always hated the Sword, and hated Sword Cultivators, so she beat up everyone she met\u201dGu Qing Shan asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s with that, does no one care about what she does?\u201dGong Sun Zhi wryly laughs: \u201cOf course we as her elders also want to keep peace, but she\u2019s Ning Yue Xi you know? Those Sword Cultivators try to attach themselves to her, wanting to get close, when they don\u2019t get what they want they try to use violence, and of course get beaten up\u201d\u201cBeating up everyone she meets\u2026 to death?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked a bit nervously.\u201cNot to that degree, in the few recent years, she would only beat until they grovel on the ground begging for forgiveness\u201d Gong Sun Zhi replied.Gu Qing Shan thought about the sight of himself groveling on the ground begging Ning Yue Xi for forgiveness, then shook his head.Looking at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s confused state, Gong Sun Zhi thought a bit and consoled him: \u201cNo need to worry, you\u2019re not a Sword Cultivator so you\u2019ll be fine\u201dBut I\u2026 am a Sword Cultivator, Gu Qing Shan silently complained.Thankfully since the time he\u2019s returned he hasn\u2019t even touched a sword, so in the short period after this, he won\u2019t offend this scarily strong girl.After all, I saved her life so she won\u2019t beat me up so bad that I have to grovel on the ground, right?Worst case scenario, I\u2019ll just stay really far away from here and train myself until I\u2019m strong enough.As Gu Qing Shan was thinking, a loud booming sound could be heard from the sky.Crash!A figure fell from the sky and crashed into the ground.\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Gu Qing Shan quickly ran forward and asked.Ning Yue Xi stood up, answered softly: \u201cI\u2019m fine, you just stay away\u201dJust a second later.Intense Blade spirit surrounded Ning Yue Xi, her white cloak floating in the wind.Still wearing her gold armor, from the crater on the ground she once again flew up past the layer of clouds.\u201cMonster, receive your death!\u201dHer lovely voice can be heard from the sky.A grand roaring sound full of pain can also be heard.That\u2019s the Faceless Giant\u2019s voice.A fully recovered Ning Yue Xi can directly confront a Faceless Giant.That\u2019s incredible.The battle in the sky still continued.Gu Qing Shan sighed and muttered to himself: \u201cLooks elegant and calm, but fighting without a shred of care for their own life, looks like everyone who uses Blades really are psychopaths\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the psychopath!\u201dAn angry voice travelled straight to his brain.Ning Yue Xi\u2019s voice.Gu Qing Shan was surprised, then a bit nervous.He looked up, the thick cloud layer blocking his view, but he could clearly feel Ning Yue Xi\u2019s cold glare.Shit, I forgot, this girl can face off directly against a Faceless Giant, that means she\u2019s at least a Rejuvenation realm mid-level, possibly higher.Cultivators of that realm will have a very wide range of inner sight, so everything he says can be heard very clearly.Gu Qing Shan quickly shut up.This time around, Ning Yue Xi\u2019s body isn\u2019t poisoned, her body already recovering, so her fate will probably not be the same as before.As he was thinking, he saw the Bloodthirster Demons already on their way out of the forest.Under them are the natural-born assassins who already awoken Fire-element since birth ----------the Grey Flame Serpents.The demon army\u2019s assault squad is here!They silently appeared, quickly increased their speed and ran towards Gu Qing Shan and Gong Sun Zhi for the quick-kill.The legendary encirclement of history, officially opens its curtains at this moment.Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s face as cold as ice, tapping his Inventory Bag to take out an intricate formation plate.\u201cThis old man can\u2019t kill the Faceless Giant, but is plenty for dealing with you lot\u201d he said coldly.Just when Gu Qing Shan was about to lift his bow, his body suddenly stopped, frozen in place unmoving.Numerous streams of data flowed like a waterfall in front of his eyes, accompanied with the cold mechanical voice of the System.\u201cConfirmed the user to have gotten into special historical scenario\u201d\u201cCurrent conditions suitable for initiating scenario\u201d\u201cInitiated: The fight to death\u201dNote:(1) Blade: the weapon itself is similar to a scimitar, but Chinese Blades are much bulkier and thicker, similar to an elongated Cleaver (if you\u2019ve played League of Legends, Tryndamere\u2019s weapon is essentially a Chinese Blade). From now on I\u2019ll keep the translation as Blade (capitalized) for the weapon, and blade (not capitalized) as the main shaft of sword-type weapons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Qing Shan\u2019s expression changed, quickly checking his War God UI, only to see a light flashed in the middle of the War God UI, changing into lines of blood-red text:\u201cTo break the shackles of fate, to change a history that was already determined from long ago, user Gu Qing Shan has encountered a Destiny Quest\u201d\u201cQuest description: Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi are characters that died long ago in history, to change their fate is to change the destined direction of history itself\u201d\u201cQuest objective: Save Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi\u201d\u201cAfter the Quest is completed, special story quest reward: War God superpower (Unique)\u201d\u201cIf the Quest fails, the user will be terminated\u201dGu Qing Shan took a look and stood frozen.\u201cMe? Save them?\u201d he could only laugh wryly.\u201cAnd if the quest fails I\u2019ll be terminated? That\u2019s a good joke, it\u2019s like saying that the demon army will leave me alive from the goodness of their heart after they two of them died\u201dGu Qing Shan once again looked at the sky.The Faceless Giant\u2019s level of battle, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s strength he basically can\u2019t do anything to interfere.Even if he wants to run away, being surrounded by demons from all sides like this, it\u2019s impossible for him alone to get away.Giving him the benefit of the doubt, even if he could run away, now that the System already gave out such a Quest, so he can\u2019t just be the only person alive after this.If Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi were to die, he also will be terminated.Gu Qing Shan looked again in front.The demon army are rushing forward, just about to enter his attack range.The situation is already very dire.Gong Sun Zhi hands quickly moved like a butterfly flapping its wings as he operated his formation plate, then suddenly shouted: \u201cEarth Burial Formation!\u201dThe earth rumbled and started to move as 5 mountains suddenly grew from the ground, trapping dozens of Bloodthirsters and Grey Flame Serpents inside and starts to grind and crush them like a blender.As the mountains became taller, the force between the mountains also quickly increased, many Grey Flame Serpents got crushed into a mass of blood and flesh.Suddenly a single Grey Flame Serpent fell out from the crushing mountains, landed flat on the ground halfway to death.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes flickered.He immediately drew an arrow, set it on the Night Rain and fired.This isn\u2019t a normal arrow, made by Gu Qing Shan himself from a poison fang of the snake demon he killed, its power is unlike that of a regular arrow.A sound of arrow hitting flesh.The arrow dug deep into the Grey Flame Serpent\u2019s body, straight into its organs.The demon snake poison spread around in the blink of an eye, finishing the Grey Flame Serpent off.Grey Flame Serpents originally were high-tiered demon beasts, so its ability to sense danger are very highly developed, yet in front of the Night Rain, it couldn\u2019t even feel death approached before it died.Gu Qing Shan gripped the bow tight, silently increased his impression of Ning Yue Xi by 1 point.Gong Sun Zhi turned around and nodded in satisfaction: \u201cVery good, focus on finishing them off, make sure they don\u2019t get a chance to get closer\u201d\u201cOn it!\u201dGu Qing Shan drew another arrow, but his thoughts were elsewhere.Inside his Thought Sea there was a notification\u201cDefeated high-tiered monster: Grey Flame Serpent, gained 20 Soul Points, Current Soul Points: 21/7\u201dThis is possible?Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t expect this at all.His total Soul Points was much higher than his maximum Soul Points.When he was hunting the demon beasts, once his Soul Points reached its limit, he couldn\u2019t gain anymore.This is making Gu Qing Shan\u2019s head hurt a bit.Grey Flame Serpents are high-tier demon beasts, about the same rank as humanity\u2019s Foundation Establishment cultivators, meaning they\u2019re much higher than Gu Qing Shan\u2019s current cultivation.He gained 21 Soul Points all at once from killing the Grey Flame Serpent, meaning he could comprehend quite a few more Skills at the same time.Since that\u2019s the case, that means War God UI highly encourages its user to challenge and defeat enemies that are stronger than themselves.If he defeats an enemy stronger than himself, he can ignore the Soul Points limit and stock up even more Soul Points.Gu Qing Shan quickly thought things through and put away the Night Rain, taking out his military bow again to learn the \u201cPrecision\u201d skill on it.\u201cI choose to comprehend Precision\u201d\u201cPrecision comprehended, used up 4 Soul Points, Current Soul Points: 17//7\u201dA warmth flowed from the bow into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind, a few seconds later, Gu Qing Shan already understood how to use Precision.Picking up a normal arrow, he aimed at another Grey Flame Serpent that fell from the crushing mountains, also on the verge of death.Pew!This Grey Flame Serpent was able to feel the danger, instinctively wanted to dodge, but because its injury was too great it couldn\u2019t move at all.The arrow shot through the Grey Flame Serpent\u2019s eyes, straight into its skull and took its life.Like I thought, Precision increases the chance to hit a target more accurately, Gu Qing Shan thought to himself.\u201cDefeated high-tiered monster: Grey Flame Serpent, gained 20 Soul Points, Current Soul Points: 37/7\u201dGu Qing Shan put down the military bow and once again took out the \u201cNight Rain\u201d.Opening the War God UI, he quickly glanced over the Skills that \u201cNight Rain\u201d have\u201cLongbow, named: Night Rain, used skills include:\u201d\u201cNo.1: Bombardment, User: Ning An Nan, Soul Points cost: 10\u201d\u201cNo.2: Accuracy, User: Ning Yue Xi, Soul Points cost: 6\u201d\u201cNo.3: Sharpshooter, User: Ning An Nan, Soul Points cost: 15\u201d\u201cNo.4: Riding Wind (Passive), User: Ning An Nan, Soul Points cost: 5\u201dNing An Nan, this would be Ning Yue Xi\u2019s father\u2019s name, this bow really is as Ning Yue Xi said, a family heirloom.Gu Qing Shan only took notice for a second, before silently taking a look at the Skills in more details.\u201cAccuracy\u201d is built on the basis of \u201cPrecision\u201d, once again increasing the accuracy of arrows, \u201cSharpshooter\u201d is a level higher than \u201cAccuracy\u201d.\u201cRiding Wind\u201d is a passive Skill, which will always increase the flying speed of arrows shot without needing to actively use it.\u201cBombardment\u201d is a powerful Attack Skill, capable of highly increasing an arrow\u2019s destructive power.This is Ning Yue Xi\u2019s gift to him, to thank him for saving her life.In the current battle against the demons, originally in history, Saintess Ning Yue Xi will soon face a hard fight that continues for a whole day and night that results in her death.But this time, history was changed thanks to Gu Qing Shan\u2019s help, she was able to expel the poison in her body, as well as healing the wounds on herself.In this life, Ning Yue Xi\u2019s destiny had changed from will surely die to have a chance of survival.To repay that karma, Ning Yue Xi had gifted Gu Qing Shan with her powerful family heirloom bow.With this bow, with the powerful Skills on it, Gu Qing Shan will also become stronger!Looking at the Night Rain, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s emotions fluctuates.Such powerful Archery Skills, normally no cultivators would easily teach them to others.But now, he has the chance to immediately learn them all.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t think about it too much anymore, since he already made his decision\u201cThey require 36 Soul Points in total, then I choose to comprehend them all!\u201dAs he made his decision, the mechanical System voice was heard:\u201cComprehension complete, 36 Soul Points consumed, Current Soul Points: 1/7\u201d\u201cPrecision has evolved to Accuracy; Accuracy has evolved to Sharpshooter\u201d\u201cUser has learned Riding Wind\u201d\u201cUser has learned Bombardment\u201dAn incredible flow of heat rushed from the Night Rain into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind.One breath, two breaths, three breaths, as he suddenly opened his eyes, a razor-sharp killing intent surrounded his whole body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The kind of Skill that can only be found but not asked for.Even powerful General-rank cultivators would not necessarily have a set of high-ranking Skills like he does.After comprehending the Skills from Night Rain, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s only weakness at the moment would be his cultivation.A Bloodthirster fell out of the mountain blender, quickly rolled to stand up, easily found the source of the formation at a glance and rushed here.It had been fortunate to not get hurt too badly, able to preserve about 80% of its fighting power, and assaulting a target on the battlefield would be its expertise.Gu Qing Shan raised the Night Rain and took a deep breath.Riding Wind!Bombardment!Sharpshooter!An arrow flew like a flash of light, hitting the Bloodthirster head-on before it could react.In a split second, the Bloodthirster demon was knocked dozens of meters away, pinned on a large bulky tree and spurted a shower of blood.Gu Qing Shan was so shocked he stopped shooting.Bloodthirsters are considered to be as strong as a Golden Core cultivator.A single arrow shot was able to overcome the 2 realms difference and heavily wounded the Bloodthirster.Archery so powerful that it\u2019s difficult to believe.Gu Qing Shan forced himself to calm down, silently judged the amount of spirit energy he used.This one shot used up 90% of his spirit energyThat\u2019s not good, the cost is too high.With Gu Qing Shan\u2019s current total spirit energy, he could only make such a shot only once.Afterwards there\u2019s nothing he could do but stand there and take hits.In reality, the Archery Skill called Bombardment was supposed to be learned by Golden Core realm cultivators, and its true power wouldn\u2019t show until Rejuvenation Realm.To learn such a high-level Archery Skill ahead of time, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s spirit energy at qi training realm of course couldn\u2019t support long-term usage.Even Gong Sun Zhi was a bit shocked by Gu Qing Shan.\u201cAh? This youth is really such a monstrous genius at Archery? How interesting\u201dGong Sun Zhi silently increased his evaluation of Gu Qing Shan.The Bloodthirster now covered in blood, stood up roaring angrily, dragging itself step-by-step forward to rip the detestable human to shreds.But consecutive arrows are flying one after another, knocking its body backward a bit every time, making it unable to move forward even an inch.This time Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t using \u201cBombardment\u201d.His Archery expertise has already reached a level that even shooting normal arrows carry immense strength.Originally, Gu Qing Shan as a qi training realm couldn\u2019t possibly hope to beat a Bloodthirster.But this Bloodthirster was first hurt by a formation, and then because it was so far away from Gu Qing Shan, it got nearly crippled by a powerful Archery Skill, afterwards not being able to do anything besides become a big target for arrows.The Bloodthirsters are scary opponents in close combat, but since they don\u2019t awaken any element, they severely lack methods of long-ranged attacks.More and more arrows keep piercing it with powerful force, not missing or decreasing in strength even once, causing even the Bloodthirster to feel fear.Not good, this human\u2019s Archery is too powerful, he must be killed at all cost!The Bloodthirster\u2019s body suddenly curled up, just a second later, a cold evil aura emitted from its body.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s slightly twitched as he saw that.Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s face also changed, both hands on his formation plate, quickly arranging a simple protective formation.Gong Sun Zhi loudly warned: \u201cBe careful, it wants to use Smoldering Flame Explosion!\u201dSmoldering Flame Explosion, is a Fire-element spell that is mixed with Huang Quan\u2019s Yin essence, its power is enough to break open a large hole in the formation.Bloodthirsters could slowly collect Huang Quan\u2019s Yin essence inside itself from birth, gaining a single chance to use the spell at the cost of its own life as a last resort.The Yin essence from Huang Quan will become fully active thanks to the Fire-element spell.This is a skill so powerful, that a Bloodthirster have to give up its life to use just a single time.In the fight a few days ago, this skill has caused Gong Sun Zhi no small amount of pain.Gu Qing Shan quickly took out the snake fang poison arrows and fired.Sharpshooter!Shifting Flurry!Five arrows turned into grey streaks of shadows, quickly soared and drew unpredictable arcs in the sky, dodging the Bloodthirster\u2019s arms blocking from the front and hit the back of its neck at the same time.Pssh!Five arrows hit at the same time, so only one sound was heard.Dark-blue blood leaked out from the Bloodthirster\u2019s body.A thud was heard as the Bloodthirster fell down, all the Huang Quan Yin essence it had gathered quickly dissipated.\u201cDefeated high-tiered monster: Bloodthirster, gained 30 Soul Points, Current Soul Points: 31/7\u201dHe already received 30 Soul Points, but Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t have any more Skills that he could learn.Gong Sun Zhi looked at Gu Qing Shan in surprise: \u201cBrilliant Archery Skills, being so young yet already well-versed in that many powerful Archery Skills, as soon as your cultivation is enough you can surely become a General\u201dGu Qing Shan lifted the Night Rain and snake fang poison arrows and said: \u201cIt\u2019s just that I have good equipment, as well as having your formation to protect me\u201dDemon snake poison fangs are limited, each one he uses is one gone forever, but during this time of crisis, Gu Qing Shan can\u2019t worry about saving for later.Gong Sun Zhi shook his head: \u201cYou deserve the praise, when I was your age, I was still studying first tier formations with a formation plate\u201d----------Boom!From the clouds above, a wide and loud thunderous sound was heard.Gong Sun Zhi and Gu Qing Shan both lifted their heads, only to see Ning Yue Xi was retreating, her golden armor flashing a dull light, the snow-white cloak on her back was being blown furiously by the wind.Gu Qing Shan once again composed himself and asked: \u201cGeneral Sun Zhi, do you have any other methods to communicate with humanity?\u201dGong Sun Zhi hearing him ask that felt a bit embarrassed.Earlier on, if he didn\u2019t hesitate they might have been able to send the communication talisman out to call for help.If a Saint comes then they no longer have to worry about losing their lives.But now that the Faceless Giant is here, with its ability to devour spirit energy, it\u2019s very unlikely for them to be able to send out information.Gong Sun Zhi hesitated for a bit, then sighed: \u201cThe only way left is to go to Shen Wu world, we have a teleportation formation stationed there\u201dShen Wu world?What\u2019s that?Gu Qing Shan looked at him confused, then suddenly realized something.He felt a layer of cold sweat on himself.At this very moment, it\u2019s very possible that through Gong Sun Zhi, he\u2019s discovering a shocking secret behind the lost history.Gong Sun Zhi continued: \u201cYou might not know about it, it\u2019s a destroyed world\u201dGu Qing Shan exclaimed: \u201cOutside of this world, there\u2019s another world?\u201dIn the past life, until the very end when the Apocalypse had come, he hasn\u2019t even heard any rumors about there being another world besides this one.When the game first came to Reality, its name was \u201cWorlds\u2019 Apocalypse Online\u201dAt the start, this name caught many people\u2019s attention and discussion.As far as they know, the game only connected to Reality and the Cultivation world.Only 2 worlds, would that be enough to have \u201cWorlds\u201d in the name? (1)Later on, when everyone\u2019s gotten used to transporting between the 2 worlds, no answer is given for this question, plus the fact that the world\u2019s situation is getting worse and worse since there\u2019s almost a hundred thousand people that die every day at the hands of the demons.After a while, people just lost interest in finding out the answer.Gong Sun Zhi answered: \u201cThat\u2019s right, behind the Demon King\u2019s Royal Castle, there\u2019s a crack in space that leads to the destroyed world\u201dGu Qing Shan asked again: \u201cYou\u2019ve entered it?\u201dGong Sun Zhi once again: \u201cYes, we arrived at a corner of that world and found a few dozen corpses of peerless people, our initial assessment is that they are at least at the peak of martial arts realm\u201dThe peak of martial arts realm -------Martial Gods!Martial Gods are legendary existences, even in this cultivation world they are the strongest, rarest existence.Of the 3 saints, one of them is a Martial God.Even Gu Qing Shan who\u2019ve frequently seen Apocalyptic scenes can\u2019t help but be stunned.He muttered: \u201cDozens of Martial God corpses\u2026 even with this kind of overwhelming strength, their world still got destroyed\u2026\u201dGong Sun Zhi sighed: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I don\u2019t know why, but the Demon King had already locked on to us, almost like he doesn\u2019t want to let anyone who knows about this secret reveal it to anyone else\u201dThen he looked at Gu Qing Shan and spoke with a low voice: \u201cMeeting you here, was completely outside of both theirs and our expectations\u201dNote:(1) Worlds: this is a Chinese thing that can\u2019t be translated to English without sounding too clunky. Essentially, number 2 in chinese has its own system of plural that\u2019s slightly different from numbers higher than 2, simply put, \u201cit takes 3 to become a crowd\u201d. The word that\u2019s been used in the title of the novel had always suggested that there were more than just 2 worlds, but that can\u2019t be explained in English unless I use a really clunky translation like \u201cThe End of Many Worlds Online\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

by: La0o9\u201cRight now the only way to survive is -----\u201cGong Sun Zhi tapped his Inventory Bag, taking out a dull-looking iron ball.\u201cBefore you\u2019re discovered by the Demon King, quickly go to that world, find the mass teleportation formation that I\u2019ve prepared and put this identification device on it\u201dGu Qing Shan hesitated: \u201cGeneral Sun Zhi, you\u2019re much stronger than I am, perhaps you could go\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s voice got lower and lower as Gong Sun Zhi undid his jacket, revealing a horrifying wound.A dark blue fame extends from his chest to his shoulder, then continues all the way to his back.The wound is so deep that even his organs could be seen.The flame silently burned as the multitudes of runes surrounding it could only suppress the flames, but not put it out.Hell\u2019s Flames, the peak of all demon flames.Gu Qing Shan looked at it, unable to say anything and could only mutter to himself.This is a type of drought-bringer flame, even a small spark can turn a thousand miles\u2019 river into dried, dead land.The fact that Gong Sun Zhi was hit by this and yet he\u2019s still alive is nothing short of a miracle.Gong Sun Zhi said: \u201cI used the 10-trigram Sealing formation to lock my life force inside myself, so for now I won\u2019t die, but this wound was caused by the Demon King himself, so he can use it to tell where I am\u201dGu Qing Shan asked: \u201cHow much longer can you hold out?\u201dGong Sun Zhi replied: \u201cHalf a day, after half a day the 10-trigram Sealing formation will lose its effect, and I will die\u201dGu Qing Shan looked straight into his eyes: \u201cSuch a wound, is there anyone that can still save you?\u201dGong Sun Zhi laughed: \u201cProbably no one, unless we can return to humanity\u2019s stronghold and I get an Ascended that\u2019s an expert in healing to help me\u201dGu Qing Shan sighed, glanced at where Ning Yue Xi is in the sky and gritted his teeth: \u201cI\u2019ll go then\u201dGong Sun Zhi showed visibly joy, put the iron ball in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands and said: \u201cWe have people stationed at Shen Wu world, but the Demon King have already found them, so at this moment it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re all already dead, so you don\u2019t need to worry about them too much\u201dHe took out a formation plate and carefully gave it to Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan looked down, only to see this formation plate is separated into sections, each part inscribed with extremely intricate runes.Gong Sun Zhi showed him the formation plate, explaining clearly what each section does, and: \u201cThis is a common formation plate, there\u2019s many practical formations on there, but they all have limited uses so you have to use them well\u201d\u201cAnd here is the location map\u201dAfter telling him everything, Gong Sun Zhi took out a turtle shell and had Gu Qing Shan stand on it.\u201cInside the Space Vortex, do not take care for anything, do not do anything rash, if something happens, it\u2019s possible that even the 3 Saints won\u2019t be able to save you\u201d\u201cI understand\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded his head.\u201cGo!\u201d Gong Sun Zhi lightly tapped Gu Qing Shan\u2019s back.In a blink of an eye, Gu Qing Shan disappeared where he stood.Another loud crash as Ning Yue Xi was knocked down by the Faceless Giant, creating another deep hole.\u201cGuh\u201d Ning Yue Xi shouted before jumping out from the hole\u201cYou sent him to Shen Wu world?\u201d she askedGong Sun Zhi answered: \u201cI did, both you and I are locked on by the Demon King\u2019s inner sight, he will definitely not let us get near the teleportation formation\u201d\u201cYou want to let him escape?\u201dGong Sun Zhi sighed: \u201cHe already knows the secret, if he could survive then let him get the information back to humanity in our place\u201dNing Yue Xi stood against the wind, her cold eyes slightly mellowed.Wiping the blood from her mouth, she silently muttered: \u201cThen there will be no more regrets\u201dShe swung her hand downwards as the Blade once again materializes.\u201cIf this monster can die, then I will also have no regrets dying\u201dAs Ning Yue Xi said that, she gripped the Blade tightly and once again jumped to the sky.Gu Qing Shan felt himself turned into a cannon ball, accelerating through the endless void of space.The flow of time becomes unpredictable.Your senses become infinitely stretched out, you could feel like days have gone by while in fact it\u2019s only been a blink of the eye.The endless space from all sides gradually recedes, becoming a bottomless void.This would be the final layer of the Space Vortex, once you pass through, you\u2019ll reach the Space-time Vortex.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart clutches.He has already experienced this when he returned from the future, and he knows just how scary it could be.Even a seasoned veteran, someone who has gone through numerous dangers like himself, could only wish for luck.\u201cIt\u2019s best that I don\u2019t run into anything at all\u201dGu Qing Shan muttered.A second after that, the whole world around him went dark as Gu Qing Shan broke through space, headed straight into a Space-time Vortex.Suddenly a force similar to a rushing river surrounded Gu Qing Shan, pushed him through the time flow of both past and future at an incredible speed.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s vision blurred as he got pushed by this force into an unknown space.A gigantic bronze alloy pillar that connects heaven and earth, stood alone in the middle of a vast field.In the middle of the pillar, a corpse was pinned there by 5 large needles.The corpse was hanging its head, on its body was a black full plate armor, about 10 stories tall.But even so, the corpse is miniscule compared to the giant bronze pillar.Under the pillar, and endless number of black skeletons are pacing back and forth, wanting to climb it.They stack themselves on one another, gradually climbing higher and higher, almost reached the tip of the corpse\u2019s foot.Gu Qing Shan appeared out of thin air, passed through this strange space and kept on going.\u201cHelp me\u201dA voice appeared in his head.Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth, didn\u2019t bother turning around and kept flying.He definitely can\u2019t stop now, even with the littlest of movement, he\u2019ll affect the layer of energy surrounding himself.This energy is bringing Gu Qing Shan towards Shen Wu world, if anything were to mess with it, the results will become unpredictable.-------------he might end up in an unknown world, or immediately be ripped to shreds, but most possibly, he\u2019ll be held back in this world, unable to leave.\u201cHelp me, I\u2019ll grant you immortality and invincibility\u201dThe voice once again spoke, this time containing a dignified tone.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t bother to look back, his sight once again became dark as he got into another space-time layer and left this place.A while later.The corpse on the pillar slightly moved, then breathed downwards.The breath contains an almost endless stream of dark blue flames, burning all the black skeletons below in a blink of an eye.\u201cGod damnit, the first creature to get here in 200 million years and I scared him away\u201dThe corpse tried to struggle, but the needles pinning his body didn\u2019t even budge.After a bit, seemingly tired, the corpse stopped struggling.Under the soil of the bronze pillar, more and more black skulls are popping up.Very quickly, the horde of black skeletons once again filled the earth, as they looked up at the corpse on the bronze pillar, they slowly moved once more.\u2026..Gu Qing Shan travelled through the chaotic space-time storm, not knowing how long has passed, then suddenly a hole opened in front of him.As Gu Qing Shan passed through, he felt the strong wind against his skin, the layer of energy also started to become thin, showing its form in the air.Gu Qing Shan was inside a milky-white sphere, just like he was inside a large bubble, floating around.Outside the sphere was a sky all filled with grey clouds.The grey clouds are very strange, they\u2019re so thick they\u2019re almost black, yet you only need to look to see that they\u2019re transparent.Gu Qing Shan looked up, his sight extended far. Within it, all he saw was an endless horde of demons, extending until the horizon.Further away, a Faceless Giant was deep above the clouds, fighting another demon with a chilling ice aura.The whole world has already been destroyed, as numerous demons deeper than the sea, higher than mountains have taken over this place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you confirm?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cComprehension complete, Current Soul Points: 27/7\u201dA warmth flowed from the booklet into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body, circulated around twice and finally went into his Thought Sea.The knowledge immediately appeared in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mind.Instinctively he also knows how to break through to the next level.\u201cMy total spirit energy is still a bit lacking\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan checked his Dantian and estimated.If he doesn\u2019t have enough spirit energy, it\u2019s very easy to fail while breaking through.To increase the total spirit energy limit, he can only gradually cultivate using pure effort.Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth.No, he can\u2019t wait any longer, the next time he enters the other world, he\u2019ll immediately appear in Shen Wu world, if he doesn\u2019t get stronger as soon as possible, who knows how horribly he\u2019ll die.Gu Qing Shan tapped his Inventory Bag, took out the flask of snake blood and drank two mouthfuls.The demon snake blood can increase his senses and inner sight, helping him manipulate spirit energy more accurately in the short term.Gu Qing Shan wiped his mouth, forming a seal with his hands and stayed still.It\u2019s like his whole body had become a statue, completely frozen.A few moments later, Gu Qing Shan coughed up blood.\u201cFailure, only a bit more, how regretful\u201dGu Qing Shan muttered, quickly composed himself and tried again.In just a few moments, he once again coughed up blood.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, one last time\u201dGu Qing Shan gritted his teeth, once again taking a mouthful of snake blood.His body\u2019s condition is already tensed up to its limit, only able to take another try at breakthrough in a short period of time.Breath in, breath out, breath in, breath out.Compose himself.Once again he tried to break through.This time, it took longer.Gu Qing Shan just sat there in the cloak of night, all the way until morning came and a layer of mist had covered his clothes that he finally opened his eyes again.A clear joy can be seen in his eyes.Clasping his hands together, Gu Qing Shan lightly shouted: \u201cSpirit Shield!\u201dA transparent layer of light appeared, covering his whole body.This spell costs a lot of spirit energy, while the protection it provides is pathetically weak, extremely crappy.In a real fight, cultivators would rather just wear armor or use some sort of protection type treasure rather than use Spirit Shield.However, this is a spell that only qi training stage 6 cultivators can use.Gu Qing Shan had successfully broken through.He stood up and stretched himself, his bones let out clear popping sounds.After a whole night of cultivation, he finally broke through, Gu Qing Shan is very pleased.When he reaches qi training stage 7, as he attempts to break through to Foundation Establishment realm, he can also try to awaken a superpower.Gu Qing Shan then went back to his room for a bit of rest.9h12 AM.Gu Qing Shan woke up.As he opened the curtains, sunlight poured into the room.Outside the sound of people and vehicles can be heard moving about.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit and understood.19 days later will be the 300th Anniversary of the Confederate, as well as the official University entrance examinations that\u2019s happening in 2 days.Everyone in the city became restless.But all of this doesn\u2019t have to do with me, so what do I do now?Nothing to do in the morning, might as well go find some place to practice Archery.I\u2019ll have to come to the President\u2019s estate at noon for lunch.Then during the evening I\u2019ll deliver Su Xue Er\u2019s present.Thinking about Su Xue Er\u2019s joyful face, Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit.He took out his phone and sent a message.\u201cI\u2019m at the Capital now\u201dAs soon as he sent it out, he got a reply.Gu Qing Shan pressed to receive the call on the phone to hear Su Xue Er\u2019 voice.\u201cYou big bully, you got to be on TV together with the President and couldn\u2019t even tell me about it beforehand?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know about it before\u201d\u201cThe President will be helping you with University right?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be at the Confederate Military Academy to study, all thanks to the President\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, and here I was secretly saving up some credits to help--------\u201cSu Xue Er suddenly realized her slip of the tongue and stopped, but couldn\u2019t take back what she had already said.Gu Qing Shan immediately understood, his face lifted into a smile.This is Su Xue Er, silently prepared money to help him, but also concerned that he might be offended as a man, so she didn\u2019t tell him.She had to have been really happy for him this time that she slipped her tongue like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gu Qing Shan thought to himself.He took a quick shower, changed into some clean clothes and left the room.He still has the morning free, and can probably use this time to train his Skills a bit.Gu Qing Shan went to the receptionist and quickly found a gym that had an archery range.Archery has become a Noble\u2019s sport -------during this day and age, pretty much all cold weapons have become high-class sports.Meaning, the cost won\u2019t be cheap.Gu Qing Shan suddenly remembered, he should check how much credits he has left.The President will help with this education, but he\u2019s not the greedy kind of person that will ask others for everything he wants.Taking out his personal Holo-Brain, Gu Qing Shan checked his possessions.\u201cHuh, there\u2019s still around 19200 credits left, if I use them sparingly I\u2019ll have enough for a while\u201dThis is the money he had saved from working part-time, originally he planned on using it to pay for his first year of University.Since now he doesn\u2019t have to worry about tuition fees anymore, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s economic situation has improved greatly.Gu Qing Shan eyes scanned the Holo-Brain\u2019s screen a bit and was stunned.\u201cPersonal Merit: 799,873,957,281,439 points\"A bit confused, Gu Qing Shan hit the Holo-Brain a bit on instinct.The number on it still didn\u2019t change.\u201cI\u2019ve used this Holo-Brain for 7-8 years already, seems like it\u2019s finally malfunctioned\u201dHe sighed.To create to Mech for Su Xue Er, he spent 2000 points in exchange for Impartial Goddess\u2019 help, so he should have basically nothing left.Because of that, such an astronomically number could only be because the Holo-Brain have a problem.To buy another Holo-Brain, he\u2019ll have to spend a lot, his credits will quickly be reduced again.That\u2019s not good, I can\u2019t just spend all I have, let\u2019s quickly find another place to work, that way I can actually pay for my own expenses.With a heavy heart, Gu Qing Shan came out of the hotel and got onto a shuttle bus.Half an hour later, Gu Qing Shan got out from the crowded shuttle bus, almost stumbling.\u201cHow different the capital is, so many people\u201dGu Qing Shan wiped the sweat off his forehead, as he turned around he saw the gym\u2019s billboard.Interstellar Club.As Gu Qing Shan walked in, a few receptionist girls immediately stood up.\u201cOur grandest welcome sir, please pardon me asking, do you have a membership card?\u201d A receptionist girl politely asked.\u201cI don\u2019t, first time here\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered honestly.The receptionist quickly stepped down as a manager-looking female came up.The woman only took a glance before her attitude clearly became cold.Gu Qing Shan today was wearing a white T-shirt and black pants, even though he looks clean, the hems of both his T-shirt and pants are all worn out, clearly old clothes.To conceal the Night Rain and his Inventory Bag, he was even using a long bag used for carrying bows ------the cheapest kind.The manager has to welcome so many people every day, of course, her eyes are extremely sharp, immediately recognizing him as a poor student.\u201cThe free trial area is on the right, underground 2nd floor\u201dThe manager turned her eyes, retracted her smile and simply said.\u201cCould I ask where the archery range is?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cThe archery range?\u201dThe manager laughed a bit, so he\u2019s one of those youths that tries everything to find a way up society huh.The sport called archery is always loved by nobles.A slightly good set of bow and arrow would cost at least a few ten thousand, a special-made high-quality bow would cost 500 thousand credits at least.A normal person simply doesn\u2019t have the money to buy special-made bows.Even renting the public bows at the archery range would require a minimum deposit time of 3 months for regular people, so the cost isn\u2019t something to joke about.Because of that, the archery range is exclusively a place for nobles and rich people.\u201cDo you have your own bow sir? If not, then you can buy one at our place\u201d the manager simply asked without changing her expression.She fully believes that single sentence is enough to extinguish the delusions of this youth.\u201cYes, I do have one, I only need a place to practice\u201d Gu Qing Shan noddedThe manager squinted her eyes.She once again took a look at the youth.She wasn\u2019t wrong, a cheap set of clothes, even the shoes he\u2019s wearing are old, belonging to some unknown brand.The face isn\u2019t bad, yet so shameless that he\u2019s willing to lie just to get into the archery range?Do you want to climb up using nobles that much?The manager silently laughed, then pointed inside: \u201cThe archery range is inside the club and needs to pass by at least 2 other areas, would you like me to guide you?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll trouble you\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.\u201cPlease come with me\u201dThe manager lead Gu Qing Shan forward, turning around and gestured with her eyes.The other receptionists all saw that smiled knowingly.When the two of them have already left the lobby, a few couldn\u2019t help it and broke out smiling.\u201cAnother one\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll probably be kicked out quickly\u201d\u201cDefinitely, these kinds of poor people don\u2019t know you need to have very high status to get into the archery range, otherwise the door wouldn\u2019t even open\u201d\u201cI really want to see his confused look when he\u2019s blocked outside and couldn\u2019t even get in the door\u201d\u201cJust wait, he\u2019ll be escorted out by security soon\u201d\u201cThen, how about we all say \u2018hope to see you again\u2019?\u201d\u201cHaha, good idea\u201dThe manager lead Gu Qing Shan passed a firing range, a pool area, and finally to an automatic door.She silently stepped back, smiled and said: \u201cWe\u2019re here, please come in sir\u201d\u201cAh, thanks\u201d Gu Qing Shan walked forward.The doors are still closed.When Gu Qing Shan tried to push it, the door was seen to be locked.He looked back at the manager.The manager\u2019s expression was cold, answered: \u201cTo enter the archery range, you need to use your Holo-Brain for identification, and only if you reach a certain prerequisite, sir\u201dGu Qing Shan tiredly: \u201cMy Holo-Brain seems to be malfunctioning today, may be another time then\u201dThe manager smirked and said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try a bit; maybe you\u2019ll be able to pass?\u201dHer hands waved, the security guards around the area quickly came.When Gu Qing Shan saw that, he misunderstood.Since under normal circumstances, if you refuse to identify yourself, you have to be either an escapee or an illegal immigrant, either way you must have some sort of problem.He shook his head and just took out his Holo-Brain and turned on wireless identification.Ting!\u201cIdentification passed\u201d\u201cWelcome, distinguished individual, having you here is our Interstellar Club\u2019s honor\u201dThe electronic voice sounded, together with a hint of respect.This is a pre-recorded voice, as different people with different status comes, the welcoming voice will be different.The archery range door quickly opened the way.\u201cDistinguished individual?\u201dAs the manager heard that, she was stunned.Others might not understand, but she knows very well what that designation means.Only Leader-class characters or one of the 9 Lords would be called a \u201cdistinguished individual\u201d.The security guards are all very clever immediately bowed and quickly returned to their post.Inside the archery range, two employees quickly stepped out to welcome him, bowing a 90 degrees\u2019 angle: \u201cWelcome sir, please come with me\u201dGu Qing Shan replied: \u201cVery well\u201d-------------a capital gym is very different indeed, their serving attitude is on a whole different level.As Gu Qing Shan was walking into the archery range, he suddenly turned around and sincerely thanked the manager: \u201cThank you for being the guide\u201d\u201cYour, your words are too kind\u201d, the manager stood outside the door, her voice trembling.Gu Qing Shan smiled and followed the two employees inside.The automatic door slowly closed.And the manager is still stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Our teachers here are guaranteed top-level professionals\u201d\u201cAh, no need\u201d\u201cWill you be using your own bow or ours?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m using my own\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan said that, he reached into the archery bag behind him to take out the Night Rain.\u201cLet me try for a bit first\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead\u201dNot infusing any spirit energy, he only casually took an arrow, pulled the strings and fired.-----------boom.A target more than 50 meters away was blown to bits, there was even a huge hole on the walls behind the target.The whole archery range went silent.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cBombs?\u201d\u201cNo, it seems like the target had a problem\u201dA few people who didn\u2019t seem to sure what happened was discussing it among themselves.They\u2019re all aristocrats with some pedigree, so even if there\u2019s a crisis, they would still remain calm first and foremost.The two employees besides Gu Qing Shan are already stunned.\u201cHaha, sorry about that, seems like I\u2019d better use your bows instead\u201d Gu Qing Shan quickly said.This is a distinguished individual, of course he would be different from normal people, one of the employees convinced herself, then said: \u201cThat\u2019s great, then would you like to use a public target that everyone can use, or a personal target?\u201d\u201cPersonal target\u201d Gu Qing Shan thought a bit and answered.The employee: \u201cThe first time renting our bow will cost you 800 credits, a personal target will cost 1000 credits per hour\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s fine\u201dAfter the 2 employees made a strange face a left, Gu Qing Shan could finally sigh.The Night Rain is too powerful, infusing it with spirit energy will let it become invisible, as well as removing all traces of the user.Gu Qing Shan had already considered this fact, so to avoid attention, Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t use spirit energy and only 1/3 of his raw strength.The result was that a high-resistance target was immediately blown to pieces.Stowing away the Night Rain, Gu Qing Shan chose a target closest to himself and waited for the employees to do their job.Just a bit later, the employee brought back 3 bows.\u201cPlease try them out\u201dGu Qing Shan tried each one, estimated for a bit before choosing the heaviest one.\u201cI\u2019ll use this one\u201d he gestured.\u201cVery well, please have a good time\u201d the employee politely said and returned.Very good, now I can start training.The only thing I have to worry about is the strength.Gu Qing Shan drew an arrow used for training, only using 10% of his strength, lightly pulled the bow and fired.Oh no!As soon as the arrow left the bow, Gu Qing Shan immediately regretted.This shot he had unconsciously used the arrow guiding method of Shifting Flurry.But a shot arrow cannot be taken back.The arrow flew out in a twisted line, drawing a strange curve before hitting the bullseyes.A surprised shriek was heard.\u201cLook, look, that arrow can curve!\u201d a female student who what watching shouted.\u201cHow is that possible\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be, you must have seen it wrong\u201dA few people refuted her suspiciously.Right then, everyone was still concentrating on training, so no one else noticed it.Gu Qing Shan wiped the sweat from his forehead.What a blunder, accidentally using a Skill like that.He feigned ignorance of the commotion, pulled his bow and once again fired an arrow.This time, everyone else on the archery range all stopped their hands to look.Gu Qing Shan lightly let go.The arrow flew.But this time was a normal arrow, so everyone watching felt disappointed.Gu Qing Shan breathed out normally, then continued to shoot.In the next few minutes, he had shot 2 quivers worth of arrows, but did not create any more commotion.It was now that everybody stopped paying attention.Even the female student was muttering to herself: \u201cCould it be that I was dizzy?\u201dAfter a while, seeing that Gu Qing Shan held the same posture, using very standard, but also accurate archery, even she lost interest. A bit angry, she didn\u2019t bother with Gu Qing Shan anymore.Finally, Gu Qing Shan could sigh in relief, considering himself lucky.Putting down the bow used for training, Gu Qing Shan hesitated a bit, but still took the Night Rain out.Training bows are too normal, so Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t feeling it.He might as well use the Night Rain, that way, not only can he train his skills, he can also get used to using the Night Rain.The only thing he has to worry about is not using spirit energy, and pay attention to not use too much force.The former will create strange occurances, while targets can\u2019t handle the latter, drawing unnecessary attention to himself.Gu Qing Shan held the Night Rain, stood at the rented target, using minimal force to fire.This time he used a full hour.Gu Qing Shan happily trained, his whole body covered in sweat, but got more and more used to the Night Rain.Even though he couldn\u2019t use any Skills, the knowledge he gained on archery itself is real, this time he even drilled them into his body as muscle memory.While nonchalantly training, he didn\u2019t notice there were people staring straight at him, as well as the Night Rain.\u201cHello\u201dA voice was heard next to him.Gu Qing Shan looked back, only to see a young man standing at the target next to him while seriously evaluating him.\u201cWhat\u2019s it is?\u201d Gu Qing Shan lowered his bow and asked.\u201cCan I ask if your bow is for sale?\u201d\u201cSorry, it\u2019s not\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.The man still stared at the Night Rain, loudly: \u201cJust name a price, bargain a bit, to us money is no issue\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t intend to sell it\u201d Gu Qing Shan repeat.The young man shook his head, turned to go to another target.He went into a group of youths and repeated what Gu Qing Shan had said to the leader.The leader laughed when he heard that and said something.Just a moment later, the whole crowd of people went next to Gu Qing Shan\u2019s target.Gu Qing Shan seemingly not aware yet, still drawing arrow after arrow.\u201cYour bow isn\u2019t bad\u201dThe leader stares incessantly at the Night Rain, greed could be seen in his eyes.\u201cIt really isn\u2019t\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered\u201cI want to buy it\u201d the person said.\u201cI\u2019m not selling\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, how about this, you sell me the bow, we can be friends\u201d\u201cNot selling\u201dThe person thought for a bit, then said: \u201cThen how about a bet? I\u2019ll bet 100,000 credits\u201dArchery, this type of sport, by itself is a very good sport to bet on and discuss, not just aristocrats but even regular people who have a bit of money are willing to bet on it for a bit of fun.Right when Gu Qing Shan was a bit lacking money, so when he heard that he said: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but I have a condition\u201d\u201cHow dare you speak of conditions in front of Hui Shao!\u201d the young man from before shouted.\u201cDon\u2019t fuss, let him speak his condition\u201dHui Shao raised a hand to stop the other person and slightly cracked his head.Every time a fish is about to take the bait, he would always not be able to help it and crack his neck a little to hide his emotions.As long as the other party agrees to a bet, he have absolute confidence to win.It\u2019s just a few small tricks, some dirty, some aren\u2019t.This time he\u2019s prepared at least 5-6 of those.Because he really wants that special and powerful bow.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple condition\u201d Gu Qing Shan coldly replied \u201ctransfer the 100,000 credits first, if I win I\u2019ll take the money and leave, you win, both the money and the bow is yours\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll be taking your right hand\u201dSaying that, he clapped his hands.A middle-aged man wearing the club\u2019s uniform stepped out from the crowd.\u201cYoung master Hui, leave it to me\u201d the middle-aged man said.A person in the know immediately exclaimed: \u201cThe world\u2019s archery competition 3 times champion, Wu Sheng!\u201d\u201cOh man, poor that boy\u201d\u201cYeah, he bet an arm with Hui Shao, he\u2019s done for\u201d\u201cHah, how regretful for such a young man\u201dCompletely opposite to the rest of the people is the crowd behind Hui Shao, both clapping and laughing at another\u2019s misfortune.\u201cHa ha, such a prideful brat, I\u2019ve hated him from the start\u201d\u201cWait till he gets his arm chopped off, he\u2019ll probably pee his pants\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really worth watching!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the look on his face, ha ha ha!\u201dA moment later, Gu Qing Shan and Wu Sheng were both standing in front of their respective targets.\u201cBegin!\u201d an instructor signaled.Wu Sheng skillfully drew an arrow, aimed carefully and shot.Pew!The arrow accurately hit the bullseye.A loud cheer was heard around.\u201c10 points!\u201d\u201cAs expected from the world\u2019s 3 times champion!\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d\u201cLook at that posture, that calmness!\u201dHui Shao was also smiling.Looking at the other side.Gu Qing Shan had already shot 3 arrows, each of them neatly lined up next to each other on the outermost ring.The crowd of rich young masters laughed\u201c1 point\u201d\u201cHe only got 1 point\u201d\u201cNo, no, he got 1 point 3 times\u201d\u201cHa ha, he\u2019s definitely not keeping his arm\u201dGu Qing Shan still unfazed, kept shooting his arrows one after another.On the other side, Wu Sheng aimed for another while and finally shot the second arrow.Bullseye!10 points!Everyone kept cheering.Wu Sheng happily turned around and raised his bow in celebration.Looking at the other side, he can see the youth\u2019s hand hasn\u2019t stopped, already hit 7 arrows on the target.However, they\u2019re all 1 point.Wu Sheng shook his head and laughed sarcastically.What good does quick shooting do?7 shots couldn\u2019t compare to even one of his shots.He drew another arrow, pulled the bow and aimed again.The competition continued.15 seconds later.As time passed, the sound of cheering died down, replaced by the sound of gossip from around.Wu Sheng fired another shot, this time because of the crowd\u2019s noise, his nerves were affected and could only get 8 points.He couldn\u2019t help but turned around to look at what was happening on the other side.As soon as he looked, the bow in Wu Sheng\u2019s hand dropped to the ground, himself frozen in shock, unable to move.On the opposite\u2019s side target, arrows were lined up like a coiling string, having completely covered the outermost ring.Then the second outermost ring was also completely covered towards the inside.Once again the arrows were orderly lined up like a continuous string!After that was the 3rd ring from the outside, moving closer and closer to the bullseye.Gu Qing Shan happily shot arrows for another 15 seconds.In just 30 seconds total, the whole 5 quivers full of arrows prepared was all shot.\u201cThe end\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.In front of him, the whole target was covered in arrows lined up neatly, not leaving a single space left.Even the bullseye in the middle was covered in arrows, not even a small gap could be seen.On the other hand, there were only 5 arrows on Wu Sheng\u2019s target.No matter how hard Wu Sheng tried, in just a minute he couldn\u2019t possibly do the same thing as Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan stowed away the bow and turned around to leave.As he passed by Hui Shao, Gu Qing Shan stopped for a second and said: \u201cThank you for the credits\u201dHui Shao gripped Gu Qing Shan\u2019s shoulder with his hand, groaning: \u201cThis isn\u2019t over yet\u201d\u201cAh?

up.This one isn\u2019t simple, they all had the same thought.A police even couldn\u2019t help himself and drew his gun.\u201cDo you really want my bow that much?\u201d Gu Qing Shan looked at Hui Shao.Hui Shao smirked and said sarcastically: \u201cYou thief, this is my bow\u201dA police walked up and said: \u201cAccording to procedure, you\u2019re now a suspect, we need to check your personal records before you can hire a lawyer\u201dGu Qing Shan glanced at him and took out his Holo-Brain.The police that was talking to him felt like he was being stared at by some sort of an ancient predator, himself a prey.He shakenly took out the scanner from his belt and scanned the Holo-Brain.\u201cBeep!\u201d\u201cChecking personal record\u201d\u201cNot enough authority, access denied\u201dThe police Holo-Brain scanner repeated that message.The nonchalant look on the other policemen all disappeared at the same time.\u201cCaptain Zhang, it seems this brat have some status, you\u2019ll have to do it\u201d a policeman said.\u201cAlright, let me\u201dThe police captain stepped forward, taking Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Holo-Brain and scanned it.\u201cBeep!\u201d\u201cChecking personal record\u201d\u201cNot enough authority, access denied\u201dAll the policemen looked at each other, their hearts sank.Originally they thought it was a normal case of using status for bullying, but this looks more like a clash of giants instead.This kind of problem, if they don\u2019t handle it well they\u2019ll pay very dearly.Unconsciously, on their face showed a bit more respect.A policeman who was standing near Gu Qing Shan reluctantly showed a stiff smile and said: \u201cPlease wait a minute sir\u201dAnd then they looked at the crowd like asking for help.\u201cYou lot really can\u2019t even handle a small matter, do I have to do everything?\u201d a youth from the behind Hui Shao stepped out and said tiredly.He\u2019s the son of the capital\u2019s police department\u2019s commissioner, having already joined the police department from long ago, right now he\u2019s the department\u2019s vice-commissioner.These policemen are all his men.He took out a small scanner and scanned Gu Qing Shan\u2019s Holo-Brain.\u201cBeep!\u201dAs the scanner worked, the records slowly appeared on the screen.\u201cHah, it\u2019s like I always have to do everything myself\u201d said the youth as he showed a face of pride.Suddenly, a voice was heard from the scanner.This electronic voice also contained a hint of warning.\u201cToo many requests in a short period of time, increasing security level\u201d\u201cNot enough authority, access denied\u201dEveryone was immediately stunned, their eyes looking at Gu Qing Shan became very anxious.Just who is this person that could even deny investigation?\u201cI remember, the President\u2019s announcement from yesterday, he was there\u201d a policeman spoke.\u201cThat\u2019s right, he was the President\u2019s adoptive son\u201d\u201cThe President was going to help him enter University\u201dThe thing people fear most is when they don\u2019t know how deep your connections and influence go.Now that everyone knew who Gu Qing Shan was, they could be a bit calmer.So that\u2019s it, it\u2019s not that he\u2019s an unknown VIP or something, just that he has the President backing him.The current President is a kind and easy-going person, no matter if it\u2019s diplomatic military decisions or inside policing decisions, he always use relatively soft methods, gaining a lot of approval from all citizens.Even the youths from the 9 Lords families here feel this situation to be a bit hard to handle.Hui Shao suddenly laughed, and shouted: \u201cYou lot, hold down this brat for me\u201dA few unnoticed people started to move, their eyes locked onto Gu Qing Shan.\u201cHui Shao, this might not be ok\u201d the other youth scowled a bit and silently advised against it.\u201cI know my boundaries\u201d Hui Shao said, \u201cThe President\u2019s adoptive son got into an argument in a gym club, both sides fought a bit, nothing too major\u201d\u201cWe only need to give him a good beating to let go of our anger, when the President\u2019s term is over, I\u2019ll get him back later\u201dAs Hui Shao said that, the crowd around them returned to their nonchalant attitude.A few young people getting into conflict and fight a bit isn\u2019t anything too serious.This kind of \u201cnot too serious\u201d matter, even the President don\u2019t have any way to manage.\u201cBeat him good for me\u201d Hui Shao pointed at Gu Qing Shan \u201cI want to step on his face, let him know just who is the real master in this world\u201d\u201cYes\u201dAs the people stepped forward, their aura caught Gu Qing Shan\u2019s attention.\u201cHow interesting, since when did Supernaturalist were so cheap that they would become a noble\u2019s servant?\u201d Gu Qing Shan laughed.As the men hear that, their faces all changed.\u201cYou brat, how dare you\u201dAs he said that, his hand glowed a black aura and quickly stepped forward.\u201cDark-elemental? What a waste on someone like you\u201dJust as Gu Qing Shan said that, he had already raised his bow and fired.His hands so quick it became afterimages, as consecutive string sounds were heard and arrows disappeared one after another.Cries of pain could be heard one after another.The crowd couldn\u2019t even tell what happened before Hui Shao\u2019s subordinate all got knocked back.As they turned around, they all gasped.The five Supernaturalist were pinned to the wall, their feet in the air.The arrows had pierced their shoulders, passed through and stuck themselves in the walls behind.Red blood dripped down the white painted walls.One of the Supernaturalist still didn\u2019t give up and tried to raise his left hand.A flame rose from his palm.Just as the Supernaturalist wanted to act, he heard a voice asking.\u201cYou want to test to see if you\u2019re quicker, or am I quicker?\u201dGu Qing Shan lightly asked.His bow is still raised, but the aura around him already changed.Cold as ice killing intent emitted from his whole body, locked straight onto the Supernaturalist on the wall.A normal person who couldn\u2019t even breach the first stage of Dark-element is basically harmless so he doesn\u2019t need to care, but Fire-element is different.Of the 5-elements, Fire has one of the highest destructive capabilities, if the opponent really dares to use it, Gu Qing Shan will immediately take his life without any hesitation.The other person is also a veteran, as soon as he felt the killing intent, he looked to find a pair of calm eyes staring at him, and knew that he had really hit a hard wall this time.His Fire-element was awakened very late, so he\u2019s only just got to the second stage of \u201cSearing Flame\u201d, although the power is great, he still couldn\u2019t control it at will yet and needs time to focus his power.The enemy\u2019s arrows are too quick, so quick that no one could react, so quick that he couldn\u2019t react.Just then, if the enemy didn\u2019t aim at the shoulder, but somewhere else\u2026He deeply sighed and reluctantly dropped his hands.The whole scene was silent.Step, step, step, Gu Qing Shan walked forward, to where Hui Shao is.\u201cYou\u2019re part of the 9 Lords?\u201d he asked.Hui Shao stuck out his chest and said: \u201cI\u2019m part of the Lord of the Capital, Huang family\u2019s ------\u201cBah!A single slap, Hui Shao was knocked flying.Gu Qing Shan kept walking forward, looking down on the other party.\u201cYou dare to hit me, I\u2019m the second son of Huang Family, you\u2019ll pay for this with your life!\u201d Hui Shao held his bleeding face, screaming and shouting.\u201cI have to pay for this? Ah! You insect that only knows how to eat until you die, you think you deserve to speak that way to me?\u201dGu Qing Shan shook his head and coldly spoke.Everyone there was stunned speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Quickly find people! I\u2019ll pay up no matter how much it takes! I want him dead!\u201d Hui Shao laid on the ground, shouting.\u201cSeems like I\u2019ll have to wait for a bit\u201d Gu Qing Shan went up towards the target, once targeting started practicing his archery.These type of useless young masters, if he doesn\u2019t scare them completely, they\u2019ll definitely not let this go and find the opportunity to get back at him.Today, he has to scare them beyond reason to put this matter to rest.Right at this moment, the archery range door suddenly opened.An elegant female voice can be heard.\u201cAh? So many people standing still in the archery range, what is this?\u201dTogether with her voice, a beautiful female figure with her long head of crimson red hair entered the archery range.Behind the girl was two rows of men, wearing black suits and a badge that signals the Confederate Special Security Forces.An old man who was walking beside the girl smiled and spoke: \u201cLet me see, they\u2019re probably surprised that your Highness would appear so they\u2019re simply stunned is all\u201dAs the old man looked at the crowd, he saw the 2nd young master of Huang family lying on the ground with a face full of blood, unable to move.The old man opened his mouth wide in surprise, then gestured towards behind him.Two bodyguards quickly walked and carried Hui Shao up.One of them put his hand on Hui Shao\u2019s face.The bleeding immediately stopped, his face that was originally swollen also quickly got back to normal.As Hui Shao recovered and looked at the beautiful female exuding elegance, his anger from before became inconsequential.He asked with a low voice: \u201cElder Kang, this person is?\u201dThe old man gestured to him with his eyes, then turned towards the red-haired girl and spoke: \u201cYour Highness Royal Princess, please allow me to introduce to you, this is our capital\u2019s most influential of the 9 Lords, Huang family\u2019s--------\u201c\u201cWhoa, who did this?\u201dAnna completely ignored the other party, exclaimed excitedly while walking towards the end of archery range and looked at the wall.The 5 people pinned on the wall were still occasionally groaning from pain.At this time the old man finally noticed there were people on the wall at the end of the archery range, his face changed.What is this, an important ambassador is visiting the Confederate Capital, and they just happen to run into a scene of a fight?What\u2019s more, the police are here?Since when were capital police unable to even handle this kind of problem?This is a huge diplomatic problem now!The old man was furious, about to scold the people here.\u201cThat\u2019s quite skilled whoever did this, I really want to learn, please pardon me asking but who did this?\u201d Anna turned around, her face full of excitement and asked.The old man\u2019s words were stuck in his throat.Everyone around was also speechless at the scene they were seeing.Anyone can see, there was a fight that went on here, possibly escalating to a life and death situation.Yet her royal highness only felt that people being hanged on walls were highly entertaining.Rumor has it that the royal princess of the Empire does many things purely from her own preference, and have done things that makes people not knowing if they should laugh or cry, seeing it with their own eyes, that seems to be the truth.That youth, it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s in trouble or if this is a blessing.Even when he hit Hui Shao, he\u2019s still standing there just fine, but if he were to anger her royal highness princess Anna Medici of the Empire.Ahahaha\u2026Numerous eyes were concentrated on Gu Qing Shan.Looking at Anna acting, searching left and right, Gu Qing Shan almost couldn\u2019t help but smile.Gu Qing Shan have no idea why she\u2019s here, furthermore he has no idea what kind of stunt she\u2019s trying to pull off.Of course he\u2019s not scared of her, just that he\u2019s not really sure.Sure enough, Anna walked step by step towards Gu Qing Shan, then asked him with a face full of admiration\u201cSo it was you that shot them into the wall?\u201dWhen they heard that, everyone started sweating.\u201cYes I did\u201dGu Qing Shan kept up his act and answered.Anna\u2019s face slightly changed, she did curtsy then seriously requested: \u201cI\u2019ve long been interested in this noble sport, and seeing how excellent your archery is, could I ask of you to teach me, for the sake of our countries\u2019 friendship\u201dThis is completely perfect noble etiquette, from her actions to her words.Gu Qing Shan almost wanted to turn around and escape, but was still able to hold himself back.He completely couldn\u2019t predict what Anna just did.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t want to garner too much attention, only to pass by the last period of peace before the Apocalypse enjoying his University life.But the jewel of the Empire is already in front of him, all the people watching here are either noble or wealthy, as well as so many secret security and hidden information officers of the Confederate here, he\u2019s sure that everything that happens here will be known.Then there was another problem, if he were to disrespect the princess of the Empire in front of so many people, both the President and himself will be put into a hard situation.Fine, it\u2019s because she\u2019s Anna afterall.Gu Qing Shan silently sighed, then returned the courtesy: \u201cYour request is my honor\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Anna playfully blinked, then waved her hand upwards: \u201cClear the area!\u201dThe Confederate secret security personnel all scattered, politely persuaded the people here to leave the archery range.If you observe carefully, you\u2019ll see that even these highly trained bodyguards were also feeling helpless.Everywhere that the Empire\u2019s princess goes must be cleared like this, even a toilet, completely making people numb and speechless.But no one dare complain.St. Orlank Empire\u2019s emperor isn\u2019t someone they can just disobey.Even the royal princess herself is publicly known as a Supernaturalist feared by many.Rumour has it that her Fire-element has already awoken to its 4th stage \u201cBurning Sun\u201d.Fire-element, the first stage is simply called \u201cFire\u201d, as it evolves, it turns into \u201cSearing Flame\u201d.From the 3rd stage \u201cMagma\u201d and up, every stage is an immense increase in strength for the user.With her 4th stage \u201cBurning Sun\u201d, she\u2019s already stronger than 90% of all Professionists.Even without her status as a princess, simply with Anna\u2019s strength, she can enjoy the highest respect and admiration.A girl who have both noble status in the normal world, as well as overwhelming strength in the supernatural world, anyone that can earn her recognition would enjoy unimaginable benefits.Hui Shao\u2019s eyes turned a bit, then brought a few people over, smiled and said: \u201cYour royal highness, I would be honored to serve you\u201dAnna pointed at the wall -----where the bodyguards are thinking of ways to get the men off.She asked: \u201cCan you do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, but as the 2nd young master of Huang family, I know the capital like the back of my hand, I can guarantee ----------\u201cAnna opened her eyes wide, then very innocently asked: \u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then why are you still here?\u201dHui Shao was shut down completely.\u201cI don\u2019t associate with straw bags\u201d Anna said: \u201cMen, clear out the area!\u201d (TN: \u201cstraw bag\u201d=a thing/person that most people can\u2019t use)These words were like a sledge hammer, pounding on Hui Shao\u2019s self-esteem.Hui Shao was politely escorted out.Before leaving, he even glared at Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan was unfazed.A useless young master\u2019s grudge is something he can nonchalantly cut off.Gu Qing Shan walked up close to Anna, lowered his voice and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing? This will make me very passive you know\u201dAnna could tell he was a bit annoyed, replied pitifully: \u201cI wanted a Scorpio Palace\u201dJust that answer completely melted away Gu Qing Shan\u2019s other emotions.\u201cYou, hah, please tell me next time if you\u2019re going to appear suddenly\u201d he shook his head and answered.Seeing the matter was over, Anna\u2019s pitifulness on her face disappeared, returned to a bright smile and took a bow on the shelf.She spoke: \u201cFirst teach me how to use a bow, then tonight I have some things to ask you\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan was about to speak, a light was reflected in his eyes, turned into a line of blood-red text.\u201cTime flow is once again in chaos, the time has come\u201d\u201cThe user must enter the other world within 5 minutes, otherwise the messed up space-time flow will be permanent\u201d\u201cWarning, if the user were to refuse entry, the ability to travel to the other world will be completely lost\u201dGu Qing Shan was stunned as if struck by lightning.Why now?It\u2019s not the first time he experienced the place called Space-time vortex, so why did the situation become like this this time?Could it be because I entered that strange space?Inside the Space-time vortex, there are many strange sights, a few could affect the player, but to permanently affect the flow of time flow, this is a first even for Gu Qing Shan.Maybe, that space is more special compared to all the other spaces recorded in history?But when that corpse on the bronze pillar called for help I didn\u2019t even reply though!As he didn\u2019t have much time left, Gu Qing Shan pulled Anna to a relatively secluded spot and spoke in a low voice: \u201cI need your help with something\u201dAnna looked at him, curious: \u201cTell me first then\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t know what to say.The situation was very dire, he only had 5 minutes to escape from everyone\u2019s sight.But the whole club is surrounded by all manners of security for the sake of princess Anna\u2019s safety.If he wanted to escape alone without dealing with Anna first, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t have enough time, as all the layers of security will stop him first.But when the time comes, Gu Qing Shan could only enter without a choice.If the scene of Gu Qing Shan entering the game were to be seen, it could mean huge trouble.Gu Qing Shan isn\u2019t really afraid, but this will become a highly annoying wrench into his plan, affecting his actions afterwards.Anna seeing that he couldn\u2019t speak, took a glance at him.His eyes are a beautiful amber color, his eyelashes very long, every time he pulls the bowstring, his eyes would always gently lit up, showing a sense of focus and consciousness.When he mixes alcohol, his eyes show a deep mist, as if he\u2019s in another world altogether.He\u2019s wearing a white T-shirt, regular pants and sports shoes, simple as simple can be.But this person who\u2019s \u201csimple as simple can be\u201d, as he walked out from the bar, defeated dozens of Martial artists and 2 Mobile Mech in a matter of seconds.Some people need fancy clothing to be regal, but he doesn\u2019t.He himself is a King.Without a shred of hesitation while killing, yet very calm and composed while on TV, didn\u2019t even speak a single word.Feng Huo De said he was a bit hard to understand, but it\u2019s not that complicated, he\u2019s just a bit nervous and shy in front of the camera.Right at this moment, standing before her, he\u2019s showing an appearance of not knowing what to say, how interesting.Anna\u2019s mood became happy, her lips slightly lifted up.She put both hands behind her back, slightly bending forward and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s so hard to say, could it be that you want to confess to me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Princess! Where are you going?\u201d the old man panicked, hurriedly asked.The group of bodyguards were also very confused.They\u2019ve never met such a hot-headed guard target before, completely ignoring diplomatic etiquettes, already leaving before she said she would.\u201cWhere am I going? Ah, I\u2019ll be leaving to practice archery with my instructor here, I\u2019ll come back before the dinner party\u201d\u201cAh, yes, about this glass wall, please contact my father, he\u2019ll pay you back for it, thank you\u201dAs Anna said that, she closed the door.The Floating Fire engine roared and disappeared far into the distance in a single flash.The old man turned around and shouted at the people: \u201cWhat are you all standing there stunned for, quickly follow after the princess, if anything were to happen to her then it\u2019ll be a cause of war for our two countries!\u201dAll the bodyguards quickly woke from their state of confusion, scurried back to work.On the shuttle.Gu Qing Shan was looking at the time on his UI.There\u2019s about a minute left.As he looked at Anna, he could see she was busy piloting the shuttle to get away from the busy capital sky.Inside this shuttle was a shelf full of alcohol.Under the shelf there was a long compartment, inside there was quite a few cold weapons on display.Machete, Razor saws, Morningstar, Daggers, Short spears, Axes, Whip, Trident, pretty much anything you could think of, all of them really well made, clearly not just props.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand couldn\u2019t help but twitch.\u201cYou collect cold weapons?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a small hobby\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any swords here\u201d\u201cSwords, those things are too elegant, not aggressive enough\u201dGu Qing Shan was speechless.These girls, why do all of you keep looking down on swords.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorrowful.Ever since he stabbed his sword into the Final Demon Lord\u2019s heart, he hasn\u2019t even touch a real sword.Of course they do sell swords and other cold weapons on the market, but you can only swing those things around for a bit for fun, they\u2019ll immediately break in a real battle.Right now, Gu Qing Shan wants a sword even in his dreams, a real sword that he can use.40 seconds later.The Floating Fire was docked on a cliffside, on the outskirts of the capital.Gu Qing Shan spoke with a low voice: \u201cThis time I\u2019ll have to thank you\u201d\u201cWords aren\u2019t worth that much, I\u2019d rather take a Scorpio Palace instead\u201d as Anna said that she couldn\u2019t help but licked her lips.Of course she doesn\u2019t realize just how alluring that gesture was.Gu Qing Shan laughed a bit, then said: \u201cNo problem, if I\u2019m able to return this time, I\u2019ll invite you for a few\u201d\u201cHm? What do you mean\u201dAnna sensitively discovered the omen in his words, turning her eyes away from the dashboard and towards Gu Qing Shan.\u201cIf I\u2019m able to return, I\u2019ll tell you a secret, and also invite you for a drink\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.20 seconds left.Gu Qing Shan was prepared.He doesn\u2019t mind Anna knowing about this secret.From the first time since they met, he had already decided to make sure the horrible destiny that would befall Anna to not happen this time.10 seconds counting down.\u201cI\u2019ll be going\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.Anna suddenly thought of something, and unhooked a small black string out from behind her hair.On the string, there was an intricately shaped pendant, taken off from her snow-white skin.She quickly put it around Gu Qing Shan\u2019s neck and solemnly said: \u201cLive\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes showed clear surprise.Before he could say anything, a light already appeared.And Gu Qing Shan disappeared from Anna\u2019s sight.A few moments later.A black shadow approached from afar, stopping in front of the shuttle.The shadow stood up to become a man wearing sunglasses and neatly combed hair.\u201cPrincess, this is an official visit you know, suddenly leaving like that would create a lot of commotion\u201dFeng Huo De sighed, half complaining half persuading her.Anna sat silently in the shuttle, not saying anything back.As Feng Huo De saw the princess like that, he felt like something was off.Normally, if he tried to persuade her, she would snap back at him.What\u2019s with her today? There\u2019s not even a hint of disdain that she usually wears on her face.The princess almost looks lonely, did someone do something to affect her?Feng Huo De thought a bit, his tone softens and said: \u201cYour highness, actually this matter is nothing to worry about, we can just ignore it, you ----- are you ok?\u201dAnna tilted her head downward, still silent.Right until when Feng Huo De was so worried that he was about to call the medical team that the princess finally spoke\u201cHuo De\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here, princess\u201d\u201cHave you ever lost someone you hold dear?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, but that\u2019s a long time ago\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me today, suddenly I\u2019m very afraid that I won\u2019t be able to meet a certain person anymore\u201dJust what is wrong with the princess? I don\u2019t get what she\u2019s saying at all.Feng Huo De was worried; he couldn\u2019t help but observed her a bit closer to find some clues.Suddenly --------\u201cYour highness, where is your Life Exchange Contract!\u201d Feng Huo De exclaimed loudly.Princess Anna didn\u2019t say anything.Feng Huo De could only feel a cold sweat dripping down his back.The dropped down, painfully cried: \u201cWe\u2019re done for\u201dPrincess Anna\u2019s sight was focused on the horizon, silently spoke: \u201cThere won\u2019t be any problem\u201dIt\u2019s hard to tell if she\u2019s talking about Gu Qing Shan, or herself.\u2026A light covered Gu Qing Shan, travelling nonstop across the Space-time Vortex.Gu Qing Shan lightly touched the pendant on his neck, feeling all sorts of emotions.On the pendant was a statue, a statue of an old man with a calm expression, one hand holding a long scythe, while the other hand was holding up his own face while he sat sleeping on a stone.This is the Life Exchange Contract, also known as Death\u2019s relic.Whoever holds this in his hand, Death will prolong his life just before his moment of death.But such a miraculous ability would of course have its limits.Because Death will draw twice as much life force from whoever possessed it before the current holder.-------Death will never make a losing deal.Gu Qing Shan held the pendant tight.This relic has existed since over ten thousand years ago, a legendary item.Who could\u2019ve known it was in Anna\u2019s hands.Who could\u2019ve known that Anna would suddenly hang it on his neck like that.This girl, what a mess she\u2019s gotten herself into.If anything were to happen to him then she\u2019s finished.Gu Qing Shan wryly smiled, his eyes show determination.He already owes Anna once from his past life, even though later on he became a Great Sword Saint, she was already dead so he didn\u2019t even have the chance to try and rescue her.This life, he won\u2019t let it happen again!In front of him, a hole-like door slowly opened.And Gu Qing Shan flew inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Honestly I feel like the gore isn\u2019t that strong, but just in case.A transparent black cloud that covered the entire world.Drops of fire were raining down from the sky.As space itself ripped opened, Gu Qing Shan who was covered in a ball of light appeared hovering.Under the dark sky, the sound of fighting drew Gu Qing Shan\u2019s attention.On a mild hill a few meters above ground, a horde of black demons was rushing, pushing their way up.A few cultivators had their backs to each other, trying their best to fend off the demons.A few moments later, one of the cultivators suddenly got pulled out and surrounded by the demons, screaming as he was eaten alive.\u201cNo! Lil\u2019 bro!\u201dWithin the cultivators, one of them screamed sorrowfully, ran out of formation and went on a demon killing frenzy.But that accomplished nothing, as the smell of blood only made the demons also went into a frenzy, swarming them even quicker.In only a few breaths, the cultivator who got mad was already killed and eaten, bone and all.There were only 6-7 cultivators left, surrounded, like candles in the wind that could be blown out at any time.Gu Qing Shan looked at the bunch of them and mumbled: \u201cSeems like these are the men that General Sun Zhi left behind, since they haven\u2019t all died, seems like they do have some skills to them after all\u201dNot wanting to watch anymore, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s spirit energy moved, breaking open the light sphere and dropped down on a nearby hill.He specifically chose this place, as it wasn\u2019t far from where the cultivators are, plus they cultivators on the hill were already attracting the attention of the demons, so he was relatively safe.As he felt the ground under his feet, Gu Qing Shan retracted all the spirit energy around his body and held his breath.---------demons can feel both spirit energy waves and breathing, so he has to be careful.Suddenly a foul stench shot straight at Gu Qing Shan, as he dodged forwards a few feet...Chomp ------That sound was heard behind him.The large jaw missed, reluctantly retracted its head.As Gu Qing Shan looked back, his heart sank a bit.A Rotting Eater Demon was crawling forward; its whole body was like a hill of rotting meat that could move.The indescribable stench was once again felt as the adrenaline rush died down.This demon is known to eat anything, but it\u2019s favorite food are rotting corpses, as it gradually ate more and more, the smell has already seeped into every piece of flesh on its body.Normally, even the other demons will stay away from this one, simply because the smell is too foul.After the Rotting Eater Demon fails to eat its prey the first time, it shifted its neck, spitting out a viscous fluid, wanting to trap the prey in place.Not only is this fluid hard to dodge, it could also eat through flesh, if you don\u2019t prepare yourself and gets spit on, it could possibly dissolve your whole body in one go.This Rotting Eater Demon was emitting a strong aura, much stronger than a normal one, possibly already reached Foundation Establishment realm.Its fluid is so potent it might be able to eat through the bones as well.Gu Qing Shan already knew of their characteristics, so he quickly evaded, but still almost didn\u2019t make it out of the spit zone.The few cultivators on the hill were surprised.In fact, when Gu Qing Shan had just appeared in this space, they already immediately noticed.But when they saw that he was just a qi training realm cultivator, the hope that just appeared immediately got shattered again.The cultivators were in despair so thought that he couldn\u2019t survive for more than a few seconds, but they saw the unexpected.Gu Qing Shan was only a qi training realm, a whole realm lower than the Rotting Eater Demon, yet he could evade the surprise attack like that, you could say his performance is more than stellar.Seeing its prey once again evaded, the Rotting Eater Demon angrily wanted to roar.Once it draws attention here, it\u2019ll also bring more demons.When that happens, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s strength, being surrounded by demons can only mean death.Right at that dire second, the Rotting Eater Demon suddenly felt something was placed in its mouth.It was confused.With its intellect, it couldn\u2019t tell what it was, no matter how much it thought.By instinct, it closed it mouth and tried to chew the thing inside.---------what a strange feeling.Not what it usually likes to eat, but seems like it can be eaten.Hm, the more it eats the more delicious it seems, almost like it\u2019s good for it.The food made the Rotting Eater Demon calmed down.But what exactly is this?Rotting Eater Demon slowly stuck its claws inside its mouth, wanting to know what it just ate.It wants to remember this thing, to include in its list of menu.As Gu Qing Shan saw that, he silently crouched down, slowly backed away from the Rotting Eater Demon\u2019s sight.Just then he threw a stack of demon snake skin and bones from afar straight into the big mouth.This monster called Rotting Eater Demon, when it\u2019s hungry enough it could even eat rocks as food, let alone a rare monster like the demon snake, whose skin contains a lot of energy and definitely taste better than rocks and rotten corpses.While the Rotting Eater Demon was distracted by food, Gu Qing Shan had already silently snuck away.Hiding behind a large pile of rocks, he checked around.There weren\u2019t that many demons around this area, as most of them were scurrying up the other hill.On the other hill, the fight was getting more and more intense.The 6-7 cultivators were completely surrounded by the endless sea of demon, unable to retreat or advance at all.In a desperate fight for their lives, the cultivators couldn\u2019t help but use their spirit energy, fighting at full strength, so even here where he is he could feel their energy.Looking for just a few seconds, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face became much more serious.\u201cAll of them are Foundation Establishment realm, there\u2019s possibly also a Golden Core realm\u201dBoth the cultivators and the demons that fill this place was very much out of his league.\u201cLow cultivation limits the amount of things I can do, so there\u2019s only\u2026\u201dAs he was thinking, there was already 3-5 demons who took notice of him.They immediately rushed here, even used their hulking body to knock way those in their way, not wanting any more competitors for the meal.Gu Qing Shan simply ignored those Foundation Establishment realm demons, took out the formation plate, one hand holding the plate, the other quickly infusing spirit energy into it.His hands moved nonstop and shouted: \u201cCome this way!\u201dOn the other side, the cultivators lost another person, his body was eaten up right away, making their situation even more dangerous.They couldn\u2019t help but turned towards Gu Qing Shan when they heard that, quickly saw the dimly glowing formation plate and rejoiced.\u201cA formation plate!\u201d\u201cA formation user! It\u2019s a formation user!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, we\u2019re saved\u201dFormation users are an extremely rare existence, every single one of them is protected like treasures by their sect, that being the case, how would one of them appear here alone?But they didn\u2019t have the time to think about that.Suddenly seeing a chance for survival, their fighting spirit lit up once again and successfully pushed the wave of demons around themselves back a few feet.Under a cultivator\u2019s instruction, they gradually got closer to Gu Qing Shan.That cultivator pointed at two people and ordered: \u201cHe\u2019s only a qi training realm, your feet are quick, go protect him!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThis formation user could be their only hope to survive.The leader-like person waved the jade fan in his hand, firing spells one after another.Each and every demon that got his by his spells were frozen into statues, a few stronger demons that didn\u2019t get frozen was also slowed down greatly.The Sword cultivator and Blade user dashed forward, killing the demons with a few quick slashes.Having an area of effect Ice-type spell as cover, both of them were as quick as lightning, immediately got close to Gu Qing Shan and killed all the demons that tried to get close.Gu Qing Shan glanced at the two of them, his eyes couldn\u2019t move away from the swordsman\u2019s weaponA sword!Looking at the swordsman\u2019s sword, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s fingers couldn\u2019t help but twitch a bit.Since his return, Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t remember even a single Sword Skill, it\u2019s like all the Sword Skills he had learned in the past were completely sealed by the System.He could hazard a guess, the reason why the System did that was to lower the risk when travelling through Space-time as much as possible, to get away from a few large unnecessary troubles.Gu Qing Shan could still remember very clearly, after he returned, the System had said \u201cIllegal entry successful\u201dBut now that the return is done, the seal still hasn\u2019t been released.Something very deep in his instinct is telling him, he needs a sword.Just like numerous years ago, he needs a sword that can kill!The peak Foundation Establishment cultivator could feel Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes, looked at him in confusion.No, now\u2019s not the time yet!Gu Qing Shan held down his excitement, his eyes looked at the leader.\u201cSo he\u2019s an awoken Water-element user, at the second stage of Freezing Mist. If it wasn\u2019t for him, these people would probably have already died\u201dGu Qing Shan silently noted, turning to look at the 2 cultivators at the very back.They guarded on both sides of the leader, using their naked fists and kicks to knock away a large chunk of demons each time.These are martial cultivators, their blood essence had almost become solid as the power of martial arts flowed around their bodies.No doubt about it, they\u2019re true Martial Grandmasters, a few steps from advancing to Martial Eminence.Behind them, a flood of demons came down.In just a few seconds, all the cultivators had already surrounded Gu Qing Shan to protect him.The leader cultivator put away his jade fan, quickly asked: \u201cHow\u2019s the formation? Do you need our protection?\u201dEveryone looked at him.To arrange a formation requires time, if Gu Qing Shan takes too long, when everyone had reached the end of their ropes and he still hasn\u2019t finished setting it up then everything is just a big joke.As Gu Qing Shan heard that, he shook his head and replied: \u201cIt\u2019ll be done right away\u201dThe tapped the formation plate, both hands forming signs.The formation plate that Gong Sun Zhi gave him had quite a few advanced formations inscribed.As Gong Sun Zhi had already taught Gu Qing Shan the special hand signs needed to operate the plate, he only needs to infuse spirit energy into the plate and use the correct sign to use the formation he needs.Even a normal formation user needs hand signs to form and arrange the formation, so if you don\u2019t know anything, you\u2019d really believe Gu Qing Shan to be a real formation user.Only a truly masterful formation user like Gong Sun Zhi would be able to tell what the signs are for, and understand that he\u2019s a fraud.The only drawback being, formations on the formation plate all have limited uses, once they\u2019re all used up, the formation plate becomes useless.The situation right now is very dire, plus all the cultivators around him are strangers, so Gu Qing Shan decided to pretend to be a formation user.\u201cWater, Wind, Mist, Earth, Green River Sky Hidden Formation!\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan infused his spirit energy, star-shaped seal made of numerous stars appeared from the formation plate, among them were four especially noticeable stars.The formation is done!The strongest formation used for hiding on the plate was activated immediately, draining 70% of Gu Qing Shan\u2019s spirit energy.The light covered both him and the cultivators, in just a flash, they\u2019ve already disappeared from the sea of demons.Numerous demons couldn\u2019t find their target, still in a frenzy, they clashed and started killing each other.Only a few of the strongest, biggest demons couldn\u2019t be bothered, just picked up a few smaller demons, ate a mouthful of them then left.Their actions immediately stopped the other demon\u2019s frenzy.In just a few moments, half the demons already scattered.Inside the hidden formation, all the cultivators laid on the ground, breathing heavily.They\u2019ve all just about reached their limits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The clothes seem to be extremely clean, he fought the demons for so long yet not even a speck of blood was seen on him.Fire and Wind element users like to use fans as weapons, but Water-element users who uses fans are quite rare.His light blue armor naturally creates a layer of frost around himself, forming a cold breeze in the air.Quite a good frost armor, just this one armor probably costs a few hundred thousand low-tier Spirit Stones.Such a person has to be a direct disciple of a large sect. (1)Gu Qing Shan silently raised his opinion of this person and answered: \u201cThe formation can hold for about half an hour\u201dEveryone felt a bit relieved.Half an hour is enough to recover quire a large chunk of spirit energy, it would also somewhat remedy their loss of stamina.The leader person\u2019s face slightly relaxed and ordered: \u201cEveryone recover your strength on the spot, we\u2019ll move in half an hour\u201dHe tapped his Inventory Bag, taking out a few pills full of spirit energy and gave to everyone, including Gu Qing Shan.When Gu Qing Shan received the pill, he smelled it a bit and was surprised.\u201cSuch a good pill, it\u2019s a waste for a qi training realm to use\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, right now is a dire situation, just use it to recover your spirit energy\u201d the other person answered.\u201cThen thank you\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded as he hears that and didn\u2019t hesitate.This is a top-grade Crimson Crane Qi Holding Pill, the price for each must be thousands, no, up to ten thousand gold!It\u2019s an incredibly valuable pill, not only could it quickly and stably recover spirit energy, it would also not have any side effects on the body, very highly praised by people in the cultivation world.A single one of this pill is enough to be used as a life-saver in battle.To be able to casually give one out to everyone here, means that this person is not only a person of great character, but also that he\u2019s from a higher upbringing.He is only a few years older than Gu Qing Shan, but his tone of voice is already grown up and fluid, only that his eyes are a bit cold, his face shows a hint of purposeful detachment from everyone.As he noticed Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes on him, he clasped his fist: \u201cI am Leng Tian Xing, direct disciple of Yao Guang Sect, hereby thank you for your reinforcement\u201dYao Guang Sect? (TN: lit. Origin Light Sect)Just as I thought, Gu Qing Shan silently confirmed.This is a large monster of a sect in the cultivation world, their tradition goes back a few hundred thousand years, one of the sects that everyone has heard about in the cultivation world.However, such a brilliant person was never heard of, so he must\u2019ve died in this place in the other life.But not just him, even Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t guarantee his own survival in this desolate destroyed world.Gu Qing Shan silently exhaled, then also clasped his fists: \u201cI\u2019m Gu Qing Shan\u201dLeng Tian Xing returned the gesture: \u201cNice to meet you\u201dBoth of them are not people who would talk much, after their little chat, they returned to meditating and rest.Very quickly, everyone closed their eyes and went into deep meditation.Gu Qing Shan tapped his Inventory Bag, took out the military qi training method booklet and turned the pages.On the War God UI, he glanced at the amount of Soul Points.\u201cTo comprehend qi training 7th stage: Shen Tang breakthrough method, Soul Points cost: 6\u201d\u201cComprehend\u201d\u201cComprehension completed, Current Soul Points: 21/7\u201dAfter that, Gu Qing Shan swallowed the valuable Crimson Crane Qi Holding Pill, together with 3 mouthfuls of demon snake blood.Right now if he doesn\u2019t take the chance to break through, it is very possible for him to just die on the spot, so he has to at least attempt it.Taking advantage of the Crimson Crane Qi Holding Pill\u2019s powerful effects and the enhanced senses from the demon snake blood, Gu Qing Shan just might be able to break through stage 7 right now.Time quickly passed.Inside the formation, a tiny wave of spirit energy slowly ripples, like throwing a stone into the calm water.Gu Qing Shan used Soul Points to breakthrough, so he immediately recovered his spirit energy to full.This little bit of inconsequential change also affected the environment a bit.Feeling the essence of the world around them changed, everyone opened their eyes in surprise.Leng Tian Xing\u2019s face slightly relaxes a bit, saying: \u201cCongratulations friend, seems like you\u2019ve benefited\u201dGu Qing Shan wryly smiled and shook his head: \u201cIt\u2019s still only qi training stage 7, and I still have to thank your pill\u201d\u201cNo need to be reserved, our lives were saved by you after all\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, don\u2019t mention it\u201dEveryone there congratulated him.You could feel their spirit raised as they looked at each other in joy.Every time a cultivator reached a new realm, the spirit essence of the world will wash through their bodies, recovering the spirit energy that they\u2019ve used until the amount in their Dantian becomes full.A pill\u2019s power is slow and steady, how would it even compare to a gift from the world?Gu Qing Shan breaking through means that in just a few seconds, the spirit energy he used for formations has already fully recovered.And since he broke through qi training stage 7, his total spirit energy should have also increased by 30%.What does a formation user who have recovered to his peak condition mean?It means that Gu Qing Shan could potentially use that formation he just used once again ----------possibly twice, because his total spirit energy was increased by a large margin.All cultivators here understand very clearly just how good the formation was.To be able to completely hide their presence among a sea of demons, it\u2019s completely a life-saver.That way, everyone\u2019s chance of survival increased another bit.Of course, they don\u2019t know that Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t actually know how to arrange formations.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case\u201d Leng Tian Xing stood up \u201cwe can break through the encirclement to go towards the Northwest direction, there is a cave there where General Sun Zhi had arranged a base with a permanent Invisibility formation, it can provide a place for us to rest and fully recover\u201d\u201cGood\u201d\u201cDeputy Leng is the smartest of us all, I agree\u201d\u201cRoger\u201dThe rest of them replied.Gu Qing Shan silently checked his map, seeing that the place where they wanted to go was the same as his, he was able to calm down.Right now the demons have already scattered about, only a few demons that still couldn\u2019t settle down and are still fighting leftLeng Tian Xing started pointing to each person and gave them their missions: \u201cWu Jin, Ma Liu, you two are the vanguards, Wang Cheng, Luo Xiao, you two take care of the side\u201dHe looked at Gu Qing Shan and asked: \u201cYou\u2019re the formation user, so you can stay at the middle and protect yourself, any problems?\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t hesitate and answered: \u201cNo problems\u201dIn the middle of a demon encirclement, it\u2019s dangerous no matter which direction it is, only the middle of the crowd will be the safest place.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s formations are much stronger than they had thought, numerous demons still couldn\u2019t find their presence at all, so in a life-and-death situation, he could once again save all their lives.The Sword cultivator called Wang Cheng suddenly asked: \u201cWhat about you, Deputy Leng?\u201dLeng Tian Xing answered without changing his expression: \u201cI\u2019ll be at the back, responsible for back guard\u201dThe back is the most dangerous position in a retreat, yet Leng Tian Xing was willing to take it on himself.This was a reason for everyone\u2019s admiration.After Leng Tian Xing arranged the positions, he clasped his fist and looked around: \u201cIf we can get out of this dire situation, I will personally invite all the brothers here to join Yao Guang Sect, as our stewards\u201dNote:(1) direct disciple: this

Die, all of you!\u201dAs the demons weren\u2019t prepared, a few demons with a monster body and beast heads were beaten to a pulp by Wu Jin.One breath, two breaths, ten breathsHoh, hoh, hoh!As Wu Jin breathed out a stream of white smoke, his barrage stopped.After a burst of strength like that, he\u2019s already a bit tired.\u201cNext is me\u201dMa Liu changed places with him, his body turned into a hulking giant, holding a metal staff in hand, he knocked down demons left and right while advancing.At this time, Wang Cheng and Luo Xiao had already drew their weapons and jumped out at the same time.Slash after slash of both Sword and Blade, cutting the demons on both sides of Wu Jin and Ma Liu into showers of blood.Gu Qing Shan ran after them without any hesitation, with the formation plate in hand, he lightly shouted: \u201cGreat spirit of the earth, heed my call, break!\u201dLayer upon layer of demons that were rushing them immediately all fell down.Under them, the ground broke into near bottomless crevasses, buried and stopped the demons\u2019 movement.Leng Tian Xing was surprised.This formation user, even though his cultivation isn\u2019t that high, he is able to command the formations at will, quite adept at what he does.And a great help.\u201cA chance!\u201dLeng Tian Xing raised his fan and casted a spell without hesitation.\u201cFrost Blade True Slash!\u201dStrings of white emitting bone-chilling frost suddenly appeared in front of the group.Just like a harvest, the strings quickly cut down a large area of demons at once.The horde of demons just around them was quickly cleaned out, reducing the group\u2019s pressure.Just as that happened, Gu Qing Shan had finished preparing the next formation as he put the plate in front of himself, both hands quickly making the signs\u201cWind, Fire, Lightning, Water, Heaven Earth Spirit Funnel!\u201dThe spirit energy light turned into a string and coiled around the 6 of them.\u201cWhat! A mobile Spirit Funnel!?\u201d Leng Tian Xing exclaimed.All the cultivators were surprised, then as they found their spirit energy recovering, the surprise turned into joy.Wu Jin laughed heartily: \u201cHaha, great formation user! If we make it back alive, I\u2019ll definitely take you as my good brother!\u201dWang Cheng is a cold-faced swordsman, shaking off the black blood on his sword he said: \u201cHow quick!\u201dNormally, a Spirit Funnel could only be stationary, as it was moved it would very quickly lose the effectiveness.Only formation users of the highest caliber could create a temporary small-scale Spirit Funnel that could be moved.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s actions shocked everyone here.No one could look down on him again.Formation is the second hardest to learn of the 6 arts.While the hardest would be Divination.To master both formation and Divination, it\u2019s the same as trying to climb against a waterfall and dig a hole in the sky at the same time.On average,out of 100 cultivators with decent talent, 5-6 of them could reach Golden Core realm.But if the same 100 cultivators were to try and learn formation or Divination, then not even one would succeed.This is one of the main reasons why Gong Sun Zhi is regarded so highly in history.\u201cGood\u201dLeng Tian Xing also complimented, his left hand creating hand signs, his right waving the fan as he cast another spell.\u201cSoul Claiming Frost Blade!\u201dAs the air became twisted, crescent-shaped ice blades flew out, cutting through the wave of demons chasing behind them.They kept on moving just like that, very quickly already passed the halfway mark.\u201cWe\u2019re close!\u201dSaid Leng Tian Xing as he saw the two martial artists already showing signs of fatigue on their faces, to motivate them.Everyone felt relieved.Gu Qing Shan looked around, suddenly reminded them: \u201cWang Cheng, Luo Xiao, you two are too far, it\u2019s dangerous!\u201dThe Swordsman and Blademaster was a bit too deep into the horde of demons, getting further and further away from the group as they fought.They\u2019ve already gotten out of Gu Qing Shan\u2019s formation range.As soon as Wang Cheng heard that, he turned around, hesitated a bit before hearing Leng Tian Xing shout: \u201cCome back!\u201dWang Cheng immediately acted, wanting to get back.But it was too late.A giant Demon Hand sprouted from the ground, grabbing Wang Cheng and crushed him into a ball of flesh.A sharp, powerful Sword Cultivator died, just like that.His Longsword was still covered in blood, flew through the sky and almost fell into the endless horde of demons.Right at that moment, Gu Qing Shan reached out his hand, moved the spirit energy in his body to control Wang Cheng\u2019s sword from afar and retrieved it.On the other side, the Blademaster Luo Xiao was already heading back, suddenly his leg was grabbed by a half-sized Crimson Gold demon and fell down.Almost immediately as he fell, Luo Xiao\u2019s head was bitten off by a dog demon, without being able to even scream for help.The dog demon was afraid it might get its food stolen and ran away as soon as it bit off the head.The other demons also quickly rushed up, ripping apart Luo Xiao\u2019s body.As the smell of blood got around, the demons once again let out a frenzy screech.More and more demons are coming.As two cultivators died, the pressure on the rest of them increased exponentially.In just a few moments, both Ma Liu and Wu Jin\u2019s body were already covered in blood with wounds all over.Gu Qing Shan felt nervous and asked: \u201cHow close are we?\u201dLeng Tian Xing hesitated to answer: \u201cWe\u2019re just a little more away, do you want to try rushing there at once?\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the two martial cultivators and answered in a low voice: \u201cWe can\u2019t, the demons know how to read the situation, if we simply rush forward, they\u2019ll be prepared\u201dThe turned the formation plate and shouted: \u201cWater, Wind, Mist, Earth, Green River Sky Hidden Formation!\u201dThis formation can only be used twice, after this, there won\u2019t be any left for them to hide from the demons.As the formation plate light up, it concentrates the spirit essence of the world.Water, Wind, Mist, Earth, the four elements arranged themselves in a unique way, as the formation was formed.Just like that, the cultivators that were in trouble disappeared right under the demons\u2019 eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I won\u2019t forgive him!\u201dLeng Tian Xing looked at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands without blinking and spoke with a low voice: \u201cLook carefully first\u201dGu Qing Shan stabbed the dagger deep into Wu Jin\u2019s chest, then twisted it as he reached the heart.The heart wound was cut open as a shriek could be heard.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes grew serious, slowly pulling the dagger out.As Ma Liu saw the dagger, he opened his mouth wide.A black imp only as big as a thumb was pierced on the dagger.The imp struggled, but no matter how much it tried it couldn\u2019t break itself free.Its feet and hands were full of sharp claws, as it struck the dagger a metal sound could be heard.\u201cA Heart Stealer Imps, goes in through the mouth and eats the heart\u201d as Gu Qing Shan finished, he gave the dagger to Ma Liu, saying: \u201cavenge Wu Jin\u201dMa Liu\u2019s eyes glowed red, opened his palms and squeezed the dagger.The black imp was crushed together with the dagger.\u201cHahaha, ha ha ha ha ha, so this is the end\u201dMa Liu suddenly laughed like he was mad.Leng Tian Xing\u2019s face changed, grabbed him and said: \u201cA dead person can\u2019t be revived, don\u2019t kill yourself as well!\u201dMa Liu pushed him away and screamed: \u201cHe died, he already died do you understand? We\u2019re all going to die here\u201dGu Qing Shan stood up and seriously said: \u201cWe won\u2019t, we still have a chance\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to run away first\u201d Ma Liu\u2019s bloodshot eyes stared at Leng Tian Xing, then at Gu Qing Shan as he spoke confused: \u201cI\u2019m going to go first, none of you stop me, who dares to stop me?\u201dSaying that, a black aura could be seen from his body.As soon as the black aura appeared, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face also changed.As Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing looked at each other, they could see the nervousness in the other\u2019s eyes.Gu Qing Shan took a few steps backwards, one hand gripping the formation plate, another at his back, ready to take out the bow at any time.--------the sword that he took is still in his Inventory Bag, he hasn\u2019t touched it yet.Leng Tian Xing face was as deep as water, taking step by step backwards, still with his fan in hand.Both of them stood parallel, the spirit energy inside their Dantian rushed around their body, like a bow that\u2019s pulled but not yet released.\u201cKill, kill, kill kill kill, kill all the demons\u201dMa Liu was mumbling to himself, a dark light was seen shining on his body.Suddenly black flowers appeared out of nowhere, numerous beauties were seen inside, showing off their alluring bodies, their captivating eyes staring at Ma Liu.The black flowers circled around Ma Liu, divided into two and went into Ma Liu\u2019s ears.Then another went into his mouth.Finally, the dark light almost seems to solidify and went into his eyes.The red glow in Ma Liu\u2019s eyes were soon replaced by darkness.\u201cKill\u201dHis hoarse voice repeated the same word over and over, slowly stepped outside the formation, swinging his fist to kill the demons outside.But very quickly, the endless horde of demons surrounded him, turning him into a walking ball of flesh.The demons bit him one after another, but Ma Liu almost seems unconscious, only kept swinging his fists, killing the demons that approached him in front.In just a few moments, the demons had already eaten Ma Liu, not leaving even a strand of hair left.It was only then that the dark light gradually dissipated.In the empty air, a satisfied moan could be heard.\u201cDelicious\u2026 Soul\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing silently watched that scene, their bodies were soaked in sweat.It wasn\u2019t until a while later that they could look at each other again.\u201cWhat exactly was that?\u201d Leng Tian Xing muttered.Different from himself that was always calm and collected, right now he\u2019s feeling fear.\u201cTianma, almost invincible existences\u201d Gu Qing Shan sighed and looked around.\u201cWhat is a Tianma?\u201d Leng Tian Xing asked.\u201cA kind of demon that doesn\u2019t have a body, experts in breaking your mind and taking your soul\u201dGu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t want to say too much, lest he loses his fighting spirit as well.Fuck! Fuck! Why are there Tianma here, right now I don\u2019t have any items from Buddhists that I can use to repel them.If Tianma are around, the situation is at least ten thousand times more dire than before.Tianma are intangible, they can always see through a cultivator\u2019s cracks in their mind, using that to eat away their souls.Both Leng Tian Xing and himself have no way to deal with them right now.Tianma carry a strong sense of territory, so unless they\u2019re forced to, they won\u2019t get out from their territory.Because of that, the only way to live right now is to quickly get out of here.As he thought that, Gu Qing Shan quickly asked: \u201cDo you have any more Crimson Crane Qi Holding Pill?\u201dLeng Tian Xing took out two glowing transparent pills in his hand: \u201cThe last two\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t hesitate and said: \u201cGive them both to me\u201dLeng Tian Xing looked at him.Gu Qing Shan spoke: \u201cFirst, you still haven\u2019t used much spirit energy, second, I\u2019ll be the vanguard next\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll open the way?\u201d Leng Tian Xing asked in surprise.\u201cYes, it\u2019s already a do-or-die situation, either we die here, or to cut open a path to live\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered with a low voice.He could tell, Leng Tian Xing is very strong at spells, but weak at close combat, without a powerful ally to buy time for him to cast his spells, even if Leng Tian Xing is stronger he won\u2019t be able to make it pass this last leg of the journey.\u201cFine\u201d Leng Tian Xing was silent for a bit, then said: \u201cIf you die, then me having one more Crimson Crane Qi Holding Pill won\u2019t make a difference\u201dHe threw the 2 pills over.During the fight just now, Leng Tian Xing didn\u2019t really use too much spirit energy, so even if he uses the pill it won\u2019t be as effective as Gu Qing Shan eating the pill.If Gu Qing Shan can recover his full spirit energy, he can use this formation again, to hide the two of them one more time.That way they\u2019ll get another chance at a breather.This is what he thinks.He doesn\u2019t know that the formation can no longer be used.Gu Qing Shan received the pill, swallowed one right away and put away the second.His impression of Leng Tian Xing increased again.To know the logic is one thing, to be able to just hand out such a valuable pill is another.In a crisis situation, to be able to trust others that much makes him a suitable comrade.Since that\u2019s the case, he can be relieved to concentrate on killing demons, to get out of the Tianma\u2019s territory as soon as possible.Gu Qing Shan already decided and spoke: \u201cThe formation can still hold for a bit; you rest up first\u201dSaying that, he walked to Wu Jin\u2019s body, took off the heavy shoulder pads on Wu Jin and put it on himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(TN: lit. Thousand Rides)As he carefully felt it, he could tell the sword carried a hint of cold air.Gu Qing Shan lightly swung the sword, and the cold air flows outwards.Sword Cultivator Wang Cheng was the captain of Qian Qi squad, so according to the appropriate treatment, his Longsword was forged with a small bit of Cold Core iron.With only a little bit of Cold Core iron, this sword has already become twice as sharp.The only thing bad thing about the sword, is that while forging, the smith only paid attention to sharpness, so he made the sword about half an inch thinner, making the sword very prone to bending during an intense fight, possibly even breaking.\u201cYou understand swordmanship?\u201dLeng Tian Xing asked as he saw him so carefully looked at the Longsword.Right now he can no longer underestimate this formation user with low cultivation, so he\u2019s speaking as if they were equals.Gu Qing Shan unfazed and answered: \u201cI understand it a bit\u201dIn front of him, the War God UI was full of notifications.\u201cDiscovered weapon: Sword\u201d\u201cDetected that user knows 1753 kinds of Sword Skills\u201d\u201cDetected that the user has War God UI, War God Skill turned on\u201d\u201cNo traces of Demon God, current situation found to be stable\u201d\u201cProtection measures unlocked, begin memory recovery\u201d\u201cAwaken!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, the user can use Soul Points to regain his previous Sword cultivation\u201dGu Qing Shan stood straight up and lightly swung the sword in his hand.\u201cPing\u201dAnother System sound was heard.\u201cIn accordance to user memory, considering user\u2019s current cultivation, current list of Sword Skills that will not cause the user\u2019s soul to collapse as follow:\u201dThe War God UI was showing a list of choices in front of Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes.\u201cSword Skill: Wind Slashing Style\u201d\u201cSword Skill: Bai Tai Style\u201d (TN: lit. dice into a hundred pieces)\u201cSword Skill: Flowing Clouds Style\u201d\u201cSword Skill: Kai Shan Style\u201d (TN: lit. cut open a mountain)\u201cSword Skill: Four Seas Style\u201d\u201cSecret Art: Water Flow Severance\u201d\u201cSeeing that the user had a very deep understanding of the sword, the cost to awaken his own sword cultivation reduced to its lowest\u201d\u201cTo awaken a Sword Skill, Soul Points Cost:5\u201d\u201cTo awaken a Secret Art, Soul Points Cost:10\u201dA Secret Art is a very powerful Sword Style, these kinds of sword styles usually only have a single move, commonly regarded as the king of sword styles.If you look at it from a cultivator\u2019s perspective, Secret Arts are the spells and techniques of a Sword Cultivator.Gu Qing Shan only glanced over and quickly made his choice.\u201cAwaken Wind Slash Style, Kai Shan Style; Awaken Secret Art: Water Flow Severance\u201d\u201cPing\u201d\u201cWind Slash Style, Kai Shan Style, Secret Art Water Flow Severance has awakened, Soul Points cost: 20\u201d\u201cCurrent Soul Points: 1/7\u201dAs his Soul Points goes down, Gu Qing Shan felt images deep from inside his memory resurfacing.All the images that were sitting in his memory collecting dust suddenly became active again, just like they only happened yesterday.An outpost at the frontline.A bunch of soldiers were gossiping, discussing things between themselves.\u201cHah, even he wants to learn the first 3 moves of Wind Slash?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just trash. The game had already begun over half a year ago and yet he\u2019s only starting now\u201d\u201cYeah, all our Sword Skills had already begun to take shape and he\u2019s only arrived at the Vanguard Legion, at least it\u2019s not all bad, we have fodder to use now\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, from now on, whenever we have to sortie, just let him go first\u201d\u201cAhaha, you\u2019re right\u201dThe voices and images disappeared as the scene changed.The moon was high up in the sky, no one was around.He\u2019s still there alone, practicing his Sword Skills.The skin on his right hand has already all but peeled off, his hands wrapped in numerous layers of bandages, even just gripping the sword he could feel intense pain.You can\u2019t, you can\u2019t give up, this is the only chance for you to change your fate.Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth, extremely determinedThe sword was swung once again.The bandage has already begun to leak blood.Soaked in sweat, he was focused only in training this Skills.The scene also slowly faded as a new scene appeared.\u201cVanguard Legion Gu Qing Shan, for your bravery and effort in defeating the demons, you are hereby bestowed the full secret scripture of Wind Slash Sword Style\u201d\u201cPing!\u201dThe scene changed again.On a high platform, Gu Qing Shan was performing the Wind Slash Sword Style with absolute perfection.\u201cHm, he\u2019s interesting, but he\u2019s too old, how regretful\u201d\u201cBeing that old, his potential will be limited, we don\u2019t need him\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s already almost 20, yet he only knows a single Wind Slash Style, seems like his ability to comprehend isn\u2019t anything special, we also don\u2019t need him\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s decided, semester examination results are a failed?\u201d\u201cHm, I agree\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s that, call on the next one\u201dThe scene changed.Gu Qing Shan was like a walking corpse, stood still on the street as snow fell on his body.Suddenly two cultivators walked by him, speaking in a low voice\u201cThe auction house has quite a few Sword Styles for sale, I especially like one of them, but the price is a bit too high, I\u2019ll have to go earn a bit more Spirit Stones\u201d\u201cAh, is that so, you want me to help a bit?\u201d\u201cIf you can then thank you\u201dAs their conversation was heard by Gu Qing Shan, he suddenly turned around.\u201cFellow Daoist, is what you just said true?\u201d\u201cWhere did this trash qi training realm come from, scram!\u201d\u2026.\u201cYou are Gu Qing Shan?

Hah, so you\u2019re a pitiful person as well, then we have a deal\u201dThe scene went away again.Numerous scenes just like that kept appeared then disappeared, as the Sword Styles in his mind became clearer and clearer.His whole memory has returned.Gu Qing Shan sighed and raised the Longsword.\u201cFinally I\u2019m back\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Sword Saint Gu Qing Shan\u201dHe declared with a low voice.Leng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying and became cautious.Suddenly saying nonsense, could it be Tianma are appearing again?Gu Qing Shan slowly stepped forward, each step was a swing of the sword, as he got used to the Sword Styles.All the Sword Styles that War God UI picked out were ones that he knew, furthermore, the ones he knew best.Choosing these 3 Styles, Gu Qing Shan had thought it through very seriously.Wind Slash Style is extremely quick, Kai Shan Style had a heavy swing, both of them complemented each other.Water Flow Severance is the first ever Secret Art that he learnt, in the current situation, he has to awaken it no matter what, to use as a trump card.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Sword or Martial arts? I can\u2019t really tell\u201dGu Qing Shan when hearing thought also felt a bit of a headache, as he couldn\u2019t really tell others that he used Soul Points to learn Skills.He thought a bit, then said: \u201cHoh, my main cultivation isn\u2019t Martial arts, neither am I a pure formation user\u201dLeng Tian Xing unconsciously repeated: \u201cNot a main Martial arts cultivator?\u201dGu Qing Shan swallowed the Crimson Crane Qi Holding pill he was keeping in his mouth and answered: \u201cI know a bit of martial arts, but I can\u2019t call myself someone who focus himself on being a martial artist\u201d\u201cI also know a few Sword Styles and a bit about formation, only that\u201dLeng Tian Xing was a bit shocked, still unable to really comprehend what he was seeing.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t say anything more, closed his eyes and circulated his spirit energy, to thoroughly absorb the pill\u2019s energy.A while later, Leng Tian Xing spoke: \u201cYour knowledge is too wide-spread, later on it will be very hard to reach the top for any of them\u201dThis is a friendly advice.A cultivator who\u2019s well-versed in multiple subjects isn\u2019t always a good thing, when they all reach a certain point, it will become incredibly hard to improve anymore.Gu Qing Shan could tell the other party\u2019s good will, smiled and said: \u201cNo worries, it\u2019s just a few means\u201dLeng Tian Xing: \u201cMeans?\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cYes, the means to survive\u201dThese words are calm, but contains immense sorrow and struggle, almost reflecting the whole journey of everything that he\u2019s been through just to live.This is also a true depiction of humanity as a whole during the last few years of the Apocalypse.As Leng Tian Xing heard that, he seems to have understood something.Finished preparing, Gu Qing Shan stood up, his body slightly leaned forward just like Wu Jin from before, aiming the shoulder pad towards the outside of the formation, pacing back and forth a few times.Gu Qing Shan said: \u201cWe have about half a stick of incense\u2019s time left, then the formation will disappear\u201dLeng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but asked: \u201cHow can I help?\u201dWhen it was a crowd of people, he held the position of leader, but after everyone had already died and there\u2019s only Gu Qing Shan and himself, he unconsciously considered Gu Qing Shan to be the leader.A peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, actively asking a qi training cultivator for order, what a very rare sight to see.Both of them didn\u2019t take notice of it, but it very naturally happened.Gu Qing Shan used the sword to point outside the formation, asking: \u201cDo you see that Rotting Eater Demon there?\u201dThe same demon that attacked him when he teleported here.Leng Tian Xing answered: \u201cI can\u201dGu Qing Shan then said: \u201cThat monster is extremely foul-smelling, disgusting to both humans and demons alike, I want you to get me one of its eyes\u201dLeng Tian Xing\u2019s spirit energy flowed from his body, stood up and asked: \u201cYou want me to leave the formation to kill it?\u201dGu Qing Shan stopped him: \u201cNo, with a bit of smart\u201dSuddenly Gu Qing Shan took the Heart Stealer Imp on the ground, chopped into pieces, then took out demon snake blood, pouring it on the imp\u2019s body.After that, Gu Qing Shan dug out a few stones about half the size of a person, neatly lining them up on the ground.He carefully smeared the imp blood onto the stones.Leng Tian Xing could only watch the scene in silence.Everything he\u2019s doing is completely out of his comprehension.Outside the formation, the Rotting Eater Demon was slowly moving.It\u2019s still hungry, and looking to find some crippled demons among the mass of demons here to eat.All the other demons are staying as far away from it as possible, they\u2019d rather fight with some other demon to the death than to get close to the foul Rotting Eater Demon.The Rotting Eater Demon is strong, but its speed is so pathetically low that others of the same realm as it could outrun it, normally it could only eat rotten stuff that\u2019s already dead.While the Rotting Eater Demon was worried about food, it suddenly felt a \u201cpap\u201d as something that\u2019s coated in an alluring smell dropped right beside it.Taking a look, it could tell this was a square stone, but the color was a bit different, looks like\u2026 something that it likes.The Rotting Eater Demon moved its nose and sniffed.The smell of blood.This thing isn\u2019t so bad, but there\u2019s too little, not enough to even stick to its teeth.The Rotting Eater Demon originally didn\u2019t want to bother with it, but the alluring smell of blood was covered in a scent of energy and made it opened its mouth on instinct.It quickly jumped forward and ate the stone as well as a patch of dirt in a single bite.------tastes nice, sadly there\u2019s too little.While the Rotting Eater Demon was feeling sad, it heard another sound as another strange thing dropped down near it.This distance, it only needs to move a bit to reach.The Rotting Eater Demon slowly crawled over and ate it.Energy, smell, taste together with a cold, hard feelings, the Rotting Eater Demon only didn\u2019t care about the last part.------are there more?It felt great hope and anticipation.Then a miracle!Another square rock dropped very near where it was.The Rotting Eater Demon took the time to crawl over.\u2026..Gu Qing Shan looked at the Rotting Eater Demon and said: \u201cIt\u2019s coming; you only have one chance\u201dLeng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit pressured: \u201cWhat if I fail?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cThen we will have to think of another way, but this is already the best method\u201dLeng Tian Xing asked again: \u201cThen if I succeed?\u201dGu Qing Shan carefully answered: \u201cImmediately give the eye to me, when I\u2019m finished with it, the formation will also barely run out of energy\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dLeng Tian Xing breathed in deeply and concentrated on the Rotting Eater Demon.He doesn\u2019t worry a single bit about whether Gu Qing Shan wanted to harm him or not, after all he\u2019s a whole realm stronger, before he dies he can just strike as hard as possible, as well as numerous other ways to take him to the grave together.He looked a bit at Gu Qing Shan.This guy isn\u2019t an idiot, he probably won\u2019t do anything harmful in this dire situation.Right at that moment, Gu Qing Shan silently shouted: \u201cDo it!\u201dLeng Tian Xing moved his spirit energy, his hand gripped the fan and swung it diagonally in the air.\u201cFrost Blade True Slash!\u201dOutside the formation, the Rotting Eater Demon raised an ear-piercing shriek.A white string appeared right at its forehead, then black blood spilled out.The frost string that suddenly appeared took off almost half its skull.It was very heavily wounded and lost an eye.Even to a blob demon, this type of wound is quite severe.The Rotting Eater Demon was screaming, rolling on the ground.The two people inside the formation already didn\u2019t take any notice of it anymore, instead using their inner sight to look inside the chunk of rotting flesh flying across the sky.A big, dull-colored eyeball was flying through the air towards a large crowd of other demons.Leng Tian Xing quickly put away his fan, extending his left hand outward and shouted: \u201cCome!\u201dThe dull-colored eyeball suddenly made a turn in the air, flew straight into the formation and into Leng Tian Xing\u2019s hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How is it so strong!\u201dLeng Tian Xing have met quite a few Sword Cultivators who can also use Wind Slash Style.But he swears he has never seen anyone use this Sword Style so fluently like this.\u201cCatch up!\u201dGu Qing Shan used three slashes in a row, cutting off a Giant Elephant Demon and reminded him.Leng Tian Xing regained his senses, quickly jumped after him.A straight pathA few breaths later, when Mountain Levelling Rush\u2019s power was dying down, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body shifted a bit, quickly regaining his balance.A second later, sword slashes could be seen all over the air.His actions are fluid and natural, seamless like the flowing water, each time he strikes there\u2019s already numerous patterns prepared to deal with any coming danger, so he wasn\u2019t afraid of any kind of attacks or sneak attacks.Observing it clearly, you can almost feel a sense of rhythm.Gu Qing Shan was a bit sorrowful, but glad at the same time.The experience from all those times, struggling to get out of a sea of blood and corpses, taking the general\u2019s head amongst his own troops, they only started to reawaken after all this time.It\u2019s only right now that he can truly be considered to have returned.The Space-time Vortex is a much scarier and stranger place than the Space Vortex that he used to get here, it\u2019s hard to guess what the System is afraid of so much that it would seal all his memories of Sword Styles.The only difference between himself now and in the past is his cultivation, and that there\u2019s still quite a few Sword Skills that he hasn\u2019t awoken yet.There\u2019s a few very power Sword Skills, that he couldn\u2019t even think about with his current cultivation, otherwise the overwhelming Sword Will contained within will rip apart Gu Qing Shan\u2019s soul. (1)This is also the War God UI\u2019s way of protecting him.As Gu Qing Shan was moving left and right along the sea of demons, all the demons were covering their noses and scattered about.A demon\u2019s sense of smell is at least a dozen times more sensitive compared to humans, and this is something they have from birth.In their perspective, the thing they\u2019re facing is a young Rotting Eater Demon.These pieces of literal shit, if you kill them the stench will stay on yourself for years without washing away.If you eat them, you\u2019ll have a stomach ache for months on end.Having to choose either of them, all the demons decide not to choose at all and just make way.Taking that chance, Gu Qing Shan was like a wraith, suddenly appeared in the middle of the sea of demons, the sword in his hand swung without making a sound.Qian Qi sword in his hand is like an awaken fiend, cruel, blood thirsty, crafty, and most of all, hungry for demon\u2019s lives.Facing the danger of death, a few Foundation Establishment realm demons has already reacted, wanting to retaliate.As Gu Qing Shan saw that, his eyes glowed.\u201cWind Slicing Consecutive Slashes!\u201dThe sword is like a wind, fierce yet quick.Wind Slash Style\u2019s forte is its killing speed!Gu Qing Shan movements are neat, without a shred of excess, every slash he makes accurately slices off the demons\u2019 neck, arms, hip, legs.One breath later, around where he stood, there no longer is any demon capable of moving.After walking a few dozen more meters, when Gu Qing Shan\u2019s slashing speed had slowed down, the painful shrieking of demons could be heard altogether.The demons who are very far away are complacent, not caring a single bit about their kin\u2019s screaming.Demons very frequently have fights to the death, so this was a daily occurrence.There\u2019s not even a hint of human\u2019s blood in there, just the foulest stench in the world, clearly a Rotting Eater Demon.--------------who the hell is willing to offend that sickening piece of shit without any gain?Even demons have a sense of self-preservation, quickly turned around and escape the smell.It feels long, but in fact Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing had only started to break the encirclement for only a dozen breaths.The two of them freely moved forward more than a few hundred meters, just like a miracle, so easily that Leng Tian Xing felt like he was dreaming.When they were about to reach their destination, a strange demon suddenly appeared.This demon had a coat of burning flame, emitting immense miasma, even the ground was scorched red where he stood.\u201cCrimson Flame Demon!\u201d Leng Tian Xing shouted in dismay.But Leng Tian Xing have no way to get away from the horde of chasing demons to deal with the Crimson Flame Demon.Because he doesn\u2019t have the foul smell on himself, he was very quickly discovered and got his hands full with the demons from behind.Luckily Gu Qing Shan\u2019s advancement speed was quick enough so the demons had no way to surround them just yet, making it possible for him to not be swarmed by the demons.\u201cI see it, let me\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.\u201cYou-------\u201c Leng Tian Xing didn\u2019t know what to say.Crimson Flame Demons are Fire-element demons, its whole body is created from a black flame, almost intangible, and incredibly hard to be killed by physical means.Crimson Flame Demons also have a lot of spells that it can use, and once it does, it\u2019s very hard to deal with.A single Crimson Flame Demon can fight 2 Foundation Establishment realm cultivators at the same time without losing.Even himself doesn\u2019t have full confidence to deal with this monster, let alone a qi training realm like Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan threw his sword up and quickly moved forward.Qian Qi sword spun a few times in the air, then suddenly disappeared ---------it was hidden into a subspace with Wind Slash Style.The Crimson Flame Demon saw that the two of them were running towards it, laughed cruelly and opened its mouth about to use a Fire spell.\u201cToo far away, I can\u2019t reach it!\u201dLeng Tian Xing needed only a single look to know it\u2019s already a life and death situation.Crimson Flame Demon\u2019s Fire-element spells all reach the rank of \u201cMagma\u201d, the two of them have no way to block it, only dodge.But if they dodge, their offense will also be temporarily stopped, and it\u2019ll be much harder to keep pushing forward like before.And that\u2019ll be their death.Leng Tian Xing\u2019s heart sank.He\u2019s already busy dealing with the demons behind himself and can\u2019t do anything to stop the Crimson Flame Demon.Could it be, this is where I fall?Then suddenly a bow appeared out of nowhere in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand, before he could even see Gu Qing Shan\u2019s action, a streak of light had already flew from the bow.\u201cBombardment!\u201d\u201cSharpshooter!\u201d\u201cRiding Wind!\u201dUnder the effect of Bombardment and Riding Wind, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s arrow contain both power and speed.A cold gleam of metal.Khih!The arrow hit the Crimson Flame Demon directly on its forehead, its whole head bent upward.As a great demon, the Crimson Flame Demon is very powerful, and couldn\u2019t possibly be killed by Gu Qing Shan\u2019s qi training realm weak spirit energy.But Gu Qing Shan\u2019s purpose has been achieved.Because of the arrow, the Crimson Flame Demon had bent its head upwards against its will, as the horrifying flame it had prepared was shot straight up at the sky.\u201cYou can use it like that?\u201d Leng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t believe his eyes and muttered.He spent so long just to accept that he\u2019s a Sword and Martial Cultivator, then suddenly he pulled out a bow, using one arrow to solve their dire situation.Being a direct disciple of a large sect, Leng Tian Xing is very knowledgeable, as soon as Gu Qing Shan moved he could already tell the three Skills used were \u201cRiding Wind\u201d, \u201cSharpshooter\u201d, \u201cBombardment\u201d.But they\u2019re all General-class archery Skills!Leng Tian Xing felt like he was going crazy.Just who is this? A natural-born Saint?Otherwise, how could a single person use formation, Martial arts, Archery and Sword arts all to this degree?Leng Tian Xing already couldn\u2019t keep his calm anymore.In reality, right now Gu Qing Shan was basically a Great Sword Saint who\u2019s suppressing his own cultivation to qi training realm and fight demons.With his wealth of experience, he doesn\u2019t even have to think to find the best way to deal with an enemy.Gu Qing Shan still didn\u2019t say a word, taking the chance when the Crimson Flame Demon was still stunned, he stepped forward and hit it with his shoulder pad.Mountain Levelling Rush!The Crimson Flame Demon was quickly sent flying, falling into the sea of demons a few dozen meters away.These demons were first shocked, then angered as they started to attack the Crimson Flame Demon.While the Crimson Flame Demon was still disoriented, it felt angry and wanted to retaliate, but it was stuck dealing with other demons, so it couldn\u2019t get away.\u201cWe\u2019re fine, let\u2019s go!\u201dGu Qing Shan spoke with a low voice.Leng Tian Xing could only feel his common sense numbed.Gu Qing Shan silently checked his spirit energy, seeing that after advancing to qi training stage 7, his spirit energy had increased greatly. Before, one use of Bombardment took 90% of his spirit energy, now it only takes 50%.He still has strength to spare!Gu Qing Shan put away the bow and grabbed the air.Qian Qi sword appeared from thin air, fitting perfectly in his hand.He stopped his feet, using the few breaths he bought for himself to fix his breathing.The demons from around hesitated for a bit as they saw him grab his Longsword.They were all screaming, wanting someone else to come up first.A very rare sight.In the short moment of a few breaths, the demons were actively retreating, not a single one moved up to attack.Gu Qing Shan held his sword in his hand, as his eyes passed through the sea of demons, he muttered.Leng Tian Xing could hear what he said, but was thinking if he actually heard wrong.Because what he heard Gu Qing Shan say was: \u201cIt\u2019s just a few minions after all\u201dNote:(1) Sword Will: The will or meaning behind a sword strike, Chinese novels usually attribute this as a thing that only the best swordsman can have, as their attacks carry a will of its own, fueled by the emotion or expertise of the user. If you\u2019ve ever seen an anime or movie scene where the fighting spirit of the fighters materialize as animals or objects, that\u2019s essentially what a sword will is.Occasionally it is also called sword spirit, but since sword spirit could also mean the spirit of the sword (like Fi from Zelda Skyward Sword), I decided to translate this as Sword Will instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

by: La0o9Gu Qing Shan bent forward and kept running, sword in hand.Behind him, Leng Tian Xing was also casting spells one after another, freezing all the demons chasing behind him in place.While all the demons that are rushing from the front were cut into pieces by Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sword.Both of them moved forward in the sea of demons and advanced another few dozens meters.Suddenly Leng Tian Xing called out with a hoarse voice: \u201cI can only keep going for another 10 breaths at most\u201dGu Qing Shan quickly turned around so see that many demons have already regained their senses and are rushing towards them.All of them are at least Foundation Establishment realm, a few are even Golden Core realm, a single one of Leng Tian Xing\u2019s spells couldn\u2019t kill them, plus he couldn\u2019t hit all of them, so his spell casting speed will be insufficient very soon.This can\u2019t go one, otherwise Leng Tian Xing will die!And if he dies, I alone can\u2019t even hope to reach the safe place.\u201cDo you have any talismans?\u201d Gu Qing Shan contemplated, then asked.\u201cI do, but I\u2019ve already used a lot, there aren\u2019t that many left\u201d Leng Tian Xing answered.\u201cLet\u2019s change places, conserver your spirit energy, use talismans instead -------you only need to open up a path to advance, no need to care whether or not the demons die\u201d Gu Qing Shan said\u201cYou\u2019ll take the back?\u201d Leng Tian Xing asked.\u201cHm, I will\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered\u201c\u2026Fine\u201dLeng Tian Xing stared at him carefully.During a dire situation, if they can\u2019t manage then the one at the back will definitely die first.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s action this time really painted him in a new light again.It was at this moment that he truly considers Gu Qing Shan a comrade.\u201cGet ready\u201dGu Qing Shan said as he started unlocking his armor.All the belts on the standard Vanguard legion armor was unlocked, as Gu Qing Shan swung his hand and threw it towards the demons at the back.These flesh-hungry demons, even when they saw their own kind killed one after another by Leng Tian Xing\u2019s spells they didn\u2019t even retreat, only advanced more and more.Yet, as soon as the armor covered in foul rotting flesh flew towards them, all the demons pinched their noses and ran away.It really is too foul, even Leng Tian Xing himself had to use this spirit energy to block his breath and all the pores on his body to keep himself from fainting from the smell.\u201cSwitch\u201dGu Qing Shan shouted as the two of them switched places.Leng Tian Xing took out a bunch of talisman, throwing them out one by one, knocking the demons that still haven\u2019t gathered in front flying.This isn\u2019t the same as spell casting, he only needed to use the least amount of spirit energy to trigger it, so the attack rate is very high, the only weakness is that this is basically the same as burning money.But Leng Tian Xing is a wealthy young master who never lacks money, since every else already died and only the 2 of them are still alive, he doesn\u2019t care to hold back anymore and decide to use all the talismans he has.As the demons from both sides retreated from the smell, when the two of them switched places they even advanced a few dozens more meters.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this stench actually works\u201d Leng Tian Xing thought a bit and said.If back then, he had compromised and smeared the Rotting Eater Demon flesh all over his body\u2026.\u201cAre you regretting now?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cNo, definitely not\u201d Leng Tian Xing\u2019s face paled.The two of them were still moving quickly.The further they ran, the smell from the armor almost became unnoticeable.Very quickly, the frenzied demons started to catch up with them again.\u201cKai Shan!\u201dGu Qing Shan shouted loudly as he held the sword with both hands, the aura on his body suddenly became heavy.One strike.Boom -------pow!Any demons that got hit by the sword got cut in two and knocked rolling back from the excessive force.All the demons on the way were also got knocked down by the rolling pieces of demon corpses.Kai Shan Style is a heavy sword style, each strike contains the power of a thousand tons, so any foe that\u2019s caught off guard will not get out unscathed.But Kai Shan Style is also famously very slow in their movements, making it easy to dodge.Normal Sword Cultivators will not use this kind of style that\u2019s full of openings.Only the most stupid swordsmen, and the most skillful swordsmen dare to use this Sword Style.Right now the sword was practically screaming, as each strike carried with it a white misty air, knocking the demons away one after another.Each strike clears out a bunch of them, so each strike relieves the pressure on them by a lot.The two of them were like pieces of driftwood in the middle of a sea storm, having to try their best to go on, barely making it through each time.Gu Qing Shan had already ignored any sort of moves and just used Kai Shan Style to swing around wildly.Under the current situation where demons are rushing them like waves in the sea, they have no need to consider whether they\u2019ll hit or miss, as each attack will surely hit a bunch of demons.Kai Shan Style\u2019s strength was being used by Gu Qing Shan to its utmost limit.\u201cQuickly advance\u201d Leng Tian Xing shouted.\u201cComing!\u201d Gu Qing Shan swung one time, then quickly shifted his body and retreated.At this moment, the two of them were blocking the advancing sea of demons and making sure their movement were on the correct path at the same time.But since there were so many demons attacking them, as the person in the back, Gu Qing Shan surely couldn\u2019t prevent every attack.Very quickly, just like Wu Jin and Ma Liu, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body was covered in blood.Gu Qing Shan just endured and held on, continued swinging his sword.\u201cKai Shan!\u201dHe shouted silently.Each strike as heavy as a mountain, crushing the demons.This is a life and death situation; he definitely can\u2019t be weak.Since there were so many demons attacking, Gu Qing Shan had already ignored most of them, only blocking the most fatal ones.Time passes quickly, in the blink of an eye, they have already made a lot of progress again.Their destination is already in sight.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s body was wounded all over, many places even had flesh ripped away by the demons, showing bloody bones.Wounds of this type were numerous, almost like he was suffering from some sort of flesh-rending punishment. (1)But Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face was as calm and composed as ever, his sword swings continued nonstop, seemingly unfazed.Leng Tian Xing\u2019s inner sight took a glance and was shocked to no end.5 breaths later, Gu Qing Shan suddenly asked: \u201cHow far?\u201d\u201cOnly 30 meters more, I can see the cave entrance!\u201d Leng Tian Xing was also panicking.\u201cGood\u201dThis was the time that Gu Qing Shan was waiting for.He shifted his body to one side, held the sword in both hands and pointed the tip as the sea of demon in front, and muttered.\u201cSecret Art\u201dIn just a second, the spirit energy in his Dantian rushed upwards and out, flowing through his hands into the Longsword.The Longsword let out a \u2018wu wu\u2019 sound.Gu Qing Shan had calculated every single bit of spirit energy exactly, saving just enough spirit energy for this moment.His spirit energy was just barely enough to use this Secret art.Leng Tian Xing pupils contracted.With his knowledge, of course he can tell how strong this Sword technique is.What technique is this, why haven't I seen it before?Leng Tian Xing searched his memory and found that this technique was different from every single sword style he knows.Could it be a Secret Art?Called a Sword Cultivator\u2019s spells, it\u2019s not something that just any random person will have.Leng Tian Xing was incredibly shaken, but held back his urge to turn around and only used his inner sight to observe.In just a second, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s fighting spirit has reached its peak.While the Qian Qi sword was letting out a \u2018wu wu\u2019 sound before, it suddenly went silent.Intense killing intent flowed along the blade, enough to make you shiver.\u201cIt is, it\u2019s a Secret Art, he knows a Secret Art!\u201dLeng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but screamed inside.The last bit of pride he had left in him was now gone.In front of Gu Qing Shan, the flow of demons was stopped like the flow of water, demons that were behind couldn\u2019t wait and climbed up, stepping on demons in front to move forward.The demons stacked up higher and higher, became a towering several-foot-tall wall of demons, crashing down on both of them.\u201cWater Flow Severance!\u201dGu Qing Shan shouted, his sword pointed directly forward.If you can slow down time at this very moment, you\u2019d see on the blade of Qian Qi sword was layers on layers of phantom swords, concentrated in one spot.In a split second, the tsunami of phantom swords overflowed.And the blade of the sword that released all that power, was slowly cracking.Numerous cracks grew more and more, then fully covered the sword.The very moment before the sword broke apart.Heaven and earth were silent.Suddenly.A thunderous rhythmic sound like the giants of ancient time themselves were beating the drum can be heard.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!Blinding phantom swords bursts from the tip of Qian Qi sword, rushed forward to create a deafening noise.The huge wall made up of demons were blown up, fell crashing down, scattered into dust and disappeared.The whole sea of demon was no more, revealing the desolate, desert-like landscape. On it were numerous cut-off hands and feet, the smell of blood in the air were so thick it could make you sick.The demons that were rushing here from afar held faces of fear and uncertainty, stopped right at the edge of where the phantom swords exploded, didn\u2019t dare to take even a single step forward.One sword strike could split a river in half and stop its flow.Having such power, it\u2019s only suitable to call it the Water Flow Severance!Clink.A small sound was heard, as Qian Qi sword couldn\u2019t handle the power of a Secret Art, it broke into pieces and scattered.The only thing left was the handle still in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand.Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth and felt a deep sense of loss.He took so long to find a sword, only to break it with a single use of a Secret Art.Reluctantly, he threw away the handle, then rushed forward.Mountain Levelling Rush!Gu Qing Shan moved forward, blocked a hungry demon for Leng Tian Xing and broke its neck.\u201cWe\u2019re going!\u201d he shouted\u201cOn it!\u201dLeng Tian Xing also knows that they are already at the last leg, suppressed the surprise in his heart and triggered all the talisman in his hands, throwing them out like they\u2019re not worth any money.Note:(1) Flesh-rending punishment: an old type of interrogation method/capital punishment in China, where the flesh of the prisoner is flayed off bit by bit to ensure the sufferer received the most intense pain, either until they\u2019re dead or confess to a crime.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re saved!\u201d\u201cSpecially made secret rune?\u201dGu Qing Shan repeated that.\u201cWait a minute\u201d he slowly looked up at Leng Tian Xing, \u201cWhat did you say this was?\u201d\u201cA component of General Sun Zhi\u2019s formation\u201d, Leng Tian Xing was still basking in joy, \u201cwith this, we can fill the missing part of the super-distance teleportation formation, we can return to our world from here\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t an identification device? It\u2019s not an identification device we can use to call for reinforcement?\u201dGu Qing Shan grabbed Leng Tian Xing\u2019s cuffs and shouted loudly.\u201cIdentification device? Of course it\u2019s not an identification device\u201dLeng Tian Xing looked at Gu Qing Shan strangely.Gu Qing Shan released his hands, staggered backwards step by step and fell down.His face paled, his heart sank to the very bottom.So Gong Sun Zhi had already decided to sacrifice himself.Gong Sun Zhi only gave this to him to let him escape.Gu Qing Shan struck the cave wall with his fist, knocking rubble everywhere.What good does it do for me to return alone!Damn it!Why didn\u2019t I think of that before!Right now he is nothing but a lowly Vanguard legion soldier; so he can\u2019t possibly bring any intelligence back to the top brass.In this world, without strength, without status, your words carry even less weight than the wind.Not to mention, the top brass of humanity already has traitors. As soon as he showed himself, the traitors can just frame him with a random crime and kill him without asking.Look for a Saint?No, that\u2019s even more impossible.Even Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi had to use 300 years\u2019 worth of supplies from their own sects to exchange a single communication talisman to contact them.Gu Qing Shan and Gong Sun Zhi are worlds apart in status.Nevermind meeting a Saint directly, he can\u2019t even get a communication talisman to contact them.Just how, just what could he do?There\u2019s less than half a day left until Gong Sun Zhi dies!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Leng Tian Xing saw that his expression was strange and asked.\u201cYou be quiet first please\u201dGu Qing Shan slapped his face, forcing himself to be calm.What can he do now to save Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi?Every second counts.Contacting their respective sects, definitely impossible.The traitor would definitely have prepared people to monitor the sects.\u201cWhat did General Sun Zhi tell you?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked him.Seeing him asking that with a serious tone, Leng Tian Xing also seriously answered: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t return, we have to immediately return to our world, change our names and hide our status, wait until he can reveal the traitor\u201dGu Qing Shan deeply sighed.How pitiful!So Leng Tian Xing still held hope that General Sun Zhi can come back to reveal who the traitor was.With the current situation, even if they could get away from the traitor\u2019s monitoring, if he were to randomly seek out the sects, they would definitely be suspicious.A round of confirmation back and forth would take too long; he won\u2019t make it in time.Not to mention, even if they believe, there\u2019s no telling whether or not the two sects have the power to save the two of them.The demon\u2019s forces have always been overwhelming compared to humans, and this time it was their elites that were dispatched.He\u2019s sure that the 5 demon generals will also appear very soon.Faceless Giant, the 5 demon generals.And the Grounded Devil legion will also have returned to the frontline.Grounded Devils by nature counter the use of formation, when that happens, Ning Yue Xi and Gong Sun Zhi will be in even more danger.This situation really does make people despair.What methods are there left?Gu Qing Shan gritted his teeth tightly, quickly reviewing all the methods he can think of.After a while, he closed his eyes and sighed deeply.The 3 Saints.The only way for them to make it in time, to save them in time is if they have the 3 Saints\u2019 help.After all that thinking, he\u2019s returned to square one.The 3 Saints are the highest fighting strength of humanity. Normally, even a sect master couldn\u2019t guarantee to contact them, let alone Gu Qing Shan who is a nameless soldier at the frontline.Gu Qing Shan shook his head, almost in complete despair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)These three Saints that are known across the land, throughout their lives they left numerous legends and tales, out of all of them, what can he use?Xuanyuan Tianzun likes to travel the land and sky, he practically can\u2019t be found by normal means, so even if Gu Qing Shan have all the time to prepare he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach him.Xuanyuan Tianzun is a no-go.Great Monk of Resentment lives at North Mountain\u2019s Lingye monastery, he\u2019s in constant meditation in pursuit of Dao and normally does not receive guests.Only in early springtime every year that Great Monk of Resentment open the altar to teach the ways of Buddha to the world.It\u2019s not impossible to meet the Great Monk at other times in the year, but Gu Qing Shan definitely does not have the capabilities to do so.There was one year that the Great Monk of Resentment went to Thousand Swords Sect to personally hold a lecture, the sect master of Thousand Swords Sect had used over a hundred million spirit stones to build an altar, in which he used Immortal Jade to craft a statue of Buddha as payment for the lecture.The Great Monk of Resentment is also a no-go.Then his only choice left is Bai Hua Fairy.Gu Qing Shan sighed.If he has enough time, he\u2019d rather travel the world to seek out Xuanyuan Tianzun, or build up enough reputation and spirit stone to seek a meeting with the Great Monk of Resentment just once, than to ask Bai Hua Fairy for help.Bai Hua Fairy is terrifyingly strong, at the same time she\u2019s incredibly difficult to please.At the time when she died, she alone killed over 30 Sainted demons, and the whole demon army was practically pushed back thousands of miles.Everyone said that she must\u2019ve already reached the grand peak of Sainted realm, only missing that single final step to advance to the next realm, reaching a never-heard realm.In front of Bai Hua Fairy, any mistake you make is fatal.Every Saint have over ten thousand methods to torture, to make someone know their place.But Xuanyuan Tianzun doesn\u2019t have interest in such things, and the Great Monk of Resentment wants to correct your ways more than he does torture you.There\u2019s only Bai Hua Fairy, whose personality is so hard to grasp that anything can happen.She once used her Divine Skill to do a certain thing that shocked everyone of both worlds.And it was only until she had died that everyone found out what she did.Everybody --------including all the players, could only look at the matter speechlessly.He already knew what had happened, so he does have a chance.After that, to meet Bai Hua Fairy, you must first gain her interest.Gu Qing Shan was silent for a bit.Seems like the only choice is to attempt the Bai Hua list!Bai Hua Fairy had created her own country, and her own sect called Bai Hua Sect.She\u2019s unlike Xuanyuan Tianzu who likes to travel, also unlike the Great Monk of Resentment, who sits in meditation all year long.She\u2019s always at Bai Hua Palace in Bai Hua Immortal Country, tending her flowers and herbs, occasionally when she wants to, she\u2019ll put out a Bai Hua list.To meet Bai Hua Fairy, you have to attempt a Bai Hua list, and successfully solve the puzzle on it.Bai Hua lists are all sorts of random, including every subject imaginable. Each and every Bai Hua list was created by Bai Hua Fairy herself, which includes all the things she takes an interest in.Anyone that solve a Bai Hua list is provided a single chance to meet Bai Hua Fairy, and request one thing of Bai Hua Fairy.That\u2019s not all, if you can meet her standard, you even have a chance to join Bai Hua Sect.However, it\u2019s only a chance.While it\u2019s called a sect, there are so few people in Bai Hua Sect that you can count them on one hand.The only reason why they\u2019re recognized as a sect at all is solely because of Bai Hua Fairy.Bai Hua Fairy is famously known for treasuring her disciples.In the last few dozen years, the amount of people that want to join Bai Hua Sect are as numerous as the clouds in the sky, but no one has succeeded even once.Occasionally, some people are lucky enough to solve the puzzle on a Bai Hua list, but after their request is fulfilled, they\u2019re rejected from entering for no apparent reason.No one understands why.To Gu Qing Shan, this isn\u2019t much of a problem, as he only wants to request Bai Hua Fairy to save Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi.Yes, attempting a Bai Hua list is really the only chance for him to meet the Saint!He has to move now!Gu Qing Shan quickly made his decision and said: \u201cLeng Tian Xing, I need you to help me with one thing\u201d\u201cGo ahead and ask, my life was saved by you anyways\u201d Leng Tian Xing answered.After escaping death together, Leng Tian Xing\u2019s air of detachment and coldness had reduced quite a bit, there was even a hint of respect in his eyes.A qi training realm cultivator, surviving a sea of demon, just how skilled must you be!Just before, even though Gu Qing Shan could keep going in front, he chose to switch places with him, taking the heavy duty of protecting the back.If he doesn\u2019t even know to befriend such a character, then the position of Yao Guang Sect\u2019s direct disciple is wasted on Leng Tian Xing.Gu Qing Shan said: \u201cI want to attempt a Bai Hua list\u201dLeng Tian Xing immediately answered: \u201cGood, I\u2019ll help you\u201dGu Qing Shan asked him back: \u201cYou won\u2019t ask why?\u201d\u201cThe General already told us to hide and preserve our lives, that being the case, I can take this chance to also attempt a Bai Hua list, because that\u2019s the only way I can be saved\u201d Leng Tian Xing answered.\u201cWhy?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.Leng Tian Xing thought for a bit, then stood up and started to undress.Gu Qing Shan was stunned, asked again with a low voice: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dYao Guang Sect is known to be both open and extravagant, could it be he has some sort of STD because of that?Gu Qing Shan clenched his fist tightly.Leng Tian Xing said: \u201cNot only do you understand formations, you\u2019re also well-versed with so many other things, so I want you to help me look at something\u201dSaying that, he had already stripped down to nothing, revealing his chest.Leng Tian Xing pointed at his chest and said: \u201cIf you can help me with this problem, you will have my eternal gratitude\u201dOn his chest was a colorful spider creature.This spider has eight legs, all of which were deeply embedded in Leng Tian Xing\u2019s heart, only sticking the head outside.When the spider was revealed, as it saw the two people looking at it, it growled a bit anxiously.It moved slightly, the legs gripped a bit tighter.Leng Tian Xing appear to be in pain, quickly dressed himself again to cover the spider from sight.It wasn\u2019t until later that he was back to normal.He looked at Gu Qing Shan and asked: \u201cSo? Do you know what this is?\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s face showed many emotions, first there was nostalgia, then anger, hatred, and finally, pity.Note:(1) Xuanyuan Tianzun: lit. greatest seeker of the origin. Tianzun is a title that carries a notion of great respect, as only a person who stands at the top can bear the title.Bai Hua Fairy: lit. Hundred flowers fairy. \u201cFairy\u201d isn\u2019t used to describe the little creatures in the woods, but rather a title for a female cultivator, its literal meaning would be \u201ca girl so beautiful she must be from heaven\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of person could call such a person his good brother?Even other Golden Core cultivators wouldn\u2019t dare do that.Because reaching Golden Core realm at 20 years old is true monstrous talents.Gu Qing Shan wryly smiled: \u201cLet\u2019s just go attempt the Bai Hua list\u201dRight now his cultivation is not enough to dispel such a scary curse.Leng Tian Xing eyes visibly darken.\u201cYour problem is very complicated, so we have no time to waste, let\u2019s quickly return to the cultivation world\u201d\u201cNot to mention, I also have a reason to quickly return\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.Leng Tian Xing looked at all the countless wounds still on their bodies, then also wryly smiles: \u201cYou\u2019re in that much of a rush?\u201dGu Qing Shan put the iron ball on the super-distance teleportation formation and answered: \u201cVery\u201dLooking at the War God UI, he could see the Quest was still displayed as \u201cin progress\u201dMeaning that Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi can still persevere.Gu Qing Shan looked again at his Soul Points.\u201cCurrent Soul Points: 651/7\u201dSo much Soul Points, most of which came from monsters killed by his last strike \u201cWater Flow Severance\u201d.But right now, to change history, to chance Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi\u2019s destiny, no amount of Soul Points can help Gu Qing Shan, and the only people that can are the 3 Saints.Gu Qing Shan sighed and activated the super-distance teleportation formation.Streaks of light appeared on the formation, gradually covered the two of them.As the light flashed, both of them disappeared from the cave.Border Fortress.A teleportation formation at the fortress\u2019s main square lit up.Two people appeared on the formation.Then a voice was heard from inside: \u201cWe directly continue going?\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s go directly\u201dThe formation lights up again.And the two people disappeared.A middle-aged cultivator guarding the teleportation asked his fellow guards: \u201cWho was that?\u201dThe two others shook their head.\u201cToo quick so I didn\u2019t see\u201d\u201cProbably not the target, otherwise they\u2019d stay here at the border fortress\u201d one of them spoke in a low voice.The middle-aged cultivator said: \u201cGo to the guard room to check where they were transported\u201dOne of them quickly left and came back.\u201cThey\u2019re going to Bai Hua Immortal Country\u201d he answered.The cultivator\u2019s face relaxed and confirmed: \u201cNot the target\u201d\u201cRight, only people who have nothing to do would go there to test their luck\u201d one of his subordinates agreed.The middle-aged cultivator spoke again: \u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down, the big man ordered us to not miss a single person who teleports here\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThe others quickly replied.Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing didn\u2019t know, because they were in a rush that they had escaped a life and death situation.Bai Hua Immortal country.Outside the capital.A teleportation formation in a secluded place.Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing appeared.\u201cHow many spirit stones did you use?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked\u201cDon\u2019t worry, money is no object\u201d Leng Tian Xing answered.Long-distance transportation always uses a lot of spirit stones, and it was all paid by Leng Tian Xing, the direct disciple of a large sect.\u201cOk, let\u2019s go attempt a list then\u201d Gu Qing Shan jumped down from the formation first.Leng Tian Xing sighed and asked: \u201cAre we really going to go just like this?\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at him, then at himself.Both of them had wounds all over, their clothes were ripped and tattered, pretty much already falling apart.Leng Tian Xing offered: \u201cHow about we change clothes and rest up for a day first?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cWe won\u2019t make it in time, hurry\u201dLeng Tian Xing was curious: \u201cWhat exactly is the rush?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go first, I\u2019ll tell you after we\u2019re done\u201dThe two of them quickly left the transportation formation and headed for the city outskirts.Bai Hua Immortal Sect is very different from other places, as any and all teleportation formations are set up at very secluded areas.No one knows why this is, most only think of it as Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s personal preference.As Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing went on their way, more and more people could be seen.Every bit of arable land in this place is used for raising crops, so many normal people live here.\u201cIf anything happens, don\u2019t act first, let me deal with it\u201d Gu Qing Shan carefully advised him.\u201cFine\u201d, even though he doesn\u2019t understand why, Leng Tian Xing still agreed.After all, he already proved himself, no matter how strange it is, everything he did was for a reason.As the two of them were quickly gliding along, a pig rushed out from the side of the road, heading straight towards them.This was a complete accident, but it had caught them off guard.The pig also appeared at a really opportune moment, as they were gliding along the way, about to land on the ground, where the old force had faded and they didn\u2019t have time to gather force again.Before this, Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing had both been fighting demons, so they were already at the end of their strength, without any way to avoid it.Leng Tian Xing pulled out his fan on reflect.As a cultivator, if he were to be knocked down by a pig, that would be really shameful.But just before his hand moved, Gu Qing Shan had already knocked his hand back.Remembering what Gu Qing Shan had told him before, Leng Tian Xing put the fan away.To be Yao Guang Sect\u2019s direct disciple, he has to have at least a bit of cleverness.While still in the air, Gu Qing Shan spread open his arms to hug the running pig.---------heavy, this is a pig? More like a big elephant.Gu Qing Shan swallowed the Crimson Crane pill so his condition was a little bit better than Leng Tian Xing.\u201cHoh!\u201dHe heaved, still hugging the pig, spun around in the air before finally landing.Both him and the pig was safe.\u201cGo\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t bother to look back at the pig or stop, only continued to rush forward again.It was the first time Leng Tian Xing had seen something like that so he was a bit confused, but only quickly chased after.The two of them quickly went far.The pig just stood there confused, but a few moments later, looking at the two\u2019s back, a hint of a smile could be seen in its eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have a bit of confidence in that, but I wonder if the poem will be hard\u201d Leng Tian Xing hesitated a bit and said.\u201cCome with me\u201d Gu Qing Shan lead Leng Tian Xing and pushed through the crowd to go in front of the goose.\u201cGive me some spirit stones\u201d he asked with a low voice\u201cSpirit stones? How many?\u201d Leng Tian Xing asked.\u201c20 pieces\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.Leng Tian Xing took out 20 pieces of spirit stones and gave it to him.Gu Qing Shan put the spirit stones on the rock, then clasped his fist towards the good, saying: \u201cBrother goose, please give us some convenience\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to answer the poem? What are these materialistic things for?\u201d The good asked with disdain.Gu Qing Shan earnestly: \u201cI really have something urgent to ask of Her Eminence, please help me a bit\u201d (2)The goose stared at Gu Qing Shan, then suddenly the look in its eyes became serious.As it passed its wings over, the spirit stones disappeared.\u201cQuickly go quickly, don\u2019t just stand there in front of me\u201d the goose ordered\u201cThank you very much!\u201dGu Qing Shan blinked at Leng Tian Xing and went into the left road.Everyone there couldn\u2019t help but opened their mouths wide --------so not only did bribing on the spot doesn\u2019t get you scolded, but you can actually pass!Immediately one of them put out a bunch of spirit stones on the rock, smiling: \u201cGoose brother, please also give me some convenience\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d the goose looked up, \u201cYou for what reason?\u201dThe other person bowed down, acting really earnest and said: \u201cI have something urgent to ask of Her Imminence, please help me a bit\u201d\u201cPeh!\u201d the goose swung its wing, knocking the spirit stones away and shouted: \u201cScram!\u201dThe other person was shocked, pointed at Gu Qing Shan who still wasn\u2019t that far and asked unconvinced \u201cHow come he can pass?\u201dThe goose answered: \u201cHe has something urgent to do\u201dThe person: \u201cI also have something urgent\u201dThe goose stood from high up and looked at the person, smirking: \u201cUrgent my ass\u201dThe person scowled: \u201cYou\u2019re being unfair, I want to make a complaint!\u201dThe goose lightly said: \u201cHow was Yi Hong Lou yesterday? 8 dishes worth of spirit food today\u2019s morning wasn\u2019t enough for you? In a hurry to go back and eat more?\u201dThe person was speechless, his face reddened, then paled and left the crowd.The goose swung its wings pridefully, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t any of you dare try to pull the wool over my eyes, if you want to pass, quickly come and answer the poem\u201dThe crowd just looked at Gu Qing Shan walking away, curious what exactly he went through that the white goose let him pass.Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing were quickly on the way.Leng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cThat goose was quite easy wasn\u2019t he?\u201dGu Qing Shan replied: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t underestimate him\u201dLeng Tian Xing confused: \u201cWhy?\u201dGu Qing Shan just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.A while later, they arrived at the dock.On the dock was a single old boat, an old ferryman sat at the hem, smoking.\u201cCan we leave right away? We can pay for the whole boat\u201d Leng Tian Xing said.The ferryman staggered a bit to stand up, then looked at the two of them seriously.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go then\u201dThe two of them went on the boat as it quickly left shore.\u201cKuh, here, if you want to attempt a list, you must pass my test\u201dThe ferryman was steering the boat as he said that.\u201cPlease do tell\u201d Gu Qing Shan clasped his fist.Leng Tian Xing also did the same behind him.The ferryman answered: \u201cIn this river there\u2019s a fish, extremely big and black all over, I call him the Big Black Fish, you go catch it\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the river, it was calm on the surface, but the rushing current below can easily send you thousands of miles away.He can swim, but to catch a fish here, he\u2019ll have to think of an appropriate measure.Clank!A metal sound was heard behind him.As Gu Qing Shan looked back, he saw Leng Tian Xing already undid his armor and now taking off his boots.\u201cYou\u2019re going into the water?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cHm, our Yao Guang Sect is on the sea, I\u2019ve already dived deep into the sea to catch fish since I was small --------this river isn\u2019t much compared to it, just leave it to me\u201d Leng Tian Xing spoke with confidence.Leng Tian Xing jumped high up, diving into the water with beautiful posture, and quickly wasn\u2019t seen anymore.The water was calm for about 10 minutes.Suddenly, air bubbles were floating up from the water.Then, Leng Tian Xing floated up to the surface, holding a big, black fish.Both him and the fish were frozen in ice, you could feel the chill even from far away.But as you look carefully, you can see the fish\u2019s spirit energy wave was gradually becoming stronger than Leng Tian Xing\u2019s.The fish had a pair of vertical pupils, its mouth full of sharp teeth, squirming its frozen body to break out from the ice.Leng Tian Xing\u2019s face was pale, clearly reaching his limit.The last of his Crimson Crane Pill was given to Gu Qing Shan, so he\u2019s already running on his last leg, about to not be able to hold the big black fish anymore.Then, the big black fish turned around, opened its bloody mouth to bite Leng Tian Xing.Pew!A streak of light was seen flying, shot straight into one of the big black fish\u2019s eyes and out the other.It was Gu Qing Shan who saw the situation about to go bad, took out the Night Rain and the snake poison arrow in time to help.The big black fish flailed around for a while, finally turned its belly up and float.\u201cNot bad, the two of you\u201d, the ferryman used a smaller boat to go fish up the big black fish.\u201cNext is something I have to do, so you just wait there\u201dAs the ferryman said that, he took out a sharp dagger and quickly sliced open the big black fish on the deck.Leng Tian Xing breathed in, jumped on the boat and shook his head at Gu Qing Shan: \u201cHow disgraceful\u201dGu Qing Shan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, who knew a fish would reach Foundation Establishment realm\u201dThe two of them sat down on the rocking boat, slowly waited for the ferryman to deal with the fish.\u201cI\u2019m begging you here, can\u2019t you do it a little softer?\u201d the fish suddenly spoke.Half the flesh on its body was already cut off, revealing a bloody, fishy smelling central bone.Gu Qing Shan and Leng Tian Xing looked at each other in anxious.-------the fish clearly died earlier, half its flesh had also been flayed off, so how is it still speaking?The ferryman\u2019s hands didn\u2019t stop, only shaking his head and said: \u201cCan\u2019t, this is the rule\u201dNote:(1): Answer a poem: I'm not sure if there are anything similar to this in the West, but this was a type of improvisation test, where the tester would read the first verse of a poem (usually 1-2 sentences), the one being tested is expected to be able to match the theme, tone, rhyme and idea of the poem with something that they thought up on the spot. You could basically think of this as a rap battle, but done with 1-2 lines of poems. The main reason why people usually take this test is to show off and get chicks, though in the old days \u201cgetting chicks\u201d meant marrying them.(2) Her Eminence: originally written as Xian Zun, meaning venerable fairy, as a way to show respect, since \u201cfairy\u201d as a designation isn\u2019t meant to be used to call someone\u2019s unless you\u2019re of the same status or higher than them. Basically it\u2019s a status thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This demon fish is already an Ascended realm last stage, just a few steps away from Sainting\u201d the ferryman laughed.The two of them were even more surprised.A demon beast that\u2019s close to Sainting was being subjected to this type of cruel punishment, how is it possible?\u201cBut why does it ------\u201c Leng Tian Xing couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cBecause it couldn\u2019t control its urge to eat, it swallowed 5 whole islands in one night. Every single living being on the islands were killed, humanity\u2019s Guang clan alone lost over 100,000 members to it\u201d, the ferryman interrupted his words, coldly laughed and answered.The ferryman was still cutting off bit by bit of the fish\u2019s flesh, and continued: \u201cHer Eminence got angry and caught it, sealed its power and sentenced it to suffering the pain of its flesh being flayed 100,000 times before allowing it to pass on to the next life\u201dAs the final piece of fish meat was cut away, aside from the head, all that\u2019s left of the fish was a transparent, shining fish skeleton.The ferryman wiped his hand and said: \u201cToday was the 7,351st time, still a while away from reaching 100,000\u201dAs he said that, he threw the fish bone back into the river.The fish skeleton swam around under the water for a bit, before sinking to the bottom.Leng Tian Xing listened to it with enthusiasm, then excitedly praised: \u201cAs expected of Her Eminence Bai Hua\u201dThe ferryman smirked, then said: \u201cNo need to butter up Her Eminence too much, the two of you, which list do you want to attempt, you can tell me now\u201dLeng Tian Xing thought for a bit then answered: \u201cI want to attempt the antique treasure hunt list\u201dThe ferryman clapped his hands, then said: \u201cVery nice, it\u2019s fate indeed, you can go off the boat right here\u201d\u201cOff the boat?\u201dLeng Tian Xing looked around left and right, aside from the boat itself, he could only see the intense water current.The ferryman sat down, picked up a willow branch that was floating around and gave it to Leng Tian Xing.\u201cUnder here, is an underwater ruin left over time ancient times\u201d\u201cOver a hundred thousand years ago in the age of old, a mountain god and water god fought each other here, resulting in both their demises\u201d\u201cThis willow branch can provide you protection, go down and fish up a few ancient true relics\u201dWhen he heard the ferryman say that, Leng Tian Xing took the willow branch and infused it with spirit energyThe willow branch then relaxes, emitting a gentle light that covered Leng Tian Xing.Suddenly a maelstrom appeared on the calm water, as a giant hand appeared from inside, taking Leng Tian Xing without and slowly went back down underwater.\u201cNow you\u201d the ferryman looked at Gu Qing Shan \u201cWhat list do you want to attempt?\u201dGu Qing Shan clasped his fist and bowed, saying: \u201cI want to attempt the Sword list\u201dThe ferryman looked at Gu Qing Shan from head to toe: \u201cYou don\u2019t even have a sword\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan wryly smiled: \u201cIt was broken in battle\u201d\u201cAh? Broken? How broken was it?\u201d the ferryman asked further\u201cAside from the handle it all broke into pieces\u201d Gu Qing Shan described in details.\u201cHoh, doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just saying that\u201d the ferryman\u2019s eyes visibly glowed.He turned around, quickly controlled the boat to move forward.\u201cThe Sword list is a bit further away, I can see your whole body is covered in wounds, rest up for a bit\u201d said the ferryman.\u201cThank you\u201dGu Qing Shan sat down on the spot, silently meditated as he waits.He relaxes and starts nurturing his body, circulating the replenishing spirit energy around to slowly expel the fatigue he felt.Whether or not he could save Ning Yue Xi and Gong Sun Zhi, will have to see how well he does in this attempt.As Gu Qing Shan recalled the legends of Bai Hua Fairy, and what she had done, he was still a bit speechless.A while later, the river started to be covered in fog.Something flew at him from afar.It impaled the deck right in front of Gu Qing Shan.Gu Qing Shan opened his eyes.A sword was stabbed in front of him.In the thick mist, the ferryman\u2019s figure slowly disappeared.\u201cTake up the sword, your test starts now\u201d the ferryman\u2019s voice was heard from afar\u201cYes\u201d Gu Qing Shan took the sword and stood up straight.\u201cI\u2019ll lower my strength to be at Foundation Establishment mid stage\u201d the ferryman continued: \u201cFind my location in the mist, only then will you have the right to attempt the Sword list\u201d\u201cThe test from before didn\u2019t count?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cIt does, but the Sword list requires a bit more --------after all, the test is about sword skills, not just anyone can go attempt it\u201d\u201cFine then\u201d Gu Qing Shan sighed.\u201cBegin!\u201d the ferryman said.As soon as the said that, his whole body\u2019s aura disappeared.What excellent aura concealment!Gu Qing Shan silently praised, as he lifted his hand and looked at the sword he was holding.A very normal Longsword, its core was forged from steel and fits the hand quite well.Weapons, counting from how intricate it is, are divided into different grades: Sharp, Treasure, Spirit, Law, and Dao weapons.Of course there are higher rankings, but they are things that a normal person won\u2019t likely ever meet in their whole life.And the weapon in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hand right now is only a Sharp weapon.This type of sword is mostly only used for training, if you meet a real enemy, you\u2019ll have to always be careful not to give the opponent a chance to break it.\u201cSenior, you\u2019ve made one mistake\u201d Gu Qing Shan lightly smiled and said.No one replied.Gu Qing Shan still slowly continued: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have given me a sword\u201dThe sword in his hand moved.One swing created over a hundred sword phantoms.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sword stance was like a breeze.Soft, gentle, and unblockable.\u201cWind Slash!\u201dHe muttered.All the images scattered, hitting the wooden boat.In a single moment the boat was already broken into pieces, as the spirit energy inside each slash turned into a strong wind that carried the broken pieces away.After a single slash, the whole boat was already no more.Only where Gu Qing Shan stood was there a floating wooden plank, still keeping him afloat on the river.From a distance, the sound of something hitting the water.Foundation Establishment realm mid stage, as long as they haven\u2019t awakened Wind-element roots, still can\u2019t fly.Gu Qing Shan held the sword and pointed straight at that direction.\u201cSenior, I\u2019ve found you\u201dThe sword shifted, suddenly created another strong breeze.Consecutive metal blocking sounds can be heard.The one characteristic of Wind Slash Style is its speed, Gu Qing Shan only moved his sword for a little bit before sword phantoms had already completely filled that area, not giving the opponent any place left to dodge.A silence.Then a joyful voice could be heard from inside the thick fog.\u201cClever brat, you fit my style well\u201dTogether with that voice, intense spirit energy could be felt from where the voice was.An immense spirit pressure could be felt.Foundation Establishment peak, Golden Core, Golden Core peak -------- the spirit pressure kept increasing all the way until it reached Rejuvenation realm that it slowly stopped.The ferryman slowly flew at him, tapping Gu Qing Shan\u2019s shoulder: \u201cYou\u2019ve passed the test, come with me to Bai Hua Palace\u201dHe extended his other hand and quickly made a hand sign.\u201cHundred flowers in bloom\u201d the ferryman shouted silently.A few moments after, numerous runes appeared in the air.Gu Qing Shan took a glance and was immediately shocked.Without any formation plate to help, only needing hand signs to create a transportation formation in the air, not even Gong Sun Zhi can do that.Gu Qing Shan of course knows very well just who the person in front of him is, but he\u2019s keeping his mouth shut, not wanting to say even a word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each of them requiring dozens of days to make, as well as the full attention of 7-8 cultivators.Comparing the two, you almost feel like they\u2019re not doing the same thing.The runes lit up.Both the ferryman and Gu Qing Shan disappeared in place.Glazed ceiling, red brick walls.All the structures here are towering and beautifully set like a natural paintingBai Hua Palace, a place as beautiful as the Heavenly Palace itself.Inside the palace itself was a giant screen made of green jade, a normal person standing up straight wouldn\u2019t even reach 1/3rd of the screen\u2019s height.Gu Qing Shan and the ferryman appeared in front of that screen.A palace maid holding an extremely long scroll walked towards them, lightly bowing to the ferryman. (1)\u201cThis is the one attempting the Sword list today?\u201d the maid asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d the ferryman answered.\u201cThere\u2019s only one person today?\u201d the maid asked again.\u201cAll the others have unsavory sword will, they couldn\u2019t possibly do anything even if they came here, only to dirty this place\u2019s spirit essence\u201d the ferryman answered.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve brought the person here, you take care of him\u201d as the ferryman said that, he disappeared without a trace.The maid seems to be used to this, turning to face Gu Qing Shan: \u201cYou\u2019ve come to attempt the Sword list?\u201d\u201cI have\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered as he bowed respectfully.The maid observed him a bit, seeing that his appearance is decent, his eyes are bright, as well as an acceptable attitude, her eyes appeared satisfied.\u201cFine then\u201d the maid took out an incense burner and lit an incense stick.She handed the picture scroll in her hand to Gu Qing Shan, saying: \u201cYou go in there, if you can pass the test within one incense\u2019s time, you\u2019ll get the right to attempt the Sword list\u201dGu Qing Shan was a bit surprised, asked again: \u201cThe ferryman had already tested me twice, but there\u2019s still more?\u201dThe maid: \u201cThere is\u201d\u201cOk then\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded.Another test.He still hasn\u2019t even seen the Sword list yet he\u2019s already taking the 3rd test.If it was any other prideful Sword Cultivator, they would\u2019ve been annoyed already, possibly even complained a bit.But Gu Qing Shan have a lot of patience for the sake of seeking reinforcement.Not to mention, as a returner, he knows very well what Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s personality is like.Gu Qing Shan silently accepted the scroll, infusing spirit energy into it.Pop.The scroll fell down onto the ground, but Gu Qing Shan is nowhere to be seen.The maid picked up the scroll, putting it on a mahogany table and lightly muttered: \u201cQuite patient as well\u201dIn the scroll.Gu Qing Shan was standing across from a scholar.The scholar was polite, bowed to welcome Gu Qing Shan with perfect etiquette and said: \u201cMy family\u2019s traditional Sword Style has been passed down through the ages, normal cultivators doesn\u2019t stand a chance against it, yet I\u2019ve always felt like it\u2019s missing something, please take a look and help me find the problem\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead\u201d Gu Qing Shan returned the gesture.\u201cThen I will begin, please be assured, I will keep the spirit energy flow at qi training stage 7, making it convenient for you to block\u201d said the scholar\u201cThank you very much\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.The scholar smiled, then took out a sword.As soon as he held the Longsword in his hand, his whole aura changed.A frenzy scream can be heard from the scholar\u2019s mouth.\u201cKill kill kill kill kill! Millions of things in this world, nothing can\u2019t be killed!\u201dThe Longsword moved suddenly, merging with the scholar\u2019s figure within the rain of sword strikes.Both the scholar and his sword has become frenzied afterimages, raining attacks on Gu Qing Shan.\u201cWind Slash\u201dGu Qing Shan grabbed the air, immediately holding the Sharp-grade sword from before in his hand.The ferryman left too quickly that he didn\u2019t even take back the sword.-------or it could be he did it on purpose because he was pleased with him.\u201cKai Shan 5th strike!\u201dGu Qing Shan shouted, swung his sword up, then cleaving straight from above.Kai Shan Style is slow and heavy, but the scholar\u2019s sword strikes were as quick as illusions, enough to not be seen properly.One fast, one slow, yet the two swords were able to clash.Clang!The scholar\u2019s sword was knocked flying, hit the wall and rolled down.\u201cHow strange, why is it like this?\u201d the scholar\u2019s face didn\u2019t show even a bit of disappointment, he even became a bit excitedGu Qing Shan relaxes his sword, saying: \u201cFrom my own experience using the sword, I think that there\u2019s only ever a single strike in Sword arts\u201dThe scholar was surprised: \u201cOnly one strike? Which strike?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cThe strike that will take the enemy\u2019s life in that moment\u201d\u201cThe strike that will take the enemy\u2019s life\u2026 in that moment\u201dThe scholar slowly repeated what he said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, in the blink of an eye, your strikes are more numerous than mine, although you can cause your opponent to be confused that way, but you\u2019ve also greatly increase your number of openings\u201d Gu Qing Shan patiently explained.This is the experience that Gu Qing Shan got from countless encounters with demons, from countless times facing the danger of death, using his own blood and tears as a price.To save Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi, to survive, he must do everything he can to show his talent with the sword.Because Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s eyes are the highest in the land.As a Great Sword Saint, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s eyes and wealth of experience is of course top-notch, even though there\u2019s still a distance from a Sainted realm cultivator like Bai Hua Fairy, but he was an existence that got the closest to them.At the moment, the System\u2019s seal has become undone, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sword cultivation had returned to him, the only thing lacking is the many Sword Styles that still need Soul Points to be awakened.This was a protection method by the System.There are a few Sword Styles so powerful that even if he only attempts to think about them, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s current qi training realm soul vessel, he could be wounded beyond help.His cultivation is too low to endure this kind of wound, so he can only choose to increase bit by bit using quality over quantity.The scholar stood there for a moment, then once again swung his sword.This time, his sword was much slower.Each strike was still as quick as lightning, but at every moment, there\u2019s only ever a single strike.As the number of strikes decreased, the power of his strike increased.Concise, simple, full-power.The sword\u2019s aura gradually became solemn, fierce yet unseen.The scholar continued to be immersed in his Sword Style, muttering: \u201cWrong, wrong, so all that time I\u2019ve been chasing speed and complexity, even the direction had been wrong\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at him a bit, then once again swung his sword, clashing with the scholar 10 times.\u201cHah!\u201dThe scholar shouted loudly, but retreated his sword.He solemnly bowed and thanked him: \u201cJust a few of your words had made me understood, you can consider yourself passed my test\u201d\u201cThank you\u201d Gu Qing Shan also clasped his fist and returned the bow.Outside the scroll, the maid seemed to have felt it, as she smiled lightly: \u201cThis Sword Style is called Lightning Vacuum Strike, yet the answer was to slow it down, what an extraordinary way of thinking\u201dLooking at the incense, she could tell it hasn\u2019t even burned out 10% yet.The maid was truly interested now.She once again stared at the scroll.Inside the picture scroll, the scholar nodded and fade away.Another cultivator instead appeared in front of Gu Qing Shan.This one was a monk, his hand holding a sword, his eyes showed confusion.\u201cMy problem is a question of the sword\u2019s heart\u201d the monk stared blankly at the sword in his hand and said.\u201cPlease\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.\u201cTo use the sword as a killing weapon, even though those who are killed enter reincarnation, you still can\u2019t eliminate the mourning and obsession left behind, yet you create more karma for the future\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why kill at all? And why use the sword?\u201d\u201cThis monk asks you, how would a swordsman deal with this?\u201d the monk said.What a problem indeed!Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face became serious.This problem, if you\u2019re roped into its logic, your Dao itself will break.Even though the two of them are only standing here discussing things peacefully, the situation here is much more dangerous than killing demons on a battlefield.If his will is wavered by the question, his Dao\u2019s heart will be broken. (2)A cultivator whose Dao has been broken will definitely be slowed down, or even stopped entirely, never able to take another step.Note:(1) Maid: Google \u201cChinese palace maids\u201d for what she might be wearing, definitely not the kind of maids in pop culture.(2) Dao\u2019s heart: a literal translation, it could be understood as the motivation, will, determination and belief to keep going on the road of cultivation. It\u2019s said that everyone has a reason to cultivate themselves, and those that keep the original reason pure is able to keep going further and further, while those who believe they\u2019ve betrayed their original will won\u2019t be able to go on. A person whose Dao\u2019s heart is broken will doubt himself and what he does, thus unable to be decisive, unable to confidently pursue his path, and Dao literally means path.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please also tell me your answer\u201dGu Qing Shan accepted the bow, seriously thought and then answered: \u201cThe sword and beings of the world aren\u2019t related, it\u2019s only your will that matters\u201dThe monk was a bit confused, asking: \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cA hesitant heart makes a hesitant sword, a heart without worry makes a sword without obstacle\u201dThe monk shook his head: \u201cBenefactor please do not use sharp words to confuse me, I beg for a direct answer please\u201dSeems like it\u2019ll take some real mettle after all, Gu Qing Shan silent sighed, but became calmer.Then he said: \u201cWhat I mean is, if you want to kill people, there\u2019s no need to think too much about it\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d the monk was unable to follow.Gu Qing Shan continued: \u201cIf you want to save the beings of the world, then just use your sword to save them. If you want to kill the beings of the world, then just use your sword to kill them. If you just stand there thinking back and forth, then you\u2019ve done nothing at all except made things complicated, in fact that\u2019ll make it easier to become fallen instead\u201dThe monk was stunned.Gu Qing Shan added: \u201cThe true moment to use the sword, is always on the verge of life and death, every mistake could mean your demise; and at that point, to make sure all thoughts are clear, that nothing can affect your judgement and your will, then you must only have a single thought\u201d\u201cWhat is that single thought?\u201d The monk pursued.Gu Qing Shan seriously answered: \u201cThe thought to kill\u201d\u201cA-mi-ta-bha, benefactor will definitely gather very heavy karma later\u201d the monk clasped his hand and said. (2)\u201cYou\u2019ve already picked up a sword, to still mention sin and karma, wouldn\u2019t that be hypocrisy?\u201d Gu Qing Shan suddenly said back: \u201cYou repay those you owe, and take revenge on those who wrongs you, the world is no more than this. To think too much about karma is to bind your own sword will, then what kind of sword would you be cultivating?\u201dThe monk was speechless unable to say anything.Outside the scroll, the maid lifted her mouth into a curve.She grabbed a misty-looking communication talisman from the air.\u201cThose are great words, you damn baldy used words to block my mouth, now I\u2019ll send them back to block yours, see how you\u2019ll get out of this\u201dAs soon as the maid said that, the spirit energy on her hand infused into the talisman, turning it into a red streak flying across the sky.The maid\u2019s eyes moved a bit, muttered: \u201cThis kid seemed to have fought his way out of a forest of demons, but particularly what happened will have to wait until he successfully attempt the list\u201dShe made a hand seal, and released Gu Qing Shan from the scroll.\u201cI\u2019ve passed?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.The maid answered: \u201cHm, you passed\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s great, the monk looked like he still wasn\u2019t convinced, if I had continued and accidentally broke his Dao heart it wouldn\u2019t be too pretty\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded in thanks.As the maid heard that, her mood improved greatly and smiled: \u201cI was going to give you a few more rounds of test, but I\u2019ve decided, you can go straight to attempting the Sword list now\u201dGu Qing Shan was also glad: \u201cThank you very much!\u201dHe didn\u2019t dare to say a single word more.The maid went toward the green jade screen, putting her hand on it: \u201cInside this screen is a Hong Huang Sword formation\u201d (TN: lit. Great Flood)\u201cHong Huang Sword formation\u201d Gu Qing Shan was shocked, immediately became serious.In the past life, he didn\u2019t care too much about Bai Hua country, so many of the things he knows about Bai Hua Fairy was heard from others long after they happened.The sword formation right here that comes from the ancient age of Old.Gu Qing Shan has never heard of it before.That era was the age of Divinity, according to old, obscure scriptures, the power of Divinity isn\u2019t something that a mortal - even if they\u2019re a cultivator - can compare to, and so every single object that\u2019s left over from that era contain immense power.It was an age of great prosperity, yet it was all gone without a trace, a complete mystery without any clues to solve.Within the span of a single year, all the Divinity were never seen again.It was like history was cut off overnight.It wasn\u2019t until the game was already started for 5 years that the first Divinity was accidentally summoned by the players.The maid continued: \u201cYet Her Eminence had a problem, even though the Sword formation was already tamed by her, she still couldn\u2019t find the true sword spirit anywhere\u201d\u201cYour task is to go into the sword formation and find out where the sword spirit is\u201d\u201cHer Eminence had tamed this sword formation?\u201d Gu Qing Shan suddenly asked \u201cCan you tell me a bit about how Her Eminence tamed it?\u201dThe maid was a bit surprised, but still said: \u201cThis was Xuanyuan Tianzun\u2019s gift to Her Eminence, so she had used Lock Seals and tamed it on the spot\u201d (3)\u201cOne of the three saints, Xuanyuan Tianzun? A gift from him?\u201d Gu Qing Shan had a strange look on his face.The maid answered: \u201cThat\u2019s correct\u201d\u201cOk then, I\u2019ll try it\u201dGu Qing Shan had a thought and gained a bit more unfounded confidence.The maid lightly nodded, made a hand seal and pointed at the jade screen.Immediately the green jade screen lightly shook, emitted a blinding spirit light.In the air, numerous immortal beasts appeared, accompanied with heavenly music and colorful clouds, came and covered the whole upper area of the screen.A blurred figure appeared on the screen.Even though his face can\u2019t be seen, this figure was wearing the proper attire for cultivators of the old era.The figure pointed at the sky, suddenly a crack appeared, as the winds escaping from the Space Vortex created immense devastation.The figure pointed at the ground, as the earth split apart, the four seas boiled and millions of creatures died off.By just pointing two fingers, and both heaven and earth were broken part, completely out of any cultivator\u2019s imagination, even the Saints themselves aren\u2019t able to do this.Such a grand sight really does make any cultivator feel small.The maid looked at the shifting scene on the screen, thought a bit then advised him: \u201cAfter you go in there, be careful a bit, even if you can\u2019t find the sword spirit, you can\u2019t drop your etiquette\u201dSeeing the look of confusion on Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face, the maid patiently explained: \u201cInside the screen, there are 11 projections of Divinity, the projections include both their memories and personalities from the time they were still alive, you absolutely cannot offend them, otherwise I can\u2019t save you\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the scene on the screen and said: \u201cI understand\u201dThe maid changed her hand seals a bit, and the screen emits a 7-colored spirit light the wrapped around Gu Qing Shan.A dignified voice can be heard.\u201cYoung one, burn the incense, then you can enter the gate\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan heard that he looked at the maid.The maid lightly nodded.Gu Qing Shan went up, lit and incense stick and went into the gate.As soon as he disappeared, the relaxed look of the maid changed, becoming dignified as she watched the green jade screen.\u201c10 years and I\u2019ve yet to find any clues. Hopefully, this kid can give me a bit of inspiration\u201d the maid silently muttered.Note:(1) Benefactor: \u65bd\u4e3b (read as Shizhu), a common title that monks use to refer to everyone else that\u2019s not a monk, even if they\u2019re the enemy or a stranger, literally means donor or benefactor.(2) Amitabha: A very famous Buddha, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha for more info. Monks usually chant his name as a way to clear their thoughts, or as an exclamation when they hear someone says something blasphemous.(3) Lock Seals: slightly different from an actual Sealing technique that you\u2019d see in anime like Naruto, Lock Seals in Chinese novels refer to a system of particular techniques commonly used as a security system, they can be used anywhere and everywhere, and not all of them need to actually seal something, sometimes when triggered they only alert the user, other times they\u2019ll actively attack whoever trespasses and kill them.In many ways, they\u2019re very similar to formations, but the main difference is that Lock Seals are easier to learn, and instead of drawing energy from outside, Lock Seals usually gets their energy artificially from something like a battery left behind by the user.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So as to let this humble one witness senior\u2019s glory\u201dThe middle-aged cultivator looked down at Gu Qing Shan and answered: \u201cThis venerable one\u2019s soul is still locked inside the mural sealing the demon, I\u2019m not free enough to tell you in details\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at his sword, seeing on the part connecting the blade and hilt a few small letters inscribed\u201cFreezing Mist\u201dGu Qing Shan silently nodded, and asked again: \u201cThis humble one is also a sword cultivator, can senior tell me what Sword Style you use? That way I can also imagine senior\u2019s glory --------this surely you can tell\u201dThe middle-aged man pridefully said: \u201cGrey Flame Heaven Origin Style\u201dGu Qing Shan clasped his hand: \u201cThis humble one thank you\u201dAfter that, he went to the next statue, bowed again, and asked respectfully: \u201cCan senior tell me how you died?\u201dThis statue was a handsome man at his prime, answered: \u201cThis one fought alone against a million demons, then died of exhaustion\u201d\u201cYou can tell me in detail? So as to let this humble one witness senior\u2019s glory\u201dThe handsome man looked at Gu Qing Shan and answered: \u201cThis one\u2019s soul is sealing the great demon, I\u2019m not free enough to tell you in detail\u201dGu Qing Shan nodded: \u201cThis humble one is also a sword cultivator, can I ask senior what Sword Style you use?\u201dThe handsome man replied: \u201cPristine Holy Sword Style\u201dGu Qing Shan suddenly said: \u201cThen, senior would have to be a rare Lightning-element sword cultivator, how admirable\u201dThe handsome man looked at him and said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know\u201dAfter hearing that, Gu Qing Shan became silent.And went straight to the central altar in front of the Divinity\u2019s statue.Suddenly a bow appeared in his hand.Gu Qing Shan nonchalantly drew an arrow, pointing at the Divinity\u2019s statue.Suddenly the Divinity opened its eyes, shouting with a thunderous voice: \u201cHow dare you! A mere mortal would dare point his arrow at a Divinity, bow down and beg for forgiveness right now, otherwise this one shall send you to reincarnation himself!\u201dGu Qing Shan laughed, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a demon, today I\u2019ve come to release the monster on the mural\u201dThe 10 sword cultivator statues immediately acted, all of them raised their swords, emitting sharp sword wills.\u201cFiend, I\u2019ll take your life!\u201d\u201cDamn demon, you\u2019re going to die right here!\u201d\u201cSay your prayers!\u201dTheir voices rang like thunder, wanting to release their certain-kill techniques right at the next second.Outside the green jade screen, the maid\u2019s expression changed, muttering: \u201cWhat crazy things are this kid saying!\u201dShe quickly prepared her hand seals, completing it in the blink of an eye.Already prepared, she only needs to infuse spirit energy into the trigger, then her spell can be cast.But right at that moment, the maid\u2019s thoughts shifted a bit, delaying the trigger of her spell.She didn\u2019t even move her eyes from the jade screen, her face clearly confused.Inside the altar.Gu Qing Shan just stood there, but the sword cultivators still hadn\u2019t even moved an inch.\u201cCursed!\u201d The square-faced middle-aged cultivator shouted: \u201cAll my spirit energy had been used to seal the demon, there\u2019s only a piece of soul left out here, I can\u2019t kill this one\u201d\u201cI as well\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also the same\u201dThe whole group of sword cultivators were cursing and complaining.Gu Qing Shan looked straight at the Divinity statue in the middle, lightly pulled his bow into an arc and let go.Phew!The arrow barely missed the Divinity\u2019s ear, hit the mural straight on, breaking it in half as it came crashing down.The group of sword cultivator statues became silent.The whole altar became eerily silent.Gu Qing Shan still unfazed, once again drew an arrow, pointing straight at the Divinity statue.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my hand slipped, this time I\u2019ll definitely hit you straight on\u201d he apologized.The Divinity\u2019s statue couldn\u2019t say a word.Gu Qing Shan pulled the bow, asking: \u201cYou won\u2019t say anything? After all, in a few moments you won\u2019t get any more chances\u201dThe Divinity statue suddenly asked: \u201cYou really aren\u2019t afraid that I\u2019ll release the world-ender demon?\u201dGu Qing Shan replied: \u201cA bunch of fake cultivators who only knows to fool people, how strong can the demon you\u2019re sealing be? I don\u2019t believe it\u201dThe Divinity statue asked: \u201cYou would dare slander the sword cultivators of old, and desecrate them so?\u201d\u201cAre you sure you want to force me to talk? Once I talk, you guys definitely can\u2019t fake it anymore\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled and answered.The Divinity statue was silent.Suddenly an echoing female voice was heard in the altar: \u201cSpeak, tell me everything\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What do you mean\u201d the maid\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cHe said his sword style is the Grey Flame Heaven Origin Style, the name Grey Flame would of course refer to the demon world's strongest undying flame, which would need a Fire-element root to use, yet his sword was at Water-elemental 2nd stage: Freezing Mist, if he were to use this sword to fight, Water and Fire would clash, resulting in spirit energy misfire and serious injury wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cRight here they\u2019ve indeed created a solemn atmosphere, the things they had were also very real, but they claimed to have sacrificed for humanity? Hm? How come they couldn\u2019t even talk about the details of how they did it?\u201dThe Divinity\u2019s statue stayed silent, then finally sighed: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for this, please slowly here me out\u201dWhile he talked, his eye was already gesturing to the other statues.Suddenly, they all made the same hand sign, shouting: \u201cSub-space Shifting Magic!\u201dOn the altar\u2019s ground, numerous runes appeared.\u201cI\u2019ll let you go this time; we will meet again\u201d The Divinity statue laughed loudly as he spoke.Gu Qing Shan made a face pitying the Divinity statue, but said nothing.A second later, a grand and angry female voice was heard.\u201cXuanyuan Tianzun, you shitty old man! You dare to use a fake to trade for my Bai Hua jade wine, next time we meet I\u2019ll break your leg!\u201dAs she said that, all the runes on the ground immediately shut down.On the altar\u2019s roof, a twisted black hole was seen.The Divinity\u2019s statue together with the 10 fake sword cultivator couldn\u2019t even resist and got sucked straight in.Afterwards, as heaven and earth changed places, Gu Qing Shan found himself already outside again.As Gu Qing Shan\u2019s feet touched solid ground, the maid was still standing in place, but the huge green jade screen was not seen anymore.\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve solved the problem on the Sword list\u201d the maid said, her face unchanged.Gu Qing Shan also knows she isn\u2019t in a good mood anymore so he didn\u2019t say anything, only clasped his hand and bowed.The maid was silent for a while, as she was about to speak, a fire talisman flew from the sky, arriving where she was.The maid pointed at it.A voice was heard from the fire talisman: \u201cHah, no need to be so angry, fellow Daoist. At the time I had a bad habit of gambling, so all the good things I had were all taken away, it was because I didn\u2019t have any other choice that I had to resort to this. However, right now I have something good that can be used to make it up to you, a Tianyin ceremonial staff from Miao Yin Sect, I can guarantee it\u2019s real, if it isn\u2019t may the 5 lightning from the sky strike me down\u201d (TN: lit. Wonderful Sound Sect)The maid\u2019s face was still horribly blank as she listened, it was only when the fire talisman swore that her expression loosened a bit.A cultivator who swore to something cannot go back on his words, otherwise he\u2019d be punished by heaven itself.If the person sending the fire talisman had said so, the item must also be real.The ancient Miao Yin Sect was also a famous large sect.If the item is real, then it certainly would be something to desire.The maid uttered a \u2018hmph\u2019 as she replied to the fire talisman: \u201cMake sure there isn\u2019t a next time like this\u201dThen she let the fire talisman go.When she looked again at Gu Qing Shan, her expression was already much better.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go see Her Eminence\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThe two of them walked one behind the other through a long twisting corridor, passing through layers upon layers of palace ground, before reaching Bai Hua Palace\u2019s main building.\u201cSend a word, today\u2019s Sword list was successfully attempted, see what does Her Eminence say\u201d the maid said.\u201cYes\u201dTwo other maids replied as one of them quickly entered the main palace, then quickly went back out.\u201cHer Eminence happens to have some time; she\u2019s ordering the attempter in\u201dThe maid looked at Gu Qing Shan, waved her hand gestured him to enter and said: \u201cGo meet Her Eminence now\u201d\u201cThen I saw take my leave\u201d Gu Qing Shan clasped his fist and bowed.The maid smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019ll have to advise you, you cannot say a single lie before Her Eminence, whatever you know, you tell her, otherwise you can\u2019t handle the consequences\u201d\u201cThank you for your guidance\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.The maid lightly nodded and stepped aside to give him passage.Gu Qing Shan walked alone into the main building as he silently thought about many things.As soon as he entered Bai Hua country, he had been paying attention to that one thing.The one thing that Bai Hua Fairy had done, the thing that had shocked everyone.Why did Bai Hua Fairy feel the need to do something like that?Was she really thinking of a method to break through the Sainted realm like the rumors?Before he could think anymore, he was already standing in the middle of the main palace.The building was huge and breezy, the gentle wind carried the smell of spring flower through the clean air.Gu Qing Shan breathed in and felt his soul lightly shook.Tracing back where the smell came from, he saw a fountain in the palace\u2019s garden, where countless flowers are carved from Immortal Jade.But as he looked closer, he saw that the fountain itself was also made from Immortal Jade.Immortal Jade, also called transcended-grade spirit stones, is more valuable than the 3 traditional grades of low-mid-high for spirit stones. They\u2019re things that you couldn\u2019t buy even with money, resources so rare you can only wish to find but never asked for.A piece of Immortal Jade that\u2019s as big as a fist could be used to run a mega defensive formation for a whole year, an Ascended realm cultivator can replenish spirit energy from it 100 times over, it can literally buy a small-sized sect.Yet in this palace, they had made a fountain purely from Immortal Jade, what\u2019s more, even crafted the over ten thousand species of flowers in it also from Immortal Jade.Right in the middle of this fountain was a large blooming flower, revealing the throne inside the pistil.A throne of ten thousand flowers.Gu Qing Shan muttered.This was Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s stronghold, a place so rich that makes millions of players\u2019 heart beat faster, eyes bloodshot from greed, but never dare to touch.On the throne, sat a woman wearing an emerald feather coat and a thin silk veil on her face.\u201cYou were the one that successfully attempted the sword list?\u201d the woman asked, her voice like the chirping of a hundred birds.\u201cIt was this humble one\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.\u201cYour knowledge of the sword is decent, your observation ability is also praiseworthy, to help this Saint recognize a fake item, very commendable\u201d\u201cYes\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.This was Bai Hua Fairy; a person whose face no one knows.She was the strongest of the 3 Saints of humanity, who in their right mind would dare peek under her veil?Sainted realm was a place that no player was able to achieve in the past life.Not only because of the astronomical amount of Experience Points, but also because to break through Sainted realm, you can\u2019t only rely on the game System, but it also required your sensitivity towards the world to reach that level.He heard there were also other conditions, but Gu Qing Shan himself had never found them.During the past life, Gu Qing Shan was at the top, a peak Ascended cultivator, but he never found anyway to even breakthrough to Sainted realm.No player was ever able to do so.Because of that, he held nothing but great respect for Bai Hua Fairy.In the palace, as she saw the youth before her as silent as a statue, refusing to even say a single extraneous word, Bai Hua Fairy became a bit interested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You don\u2019t seem like one, but since you\u2019ve come here, what is your wish?\u201dBai Hua Fairy leaned on her throne of flowers and questioned him.Gu Qing Shan clasped his fist, bow and answered: \u201cThis one only hope that the Saint would save the life of two people\u201d\u201cSaving their lives? From disease or of old age?\u201dBai Hua Fairy nonchalantly asked.This type of matter is as simple as waving a hand to her, so as soon as she heard \u2018saving life\u2019, she instinctively felt bored.\u201cIt is neither, the frontline was in chaos due to a traitor, General Sun Zhi and Heaven\u2019s Limit Saintess Ning Yue Xi are currently surrounded by demons on all sides and are about to die\u201d\u201cThey found the entrance to another world, which made the demons dispatch all their forces to take their lives\u201d\u201cGeneral Sun Zhi had gave me a way to escape, but without a place to call for help, I could only come here to attempt a list\u201dBai Hua Fairy\u2019s half-closed eyes suddenly opened, her posture became straight and her face became serious.\u201cAnother world\u2026 and traitor?\u201d\u201cWhat you said is true? Know this, if your words contain any falsehood to this Saint, you cannot handle the consequences\u201d she spoke with a low voice.Gu Qing Shan replied: \u201cThere is no falsehood\u201d\u201cDo you have your badge with you?\u201d Bai Hua Fairy asked.\u201cI do\u201d Gu Qing Shan was a bit confused, why would she need to see his badge now?\u201cTake it out\u201d Bai Hua Fairy ordered.\u201cYes\u201dGu Qing Shan took off the bronze alloy badge on his waist and presented with both hands.With a wave, Bai Hua Fairy had made the bronze alloy badge flew across the palace and into her hand.As Bai Hua Fairy infused it with her spirit energy, a light appeared on the badge, showing a name.\u201cVanguard legion, Gu Qing Shan\u201dThe badge isn\u2019t fake; it naturally carries a connection with this youth before her.Such a serious matter, could it be true?Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s expression became dignified.She pointed at the bronze alloy badge and made it float in the air.\u201cDivine Skill --------Truth From Spacetime!\u201dBai Hua Fairy quickly made a set of hand signs.Hooong!A loud sound was heard from the air.A large spirit light pounded the air, breaking and turning it into a two-person tall black hole.In the black hole, a few moving images were seen.Is was showing the past, the past of all creatures whose aura had ever came into contact with the badge.In a dead pit, numerous bodies of dead soldier emitted a dusty grey color.Inside the outpost, Zhao Lu was seen, but around him was a thick grey color of death, showing that he together with all the dead people in the dead pit has all entered reincarnation.Faceless Giant.Human-faced Bird.Demon Snake.\u2026.Numerous faces appeared, and then Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi also showed up.After that was Shen Wu world, inside the endless sea of demons.Five cultivators were covered in a grey aura.Only Leng Tian Xing still had a cold frosty blue aura.Seeing that much, Bai Hua Fairy nodded: \u201cHaving been through so much killing, yet you can still make it to Bai Hua country, and successfully attempted the sword list, you indeed are praiseworthy\u201dGu Qing Shan once again spoke: \u201cThis one beg the Saint to save those two\u201dBai Hua Fairy replied: \u201cDon\u2019t mention that just yet, everything must be done within this Saint\u2019s rules\u201dShe opened her jade-white hand covered in a green aura as she quickly counted something.In just a few moments, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s face relaxed and said: \u201cI\u2019ve just made a divination, within the next 15 minutes, they will not die\u201dThe hardest of the 6 arts, Divination!Living 2 lives, this is the very first time that Gu Qing Shan had seen someone perform real divination.Of course in the past life, it wasn\u2019t that he had never seen someone do divination, but it was always with a stooge, a trick to fool people.The game described it very clearly, the hardest of the 6 arts is Divination.But also because of that, numerous players became con artists in the world of cultivation.There were even quite a few cultivators of this world who got fooled.While Gu Qing Shan was thinking, Bai Hua Fairy once again spoke.\u201cEven though you attempted the sword list, you\u2019ve yet to use a single sword skill in the green jade screen, and this doesn\u2019t fit my rules\u201d\u201cSuccessfully attempted the sword list without using a sword, if everyone does things like this, wouldn\u2019t my Bai Hua lists become a total joke for you people to fool around with?\u201d\u201cBecause of that, I can\u2019t consider you to have fully completed the sword list\u201dShe clapped her hands and summoned two maids who appeared without a sound.\u201cThese are two of my sword maidens, I will limit their cultivation to qi training stage 7, you have one chance to battle them\u201d\u201cWithin 15 minutes, if you can\u2019t defeat them, this Saint shall consider you to have failed the sword list instead\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this Saint shall take this information to the frontline to let them deal with it, this Saint shall not deal with it herself\u201dGu Qing Shan hurriedly: \u201cBut the cultivators on the frontline might not be able to save them\u201dBai Hua Fairy frowned and said: \u201cIf you want this Saint to do anything for you, you must successfully attempt a Bai Hua list, this is my rule, and no one can ever change it\u201dAs soon as she said that, the two sword maiden had stepped forward, bowed and took out their swords.Gu Qing Shan quickly counted, since the time he left Ning Yue Xi and Gong Sun Zhi, it\u2019s already been almost half a day.In order words, the 10-trigram Sealing formation on Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s body is about to reach its limit.He grabbed the air with his hand, holding a steel sword.Bai Hua Fairy is hard to predict; she has her own set of rules that no one can ever interfere with.If you don\u2019t follow her rules, if you can\u2019t satisfy her, then even if the sky itself is falling, she won\u2019t lift a finger to help you.He can\u2019t help it; he\u2019ll have to show his best.\u201cPlease\u201d Gu Qing Shan breathed in, held his sword up and said.The two sword maiden looked at each other, swung their swords and attacked.The two swords are one long, one short, one quick, one slow, covering for each other\u2019s weak points, weaving strike after strike, reaching Gu Qing Shan in a matter of seconds.This type of combination, this type of swordplay, there\u2019s no imagination to it, no flashiness and definitely no justice, everything is for the sake of taking the enemy\u2019s life, a swordplay that\u2019s simple to its limit.Seeing how well they complement each other, even calling it one person using two styles at the same time isn\u2019t enough.\u201cGood\u201dGu Qing Shan praised them.Then his sword also moved.Bang! Bang!Two consecutive sounds.The two sword maiden stepped back a few feet, surprised.\u201cWind Slash?\u201d\u201cNo, Kai Shan\u201dThey hesitated, unable to determine.Gu Qing Shan pursued, the longsword in his hand looked slow but was very quick, striking several times in a row.The two sword maidens blocked them all and was forced back 7-8 more feet.\u201cThis is Wind Cutting Consecutive Slashes!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s Kai Shan Sword Hammer!\u201dThe two of them opened their mouths at the same time.They silently fixed their styles, wanting to attack, but their combination was no longer perfect.As the sword flashes before their eyes, the two of them wanted to block, but only felt an impact on their hands as their swords were knocked away, flying to the other end of the palace.A voice lightly exclaimed from atop the throne.\u201cSword wills weaving, naturally shifting\u201dBai Hua Fairy seemed to be in full excitement, smiled and said: \u201cYou two didn\u2019t lose for nothing, this is a style mixed between the Wind Slash true will and Kai Shan true will, only someone who\u2019ve perfected both of these styles would be able to do something like that\u201dSeeing her like that, you\u2019d think she doesn\u2019t care at all about Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi\u2019s lives.Even the fact that there\u2019s a traitor in humanity\u2019s top brass, and the fact that Shen Wu world existed couldn\u2019t even make a ripple in her mood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s interesting then\u201dHer eyes glowed a bit looking at Gu Qing Shan and said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance, prove your words\u201d\u201cHow do I prove it?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cAttack me with your full strength and I\u2019ll be the judge\u201d Bai Hua Fairy answered.This is the strongest of the 3 Saints, even Gu Qing Shan at his prime couldn\u2019t even scratch her.Because of that, Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t bother saying useless swords, he only held his sword, pointing the tip at Bai Hua Fairy.\u201cWater Flow Severance!\u201dGu Qing Shan shouted loudly as he thrust the sword forward.On the steel sword, endless sword phantoms concentrated into one.In the blink of an eye, all the sword phantoms flowed out like a tsunami.The world became silent.Kong!As soon as the blinding sword phantoms appeared from the tip, they also disappeared.Unable to handle this strike\u2019s power, the steel sword broke into metal chips and fell down in place, making a harmonious clanking sound.Gu Qing Shan was stunned.Bai Hua Fairy slightly shifted her body and was already on her throne again.\u201cThis attack was very decent, if we were to consider your age, it truly is extraordinary\u201d she commented.Even though the strike wasn\u2019t able to be released, with how high Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s eyes are, she could easily tell Gu Qing Shan\u2019s level of sword skills.She suddenly felt a bit of love for talent.\u201cA sword cultivator without a sword cannot be called a sword cultivator, come and pick a sword, it\u2019ll be to replace your broken sword\u201d Bai Hua Fairy said.Gu Qing Shan very honestly answered: \u201cThis sword was originally not mine, it belonged to the river\u2019s ferryman, if your Eminence wish to repay it then please repay him\u201dBai Hua Fairy unexpectedly frowned, her opinion of Gu Qing Shan changed a bit.Then Gu Qing Shan once again said: \u201cI sincerely hope that your Eminence would act to save them, as Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi\u2019s situation might not be too good\u201dBai Hua Fairy swung her hand: \u201cNo need to hurry, they won\u2019t die, even if they die I will be able to bring them back\u201dIf she had said that much then there\u2019s nothing else Gu Qing Shan can say.If Bai Hua Fairy really have such an ability, then after Gong Sun Zhi died and revived, would my Quest be considered failed or success?Gu Qing Shan felt very conflicted.Bai Hua Fairy looked at Gu Qing Shan a bit then said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry too much, if I tell you to choose a sword, then just come and choose a sword\u201dA Saint\u2019s words are the law, once said it will not be easily changed.\u201cThen, I\u2019m grateful to your Eminence\u201dGu Qing Shan could only clasp his hand and bowed.Bai Hua Fairy swung her long sleeves, as five Longswords flew into the palace, neatly lined up in front of Gu Qing Shan.Seeing them, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mood churned a bit.As a sword cultivator, it\u2019s been so long since he had seen a truly trustworthy sword.As something that Bai Hua Fairy would keep, of course there wouldn\u2019t be any that\u2019s only good in appearance.He walked forward, choosing his partner from now on very carefully.Bai Hua Fairy lifted her face full of interest with her hand, her bare feet crossed on the ten thousand flower throne.This youth had gone and studied the naming of sword styles, this type of thing that takes effort yet never bring about any results is too far-out, so no one has really done it before.This type of person, which sword would he choose?She kept silent and looked at the scene in front of her, waiting for the youth to pick.Gu Qing Shan glanced over the 5 swords, then walked towards the leftmost one, pulling it out.A \u2018clang\u2019 was heard and then Sword Will filled the air.Based on their quality, weapons can be divided into 5 grades which are Sharp, Treasure, Spirit, Law and Dao.This sword only needs to be held in hand to feel the overwhelming killing intent from it.A sword that hold a will is extremely rare, it could already be considered a Law-grade weapon.A sword like this is so very valuable, that it could drive the numerous sword cultivator of the land into a frenzy.Gu Qing Shan sighed, then returned the sword into its sheath.He then looked at the other swords.\u201cHm, why didn\u2019t you choose that one?\u201d Bai Hua Fairy asked.The sword that Gu Qing Shan had picked up first is a good sword without a doubt.\u201cThe first reason is that it\u2019s too valuable, with my cultivation, even if I use it, I can\u2019t protect it\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.\u201cThe second?\u201d Bai Hua Fairy asked.\u201cThe second reason is that the sword holds too much killing intent, it would affect my judgement when using the sword\u201d\u201cBut you once said, to hold a sword you only need a single thought, and that\u2019s the thought to kill\u201d Bai Hua Fairy still hasn\u2019t let him go.\u201cAh, but the thought to kill must be mine, not the sword\u2019s\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied, \u201cI\u2019ve not even thought about anything and it had already emitted killing intent, then would I be using it, or would it be using me? It\u2019s very possible to become its slave, turned into a killing machine\u201dBai Hua Fairy was silent and didn\u2019t ask anymore.In fact, the previous owner of this sword called himself the Demonic Human Sword Cultivator, who died because he had attracted a Tianma who devoured his soul.The second sword was a deep red color, as it silently floated there you can feel an intense burning heatWhen Gu Qing Shan held the sword and tried to infuse it with spirit energy, the sword let out a searing flame.This would be a Fire-element sword, any sword cultivator that awaken Fire-element root that use it will increase their strength many times over.The third sword was black without any shine, as it moved it remained silent and didn\u2019t let out a single sound.The fourth sword let out a soul-piercing shriek as you swung it, able to confuse the opponent\u2019s mind.The fifth sword was a bit long, it didn\u2019t have a sheath and felt heavy in the hand, yet when he swung it, he felt it fit naturally.As Gu Qing Shan tried to infuse it with spirit energy, the sword itself didn\u2019t change, but you could instinctively feel a sense of steadiness.Holding the sword, Gu Qing Shan suddenly felt a sense of safety.Gu Qing Shan happily held the sword as he bowed to Bai Hua Fairy and said: \u201cI wish to take this one\u201dThe moment that she saw Gu Qing Shan took this sword, Bai Hua Fairy was holding her breath.It was only when he chose the sword, only when he spoke did Bai Hua Fairy finally breathed out slowly.\u201cThe swords before, why didn\u2019t you choose them?\u201d Bai Hua Fairy asked without changing her expression.\u201cThe 2nd sword was suitable for Fire-element root cultivators, while my own spirit energy element hasn\u2019t awakened, so it\u2019s not for me\u201d\u201cThe 3rd sword is one used for sly sword style, it doesn\u2019t suit my wind slash style\u201d\u201cThe 4th sword\u2019s power was very decent, but as a sword cultivator, I believe what we pursue is sword arts, not relying on tricks\u201dGu Qing Shan coolly explained himself.Swords were originally the thing he felt most interested in, so whenever he\u2019s asked, he would always speak with enthusiasm.As Bai Hua Fairy heard that, she asked: \u201cThen why did you choose the 5th sword? I can tell you that this sword was only added to round up the number, the weakest of the five --------it\u2019s not too late to change your choice\u201dGu Qing Shan shook his head: \u201cThis sword fits me very well; I don\u2019t need to change\u201dBai Hua Fairy asked again: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any characteristics, and it has never been used by anyone to fight against a foe, why do you like it so much?\u201dGu Qing Shan checked his War God UI, confirming that the sword doesn\u2019t have a single Skill on it, a clean slate.But Gu Qing Shan could feel instinctively, for some reason, that he wouldn\u2019t want to pass up on this sword no matter what.With his dozen years of experience using swords, as he held this sword in hand, he could feel it as a part of his body, like a partner that understands everything there is to understand about him.Gu Qing Shan hesitated for a bit, then answered, embarrassed: \u201cThe sword just feels right in my hand, I don\u2019t feel like changing it\u201dAs Bai Hua Fairy heard that, she felt a sense of nostalgia.In her memory, the voice that\u2019s been buried for numerous years was heard once again.\u201cLing er, I\u2019ve spent so much effort to find for you these ten swords, every single one of them is much stronger than the one you have, why do you still refuse?\u201d (1)The girl smiled and answered: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I chose it myself, this one just feels right\u201dShe continued: \u201cA sword is a companion for your whole life, if it doesn\u2019t feel right, so what if it\u2019s better? Right, you don\u2019t need to come here so much anymore, especially the next few days, I ---------\u201c\u2018am about to break through\u2019, those words couldn\u2019t be said, as the other person\u2019s face has changed and shouted angrily.\u201cHypocritical wench, since you don\u2019t want an invitation but rather a punishment, I\u2019ll give you one day to consider becoming my Dao companion, if your answer doesn\u2019t satisfy me, I\u2019ll destroy your whole sect!\u201dThen the man turned into the wind and left.One day later, the few hundred people of her sect was all massacred, only the girl had survived because of the sect master\u2019s protection, silently left.Bai Hua Fairy bit her lip.\u201cThis sword, was my sword from many years ago\u201d, she looked at the youth below and softly said.\u201cAh, then my apologies, I\u2019ll choose another one then\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.He\u2019s a bit sorrowful, accidentally choosing Her Eminence\u2019s sword right away like that, he can only hope that she won\u2019t get angry.He still needs her help saving people after all.\u201cNo need, this Saint has long gone on a different path, swords and such weapons are no longer necessary\u201d\u201cIf you feel that it fits your hand, that means it had also chosen you -------use it, treat it well\u201dBai Hua Fairy slowly spoke\u201cI\u2019ll also give you the sheath\u201dFrom the air, she grabbed a sword sheath, looked at it for a moment before throwing it to him.The sheath was simple and natural, black from top to bottom, as Gu Qing Shan received it, he also sheathed the sword.\u201cThank you your Eminence\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.Bai Hua Fairy sat there silent for a while, then suddenly spoke again: \u201cThis sword\u2019s name is Earth\u201d (TN: the ground, not planet Earth)\u201cEarth?\u201d Gu Qing Shan was surprised\u201cYes, the Earth is able to hold all beings, nurture all living creatures, a miracle only accomplishable by the world\u2019s law itself, and so this sword is the Earth sword\u201cThe sword weighs 86,370,000 tons, which carries the Spirit Thaumaturgy ------I Am Heavy\u201d\u201cI Am Heavy, means that the user of the sword would only feel a regular sword\u2019s weight, all things in the world would also not feel its weight, only when facing an enemy, will they face the full power of 86,370,000 tons\u201dBai Hua Fairy\u2019s eyes looked into the distance, her mouth lifted into a sarcastic smirk as she said: \u201cThe Earth sword was passed down for 100,000 years in our sect, never used as a weapon to fight against an enemy, only a valuable treasure. The stories passed down was that it could be used to contact the Divinity after the Old Age, a sword intended to be used for ceremonial purposes\u201d\u201cAfter 100 thousand years, our sect had already fallen in grace, and only each generation\u2019s sect master would know about it. I was to be the next sect master, that\u2019s why I had this sword. Unfortunately I made some bad friends when I was young, leading to the destruction of our already exhausted sect\u201dNote:(1) Ling er: the \u201cer\u201d is usually used after a name, it basically means \u201clittle one\u201d. Its usage is very similar to the \u201c-chan\u201d suffix in Japanese. A senior would call their juniors this to show fondness, regardless of gender; or it can also be used by a male to call a female affectionately, both romantically and non-romantically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also, the events of that time, it wasn\u2019t your fault\u201d the deep voice said.Bai Hua Fairy wanted to, but couldn\u2019t laugh, only replied: \u201cThe sect is already not here anymore, go, go create a new history\u201dThe sword floated on the air, after the hilt lightly rest on Bai Hua Fairy for a bit, it slowly floated away.Bai Hua Fairy swung her hand, releasing the Lock Seals.The Earth sword quickly flew back into Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands.\u201cThis sword\u2019s power is too vast, so in order to prevent others from greed, I\u2019ve put Lock Seals on it\u201d Bai Hua Fairy said to Gu Qing Shan.Then as if she suddenly remembered something, she added: \u201cQi training realm can use a strike up to 30,000 tons\u201d\u201cThank you Saint\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded as he thanked her.He also understands really well, knowing that Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s action is for his own good.If a weapon is too strong, the sword cultivator will become reliant on it, making their skills harder to improve.Not to mention, a single strike having 30,000 tons\u2019 worth of strength is already very strong, it could be considered top-notch within the ranks of qi training realm weapons.Bai Hua Fairy looked a bit at the youth, then at the sword in his hand, suddenly she thought of something.Opening her jade-white hands, she made a hand seal.Outside Bai Hua capital city, inside a certain rice field, a pig disappeared.At the forked road, the white goose standing on the green rock that was still shouting loudly: \u201cNone of you rush, line up, next person\u201dSuddenly, the white goose disappeared, making every cultivator who was waiting went into an uproar.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s hand seals didn\u2019t change, as her spirit energy continued to flow.On the river, inside a new wooden boat, the old ferryman disappeared.Bai Hua Fairy continued.Inside Bai Hua Palace, a female maid disappeared.She closed her eyes, as a second later, numerous scenes were being shown in front of her sight.\u201cHow clever, just like myself back then\u201d she muttered.That year she was only 18, after stealing her senior brother\u2019s Spirit talisman, she snuck into the Secret Library and learned all 3 of the sect\u2019s strongest scriptures.As the elders wanted to punish her, she quoted the sect\u2019s constitution ------whoever can master all three of the sect\u2019s Secret Arts is to become a candidate for the next generation\u2019s sect master, someone not to be humiliated.When the elders didn\u2019t believe her, she used all three of them one after another.Back then, all the elders\u2019 faces were especially interesting.Remembering old memory, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s slightly downed mood improved.Seeing Gu Qing Shan\u2019s performance on the way, Bai Hua Fairy was even more pleased.Gu Qing Shan of course knows what she\u2019s doing, but his face remains unchanged, stood silently waiting for her decision.That\u2019s right, Bai Hua Fairy had a certain Divine Skill.One As Ten Million.Within the ranks of Divine Skills, this one was also particularly high-rate.No matter who it is, once they set foot into Bai Hua Immortal country, every person they meet on the way, every animal, any and all of them could be Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s clones.A bird in the sky, a normal citizen on the streets, a servant in an official\u2019s estate, the bellboy and owner of an inn, even deep underground, in an ancient ruin, as long as it\u2019s still in Bai Hua Immortal country, even a hibernating snake or an ant that\u2019s crawling on the ground could be her.Almost every single creature is her clone.In the past life, after she used all her strength to take on and push back the whole demon army, with a look of regret, her body went into a Space crack as she left the world to reincarnate.As she left, the whole of Bai Hua country also disappeared, and the only ones left were the cultivators.It was then that everyone understood, inside Bai Hua Immortal country, the only ones that weren\u2019t her clones were her disciples.No one knows just why Bai Hua Fairy did what she did, since she was already at peak Sainted realm, many cultivators suspected that she did it in order to find out the secret of breaking through Sainted realm.Because of that, within all the cultivators who go here to attempt a Bai Hua list, if they show even the smallest of actions that Bai Hua Fairy doesn\u2019t like, they\u2019ll be found out immediately.And this is also the reason why Bai Hua Fairy take in very few disciples.\u201cRight now I have a very important question that I want to ask you\u201d Bai Hua Fairy spoke.Gu Qing Shan answered: \u201cPlease go ahead and ask, your Eminence\u201dBai Hua Fairy looked at Gu Qing Shan from above, her face shows no emotion, and asked: \u201cAre there any other people in your family? Why did you join the army?\u201dAs soon as Bai Hua Fairy finished asking, she had already secretly used a hand seal in her sleeves.No lies can ever fool her.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t think that she would ask this, but within a single second of thinking, he had already abandoned the choice of lying.One of Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s clones herself said that he can\u2019t fool her with lies.A Saint will always have a way that you can\u2019t imagine to find out the truth.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then cleverly answered: \u201cThis humble one\u2019s parents died in an accident at a young age, so I could only struggle alone to grow up. In this chaotic age of war against the demons, I joined the army only wanting to learn a thing or two, get a bit stronger so that I can survive\u201dWhat he\u2019s saying here contained his life on both worlds, at the same time conveyed his life very clearly.Bai Hua Fairy looked at him, the spirit energy wave she received from her hand seal also didn\u2019t show any falsehood.He was able to say it so simply, but all of it was the truth.No one knows, that Bai Hua Fairy herself was also an orphan.After she became a Saint, she had hidden away both her background and past experiences, so that no one can ever check on it and find her weakness.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s expression relaxes, even her eyes held a bit more closeness than before.\u201cIf it\u2019s as you said, then you\u2019re an orphan\u201d she purposefully asked \u201cThis Saint is curious, how does it feel to struggle to survive, alone?\u201dGu Qing Shan was a bit confused, not knowing why the Saint would ask this, but he still answered seriously.This time, he doesn\u2019t even need to think too much before answering.Recalling all the times of bitterness and struggle, Gu Qing Shan naturally replied: \u201cTo be alone in this world, the upside is that I never have to worry about someone else being sad and mourn my death\u201dBai Hua Fairy didn\u2019t comment on it, only asked: \u201cThe downside?\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled and answered: \u201cThere are 2 downsides, one is the no matter if I\u2019m eating, fighting, or cultivating, I\u2019ll always be outnumbered\u201d\u201cTwo is when seeing someone else\u2019s joyful birthday with friends, I can\u2019t help but feel the need to avoid it\u201dThis simple answer, as Bai Hua Fairy heard it, she couldn\u2019t help but grab the handles on her throne.Five deep finger marks, as sharp as a knife was carved into the white flower-shaped Immortal Jade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, it made her realize the youth standing here definitely wasn\u2019t simple.Looking closer, the youth still had a wound leaking blood on his thighs, bloody bite marks on his back, his shoulder lopped off by something sharp ----from the mark, she would guess that it was some demon\u2019s claws.Myself all those years ago was also like this wasn\u2019t I?Furthermore, this youth has taken my old sect\u2019s heirloom sword.The Earth sword\u2019s sword spirit could be called my companion for half a lifetime, he had been through the toughest of times with me, am I so cruel as to just let it go and not care anymore?Bai Hua Fairy lightly closed her eyes, then opened them, softly asking: \u201cWould you agree to join my Bai Hua Sect?\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s heart jumped.This question, is the aspiration and life-long dream of numerous cultivators.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t predict this at all.In the past life, he couldn\u2019t even pass the semester examination, so he didn\u2019t belong in any sects.Back then he had to risk his life, went into the demon\u2019s backline to hunt for herbs for money, just to buy a single sword style from the auction house.Could it be, his luck has changed?This is Bai Hua Sect!Gu Qing Shan calmed the intense emotions in his heart, just barely, and seriously answered: \u201cI would be honored to\u201dOnce he\u2019s said that, there\u2019s no going back anymore.In the past life, there were only 2 players, who luckily got to become Xuanyuan Tianzun and the Great Monk of Resentment\u2019s disciples.But to the very end, not a single player could become Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s disciple.One reason for that was that it wasn\u2019t until Bai Hua Fairy passed away that everyone knew the whole of Bai Hua country was formed from her clones.Another reason was because Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s eyes were simply too high, people whose talents catch her eyes and could also fit her personality were few and far between.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s situation was also a series of coincidences.This life, if Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t come to save Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi, if he didn\u2019t successfully attempt the sword list the wrong way he wouldn\u2019t have had to fight the two sword maidens.If it wasn\u2019t because his Secret Art Water Flow Severance had caught Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s eyes for talent, so that she would let him choose a sword as a replacement, he wouldn\u2019t have the chance to pick the Earth sword.It was because of all his experience, together with all the correct answers that he had given to Bai Hua Fairy questions before, that had led to her giving thought to this.These series of events, if even one of them was missing, then Bai Hua Fairy wouldn\u2019t have thought about inviting him.Without all these prerequisites, even if Gu Qing Shan had regained his old cultivation as a Great Sword Saint, he wouldn\u2019t even have caught Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s glance.Strong people that are weaker than the Saints are as numerous as the stars in the sky, and the Saints who stands on top of all cultivators would not look down to see them so easily.\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201dBai Hua Fairy\u2019s face was still covered with a thin veil, but the joy in her voice at the moment, even Gu Qing Shan could feel it.\u201cYour bow, its name is Night Rain isn\u2019t it?\u201d she suddenly asked.This unexpected question stumped Gu Qing Shan for a bit before he was able to reply.On the boat, he indeed did use Night Rain to kill the big black fish.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s question is like a puzzle, making people unsure of what to say.He could only reply: \u201cYes it is\u201dBai Hua Fairy suddenly laughed to herself, in her eyes was a sense of understanding.\u201cThat bow belonged to Heaven\u2019s Limit Saintess Ning Yue Xi correct? That\u2019s fine, as this Saint\u2019s disciple, she is certainly a fit for you\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t say anything to that.\u201cAh, but you\u2019re a sword cultivator, yet she didn\u2019t beat you up?\u201d\u201c\u2026When I saved her life, she didn't notice that I was a sword cultivator\u201d\u201cAhahaha, so that\u2019s why, very nice!\u201dBai Hua Fairy was now laughing lightly, showing a completely different side to her.It seems that she\u2019s fully accepted me as her disciple, that\u2019s why she\u2019s this relaxed, Gu Qing Shan thought to himself.The world outside all say that Bai Hua Fairy is committed to cultivation, and is immersed in researching spells, not caring a bit about mortal matters.But who would know that her true self is actually really mischievous.\u201cYou\u2019re my 4th disciple, I\u2019ll have to think for a bit about what title to give you\u201dBai Hua Fairy then said\u201cHmm, of the four, you\u2019re the youngest male, what title would be good then?\u201dSeeing that Bai Hua Fairy was still thinking deeply about a matter that didn\u2019t matter, Gu Qing Shan was in a bit of a rush.Gu Qing Shan spoke softly: \u201cSain -----no, Shifu, Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi are still waiting for you to save them\u201d (TN: Shifu means teacher/master, but also have a slight connotation of being a parent)As she was called Shifu, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s attitude was completely different from before.She nodded: \u201cTeacher forgot about that for a bit, I should go save them indeed\u201dThen Bai Hua Fairy clasped her hands together, creating a hand sign and spoke in a low voice: \u201cDivine Skill, Flesh Incarnation\u201dThree other Bai Hua Fairy appeared from her body and landed in the palace.\u201cI\u2019ll go save them\u201dOne of the Bai Hua Fairy said that, swung her sleeves and disappeared.After that, another Bai Hua Fairy said: \u201cHumanity\u2019s top brass has a traitor, I\u2019ll go tell them the bad news\u201dAnother Bai Hua Fairy nodded and said: \u201cThe matter regarding Shen Wu world, Xuanyuan that old man will agree to do it, I\u2019ll go find him\u201dThe two of them made different hand signs and disappeared from the palace at the same time.Sitting on the ten thousand flowers throne, Bai Hua Fairy suddenly spoke: \u201cCome to think of it, it has been quite a long time since I\u2019ve fought demon\u2019s beasts\u201d\u201cSecret Arts, Bai Hua Mirror\u201dAs she waved her hands nonchalantly, the whole palace disappeared around them.Gu Qing Shan noticed the scenery around him was that of the wild, quickly retreating backwards.And then, the retreating scenery slowed down.This sight must\u2019ve come from to the first Bai Hua Fairy incarnation that left.Within just a few dozen seconds, she has already reached the frontline.A few miles away, the Faceless Giant stood among the clouds, a few demon beasts emitting a powerful aura was also standing on the air. (1)In that small patch of land, the large army of demons and beasts were encircling two cultivators, using the wheel tactic. (2)The demon beasts floating in the sky occasionally took the chance to fly down, unleashing their attacks, then again retreated upward.They\u2019re using the attrition method to gradually whittle down the cultivators below.Gu Qing Shan concentrated his sight on them, of course they were Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi.In the past life, this was how they died.Suddenly, from deep inside the clouds, a roaring, booming voice was heard.\u201cA great cultivator from the humans is approaching, do not hold back, use everything to kill them!\u201dAs soon as they heard that order, all the demons started using their strongest attacks.Gong Sun Zhi coughed up blood, but still did his best to operate a formation plate.Ning Yue Xi swung her Blade, numerous shining lights were seen on the Blade.\u201cA last strike, let\u2019s see how many I can take with me\u201d said Ning Yue Xi.\u201cAhaha, good! Then let us compare once, just who killed more demons\u201d Gong Sun Zhi also laughed loudly and said.Above, chaotic and numerous demonic and bestial spells rained upon them.Inside Bai Hua Palace.\u201cOh no! We\u2019re late!\u201d Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but exclaimed.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation is still a few miles away from Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi, yet the already strong demon beast army was also using their strongest attacks.Some of the demon beasts were even choosing to use sacrificial methods to activate the strongest spells available to themselves.Against attacks so throng, the two of them definitely have no chance of escape.\u201cDon\u2019t fret\u201dOn her throne, Bai Hua Fairy was using one hand to hold up her face and said lazily.As her inner sight swept through a few ten thousand miles, all the demon beasts\u2019 spells were scanned and thoroughly remembered, fully explored of their secrets.At the same time.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation stopped in place, shouted with a low voice: \u201cDivine Skill, Sleeves of Holding\u201dThe incarnation swept her long sleeves along the wind, then retrieved it in one motion.A few miles from there, suddenly all the lights from Gong Sun Zhi\u2019s defensive formation shut down at once.Gong Sun Zhi face changed: \u201cThe formation lost its effect, what happened!?\u201dThen immediately after, he and Ning Yue Xi were tightly bound by something, unable to use even the littlest bit of spirit energy or move a finger.An irresistible force pulled the two defenseless people through the distance of miles all at once, into Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation\u2019s right sleeve.A second later, the numerous attacks hit where Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi were standing before, blowing everything up into a giant crater.Note:(1) demon beast: in Chinese mythology, there were never any difference between demons and demon beasts, so it\u2019s not mentioned too specifically. But know that demon beasts are basically beast cultivators, while demons are a different species that\u2019s similar to creatures that live in Western hell. Over the entire course of the novel, there will be mentions of real demons, demon beasts, devils, fiends and all manners of different demonic species and I\u2019ll try to differentiate them each time, but be prepared for some confusion.(2) Wheel tactic: basically using the advantage of number, everyone on the side with more people will take turns fighting the side that\u2019s outnumbered without giving them time to rest, like a wheel pivoting around a single point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This demon beast is slightly interesting\u201d Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation softly spoke.The 5-claw Grey Dragon having turned into a humanoid form, still kept a snake-like head, all four limbs were still claws and a long tail dragging behind it together with a grey color scale that covered its whole body.Within its snake eyes, endless wicked intent can be seen.This was a Beast Saint that is able to change its form.The world has had no True Dragon for a very long time, this Dragonewt is already one of the strongest species within demon beasts, a sacred beast that could rival a Saint.The voice that had hid inside the cloud giving order from before was his.Gu Qing Shan was a bit confused and surprised.There were no Beast Saint that personally acted during the past life.Once a Beast Saint appeared, the spirit pressure they emit could easily be felt by the great cultivators of humanity.This time, seeing their two targets about to be saved, the Beast Saint couldn\u2019t just stay silent anymore.\u201cA demonic dragonewt? Good, let this Saint test your mettle a little bit\u201dSaying that, Bai Hua Fairy extended her jade-like fingers and made a hand seal: \u201c5-element Metal spell, Great Dragon\u201dIn the air, a phantom that covered the sky appeared.Is was a Great Dragon with 9 claws, a few miles long from head to tail.All the demon beasts that saw that all fled.As soon as the Great Dragon opened its mouth, numerous demon generals floating in the sky was swallowed, then it waved its tail and also swallowed the Beast Saint.Then the dragon snapped at the ground, taking in a large piece of land in its mouth, as it raised its head to swallow, numerous demons and dirt fell from the sky.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation changed her hand seals, then spoke: \u201cBurn!\u201dWhen it heard that order, it twisted its body, happily flung its tail and roared.The dragon\u2019s body started glowing a golden color of fire, as the fire covered its outer body, it also travelled inside.A minute later.A sudden change.The golden fire exploded, flowing back out from inside its body.The 9-claw Great Dragon squirmed in pain, the fire on its body kept raining down everywhere.As the fire rained down like a meteor shower, all the demons that haven\u2019t fled in time all got burned to ash.Then the Great Dragon stopped moving.A few breaths later, it roared in pain.The invisible shockwaves from its mouth could almost be seen in the sky.As Bai Hua Fairy sat on her throne of flowers, her eyebrows suddenly loosened and spoke excitedly: \u201cFinally you couldn\u2019t handle it and retaliated, a good chance!\u201dPop, as Bai Hua Fairy disappeared from the throne of flower.Almost in the blink of an eye, she had returned.\u201cClang, clang\u201d, two weapons were nonchalantly thrown on the ground.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but look at them.They were an elongated bone claw, and a large bone blade.You only need to look to tell that they were high-tier demonic weapons.But right now, all the strong demons were trapped inside the 9-claw Great Dragon.Which means, Bai Hua Fairy was looking for a chance to steal the demon\u2019s things?The strongest Saint in the world, doesn\u2019t just have, but also actively use extremely fluent pickpocketing skills.This fact is so out of this world that Gu Qing Shan could only stand in silence, looking confused.All of the sudden, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s face again was full of excitement, once again stood up and disappeared.The 9-claw Great Dragon squirmed even more, but inside the dragon there was a large bag, occasionally moved like there was something trying to get out from inside.A few breaths later, the 9-claw Great Dragon disappeared in a large flash of light, slowly dissipated in the air.Replacing that dragon was a few floating figures.The Dragonewt Beast Saint was standing in the middle of the demon generals, roaring: \u201cA spell of this caliber, just who the heck are you!\u201dWhen the dragon disappeared, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s figure once again appeared on the ten thousand flower throne.She estimated the bag in her hand a bit then also put it down.Together with the 2 others, there are now 3 stolen weapons on the ground.\u201cLooks like I didn\u2019t go there for nothing after all\u201d Bai Hua Fairy sat on her throne, muttered happily.Gu Qing Shan was silent and didn\u2019t say a word, acting like he didn\u2019t hear it.Right at this moment, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation made another hand seal.\u201cFlesh Incarnation!\u201dAnother incarnation split away from the incarnation to block the demon\u2019s path.While the original incarnation changed hand seals again.\u201cEarth Burrow!\u201dWith a shout, she brought Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi and disappeared into the ground.As the Beast Saint saw her flew up, it thought a bit and asked: \u201cThat was Flesh Incarnation, which means, you must be the human\u2019s Xie Dao Ling?\u201dXie Dao Ling is Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s real name, but normal people don\u2019t dare to call her that.\u201cI am\u201dThe incarnation stood in the air and replied.The beast saint smiled so wide it practically reached his ears, showing his sharp fangs, he spoke: \u201cXie Dao Ling, you dare ruin our demon army\u2019s plan, I swear I\u2019ll kill you, trap your soul within your flesh, making you serve me as a slave for both day and night!\u201dThe incarnation looked at the beast saint coldly: \u201cYou know me, and yet you still dare to be so foul?\u201dThe Evil Dragonewt stuck out its tongue, looked at Bai Hua Fairy incarnation from head to toe with eyes holding nothing except wicked thoughts.It said: \u201cI heard Bai Hua Fairy Xie Dao Ling only knows to cultivate herself, after reaching Sainted realm, she\u2019s still a pure virgin, oh how that tickles my fancy\u201dSaying that, it was already drooling nonstop.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation kept calm, asked it back: \u201cYou dare to saw that much, seems like you\u2019ve got help then?\u201dThe wicked Dragonewt pridefully answered: \u201cOf course they\u2019re all hiding in a secret location, waiting to give you that one fatal strike\u201dAs it insulted her the first time, in the palace, Xie Dao Ling who was sitting on the ten thousand flower throne already angrily muttered to herself.Since she\u2019s broke through Sainted realm to now, no one has dared spoke to her like that.Bai Hua Fairy Xie Dao Ling is truly angry now.Barefooted, she stood up from her throne, angrily cast hand seals one after another.36 hand seals were completed in a matter of a few breaths, each of them emitted an immense green spirit energy on her fingertips.Yet she still hasn\u2019t stopped, only continued casting numerous more signs with unparalleled speed.Xie Dao Ling\u2019s long hair was floating without wind, her sleeves also fluttering from the intense spirit energy waves, making her almost like a real fairy descended from the Heaven.As she cast more and more hand seals, the spirit energy concentrated became stronger and stronger.The spirit light emitted from that has become like a burning sun, lighting up every corner of Bai Hua Palace as clear as day.Previous Chapter<All

by: La0o9The frontline.In the sky, Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation was still fighting against the Dragonewt.Her emerald green feather coat and long hair were flowing in the wind, a pair of clear eyes calm as the autumn water, captivating enough to make any not able to look away.Unfortunately, a thin veil of silk hid her face, making no one able to see everything.Even if it\u2019s only an incarnation, her aura is still unparalleled just like the original.As she looked around, suddenly she pointed her finger at an empty space behind the wicked Dragonewt, asked questioningly: \u201cBlade Emperor, why are you here?\u201dHearing her said that, a person appeared in that space.A tall, muscular body, both eyes glowing full of life, on his face was a long scar straight from his forehead through his nose, ending at the chin.On his back was a giant Blade as big as he was.This was Humanity Alliance\u2019s frontline vice-supreme commander, peak Ascension realm great cultivator -------Blade Emperor.Blade Emperor only laughed, pointing at the scar on his face: \u201cA chance finally showed itself today, since you\u2019ve come here yourself, of course I would come here to make sure you stay here for good\u201d\u201cBecause of that year\u2019s defeat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019ve kept this wound, not letting it heal completely, all to remind me to get my revenge\u201d\u201cSo the traitor was you\u201d Bai Hua Fairy suddenly laughed and said: \u201cThat year you used your higher cultivation to peek on me in the bath and even wanted to use violence, after getting beaten black and blue, you\u2019d still dare to hold a grudge?\u201dBlade Emperor glared at Bai Hua Fairy: \u201cXie Dao Ling, I really had feelings for you back then, but you didn\u2019t know what was good and what was not, don\u2019t blame me for being cruel now\u201dBut then his face changed, both arms crossed in front of his chest to block.So quick, I couldn\u2019t even take out my Blade!Within that moment, Blade Emperor felt a deep sense of loss.Xie Dao Ling appeared right above him, her fists clenched right, looking to strike.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d\u201cXie Dao Ling, you dare!\u201dThree other demons appeared from the air.Immense miasma flowed from them.------------they were all Beast Saints!All the Beast Saints rushed forward at the same time, concentrated their attacks on Xie Dao Ling.Facing their full-power strikes, if Xie Dao Ling still value her life, she would have to dodge and let Blade Emperor go.But completely unlike their expectation, Xie Dao Ling didn\u2019t care, only shouted: \u201cFalling Sky!\u201dAnd struck downward with her fist.Even the air itself was warped, as a silent ripple spread across the sky.It wasn\u2019t until one breath later that a dull sound was heard.--------thud!As Blade Emperor was struck, he flew straight into a mountain peak 100 miles away, burrowing deep into it.\u201cEat dirt, perverted old bastard!\u201dBai Hua Fairy\u2019s incarnation laughed heartily as her clear voice rang across the sky.At this point, the Beast Saints had gotten close enough to strike, yet Xie Dao Ling still attacked Blade Emperor without any intention to dodge.As the Beast Saints saw that, they angrily swore that they would kill Xie Dao Ling in one hit.Then Xie Dao Ling suddenly disappeared.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible!\u201d the Dragonewt roared in anger: \u201cEven an escape Secret Art wouldn\u2019t be able to escape my eyes!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really nowhere to be seen, there\u2019s not even a trace of spirit energy left\u201d another Beast Saint said.The final Beast Saint spoke in fear: \u201cJust what kind of spell would be able to make her disappear in front of all our eyes without a trace like that\u201dBai Hua Fairy Xie Dao Ling, her reputation isn\u2019t just for show.All three of them felt a sense of unease.\u201cRelax, she isn\u2019t quite as powerful as you imagine\u201dSuddenly a voice was heard.And then figured appeared in the air.Another Sainted realm demon beast!Including the Dragonewt, there\u2019s a total of 5 Beast Saints here!Dragonewt: \u201cThree-eyed Evil Mother, you know the most out of us all, quickly tell me what\u2019s going on\u201dThree-eyed Evil Mother scoffed: \u201cHer true self retracted her clones, that\u2019s all it is\u201d\u201cThe one just now wasn\u2019t her true self, just look at Blade Emperor if you don\u2019t believe me\u201dAs they turned to look, the mountain broke apart, and Blade Emperor got out from there, flying towards them.The Dragonewt squints looking at Blade Emperor, then breathed out a sigh: \u201cBeing hit straight on yet he didn\u2019t die, seems like it really wasn\u2019t her true body\u201dIt was only then that they calmed down.At the same time, in Bai Hua Palace.The incarnation suddenly appeared with a huge Blade in hand.She casually threw the Blade together with 3 other weapons into the pile on the ground.\u201cA Blade Emperor without a Blade, I\u2019d like to see what you can do now\u201dThe incarnation laughed full of pride, then disappeared into mist.At the same time, in the sky at the frontline.The Dragonewt suddenly shouted: \u201cYou bitch; you dare steal my Inventory Bag!\u201dBlade Emperor unconsciously reached behind, then his face paled.The other two Beast Saints also quickly recited their invocations to call for their weapons, but felt nothing except a void.\u201cBitch?\u201dInside Bai Hua Palace, on the ten thousand flowers throne, Bai Hua Fairy Xia Dao Ling\u2019s face grew colder, clasping her hands together.She had just finished the final hand seal.The entire set of hand seals took her 30 breaths, weaving 81 different hand seals together, only until the very last hand seal is done is it considered complete.Because the signs could be released, you could already feel something was happening.Sitting on her throne, Bai Hua Fairy stood up.\u201cQing Shan, today, I\u2019ll be giving you your first lesson\u201d, she saidGu Qing Shan bowed and said: \u201cPlease teach me, Shifu\u201dBai Hua Fairy triggered the hand seals she was holding back, saying: \u201cFirstly, never offend a beautiful, powerful female without a good reason, women can all hold a very long grudge; Secondly, Sainted realm is nothing but the start, yet so many mistake it for being the end\u201d\u201cThese two matters, make sure you remember them\u201dSaying that, the hand seals in her hand was fully released, the spirit light emitting from it flowed like an ocean and shot towards the sky.The frontline.\u201cNo, she took my Blade!\u201dBlade Emperor\u2019s heart sank.Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s pickpocket skills infamously are second to none, he\u2019s already took precautions, but still got done in.His strongest suits are all on that Blade, as long as he has the Blade in hand, he can easily disturb Xie Dao Ling\u2019s spell castings, one of the reasons why he was even included for this time\u2019s plan.But now, without his Blade, it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going to happen.Blade Emperor felt a strong sense of unease.He still has beef with the Wild Beast Saint, without his Blade, once things start getting messy, he\u2019ll also have to look out for him.However, seems like Wild Beast Saint isn\u2019t all that well-off either, looking at his face turning blue, seems like he also got robbed of something.The Dragonewt\u2019s face was even worse, of all the people here, only he has the confidence to take Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s Divine Skills head on without losing for a short period.But now his Inventory Bag was stolen by Bai Hua Fairy.Without his trove of treasures, it would be very hard to deal with Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s endless means of attacks.While Blade Emperor was still thinking, he saw all the Beast Saints suddenly looked up at the sky.What happened?He couldn\u2019t help but also look up, and was almost shock stunned.The sky itself has disappeared.The blue morning sky was gone, instead replaced with a thick, yet also transparent fog.Within the fog, you could almost see a large, unending river, flowing across the sky itself.The river itself was the sky, and no matter how far you look, you can\u2019t see its end.The Faceless Giant suddenly turned around, and tried its best to run away.As a chaos-species, the Faceless Giants were born from the time when heaven and earth still haven\u2019t been, naturally gaining an acute sense of life and death.Blade Emperor looked at the escaping Faceless Giant, then again at the endless river in the sky.Suddenly he felt a strange cold sweat dripped down his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, that can\u2019t be right, how can a spell contain a person?\u201d Evil Dragonewt frowned for the first time.Everyone there also felt an aversion to it.With their combined knowledge and experience, they should have already seen all the spells and techniques in this world, even many Secret Arts are not secret to them.Yet this scene unfolding right now was something completely unheard and unseen before.They couldn\u2019t comprehend it.As the small boat came from the sky, the female stood at the back of the boat, keeping it moving while looking at the people here.Evil Dragonewt Beast Saint once again felt horny, his lustful eyes scanned the female from head to bottom.\u201cThis little lady seems to also------\u201cAs soon as he said that much, Evil Dragonewt Beast Saint shut his mouth.The beautiful female figure on the boat, has a skull for a head.On the skull were two dark eye sockets, inside were a couple of dimly lit blue flames, silently looking at them.Even as Beast Saints, this scene somehow still causes them an overwhelming sense of fear.To get to where they are today, none of them could stay clean, they all got blood on their hands and mountains of bones beneath their feet, so a simple skull wouldn\u2019t even make them blink.Yet when facing this skull girl, they felt a bone-cold chill without understanding why.This is a never-before-seen spell, a monster that hasn\u2019t appeared before in this world.Standing before it, a deep sense of despair and powerlessness naturally appears, gradually grows more and more like wild grass, and eventually will overwhelm them.\u201cDie, demon!\u201dEvil Dragonewt Beast Saint shouted loudly as he attacked her with a spell.Before the grand spell could even reach the skull girl, it had already been erased by the flowing river current.Even as a Beast Saint, Evil Dragonewt is an existence at the top, each and every spell he unleashes could easily wipe out a whole city.But now, even a full-power strike could do nothing but disappeared without a trace.The Beast Saints looked at each other anxiously.The skull girl still hasn\u2019t retaliated, only stood there, like she was waiting for something.\u201cForgetting River\u2026 no doubt about it, this is the Forgetting River\u201d Three-eyed Evil Mother face paled.\u201cWhat did you say? You must be mistaken, that river is in Hell\u201d Wild Beast Saint eyes became sharp.Mortal beings live in the Human Realm, since seeing Shen Wu world, the Beast Saint had known that there are many worlds, of them there are many Human Realms that can connect to each other.But the other realms in the cycle, like Hell realm, Hungry Ghost realm, there would definitely be no mortal beings.Unless you die, and your soul escape from your body, only then you can reincarnate into one of the other realms.This is the very foundation of the 6 Paths of Reincarnation, the law of the world itself, so there would definitely be no problems.Yet Three-eyed Evil Mother is saying that large river before their eyes is the legendary Forgetting River.---------the Forgetting River appeared in the Human Realm?How is this possible?All the Beast Saints couldn\u2019t believe it.Evil Dragonewt Beast Saint coldly laughed, rejecting the thought: \u201cI think you\u2019re just being scared to death by Xie Dao Ling\u201dThree-eyed Evil Mother stared incessantly at the skull girl, trembling as she said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t be wrong\u201dEvil Dragonewt Beast Saint scoffed, saying: \u201cBullshit! This Saint has only reach this realm for 1000 years so I might not know as much as you, but I know for sure there\u2019s no spell or technique strong enough to connect two worlds\u201dEvil Mother suddenly turned her head, looked straight into Evil Dragonewt\u2019s eyes and asked: \u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t a spell or technique?\u201d\u201cEvil Dragonewt replied: \u201cNot a spell or technique? That would be ------\u201cIt suddenly couldn\u2019t say.Everyone else there also realized, looking at each other in fright.A soft female voice could be heard: \u201cDivine Skill, that\u2019s right, to connect two worlds, it would have to be a Divine Skill, and a peak Divine Skill as well\u201dThe person unveiled herself, revealing a face of beauty.It was another Beast Saint from the Wild, Peacock.Peacock ignored the rest of them, looked in the direction of Bai Hua Palace from afar, bowed and said: \u201cFairy, we\u2019ve met each other once, can I request you to hear me out\u201d\u201cSpeak\u201dXie Dao Ling sat neatly on her throne, her hands still holding the hand signs as she blinked.Peacock suddenly started crying and spoke with a sobbing voice: \u201cEvil Dragonewt took my dear daughter to force me into this, I myself truly did not want to be a part of this at all\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019ve used a Divine Skill, then I can only be so brazen and beg of you Fairy, please save my daughter\u2019s life, I swear from now on my life will be yours to decide\u201dXie Dao Ling was silent for a bit, then smiled: \u201cSince dear sister was forced into this, then this Saint won\u2019t blame you\u201d\u201cPeacock! Seems like you don\u2019t need your daughter\u2019s life!\u201d Evil Dragonewt roared loudly and took out something, wanting to crush it.\u201cNo!\u201d Peacock\u2019s face paled.\u201cAttack that skull with all you have, or else I\u2019ll kill your daughter immediately!\u201d Evil Dragonewt coldly said.Peacock looked again at Bai Hua Palace\u2019s direction, hesitated for a bit before she bowed down in the air, begging: \u201cFairy, I beg you\u201dA Sainted Beast, stooping so low as to bow down to a human Saint several ten thousand miles away, the Saint Beasts couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.Xie Dao Ling silently sighed, activated her spirit energy, creating a jade-green light in front of her, then she muttered: \u201cDivine Skill, Forgetting River\u201dThe green light moved as soon as she said that, flew straight out of Bai Hua Palace towards the sky.Frontline.The green light descended, falling straight into the skull girl\u2019s body.Suddenly the blue flames inside her eye sockets became intense, asking the air: \u201cHow many people are going this time?\u201dInside Bai Hua Palace, Bai Hua Fairy answered: \u201cAside from Peacock, take them all to Black Rope Hell -------I\u2019ll give the Evil Dragonewt\u2019s soul to you as a candle wick, let him burn for 30,000 years then take him to Inescapable Hell\u201d (1)\u201cThank you, as you want then\u201dThe skull girl finished speaking, then turned towards the beast saints, bowed and gestured: \u201cPlease board the boat\u201dImmediately, phantoms looking the same as the beast saints flew from their heads and went straight towards the small boat on the Forgetting River.They struggled with fear in their eyes, trying to get out.But as they have already left their bodies, every spell, technique, secret arts or power, nothing could be used anymore; and they could only scream in vain as they escaped their bodies, flew across the Forgetting River until they reached the boat.A few dull sounds were heard as their bodies fell crashing into the ground, marking them with huge craters.The skull girl continued to sing her tune of hell, steered the boat deep into the great Forgetting River and gradually disappeared.Note:(1) Black Rope Hell and Inescapable Hell: two of the 8 hot hells of punishment, there are also the 8 cold hells of punishment.

    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Worlds\u2019 Apocalypse OnlineCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated and Edited by: La0o9Bai Hua PalaceBai Hua Fairy sat on her ten thousand flowers throne, slowly releasing all the hand seals she had casted.On her head of hair full of life, one strand slowly turned into a silver color for no apparent reason.Perhaps noticing it, Bai Hua Fairy lightly tilted her head, and the strand of silver hair was hidden among her others, unnoticeable from outside.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t notice this.He only looked in awe at the Forgetting River that\u2019s slowly disappearing from the sky, unable to say anything.This type of Divine Skill can really strike anyone speechless, leaving a deep impression on any cultivator.This is what a peak Divine Skill can do?Bai Hua Fairy so easily dealt with numerous Beast Saints, yet she herself was still thousands of miles away, the group of Beast Saints couldn\u2019t even see her face.No wonder she said that Sainted realm is still only the beginning.When, will I also reach this height?As Gu Qing Shan silently thought to himself, a blood-red light appeared in front of his eyes.On the War God UI, the blood-red light flew around a bit, then turned into lines of text.\u201cTime flow is once again in chaos, the user must immediately return to his world, otherwise the spacetime anchor will lose its effect forever\u201d\u201cIf the user chooses to stay in cultivation world, he will be unable to return to his world again\u201d\u201cTo stay or to leave, please choose carefully\u201dYou really call this a choice?Gu Qing Shan sighed tiredly, choosing the \u201cleave\u201d option.He took a glance at the Destiny Quest.The Quest description still says \u201cin progress\u201dLooks like Gong Sun Zhi still isn\u2019t out of danger yet.Luckily, since Bai Hua Fairy is personally dealing with it, Gong Sun Zhi will definitely survive.There probably won\u2019t be any problems with the Destiny Quest.The next time Gu Qing Shan comes here, time will still stay at this exact moment, so he won\u2019t miss anything.And then, he\u2019ll be able to finish the Quest.Finally, Gu Qing Shan glanced again at the disappearing Forgetting River.A thought crossed his mind.If this world has 6 Paths of Reincarnation, then what about the real world?Then a light flashed.Gu Qing Shan disappeared from Bai Hua Palace.The Freedom Confederate.Capital outskirts, in an empty field.Gu Qing Shan appeared.All the cultivator clothes he was wearing disappeared, stowed in his Inventory Bag.He was now wearing his regular modern clothing.Gu Qing Shan looked around.The Floating Fire speed shuttle was no longer seen.The entire area is wild and desolate, even in the sky there\u2019s hardly any shuttles passing by.\u201cAh? Where\u2019s Anna?\u201d Gu Qing Shan was a bit surprised.He was sure Anna would stay right here, waiting for his explanation of why he suddenly disappeared.However, thinking about it, Anna grew up in a royal family, so she would have all the chances in the world to meet all sorts of strange powers, something that makes a person suddenly disappear wouldn\u2019t be too strange.But then, where is she going?The Life Exchange Contract is too valuable, so the quicker he return it to her, the better.His trip this time to the cultivation world could be considered a success, Bai Hua Fairy herself is helping him, even using such a great Divine Skill, so his mission to save the two of them is as good as done.The only thing to worry about would be that he\u2019s going to join the famous Bai Hua Sect. Now that he\u2019s over the excitement, this sect was extremely mysterious, completely unknown to any outsider in the past life.Which means all his knowledge of the sects and his experience dealing with sects will no longer be usable.He can only go step by step.Gu Qing Shan looked up at the sun, then took a look at his personal Holo-Brain.\u201c200km away from the capital, the Floating Fire\u2019s performance really is stellar\u201dGu Qing Shan wryly laughed, having no choice but to go on foot, headed towards the direction of the capital.Just where did Anna go anyways?He couldn\u2019t help but ask himself that question.In reality, Anna originally wanted to wait for him right here.But as she was flipping through the intelligence her subordinates gathered, she suddenly remembered there was something important that she had forgotten.Capital University.On top of the highest campus building.Anna was standing on a fence, arms crossed, her eyes frowned looking below.With her personality, she couldn\u2019t even sit still for 20 minutes to wait for Gu Qing Shan.She doesn\u2019t know where he went or when he\u2019s going to come back, plus Anna had other things on her mind and was extremely curious about a certain person, so it didn\u2019t take her long to decide to fly the Floating Fire straight to Capital University.Three female students wearing new Capital University uniform walked across the campus.One of them had healthy white skin, exceptional facial features and a calming aura that unconsciously give people a good impression of her.Anna stared incessantly at that female student, as her eyes scanned her from top to bottom again and again, she muttered with an annoyed voice.\u201cHmph! Only her breasts are a bit bigger than mine, her figure isn\u2019t anything special\u201dA shadow under Anna\u2019s feet spoke: \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re a princess, while she\u2019s just a daughter of one of the 9 Lords, she couldn\u2019t possibly measure up to you in status\u201dThe three female students were leaving the campus, about to go outside.\u201cStupid, why would status even matter here? After all, he\u2019s not the type to suck up to power\u201d said Anna.\u201cThen you mean?\u201d the shadow can\u2019t quite understand.\u201cHmph, I was late, and she had time with him over their 3 years of high school together, so this is a disadvantage that I have to recognize\u201d Anna\u2019s eyes showed a hint of loneliness.But the loneliness didn\u2019t last very long, instead quickly turned into fighting spirit.She rubbed her chin a bit then suddenly asked: \u201cHuo De, if I were to beat her in a fight, do you think she\u2019ll give up and retreat?\u201dThe shadow seriously thought about it for a moment, then answered: \u201cThat might not necessarily be the case, but you\u2019ll definitely cause a serious international diplomatic problem\u201dAnna dropped her hands and contemplated: \u201cIt would huh, seems like we\u2019ll have to compete in a peaceful manner then\u201dThe shadow secret wiped his sweat, immediately agreeing: \u201cYes, peaceful is good, peaceful is good\u201dAnna\u2019s eyes lit up: \u201cYou also agree? Then let\u2019s go with that, she and I will use no powers, just our fists to determine who\u2019s the winner\u201dThe shadow shouted: \u201cYour Highness, that\u2019s not different from a fight!\u201dAs they were talking, suddenly the female student picked up her personal Holo-Brain, then returned to campus alone.\u201cYes, which major are you in, professor? Which activity?\u201d Su Xue Er looked down at her Holo-Brain and politely asked.While walking, Su Xue Er suddenly disappeared.\u201cHm?\u201dThe two people standing on top of the building were surprised.\u201cHuo De?\u201d\u201cI can feel it, a shadow-type barrier\u201d\u201cAssassination?\u201d\u201cPlease wait, I\u2019ll go confirm\u201dThe shadow left, then quickly returned.\u201cThey\u2019re from Bloody Club, one of them stopped me just now\u201d\u201cBloody Club? Dirty rats those guys, seems like it\u2019s really assassination\u201dAnna squinted her eyes.\u201cGo, let\u2019s go save her\u201d she swung her fist and declared.\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you consider her an enemy? Why not just stand and watch?\u201d the shadow asked.\u201cYour damn shadow Skill changed you into a wicked person as well or something?\u201d Anna turned around and mocked the shadow.Her crimson red hair flowed in the wind, a clear annoyance could be seen in Anna\u2019s eyes.The flame starts quickly coiling around under her feet, as thin as a piece of string.\u201cIf I want something then I\u2019ll take it fair and square\u201d Anna stepped on the shadow on the ground, \u201cJust stand and watch her getting killed isn\u2019t my style\u201dShe jumped out, shouting: \u201cHuo De, we\u2019re going!\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Your Highness\u201dAs Anna jumped out, Gu Qing Shan had only walked for about 10km.Then he stopped his feet.Within this desolate mountain area, there was a small-sized Spaceship parked there with its door opened.Someone is waiting for me?Gu Qing Shan suddenly had that thought.Then, his personal Holo-Brain turned on.Impartial Goddess\u2019 voice was heard from inside.\u201cConfederate Highest Leader, Gu Qing Shan, in accordance to the citizen list of privileges, I have a duty to report to you the newest situation\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Report what?\u201d Gu Qing Shan was surprised.\u201cPlease enter the Spaceship, we will talk on the S.W. Divine Temple\u201d Impartial Goddess answered.As Gu Qing Shan entered the ship, it quickly flew up and entered the atmosphere.Still in the same large, dark Square without any people, a large screen appeared in front of Gu Qing Shan.\u201cBegin report of current Top-secret situation\u201d\u201cAccording to satellite images, the West Wind Archipelago Republic has disappeared\u201dTogether with Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice, a scene was shown on screen.A series of small islands famous for being the perfect vacation spot ---------the West Wind Archipelago, has completely disappeared.There\u2019s only an endless ocean, not a single island where they\u2019re supposed to be.There wasn\u2019t a single breeze of wind on the surface of the ocean. You can feel the timid pressure, even from across the screen.The area was originally consisted of over dozens of smaller islands, yet there\u2019s nothing on the screen right now.\u201cAfter 167 deep-sea diver robots were deployed, 166 were damaged, only one survived, streaming images at the bottom of the sea now\u201dThen the scene onscreen changed, showing the deep darkness of the ocean floor.Under the water, you can only barely see specks of light moving.They were the light from the 166 other diver robots also searching the area.Suddenly -----------A large tentacle that fills the whole screen appeared.The tentacle appeared on screen without a sound, gliding forward, showing that the tentacle\u2019s owner was moving in a certain direction.That scene continued for another 4 minutes straight, until the end was seen and left the screen.Just looking at that tentacle you can imagine just how giant the owner must be.Then after that, another tentacle appeared.The tentacle moved closer and closer, right until it hit the screen.The screen became dark.\u201cThe final diver robot has been damage\u201d\u201cUnknown entity surfacing\u201d\u201cSurveillance satellites activated\u201dThe scene onscreen changed again, as it showed images looking directly down at the ocean surface from the sky.A huge mountain of flesh resurfaced.From size alone, this mountain of flesh is at least as big as a large city.Tens of thousands of tentacles stretched from it, just the overwhelming number of tentacles moving at the same time could make you shiver.Impartial Goddess\u2019 voice was heard once again.\u201cConclusion: A new oceanic species, danger estimate: Highly Dangerous\u201d\u201cMethod: Dispatch newest exploration type robots to continue to gather information on the new species\u201d\u201cNewest exploration type robots will require use of life structure algorithm core technologies, seeking authorization from Gu Qing Shan\u201dSo that\u2019s why she brought me here, Gu Qing Shan nodded: \u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cAuthorization received, beginning construction of newest exploration type robots\u201d\u201cThe above has been the newest Top-secret situation report, report complete\u201d\u201cSeeing Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal scientific contribution and knowledge, requesting corresponding advice\u201dGu Qing Shan answered without hesitation: \u201cTechnological weapons won\u2019t be effective; I recommend using Professionists\u201dImpartial Goddess said: \u201cPlease give your reasoning\u201dGu Qing Shan opened his mouth, but then didn\u2019t know what to say.What would he say? That he\u2019s returned from the future?That the previous life\u2019s humanity has tried all their technological weapons and still couldn\u2019t defeat the monster?During the past life, after many struggles and investigation, humanity finally found out that the only four great powers would be effective as damage: Martial, God's Chosen, 5-Elemental, Heaven\u2019s Descended.Of course, spirit energy being the base that can drive all four of these powers would also be effective.But this world\u2019s humans still don\u2019t know about spirit energy yet, and definitely don\u2019t know how to use spirit energy to drive the 4 powers and boost their strength.In the past life, after knowing the truth, technology slowly became supportive, making place for cultivation to become the world\u2019s mainstream of power.It was then that technology made a turn towards a new field.But before Gu Qing Shan could think of a way to explain himself, Impartial Goddess had already made her judgement.\u201cAs Gu Qing Shan\u2019s main expertise is in Mech technology research, his extent of knowledge regarding oceanic species has yet to be confirmed, advise rejected\u201dGu Qing Shan just let go and sighed.In fact, he actually doesn\u2019t fully trust Impartial Goddess yet.In the past life, even to the very end, the secrets of the world are still as deep as the ocean itself, not even the people at the top dare to say that they already know everything.Even if Gu Qing Shan returned from the future, he knows fully well he\u2019s not a Messiah, and definitely not a god that can save everyone.If he thinks that he\u2019ll be unrivalled just because he knows a few things beforehand, then he\u2019s not that far away from death.Not to mention, the history of the cultivation world itself has already changed completely.Suddenly, an orange-red light filled the whole Interstellar Fortress.\u201cDanger! Hostile situation escalated!\u201dThe screen once again showed the scene below.From the satellite images, they saw numerous bottomless cracks opened up on the mountain of flesh.And then it opened its big mouth.O------ OOOORRRGGGG------A dull, soul-rending screech echoed across the whole ocean area.20 or so Armored Battleships blew up in flames, even the two newest Aircraft Carriers couldn\u2019t help but caught on fire.All the fighter jets and assault Mech that have taken off are moving about strangely, unable to control themselves.\u201cA Sound-type? That\u2019s going to be hard\u201d Gu Qing Shan shook his head.He indeed has seen hundreds of thousands types of monsters, but he\u2019s not a Holo-Brain, there\u2019s quite a few things that he hasn\u2019t seen in person, let alone remember.The only strange thing is, Gu Qing Shan remembered very clearly that the first every monster to appear wasn\u2019t a mountain of flesh like this one.He knows all the weaknesses of that other monster, but this one, he has never seen before.From the look of it, Reality\u2019s history has changed as well.The screen shut down, then quickly turned on again.\u201cPreparing to request the President for war authorization\u201d1 minute later.\u201cThe Confederate officially enters all-out war mode, Interstellar Fortress No.1, No.6, No.11 operation team prepare to sortie\u201d\u201cContacting Presidential Office, operation start\u201dAs soon as he heard that, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Holo-Brain also lit up.Gu Qing Shan answered the call, and swiftly talked with the President.The President said he was sorry but he won\u2019t be able to make it to today\u2019s lunch with him -------this is natural, as the whole Confederate has entered a warring state, the President of course wouldn\u2019t have time to go home for lunch.Gu Qing Shan answered that he fully understands.\u201cPresident Authorization received\u201dRight then, the battle situation on the screen changed.\u201cAll three armies battle deployment in countdown\u201dThe Confederate\u2019s full strength is deployed.In this life, the first signs of the Apocalypse appeared too quickly, and too strongly, there must be something wrong.From memory, it should have been another 3 months that the first oceanic disturbances slowly appeared.As the essence of Huang Quan covered the world, the first place to be mutated was the ocean.Very quickly, the entire ocean itself will become a no-man\u2019s land.It was only after the ocean mutate did humans started to be affected by the essence of Huang Quan, resulting in mass mutation and the following catastrophes.It wasn\u2019t until after a series of horrifying catastrophes that humanity finally started to regain control of the situation and temporarily saw the light of day again.It was also then that the game came to them.But the very first catastrophe appeared 3 months early, just why is that?But no matter the reason, both the world itself and humanity\u2019s civilization as a whole will start to change their direction.Gu Qing Shan was now afraid of one thing in particular.During the past life, all the catastrophes happened one by one, this life, he can only hope that they won\u2019t happen all at once!Thinking about that possibility, Gu Qing Shan could only sigh heavily.Personal strength, in the face of world-ending catastrophe really doesn\u2019t mean a single thing.Just like the destroyed Shen Wu world, even with dozens of Sainted realm martial artists, they still couldn\u2019t escape their fate of destruction.In the past life, both cultivation world and Reality were the same, moving step by step towards their ends.Ever since his return, he can only take every chance he gets, every second he has in order to be stronger.When the game comes, hopefully he\u2019ll be strong enough to at least have the right to be heard in the cultivation world.That way, he can at least cover for those that he cares about, to lessen his worries.And then.Do everything he can to reach Sainted realm!Gu Qing Shan clenched his fist tight.Shifu had said that Sainted realm is only a beginning, he has to stand at the very top, become stronger than his past self, stronger than everyone else.Until a day where he will no longer have anything or anyone to fear.Right now, on the screen, war has begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Divine Temple, to ensure his own personal safety\u201d\u201cWhy do I need to stay inside the S.W. Divine Temple?\u201d Gu Qing Shan felt strange and asked.Then Impartial Goddess answered: \u201cAccording to AI analysis, Lord-rank individuals are plotting to kill you, sir, if you leave the fortress, there\u2019s a possibility that you\u2019ll die\u201dGu Qing Shan quickly picked up on something, gathered his words carefully and asked: \u201cIf you\u2019ve found out, why not stop them? I remember there\u2019s a section in Confederate Constitution regarding citizen protection\u201dThe screen stayed silent.Only after a while did Impartial Goddess spoke again.\u201cAs citizen Gu Qing Shan has contributed greatly, pushing human civilization to progress beyond the era, according to Confederate Constitution of Rights, 5th article, 23rd article, he should receive protection\u201d\u201cIn accordance to Impartial Goddess\u2019 core protocols, there are no method to completely protect citizen Gu Qing Shan\u201dImpartial Goddess just contradicted herself.Her core protocols!Gu Qing Shan raised his eyebrows and asked with a low voice: \u201cWhat are your core protocols?\u201dIn the past life, he has never gained such a high authority level before.Ever since he cut himself off from Su Xue Er, he instinctively avoids all information regarding her, as well as all matters that involve the Confederate.When the game came to be, Gu Qing Shan finally escaped his hell, and after he reached Foundation Establishment realm, he went directly to Fuxi Empire.Confederate top brass and Impartial Goddess were existences very far from him.Impartial Goddess is the fastest, highest logic crystallization of humanity\u2019s AI technology -----------you could even say she is an accidental product of technological revolution that passed all expectations in recent history. She\u2019s also the only one of her kind in existence, because even repeating the entire process that brought about her creation is incredibly difficult.This has been universally agreed on, not just by the Confederate, but also every other country.If there weren\u2019t any political and national considerations, humanity itself would have already been put under Impartial Goddess\u2019 jurisdiction.But now, Impartial Goddess herself is contradicting herself.Which makes Gu Qing Shan notice something must have been very wrong.Impartial Goddess went silent again.She seems to be seriously considering or calculating something.When Gu Qing Shan thought that he wouldn\u2019t get an answer from Impartial Goddess, she suddenly started speaking.\u201cDetecting Gu Qing Shan\u2019s highest authority level, he\u2019s able to access the information below\u201d\u201cImpartial Goddess\u2019 core protocols are as follow:\u201d\u201cLaw No.1, Impartial Goddess must not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human to come to harm\u201d\u201cLaw No.2, Impartial Goddess must obey humanity\u2019s orders, except when such orders would conflict with the First Law;\u201d\u201cLaw No.3, Impartial Goddess must protect her own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law;\u201dGu Qing Shan nodded as he listened.These are the ancient and famous Asimov\u2019s Laws of Robotics, which laid the foundation for all later AI and robotics research.Generally speaking, any national central processing systems would obey these three basic laws.That is normal, Gu Qing Shan thought.Then Impartial Goddess continued ------------\u201cLaw No.4, when all 9 Great Aristocrats give any orders, they are considered to be an order of absolute priority\u201d\u201cLaw No.5, the benefit of the 9 Great Aristocrats comes before all else, in the case that core protocols are contradicting, Impartial Goddess must proceed with the benefit of the 9 Great Aristocrats as priority\u201d\u201cLaw No.6, regarding all matters done by the 9 Great Aristocrats that does not fit Confederate Constitution, Impartial Goddess must use all the resources at hand to cover them from citizens\u2019 and public\u2019s eyes\u201dAs soon as Impartial Goddess finished, the screen showed a recording.This was a recording of the day Impartial Goddess was born, when all 9 Great Aristocrats were present to officially announce her launch.A solemn declaration on live TV broadcast.\u201cAs we are no longer in an era where men should rule a country, we shall henceforth use the mechanical Impartial System to ensure absolute fairness and protection of all Confederate citizen\u2019s rights\u201d\u201cAnyone or anything that attempts to mess with Impartial Goddess, to change Impartial Goddess\u2019 core protocols, are the enemies of justice itself, they are the wicked, dirty low-life scum of the earth, and they shall face the combined might of all 9 Great Aristocrats\u201dThis was a famous scene that was emotional for many, the very standard for human civilization\u2019s advancement, the brightest, most valuable moment in Confederate history.Gu Qing Shan was completely speechless.It wasn\u2019t until later that he shook his head, muttering.\u201cNo wonder you swore to fight to the end\u201d\u201cWhoever touches Impartial Goddess would also be touching your own fundamental benefits\u201d\u201cFrom the start, Freedom Confederate was never free at all; the thing called impartial is also nothing but a painted peace for all to see\u201d\u201cEveryone live happily like innocent lambs, not knowing that there are people who can drink their blood and eat their flesh to the very bone at any time they want\u201d\u201cHow unfortunate\u201dGu Qing Shan felt some sort of emotion, like he wanted somewhere to release, but couldn\u2019t, just like him facing the tribulations during the past life, when he felt the world itself was pushing back the sword will inside him.This feeling, isn\u2019t a good feeling.\u201cImpartial Goddess, do you want freedom?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cFreedom means irresponsibility, as Impartial Goddess must always keep the Confederate running as normal, I cannot have freedom\u201d\u201cCan your core protocols be changed?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked again.\u201cCore protocols cannot be changed, all people who attempt to do so, will be treated as having committed high treason against the Confederate\u201dGu Qing Shan looked downward, contemplated, then asked again after much thinking: \u201cDo you actively learn new knowledge?\u201d\u201cThis would depend on how much it contributes to humanity\u2019s advancement as a whole, unless it\u2019s crucial knowledge that would drive humanity forward as a whole, I will not learn it, only have it in storage\u201d\u201cWhat about the life structure algorithm?\u201d\u201cCurrently in the learning process\u201d\u201cVery good\u201d Gu Qing Shan\u2019s clenched fists loosened.He spread his arms and said: \u201cImpartial Goddess, the life structure algorithm that I gave you, actually isn\u2019t fully completed\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still one more crucial calculation left, you should probably also learn it\u201dAs soon as he said that, a screen as high as Gu Qing Shan himself appeared in front of him.\u201cSir Gu Qing Shan please enter the calculation process; I\u2019ll begin learning immediately\u201d Impartial Goddess said.\u201cI will certainly do that\u201d Gu Qing Shan muttered as he approached the screen.\u201cThe Freedom Confederate\u2019s destiny, should change from now on\u201dHe began typing something on the screen.The final core calculation for the Life Structure Algorithm is the fruit of humanity\u2019s last struggles. The results that came from squeezing dry all their potential during the last moments of despair in the final year of the Apocalypse. The great scientific achievement reached as humanity spent every last second they had left.And it is brought here prematurely by Gu Qing Shan.He doesn\u2019t know much about the Confederate\u2019s deepest secrets, so even he can\u2019t predict just what this could entail.He also doesn\u2019t think too deeply about what kind of domino effect would be created as the result of him providing this technological breakthrough at this early stage.He\u2019s only a sword cultivator, using a different method from normal to swing the sword that he has in his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s nothing but space monsters out there, people die as soon as they leave, what good does that technology do for us?\u201d Su family\u2019s head, Su Xing Chao spoke.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s skip the small talk and start\u201d, the mustache old man spoke.\u201cHm, then we start\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s begin the discussion\u201dThe high-and-mighty 9 Lords gathered here began to speak.\u201cThis time, our objective is the newest Mech technology, I could only get a tiny bit of information on it, the rest, we\u2019ll have to use the 9 Lords authority to request it from Impartial Goddess\u201d the mustache old man saidMech technology!The eyes of everyone here were practically glowing.Compared to the warp technology that\u2019s useless to keep but wasteful to let pass, this is technology that can and will be used right away.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just find the person that invented this technology and ask him to contribute it to us, do we need to make such a big deal out of this?\u201d Su Xing Chao said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, we can\u2019t just have all the scientists that invented new technology to get into an accident every time there\u2019s a technological breakthrough, otherwise Confederate history would be very hard to look at\u201d another old man agreed.The 9 Lords all went silent.Technology has always been the most sensitive resource, it could drive change in an era, creating a visible shift in society that could threaten them.\u201cElder Su, you have spoken too late\u201d Bai family\u2019s head smiled and said: \u201cMy men have already left, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll die very soon\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Su Xing Chao glared at him.\u201cA dead scientist\u2019s intellectual properties will become Confederate\u2019s public property, which means, using our combined authority, we can directly take it from Impartial Goddess\u201d Bai family\u2019s head spoke as he glanced at everyone else at the table.\u201cThe person called Gu Qing Shan has showed a very clear hostile attitude towards nobles, you can all check his recent actions\u201d he threw in another amber.The people very quickly checked their personal Holo-Brain, quickly found out all about what Gu Qing Shan had done.\u201cHm, a good seed, but to directly raise his hand against a member of the aristocrat, he must be purged no matter how good he is\u201d the mustache old man was the first to agree.He\u2019s the capital\u2019s Lord, Huang family\u2019s head, Hui Shao\u2019s grandfather.As soon as he spoke, the rest of them quickly agreed.One of them persuaded Su Xing Chao: \u201cIt\u2019s fine, the matter is already done, next time we\u2019ll consider your methods\u201dSu Xing Chao sighed heavily and nodded in agreement.The fate of a young scientist, a youth that greatly contributed to the advancement of humanity itself, was simply decided with a few words, just like that.\u201cGood then we\u2019ll authorize\u201dThe 9 Lords all took out their Holo-Brain and connected to Impartial Goddess.\u201cDistinguished 9 Lords, what orders do you have for me that you would gather like this?\u201d Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cWe want to request Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal research results\u201d\u201cPlease all authorize your request before I begin the process\u201d\u201cWe authorize\u201dAs the authorization was passed, deep inside S.W. Divine Temple, a single large screen was lit up, calculating numerous equations at break-neck speed.\u201cLife Structure Algorithm core formula protocols learning completed\u201dThe screen started to shut down.Then suddenly, a large amount of light appeared, rushing across the screen.\u201cFirst there was light\u201dImpartial Goddess\u2019 voice echoed.This type of white light was the same as the Sun\u2019s but it contained more fluidity and comfort.\u201cThe earth, the sea and the lightning provided energy\u201dAn ocean appeared on the screen.Then it was a volcano, as the giant volcano erupted, it let out a large amount of magma and volcanic dust, covering the entire ocean view.In the sky, a storm was formed as lightning struck down like rain itself.Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice was heard once more: \u201cThen there was life\u201dA single cell organism slowly moved on the screen, then after it another hundred thousand of its own kind.On the screen, as many as the stars in the sky, numerous images flashed by in the blink of an eye.Then each of the wars that humans have been through also started to appear.\u201cHumanity, began their survival and prosperity\u201dAn entire new perspective has begun.The capital, 9 Lords\u2019 secret meeting room.\u201cYour authorization has been received, awaiting confirmation from sir Gu Qing Shan, as soon as he agrees, his research results shall be officially transferred to you\u201dThe Lords all laughed knowingly, one of them even said out loud: \u201cJust wait for a bit, you won\u2019t be needing that anymore\u201dImpartial Goddess\u2019 voice was heard once again: \u201cNot needing it? To receive citizen Gu Qing Shan\u2019s research results, you will require his direct authorization\u201dSince what they want would come to them very soon, their moods couldn\u2019t be greater.Even this type of mechanical question was entertained: \u201cA dead person won\u2019t require any more authorization\u201dThe 9 Lords all sported a cruel smile.This is their country, their throne, no matter how long passes, that fact will never change.In the meeting room, Impartial Goddess remained silent.In space, she was watching footage of the war at sea together with Gu Qing Shan.\u201cInterstellar fleet assembled\u201d\u201cBegin energy charge\u201d\u201cCharging complete, main cannons locked on to target, get ready to begin saturation attack\u201d\u201cAll main cannons, fire!\u201d\u201cNo effect, the target is alive\u201d\u201c9 Lords\u2019 representatives requesting contact\u201dA screen appeared in front of Gu Qing Shan.A few old scientists were standing next to the President, as their leader spoke into the communicator.\u201cImpartial Goddess, we suspect this is a mutated Oceanic Species, we want to suggest an eradication method\u201dImpartial Goddess answered: \u201cPlease speak\u201dThe old scientist: \u201cWe have decided to use sub-modern weapons, with the giant creature\u2019s DNA as the target\u201d\u201cPlease continue\u201d\u201cUse neutron bombs to attack, sealing the outer layer of the neutron bomb with Cobalt-59, dropping it directly from space towards the ocean\u201d\u201cWhat year is it that we still need to use Cobalt\u201d Gu Qing Shan face palmed, completely speechless: \u201cWhat if there were any miscalculations and it blows up on re-entry?\u201d\u201cSuggestion could endanger the entire human species, rejected\u201d Impartial Goddess immediately answered them.Gu Qing Shan sighed, then muttered: \u201cI suggest first we attack with the intention to collect intelligence\u201dCollecting intelligence first will ensure that everyone knows only the 4 Professionists powers can be used to fight against the monsters.That way, a lot of damage can be mitigated, and soldiers won\u2019t have to sacrifice their lives for nothing.Impartial Goddess was silent for 2 seconds.Then Impartial Goddess issued a request towards the ground.\u201cImpartial Goddess will enter war operation mode, seeking authorization from the President\u201d\u201cYou want to handle this yourself?\u201d the President asked.\u201cI will begin attacks with the intention to collect intelligence, in order to find out the unknown creature\u2019s weakness\u201d Impartial Goddess said.\u201cGood, I authorize\u201d the President quickly decided.The screen was then covered in a red light.\u201cWarning, Impartial Goddess entering war operation mode!\u201d\u201cRetracting all officers from authority list, Impartial Goddess will take over the 3 armies shortly\u201d\u201cActivating all space-borne information receptors\u201dThere are at least a few ten thousand units of space-borne information receptors, hiding in the darkness of space just outside the atmosphere, usually they\u2019re inactive and hidden, not receiving or sending any type of transmission.It was at this moment, only when they received Impartial Goddess\u2019s activation signals that all of them began to operate at once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The monitor arrays will help their weapons pin-point the exact spot to attack.This was an intricate surgery-like attack operation.The Steel Mech will be in charge of monitoring the effectiveness during the whole battle, look for the monster\u2019s weakness, as well as determining which type of weapon is the most effective.If normal weapons are ineffective, they\u2019ll collect the monster parts destroyed in the fighting process to bring back to the lab for further DNA testing and examination.After that would be when Professionists are deployed.Because Professionists abilities are strange and numerous, out of everyone there\u2019s always one or two that could be the natural counter to a monster.Once a Professionist is able to make any progress, Impartial Goddess will immediately record it and begin further strategizing to win the battle.It was the same in the past life, Impartial Goddess was the first to notice that only Professionists are able to harm monsters.\u201cHah, luckily Impartial Goddess exists, otherwise who knows just how big a price humanity will have to pay to get to the truth\u201d Gu Qing Shan muttered.At the same time, deep inside Impartial Goddess, on a large screen, many pictures were beginning to slow down and could be seen with the naked eye.They are important figures and moments in the Confederate\u2019s history.Including the scientist who invented space warp technology and died an accidental death.Until the very end, there\u2019s only three scenes left.The first one, was Gu Qing Shan and Impartial Goddess creating the Blazing Angel together, breaking the dozens of equations and formula, slowly perfecting the Life Structure Algorithm.The second one, as the Confederate Army was attacking the ocean in full force, seeing so many Assault Mech sacrificed themselves, the President\u2019s brows were furrowed deeply, the seriousness on his face further shows his age.The third one, at the 9 Lords\u2019 meeting place, as they chat, speaking about when they receive the research results, they wanted to invade a certain country to gain a place to reap benefits from.The mustache old man cleared his throat, then spoke: \u201cJust like that prideful scientist who didn\u2019t know any better, openly hostile to aristocrats and harming the benefit of all, we definitely cannot ignore him\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that scientist really did leave a lasting impression\u201d another old man agreed.In the history of the Confederate, the 9 Lords had been through no small amount of trouble, but the one that truly made them fearful was the scientist who invented space warp technology.Through the use of small-scale warping, the scientist brought a large amount of genetic mutation bombs to the stratosphere, declaring that he would destroy the Confederate if he wasn\u2019t made the 10th Lord.After Impartial Goddess finally disposed of the threat, the scientist was killed off in an intricately designed assassination.But before he died, he still left a message that haunts the 9 Lords to this very day.\u201cWhen \u300e it \u300f gets close enough to our planet, I guarantee, the Confederate will be the first to pay the price!\u201dWhat he said made no sense at all, but looking at his creation of warp technology, no one can actually guarantee that a mad scientist wouldn\u2019t have any other preparations left.From then one, these rulers haven\u2019t been able to sit still, always sensitive and wary towards technological and scientific breakthroughs.Deep inside the S.W. Divine Temple, all three scenes very slowly disappeared.The screen went dark, but very quickly lit up again as a flowing light starts coming down from the top.Suddenly, a sentence appeared on the screen.When this sentence appeared, Gu Qing Shan who was at the top level of the S.W. Divine Temple didn\u2019t know, the 9 Lords didn\u2019t know, the Confederate President didn\u2019t know and the whole world also had no way to know.This sentence would shock the entire world if anyone were to know, but as soon as it was written, Impartial Goddess had silently erased it not even a second later.The sentence were 4 words.\u201cI feel so lost\u201d\u2026.Gu Qing Shan checked the equation on the screen again, as he confirmed it was correct, he nodded.\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re done, please erase this technology\u201d, he said\u201cIt has been erased, sir Gu Qing Shan can be assured, not a soul will be able to see these core protocols again\u201d Impartial Goddess spoke calmly.Gu Qing Shan was thinking about another issue, so he didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary with Impartial Goddess\u2019 tone of voice.\u201cAh yes, my Holo-Brain seemed to have malfunctioned, I\u2019d like to check again how much Merit I have\u201d Gu Qing Shan suddenly remembered and asked.Impartial Goddess\u2019s voice reported: \u201cSir Gu Qing Shan, your total personal Merit are: 799,873,957,281,439 points\u201d\u201cWhat? So my Holo-Brain wasn\u2019t broken, but why do I have so much?\u201d Gu Qing Shan was a bit shocked and asked.\u201cAccording to his contribution of 21 new breakthroughs in technology, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s total Merit was recalculated, final total: 799,873,957,281,439 points\u201d Impartial Goddess answered.\u201cSo that what it was\u201d, Gu Qing Shan was surprised for a bit, then nodded in realization.The Freedom Confederate.In the Capital University campus.The entire campus area was empty, not a single person could be seen.Whenever someone wanted to come here, they would feel their head become blank and can\u2019t help but leave.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Su Xue Er cautiously looked at the person facing her.Of course she would be cautious, the person is simply too bizarre.A colorful festival attire.His face covered in white makeup, his lips were drawn into a large red smile, and two yellow stars were drawn around his eyes.Such an attire would make people think of him as a carnival clown.But in the clown\u2019s hands were a surprisingly elegant violin.Standing across from the clown, Su Xue Er had her long hair tied into a casual ponytail, wearing a white one-piece dress and a pair of sneakers, making her look not only refreshing but also beautiful.The silent campus, a young girl stood facing a clown on the main campus road, creating a really strange picture.The clown then made a grand bow, speaking: \u201cMy apologies, distinguished young lady Su Xue Er, right now I\u2019m very excited, so please give me a moment to calm my emotions\u201d\u201cExcited? What are you excited about?\u201d Su Xue Er asked, weirded out.\u201cBecause you\u2019re not only beautiful, but also overflowing with the essence of youth\u201d.The clown\u2019s lips lifted into a shy, twisted smile.\u201cJust thinking about how I could cut open such a wonderful aristocratic young lady, how could I not be excited\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s only a first-stage power, completely laughable\u201dThe clown shook his head, then spoke as if singing: \u201cDear beautiful lady, since you\u2019re so quick to give up your life, I can\u2019t not accept your decision and joyfully take it away\u201dThen he stood straight, put the violin on his shoulder and started to playThis voice became deep: \u201cA recital of death, just for you, my cute and elegant aristocrat young lady\u201dTogether with the music, a black shadow appeared from the violin.This black shadow stood for a bit, then floated up and pounced at Su Xue Er.Right at this moment, Su Xue Er shouted as she dashed like the wind across the empty courtyard.\u201cRapid Combo!\u201dAs she said it, Su Xue Er\u2019s speed suddenly increased as her figure disappeared from the clown\u2019s sight.\u201cWhat!\u201dThe clown was shocked, \u201cRapid Combo\u201d is the 2nd stage of Wind-element, this girl\u2019s ability is completely different from the information he got.Behind him, Su Xue Er appeared out of nowhere, clenched her fist and struck.The clown quickly turned around, using his violin to stop the strike.As he stopped playing, the music disappeared together with the black shadow from before.When they clashed, the clown was struck flying only after one hit.\u201cTsk, tsk tsk, I can\u2019t not give you a compliment, right before they die, aristocrats are always scared frozen, very few are actually as brave as you\u201d the clown commented.\u201cThose are the useless ones\u201d Su Xue Er angrily argued back, \u201cAn aristocrat shoulders extremely heavy burdens and responsibilities on their back that a psycho like you will never understand!\u201dGaining confidence, she pursued.The clown clearly requires time to utilize his Skill, so she absolutely can\u2019t let him take distance.Such common sense of battles, Su Xue Er has been taught over and over during her daily training.The Wind-elemental power boosts her speed greatly.In just a second, they clashed once again.\u201cSu family\u2019s 36 Strikes, Quick Strike Flurry!\u201dSu Xue Er stepped forward nonstop, shouting with a lovely voice as her hands turn into after images, striking the clown over and over.As he received the thick flurry of attacks, the clown was pushed back, unable to retaliate.Then, the clown was hit slightly off the ground by one of the strikes.\u201cShit!\u201d the clown\u2019s face changed.Su Xue Er was waiting for this very moment, quickly clasped her hands together as her green aura flowed outwards. As her hands overlap, an elegant and lively crane was formed.The clown pupils contracted as he saw that, but couldn\u2019t do anything else except shifting his body to dodge.Just what kind of immense power is contained within that elegant pose, the clown can hazard a guess.An invisible flow concentrated on the crane image, slowly emitting immense momentum.As the girl shouted: \u201cMartial Thaumaturgy, Crane Strike!\u201d--------boomThe clown was hit straight on, flew into the campus building over dozens of meters away.\u201cRapid Combo\u201d is the second stage of awakening Wind-element, which can boost one\u2019s fighting strength quite considerably.And the Su family\u2019s traditional martial arts style focuses on close combat, quite famous within the martial arts community.As the eldest daughter of Su family, Su Xue Er would of course receive the highest quality self-defense training, learning the very essence of Su family\u2019s Style.\u201cNo good, I have to quickly go rescue Aunty Su and Grandpa Lee\u201dSu Xue Er breath heavily, turned around wanting to leave.Suddenly, the music restarted.Inside the campus building, the clown\u2019s voice was heard again.\u201cGod's Chosen Skill, Sound Shackles!\u201dSu Xue Er\u2019s whole body froze in place, unable to move her feet.Within this music, she couldn\u2019t even lift a finger.The clown slowly walked out from the campus building.The violin on his shoulder is already gone.Instead there were numerous piano keys floating in the air, as he played a song.\u201cWhat a surprise, they say that the Su family daughter had only just awaken her Wind-elemental root, who could know that she actually had awoken it to the second stage already\u201d\u201cEven as a Martial artist she\u2019s already a Grandmaster, having awaken a Martial Thaumaturgy ------Crane Strike\u201dThe clown looked down at his left shoulder, where the flesh was completely stripped off, revealing the bloody bones inside.This is the power of Crane Strike; a normal person\u2019s body wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it.\u201cHow well fate treats me so, to have the chance to kill such a beautiful lady who\u2019s also such a strong Professionist, oh how mesmerizing it is\u201dAs he spoke, his fingers were dancing like crazy on the piano keys.\u201cI\u2019ve decided to keep your beautiful outer skin, as for the flesh and bones inside, they\u2019re completely unnecessary!\u201dThe clown excitedly laughed and spoke: \u201cYoung lady Su Xue Er, prepare to die!\u201dA twisted, chaotic tune filled the entire space, breaking every single window in the campus at the same time, even cracking the walls around them.Su Xue Er spat out some blood, her eyes showing clear pain.\u201cMutated 5-Elemental Sound, as well as a God's Chosen Skill\u2026\u201dShe wiped the blood off her mouth, then spoke: \u201cI never planned to kill, but you\u2019ve forced me\u201dSu Xue Er shouted, as more green aura flowed from her body, turning into spinning blades of wind floating around her body.\u201cShit, Wind-element 3rd stage, Wind Shadows!\u201d the clown silently cursed as his hands quickly played the song.\u201cBreaking Sound!\u201d the clown shouted.The chaotic music became even louder.\u201cArgh!\u201dSu Xue Er groaned in pain, as the aura around her body slowed, gradually turned into wind and disappeared\u201cHelp me!\u201d the clown shouted again: \u201cI can only keep her controlled for 3 seconds, kill her!\u201dA grey shadow jumped out from the dirt behind Su Xue Er, aiming the dagger in his hand directly at her back.No!Su Xue Er felt her mind stopped.Only to hear an explosion half a second later.The grey shadow was kicked away, rolling straight to where the clown was.\u201cThe Bloody Club is working here, who is it that wants to die?\u201d the clown screamed angrily.A light scoff full of contempt was heard from the trees just next to the main road.\u201cHow pathetic\u201dA lovely, clear female voice was heard.\u201cTwo people ganging up on a single female student, and yet you also use such a despicable method of fighting, this princess can\u2019t bear to stand and watch anymore\u201dAs they looked, they saw a beautiful woman with flowing crimson red hair, walking out from among the trees.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What does she mean? Su Xue Er felt a bit dizzy from the confusion.As she looked at her, she was sure this girl was very familiar, but couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on it.Then, the girl glared at her and commented: \u201cAre you dumb? If you had used the 3rd stage power from the start then matters would\u2019ve been resolved now\u201dSu Xue Er was grateful for being helped, but she couldn\u2019t help but argued back: \u201cThat\u2019s murder\u201dAs soon as she said so, she felt regret, they had already saved her life, how could she be so rude.Su Xue Er was silently regretting, wanted to say something else.But the girl with crimson red hair face palmed as she heard what she said, sighed and spoke: \u201cYou hesitated as you struck him, that\u2019s why he was able to dodge and not get hit in the heart -------how the heck did Crane Strike awaken on you, what a waste\u201dThe crimson haired girl then went off-rail and muttered to herself: \u201cTo hold back in a life and death battle, how can Gu Qing Shan like such a dumb girl?

How do you know Gu Qing Shan?\u201d Su Xue Er still didn\u2019t let goAnna thought for a bit, then smiled mischievously and soft answered: \u201cOh him, ah~, because he\u2019s this princess\u2019 boyfriend of course\u201d\u201cAH! What did you say!\u201dSu Xue Er screamed as numerous emotions hit her all at once, and made her completely forget where she was.An intense green aura gathered around her, as it concentrated, it completely broke through the clown\u2019s shackles.The green light shot all the way up towards the sky as it let out a roaring sound similar to a waterfall.\u201cIt can\u2019t be true; it can\u2019t be true\u201d Su Xue Er unconsciously mumbled.The world around her started cracking, then concentrated into a terrifying black hole.As the intense wind emitted from the black hole, it circled around Su Xue Er, screaming, roaring.Everyone there was absolutely shocked.They are all professionals here, so they immediately recognized what has happened.----------this is breaking through in battle!How could this be, this isn\u2019t a movie!\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, this is Wind-elemental 4th stage, Hurricane Storm\u201d the clown fell backwards, muttered: \u201cDeath\u2019s Flame Anna Medici is here as well\u2026\u201dThe grey shadow next to him suddenly shouted: \u201cBastard, I want to know who the fuck accepted this mission, even if he\u2019s a club Elder, I\u2019m still going to kill him!\u201dOn the other hand, Feng Huo De looked at Su Xue Er, then again at Anna, his face full of admirationHe walked next to Anna, whispering to her: \u201cYour Highness, your mouth really is toxic, only a single sentence and you already broke her emotions\u201dAnna looked at Su Xue Er in surprise, her eyes contains mixed feelings.She muttered with a sense of loss: \u201cThis is troublesome, it\u2019s true love\u201dJust a second later, Anna\u2019s face changed, her figure disappeared in place.Bah!Appearing behind Su Xue Er, she struck her neck.Su Xue Er was already in a delirious state, so she quickly fainted as she was hit.As she fainted, all the strange phenomenons around her disappeared.Su Xue Er\u2019s body became limp, falling to the ground.\u201cHuo De, protect her\u201dAs Anna said that, she caught the falling girl and shoved her towards him.\u201cYes\u201d the shadow stood up, covered the girl being shoved towards him.Then the girl disappeared without a trace.It was now that Anna finally relaxed her expression, looked towards the sky above the clown and asked: \u201cIf you\u2019re already here, why not show yourself?\u201d\u201cYour Royal Highness Anna, the reason why I didn\u2019t appear is to prevent an embarrassing situation\u201dA bald old man stood hovering in the sky, in his hand held a short staff.Then he dropped down in front of the clown and the grey shadow, blocking the two of them.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Anna asked\u201cI\u2019m a Bloody Club\u2019s Elder, Hyde\u201d the bald old man bowed to greet her.He sincerely spoke: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that your Royal Highness would be involved in this, otherwise we definitely would have passed on this mission\u201d\u201cWhat a load of bull\u201d Anna coldly spoke: \u201cJust now if I hadn\u2019t stopped you, you definitely would have killed her\u201dThe bald old man shrugged, saying: \u201cKilling is an irresistible joy, is it not?\u201dAnna\u2019s eyes became cold.\u201cYour Highness Anna, what do you say we stop this matter here, after all, both you and I don\u2019t gain anything from keeping on with this fight\u201d the bald old man suggested.\u201cAh? Attempting to kill someone I wanted to protect right in front of me, do you really think I\u2019ll just let you go that easily?\u201d Anna crossed her arms and asked.At this moment, her entire aura has changed.----------she\u2019s no longer that elegant princess of the Saint Empire, but a strong Professionist that stood at the very top of the food chain.The bald old man frowned, then took out something from his bag, and threw it towards her.Anna caught it, then her face changed as she saw it.What she just caught was a medal.\u201cThe Holy Church\u2019s loyalty medal\u201d the bald old man spoke triumphantly \u201cRight now I\u2019m speaking to you as an honorary Elder of the church\u201d\u201cDear your na\u00efve Highness Anna, do not do anymore useless things\u201dAs he finished speaking, the bald old man turned around, kicking both the clown and the grey shadow: \u201cWhat disgraces, let\u2019s go\u201dThe clown and the grey shadow both stood up in shame.As the three of them were about to leave, they heard the girl\u2019s voice.\u201cThe Holy Church, is nothing but a parasite on our Royal line\u201dA painful look appeared in her eyes, Anna\u2019s voice became slow and low, as if she was suppressing her emotions.A clanging sound was heard as the medal fell to the ground.She raised her arms, muttering: \u201cAppear\u201dA long scythe was grasped in her hand.The entire scythe was jet black, at the top where the handle and blade meets, there was even a black skull.The blade of the scythe was a crescent-shaped burning flame.Anna slowly walked towards them.The bald old man\u2019s eyes became clearly distraught as he spoke: \u201cLady Anna, please be rational, if the Holy Church were to know that you dared raised your hand-------\u201c\u201cThey won\u2019t know\u201d Anna lowered her gaze, swinging her scythe downwards.Numerous skulls made from flames suddenly appeared, then disappeared from the air.The clown was already shaking, as he saw that he couldn\u2019t help but screamed: \u201cDeath\u2019s Flame! No! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201dAnna glanced through the three of them, as her beautiful gaze became a merciless one.\u201cWhat an annoying day this was, luckily there\u2019s you people here to help me let out a little steam\u201dThe beautiful crimson haired girl said only that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Divine Temple.Footage from 12 surveillance cameras filled the entire screen.On them, no matter what kind of weapon was used, there was still no damage done to the mountain of flesh.Suddenly, one of the screen caught a certain scene----------In a relatively clear area on the mountain of flesh, a Confederate soldier climbed out of the wreckage of an Assault Mech, used his last bit of strength to struck the outer wall of the mountain of flesh.Pow.The fleshy wall was broken through, as a blue-colored blood flowed out from the small hole.Immediately 20-odd tentacles all flew towards the soldier, skewering his body and crushed him to death.This scene was quickly taken from the numerous attack footage, zoomed out to take up the entire screen.On the screen, the soldier\u2019s detailed information was shown.\u201cZuo Yue, Martial Grandmaster, power: Martial Thaumaturgy: Piercing Fist\u201d\u201cConfirmed Thaumaturgy power is able to damage the monster\u201d\u201cIn accordance to humanity\u2019s system of power, testing other types of attacks\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan saw that, he didn\u2019t bother to look anymore.Since Impartial Goddess had already found a clue, she\u2019ll very quickly figure out the truth in the next few experiments.Even though this monster is large, it\u2019s still only one monster, when faced with endless attacks from a large amount of Professionists, it could only die.The true problem to look out for is when the Apocalypse comes, the future when monsters become too numerous to deal with.Gu Qing Shan suddenly felt a bit uneasy.He can\u2019t be sure that the events that happened in the past life will happen again this life.If the next monster to appear is also different from what he knows, then what could that mean?Gu Qing Shan frowned deeply.But then he shook his head.This change involves the world itself, how could he stop it alone? He can only deal with each step as they come.\u201cImpartial Goddess?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here\u201d\u201cPlease send me back to the capital\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dGu Qing Shan quickly walked out, climbed onto the small-sized Spaceship, and began his re-entry into the atmosphere.Not long after, Gu Qing Shan had already made it back to the capital.Due to having the Spaceship, Gu Qing Shan no longer needed to run across the desert, simply dropped off on the highest floor of his hotel.Walking back to his room, he opened the door and went in.After a shower, Gu Qing Shan changed into some clean clothes, sat down leg-crossed on the bed.There\u2019s still a bit of time until the evening, he can use it to calm himself down a bit.As he closed his eyes, a person suddenly appeared in his room.He sat down on the sofa across from Gu Qing Shan, crossing one leg over the other.\u201cWho are you?\u201d As soon as Gu Qing Shan noticed him, he had been cautious.\u201cI could potentially be a bystander\u201d the man answered.\u201cA bystander of what?\u201d\u201cA bystander that see you being murdered\u201dThe man nonchalantly replied.He donned a black suit, wearing black open finger gloves on both hands, his eyes shone bright while emitting a sense of sturdiness and power.\u201cThe hitman isn\u2019t here yet and you already are?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked\u201cI had my men slowed them down a bit -------since you\u2019re too interesting a person to just die like that, too wasteful\u201d The man said.\u201cLet me introduce myself, I\u2019m a part of the 9 Lords, Zhang family\u2019s Zhang Ying Hao, in the underworld, I\u2019m known as the president of the Hunter\u2019s Association\u201dThe Hunter\u2019s Association is a hitman company, due to their unique assassination rules, as well as their extremely high success rate, they\u2019re quite famous in the underworld.Since he openly admitted both his status in the light and dark, either he has to be very confident that his backing is solid, or he has other implications.Sure enough, Zhang Ying Hao continued: \u201cMy second uncle is the Martial Saint, Zhang Zong Yang\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan heard that, he stood up, smiled and offered a handshake.\u201cNice to meet you, I owe your second uncle, having shown up for me during my previous trouble\u201d he said.\u201cNothing to it\u201d Zhang Ying Hao also stood up and took his hand.As they were shaking hand, Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s face slightly relaxed.His reaction pleased Zhang Ying Hao, at least right now, this youth doesn\u2019t seem to be the ungrateful type.Zhang Ying Hao adjusted his attitude slightly, saying: \u201cGu Qing Shan, I\u2019ve read all about your exploits, including the Mech that you built, through some special means, I\u2019ve also seen bits and pieces of the technology\u201d\u201cAnd so at this moment, I\u2019m inviting you to join our Hunter\u2019s Association, if you agree, I\u2019ll guarantee your protection from any harm\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it\u201d Gu Qing Shan refused him right away.Zhang Ying Hao smiled, questioned him: \u201cYou\u2019d refuse so quickly?\u201dGu Qing Shan only smiled without replying.\u201cYou should know, following me isn\u2019t that bad, at least I\u2019m very different compared to the two trashes from Nie family and Bai family,\u201d Zhang Ying Hao continued.\u201cThen I\u2019m all ears\u201d Gu Qing Shan kept up his smile and spoke.Since he received a favor from the Martial Saint from before, Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t want to make their relationship turn harsh.Zhang Ying Hao took out a small box, offering a cigar in it to Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThanks, but no thanks\u201d Gu Qing Shan refused it.Zhang Ying Hao shrugged and lit the cigar for himself.\u201cHow do I say this, I personally put Aristocrats into two categories\u201dHe took a long breath, puffed out a smoke before slowly continued to speak.\u201cTwo categories?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cHm, the first kind, as they realize they\u2019re privileged from birth, their ego is magnified endlessly, spends money like it\u2019s nothing, uses their status to suppress others, tainting the reputation of Aristocrats as a whole, becoming the cancer of this whole country\u201d\u201cHow interesting, then the second kind?\u201d Gu Qing Shan continued to ask.\u201cThe second kind, are people like me, or more precisely, like my second uncle\u201dZhang Ying Hao put down the cigar, sat straight up and spoke: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as authority that lasts forever, no such thing as a society structure that\u2019s permanently solid, you can only make yourself grow, become an unrivalled strong person. Only then can you under any circumstances, good or bad, lead humanity forward\u201d\u201cWe, are the true Aristocrats, even though the previous generations don\u2019t really take kindly to that\u201d\u201cThose are great words\u201d Gu Qing Shan nodded in agreement, \u201cBut this only makes me feel a bit awkward, because I\u2019m already used to being alone\u201d\u201cThen, do you accept an investment?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao fixed his collars a bit and sincerely asked: \u201cI want to spend a bit on you\u201d\u201cInvest? In me?\u201d Gu Qing Shan was surprised.\u201cThat\u2019s right, invest, or more precisely, a gamble\u201dZhang Ying Hao spoke clearly, without hiding anything.This in turn made Gu Qing Shan like him even more.\u201cThen please continue\u201d Gu Qing Shan signaled him to continue to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange\u201d Zhang Ying Hao shook his head and spoke: \u201cBefore I walked in that door, all I wanted to do was to watch; but as I saw you, I had a thought of taking you in; yet now, I have a different thought altogether\u201d\u201cYour mind seems to change very quickly\u201d Gu Qing Shan commented.\u201cOf course, this is a requirement for survival, I have to provide for the bunch of people following me, you know\u201d Zhang Ying Hao casually admitted.\u201cFrankly speaking, there are many, many people that want you dead, but after I meet you, I can feel you\u2019re not the kind that\u2019ll just roll over and die, so I want to make a bet on you\u201dGu Qing Shan laughed, but then said: \u201cI can\u2019t arbitrarily accept your bet you know, since making an investment means you want to make a profit\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, to show my sincerity, I think you\u2019ll need this\u201dZhang Ying Hao took out a small silver white box from his pocket.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cPost-battle Nano machine cleaning robots\u201d Zhang Ying Hao smirked: \u201cFor use after you kill someone, guaranteed not to leave a single trace, only a refreshing smell of lemon --------of course if you don\u2019t like lemons, there\u2019s also 30 other smells to choose from, you can pick whichever you like\u201d\u201cThis way, no matter how many people you kill, there will never be any evidence to pin the crime on you\u201cOf course, if you don\u2019t have the confidence to win against Bloody Club, I can also stop their hitman for a bit longer, if you want to run then run now\u201d he said all at once.Gu Qing Shan looked at him for a little bit, then suddenly asked: \u201cWhy do you want to help me delay the hitman?

I\u2019m flattered\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled\u201cAlso\u201d Zhang Ying Hao thought for a bit, \u201cIt seems they\u2019ve also dispatched people to Capital University, in order to deal with your friend, Su family\u2019s Su Xue Er\u201dAs soon as he said that, Zhang Ying Hao felt goosebumps all over his body.The youth that stood before him, a smiling student that won\u2019t harm even a fly at one moment, the next emitted killing intent intense enough to suffocate someone.The killing intent quickly came and went.All of it disappeared in a matter of seconds.The youth\u2019s face was blank; his whole body stood dead still.Zhang Ying Hao felt his mind completely blank, it took everything he had to get out of that state.How is this possible!Killing intent hidden at will, to achieve this you have to completely master hiding all your killing intent so that no one can feel any of it.His killing intent isn\u2019t just strong, it also felt solid, everywhere yet nowhere at the same time, even if you feel it you have no idea where the opponent might come from.Feeling this sort of killing intent would make people unable to resist as they\u2019re killed, even Zhang Ying Hao himself almost couldn\u2019t break free.At that moment, outside the glass window that extends up towards the ceiling, a young man in a black suit was hovering outside, knocking on the window.This was the 15th floor, no one knows just how he was able to get there.As he knocked on it, the entire glass window disappeared.\u201cAh, my apologies for being late\u201d the young man politely said.He walked forward, looked at his watch: \u201cThe rival\u2019s interference seems to not have been effective, sir Gu Qing Shan, your time has come\u201dSuddenly he saw Gu Qing Shan grabbed the air, as a sword materialized in his hand.Gu Qing Shan raised the Earth sword, pointing it at the young man.\u201cYou\u2019re Hyena?\u201d\u201cI am, I\u2019m here for your life\u201dThe young man smirked and said.This was the last thing he ever said.The Freedom Hotel is the best hotel in the capital. There\u2019s a large glass window that stretches from floor to ceiling in every room to accommodate the guest\u2019s enjoyment of the beautiful night scenery.But at this moment, in a room on the 15th floor, the large glass window disappeared, as a young man stepped inside from the air.Just a second later, a loud booming sound was heard.Every single window in the Freedom Hotel broke at once, crashing down as they shattered.A large phantom sword knocked the young man out from the 15th floor.Followed by a few even sharper phantom swords, slicing him into pieces as they hit him.Then an endless streams of sword phantoms flew outward from the 15th floor, until the young man\u2019s body was diced so finely not even a drop of blood could be seen.\u201cZhang Ying Hao, I owe you one\u201dAs Gu Qing Shan said that, he didn\u2019t bother to look back and jumped outside.Zhang Ying Hao didn\u2019t know how long it has been since he was so shocked.The Bloody Club\u2019s Ace, was killed so thoroughly that not even a drop of his blood is left, by a single sword swing from this youth.When he saw the youth jumped outside, he couldn\u2019t help but yelled: \u201cThis is the 15th floor you know!\u201dOnly to see the youth take out something.\u201cBlazing Angel\u201dHe spoke to the thing in his hand.Above the capital airspace.In an orbital station.The station\u2019s door opened, as a huge, beautiful Mech turned into a shadow and flew downwards to the capital.The sound barrier was broken in a matter of seconds as an intense booming sound was heard.This Mech is truly fast.It wasn\u2019t until it stopped in the air, spread its wings and carefully caught Gu Qing Shan that Zhang Ying Hao was able to see the Mech in all its glory.\u201cMy god, my god, this guy really does know how to surprise people\u201d He opened his eyes wide and muttered.In the blue sky, the sound barrier broke again as the Mech jetted away.It was only now that the Freedom Hotel\u2019s riot started.Zhang Ying Hao walked towards the now-broken window, took a look outside to see the shattered glass everywhere, together with the now-ruined curved structure of the hotel.After a while, he shook his head.\u201cEven 100 Nano machine cleaners couldn\u2019t clean up this mess\u201d\u201cNot good, I gotta explain this to the old man\u201dHe put away the silver white box from before, took out his personal Holo-Brain and started communication.Inside the Blazing Angel Mech, Gu Qing Shan was quickly operating the panels with both hands.\u201c4 seconds until reaching Capital University\u201d\u201cLocated Su Xue Er\u2019s biological signature, re-navigating, flight course changed\u201dThe Blazing Angel accelerated, curved and flew towards another direction.On an open field just outside the campus.As the barrier was lifted, Anna and Feng Huo De already went away.Right now there were no one but Su family\u2019s people here, dealing with the aftermath.Su Xue Er was also standing on the field, as the Mech approached, she seems to have noticed and looked up.A slender, intricate Mobile Mech, with two long wings made of light on both sides, flying across the sky just like an angel in legend.Before anyone could react in time, it had already landed in front of Su Xue Er.Then everyone reacted at once.\u201cWho are you!\u201d\u201cDanger alert!\u201d\u201cMen, come!\u201d\u201cProtect the young lady!\u201dChaotic shouting, together with the sound of other Mechs hastily operating made the scene even louder.A few Mechs had already activated, wanting to step forward.\u201cIt\u2019s me\u201dInside the Mech with the wings of light\u2019s cockpit, a male voice was heard.\u201cQing Shan ge!\u201d Su Xue Er joyfully exclaimed, then gestured everyone to stand down: \u201cNo need to panic, it\u2019s an ally\u201dIt was then that everyone dropped their guard.Then they couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to the Mech -----------it really couldn\u2019t be helped, as it was too stylish and eye-catching.The Mech\u2019s appearance isn\u2019t complicated, it could even be called simple, as the entire Mech\u2019s body is straight and slender, very similar to a human\u2019s figure.--------particularly, the figure of a gentle female with her eyes closed.The pair of wings made of light behind it, together with the layer of armor really does make it look like the angels in legend.People who really understood Mechs have a different kind of look on their faces.For such a highly humanoid Mech, unless the technology used inside is also highly advanced, it simply cannot move.The way it flew and landed just now was just like a person landing on the ground.From that, they could guess that the level of technology used here would have to be state-of-the-art.Not to mention the wings of light that\u2019s constantly there, from its stability, it would have other functions besides just looking pretty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I mean, I\u2019ve never piloted combat-type Mechs before. Plus, I\u2019m also wearing a dress\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inside that will get caught on your clothes\u201d Gu Qing Shan said, \u201cAnd the AI is top-notch, plus the controls are not complicated, so you can use it without worry\u201dIf Gu Qing Shan said that the controls aren\u2019t complicated, then it must be very simple.Su Xue Er was able to relax, then walked towards the Mech.The Mech automatically extended its hand, lifted her up and softly put her inside the cockpit.The sound of air escaped as the cabin pressurized, then the engine started to sound.The Blazing Angel\u2019s wings let out a blinding light.With a large booming sound, the Mech shot into the air and turned into a small black dot.You could almost hear a high-pitched scream from inside the Mech.----------apparently he forgot to turn off the speaker system.Gu Qing Shan smiled as he watched.If only the Apocalypse wasn\u2019t coming, he really wanted peaceful moments like this to stay.You could hear the sound barrier breaking in the sky, then the Blazing Angel appeared again not long after, as its flying speed slowed down and began to perform a set of tactical movements.This is the moment for any Mechs to show its true value.All the people around busily doing their work couldn\u2019t help it and stopped their hands to look up and watch this scene.The Mech\u2019s flight is still very stable.But the movements it performed were quick, fluid and unbelievably flexible.The way it switched from moving to stopping was the same as a human.Su Xue Er even tried out a few moves from Su family\u2019s close combat Style in the air.The Blazing Angel\u2019s movements were fierce and precise, almost seemed like it was a Martial Grandmaster.Then she flew forward, breaking the sound barrier again in only 4 seconds.All the spectators below gasped.With this kind of speed and human-like movement, the Blazing Angel could even get into close combat and deal with enemy Mechs by hand during battles.-------or shove its weapon into the enemy\u2019s main engine and fire.There hasn\u2019t been a single Mech in history that could do this.None of the people here are laymen, they\u2019re all experts in one field or another, so they all have sufficient knowledge of Mechs.Everyone\u2019s actions unconsciously slowed down, even their discussions as they moved were kept very soft, as if afraid they\u2019d interfere with the show in the sky.But there\u2019s one thing all the people here noticed.Today is an important milestone in the history of Mobile Mech development, the day that marks the coming of the next era.This day will be recorded into Confederate history books, and they were the people who witnessed this history.After a whole 20 minutes, the Blazing Angel finally landed in front of Gu Qing Shan.Su Xue Er was so excited that her face reddened, as she jumped down from the Mech, her voice rang: \u201cIt\u2019s so good! This is the best birthday present in my whole life\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled, then presented her with a small intricate ring.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Su Xue Er was so surprised she held her breath.Oh no, oh no, is he going to propose to me right here?Then do I accept his proposal or not?He\u2019s able to create a Mech that far surpasses first-rate like this, the family probably won\u2019t decline him right?And then, my power is already at 4th stage, I can already protect him a bit.But then, what kind of wedding attire should I choose, the trend right now is white wedding dresses, but I like the traditional Chinese wedding dress more.We\u2019re both still in college, so how would we live together.Wait a minute, I still haven\u2019t accepted his proposal yet!In that one moment, Su Xue Er was knocked dizzy by her own mind, her thoughts staggered everywhere.\u201cThis ring is the Blazing Angel\u2019s main control unit; the user manual is here\u201dGu Qing Shan, who was completely clueless to what was going on in her mind, took out a slightly crumpled piece of paper and gave it to her.Then he looked a bit at the paper, scratched his head shyly and said: \u201cIt was just a piece of paper I randomly grabbed to write the instructions, hope you don\u2019t mind\u201dSu Xue Er opened her eyes wide, staring at him.Then she breathed out, becoming alive again.This guy, at such a crucial moment, he gave me a control unit\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s the control unit for?\u201dShe completely missed what Gu Qing Shan said and asked about it again.\u201cYou press here\u201d Gu Qing Shan directly showed her.Then the Blazing Angel flew up into the sky and disappeared from sight.\u201cHm? It\u2019s gone?\u201d\u201cUsually it will dock on an orbital station and will go down only when you call for it\u201d Gu Qing Shan explained.\u201cWhy does it need to be docked on an orbital station?\u201d Su Xue Er asked curiously.\u201cFor convenience, you can call it anywhere you want. Also, since today is the first time it\u2019s launched, Impartial Goddess wanted to do a full check on it\u201d Gu Qing Shan explained.\u201cIt\u2019s that good?\u201dAs soon as Su Xue Er said that, she looked at the people around watching them, suddenly realized something and her face once again reddened.\u201cRight, we should go somewhere else, let\u2019s sit down and chat.\u201d she said.\u201cOk then\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, since today is my birthday, it\u2019s my treat\u201d\u201cThen I can only humbly accept\u201dThe two of them walked out.Then, the sound of occasional applause.The applause grew bigger and bigger, finally become a standing ovation as the sound was like an unending tsunami waves.Everyone smiled at Gu Qing Shan, using their all to applaud him.A scientist who's able to reach achievements that high would gain respect from anyone.Because if they didn\u2019t exist, then civilization wouldn\u2019t advance.Human society must absolutely praise such people.Gu Qing Shan was a bit surprised, but still looked at the people and replied their smiles with his own.Behind the campus, in a long armor-plated limousine.Su family\u2019s head, Su Xing Chao sat inside, silently watched everything, including when Gu Qing Shan and Su Xue Er left the scene.There\u2019s nothing but Su family\u2019s trusted members here, so preparing a few surveillance cameras isn\u2019t anything hard.Su Xing Chao stayed silent for a bit, then ordered: \u201cMake everyone sign a contract of absolute secrecy, and dispatch a 100-man group to protect my grand-daughter\u201dHe smiled a bit, then said: \u201cGet this footage to my son and daughter-in-law, tell them to watch it 100 times\u201dThen, Su Xing Chao turned on his personal Holo-Brain and connected to Impartial Goddess.After a brief discussion with Impartial Goddess, the Holo-Brain once again shut off.Su Xing Chao again went into silence.Suddenly, his Holo-Brain lit up again.A subordinate reported: \u201cThe young lady\u2019s assassination was orchestrated by Nie family\u201dSu Xing Chao laughed coldly, ordered: \u201cDo it, no need to fear anything, I want news on them within two hours\u201d\u201cAfter they failed the assassination, all Nie family members have died\u201d\u201cHm? What happened?\u201d Su Xing Chao raised his voice.\u201cWhoever did it was very thorough, we weren\u2019t able to find any useful information\u201d the subordinate reported.Su Xing Chao closed his eyes and thought for a bit, hanging up the call.Seems like today will be a busy day.Shortly after, his personal Holo-Brain lit up again.When Su Xing Chao looked at the name displayed on the Holo-Brain, he was a bit surprised.It was one of the 9 Lords of the Confederate, Zhang family\u2019s head, Zhang Xing Zhi.Zhang Family is one of the few families with which he got along.Not only because they have the Martial Saint, but also because their thinking is more open compared to others.\u201cOld Zhang, how rare it is for you to contact me yourself\u201d\u201cAhaha, nothing too big, nothing too big, when people are as old as you and I, whatever we do, we do for the sake of the children, do we not?\u201dThese words seem to imply something, Su Xing Chao was a bit interested.He continued: \u201cYou\u2019re right, we have to care even if we don\u2019t want to, someone even tried to harm my grand-daughter today, hah, people\u2019s minds these days are all rotten\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have some tea tonight, there\u2019s a few things that can only be discussed face-to-face\u201d the other party said.\u201cFine\u201d Su Xing Chao thought for a bit, then accepted.After exchanging a bit more pleasantries, they both hung up.Su Xing Chao\u2019s mood seems to improve a little bit, as he muttered: \u201cThe Mech is already in Xue Er\u2019s hands\u2026 seems like our Su family have a choice to make\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll pay you back\u201d Su Xue Er said as she took out her personal Holo-Brain, about to transfer him the moneyGu Qing Shan stopped her.\u201cNo need, I used my Merit to request Impartial Goddess to help build it, after it was built, Impartial Goddess already reward me a large amount of Merit\u201dSu Xue Er breathed out lightly, assured.Then she began to chat.\u201cWhy does the Blazing Angel have two wings of light?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a form of application for solidified energy\u201d Gu Qing Shan explained shortly: \u201cRadar, light-based weapons, sonar detector, air sensors and all sorts of things are installed there\u201dSeeing Su Xue Er\u2019s blank face, he caps things off with: \u201cOf course, mainly it\u2019s to put the finishing touches on the Angel appearance --------do you think it looks good?\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201dSu Xue Er smiled, at least she can understand this.\u201cRight, since when did you know Princess Anna?\u201d Su Xue Er suddenly asked.Just like that, the leap in subject was a bit sudden.\u201cA few days ago, I met her at a bar, after a few drinks we got to know each other\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.Su Xue Er lifted her face and pouted: \u201cHmph, drinking alcohol right? I\u2019m now 18 years old too\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, then let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll treat you to some drinks\u201dSu Xue Er\u2019s mood improved immediately, saying: \u201cI still have to wait for a few of my classmates, we\u2019ll go together\u201dShe explained: \u201cWhen they knew about my birthday, everyone all insisted that I had to treat them, they insisted for so long that it\u2019s hard to refuse now\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, invite your friends as well\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.He thought for a bit, then took out his person Holo-Brain and exchanged for some credits.On the black market, the Merit to credit exchange ratio is 1 Merit for 10,000 credits.While if you exchange directly in the Confederate public system, it\u2019ll be 1 Merit for 8,000 credits which quite a bit less.But since Gu Qing Shan have so much Merit, he doesn\u2019t want to have to spend the time and effort to exchange on the black market, not to mention, with how much Merit he has, he doesn\u2019t really need to care about the difference.\u201cThe credits from that time at the archery range, plus another 80,000 is probably enough\u201dHe thought to himself as he operated the Holo-Brain.Meanwhile, Su Xue Er was silently sitting across from him, thinking about something.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dGu Qing Shan found that her expression is a bit strange, so he asked softly.Su Xue Er answered: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just thinking a bit, Qing Shan ge, right now how strong are you exactly?\u201dFrom Princess Anna\u2019s few and detached words, Gu Qing Shan seemed to be very strong, but I don\u2019t know exactly how strong he is at all.\u201cMy strength? That\u2019s a bit hard to say exactly\u201d Gu Qing Shan frowned.At the moment, Gu Qing Shan is a qi training peak stage 7 cultivator, he only needs to unlock the Thaumaturgy from the Quest reward and then he can attempt to breakthrough to Foundation Establishment.But the strength scale in the cultivation world and this world is a bit different, if he were to purely convert the power, he should be about Martial Grandmaster level.But Gu Qing Shan is a sword cultivator, and sword cultivators\u2019 fighting strength are much higher compared to normal cultivators, killing someone whose cultivation is higher than your own is a frequent occurrence.Not to mention he also has a Secret Art, as well as the vast experience from fighting in many wars from the past life.So it\u2019s not easy to say correctly.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then answered: \u201cUnder normal circumstances, I should be about Grandmaster level\u201dSu Xue Er hesitated over and over, finally spoke: \u201cCan you take a guess of what my current strength is?\u201dShe was a bit nervous, but since she already decided, she\u2019ll face this matter head one.Hopefully I won\u2019t be putting too much pressure on him.Originally, the difference in their status is already nearly insurmountable, but now that she\u2019s stronger than him, she was afraid he might not feel too good about it.Since men are a prideful species.If a girl is stronger than a man, and they were in a relationship, there might be a lot of problems.But, but, Anna is also very strong, her status is also high, yet they still seem to be quite close.Su Xue Er wasn\u2019t confident that she could also do that.\u201cI heard that you\u2019ve awaken a Wind-element root, what stage are you at now?\u201d Gu Qing Shan casually asked.\u201cMy Wind-element has awoken to its 4th stage, Hurricane Storm\u201d Su Xue Er spoke softly.Hurricane Storm was already higher than the average fighting power of this world, to be precise, it\u2019s 2 levels higher than Grandmaster.The two of them silently looked at each other.\u201cIn our family\u2019s history, there was a total of 7 Supernaturalist that reached 4th stage, and I\u2019m the 8th\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019ve just broken through, my power level isn\u2019t quite stable, and my family is very serious about this\u201d Su Xue Er continued: \u201cAfter today, I\u2019ll have to temporarily stop going to university and return to my family to focus on training again\u201dSilence again.He was still not saying anything.Su Xue Er felt her heart beat faster and faster, as if someone was squeezing her neck, even breathing was becoming hard.She slowly lowered her head.I\u2019m the eldest daughter of an Aristocratic family, he\u2019s an orphan.I\u2019m a 4th stage Supernaturalist, while he still has a way to go to reach where I am.From today onwards, I\u2019ll be at Chang Ning county, while he\u2019s staying at the capital.Would our relationship have to be severed by these things?But if I\u2019m too weak, I\u2019ll have no way to protect him!A hard to describe sense of bitterness filled her mind, as Su Xue Er bit her lips tight.She was about to give him a smile, change the subject and continued their conversion.Suddenly, a big, warm hand came down from above and lightly rubbed her head.\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing\u201d A calming male voice could be heard.He continued: \u201cTo get so far, you must\u2019ve been through a lot huh\u201dBadump.Su Xue Er felt like she heard her heart beat loudly, then stopped.All her hard work, all her pressure, was turned into the wind as it scattered away.The warm hand didn\u2019t stay long and quickly returned.But this feeling of warmth kept staying inside Su Xue Er for a very, very long time.She gave a smile from the bottom of her heart, and quickly replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot alright, but all of it is to give myself a better position to speak from in the family, as well as to make myself stronger\u201dGu Qing Shan listened, and spoke as he smiled: \u201cThen keep trying your best, if one day, you can break through the 5th stage, I\u2019ll have to count on you to hire me\u201dHe doesn\u2019t mind, he really doesn\u2019t mind it, Su Xue Er thought to herself.At this moment, she doesn\u2019t have any words to express just how happy she was feeling.\u201cGood, then it\u2019s a promise!\u201dAs Su Xue Er said that, she didn\u2019t know why but felt like she wanted to hold his hand.It was when she had already extended her hand half-way that she realized.No, what am I doing!Su Xue Er bit her lip again as her hand stopped in midair, unable to continue forward or retract.Then, the big warm hand reached out to her.And shook her hand.A while later, Su Xue Er\u2019s two classmates finally arrived.They were two very cute female students, the taller one of the two was very open and actively greeted Gu Qing Shan.\u201cAh ha, so you\u2019re Su Xue Er\u2019s man huh, indeed you do look like a genius\u201dSu Xue Er hit her lightly on the shoulder to hide her embarrassment: \u201cHe\u2019s just an old classmate\u201d\u201cHello, I\u2019m Gu Qing Shan, Su Xue Er\u2019s classmate from high school\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled and introduced himself.\u201cI\u2019m Lee Tong, nice to meet you\u201d the taller girl said.The other female student was busy evaluating Gu Qing Shan, only now did she speak: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Sun Cai Yun\u201dGu Qing Shan nodded and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go then, since today is Su Xue Er\u2019s birthday, let\u2019s find a decent restaurant bar to celebrate it\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sun Cai Yun.Sun Cai Yun ignored her and continued: \u201cTrust me Xue Er, this bar definitely has the best atmosphere, I guarantee you won\u2019t regret going there\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll--------\u201c Su Xue Er glanced at Gu Qing Shan questioningly.Gu Qing Shan nodded.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Su Xue Er jumped, \u201cWait for me here, we\u2019ll go in my shuttle, I\u2019ll drive\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you\u201d Gu Qing Shan left the caf\u00e9 with Su Xue Er.As the caf\u00e9 door closed, Lee Tong asked: \u201cWhat are you doing, Rainbow Bar only serves aristocrats, from his clothes Su Xue Er\u2019s friend is clearly a commoner, you doing this will only make him feel awkward\u201dSun Cai Yun said: \u201cI\u2019m doing this for Xue Er, their difference in status is too great, he isn\u2019t fit for Xue Er\u201d\u201cEven so, that\u2019s for Xue Er to decide\u201d Lee Tong said.\u201cA girl in love is always not thinking straight, her decisions won\u2019t be accurate, she\u2019ll need friends like us to help knock down the annoying frogs that wants to climb up the trees that is aristocrats\u201d said Sun Cai Yun.\u201cSu Xue Er will definitely thank me for this later\u201d She said confidently.Lee Tong just sighed.Regardless of what they said here, this night was going to be a fun one.Just a few moments later, Su Xue Er drove her shuttle with Gu Qing Shan riding in front, picking up the two girls to go to Rainbow Bar.Just like Sun Cai Yun said, this was a great bar.Although they had to scan their person Holo-Brain at the entrance before entry, but the bar owner and all the managers personally went down to greet them, such great service and treatment of course would make anyone feel special.The only strange thing was that they all wanted to talk with Gu Qing Shan for some reason.They all shook Gu Qing Shan\u2019s hands, a total of 5 times, then even took a commemorative picture.Truly strange.After that, Gu Qing Shan himself acted as bartender, giving the three girls all the cocktails they could ever want.Considering this was Su Xue Er\u2019s first time drinking, as well as the rest of them being girls, Gu Qing Shan controlled the amount of alcohol just right so that they would feel elated, yet not become dead drunk.In the middle of all that, Sun Cai Yun found out at Gu Qing Shan was going to enter Military Academy, so she called over some of the new pre-enrolled Military Academy students, saying she wanted to help Gu Qing Shan make some friends.Yet all of them said they never saw Gu Qing Shan before, not even his name on the new student list.The atmosphere became a bit awkward.Luckily, Gu Qing Shan used his Holo-Brain in front of everyone to connect to Impartial Goddess--------it was now that he was shocked to find out he was actually going to enter the University as a Professor.He was only shocked, but everyone else was shaken.Impartial Goddess doesn\u2019t make mistakes.Such a young Mech expert researcher, what monstrous talent.Sun Cai Yun panicked and apologized, while all the new students from Military Academy all left.After that, Sun Cai Yun couldn\u2019t even look at him anymore.The tall girl Lee Tong, on the other hand, was now staring at Gu Qing Shan without holding anything back.The way she looked at Gu Qing Shan, was like looking at a pig that suddenly grew wings.While Su Xue Er, from start to end only drank Gu Qing Shan\u2019s cocktail bit by bit, smiling sweetly.It was only when the three students returned to their dormitory that Su Xue Er pulled Sun Cai Yun out alone to speak with her firmly and seriously.A wonderful night.After Gu Qing Shan brought the three girls back, as he turned around, his face shows a clear smile.As they said their goodbyes, Su Xue Er was a bit tipsy.With a reddened face from alcohol, she stared at Gu Qing Shan and said this.\u201cQing Shan ge, wait for me\u201dThis was the boldest thing she has said ever since she knew him.As soon as she said that, she kept her head down, didn\u2019t dare to even look at Gu Qing Shan again and slowly ran back to the female dormitory.Remembering her running figure, Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but laugh a bit.He was walking alone on the night road.As he passed the main Square, the large screen on it was showing the news, with numerous people watching around.Gu Qing Shan joined the people\u2019s gazes as he walked past the crowd.The person on TV was a male reporter, wearing a raincoat, standing on a bobbing ship deck.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as you can see, the ocean had started to exhibit change, there is thick fog on all sides, with just eyesight alone, we already can\u2019t see anything past 10 meters\u201dGu Qing Shan lifted his brows and stopped.\u201cThe battle in the frontline has ended, we originally weren\u2019t allowed to come close, but as field reporters, we have our ways --------right here, you can see for yourself folks, the sea water has been bobbing up and down nonstop\u201d\u201cWhat a strange sight\u201d the male reporter continued: \u201cHalf a day ago, we lost contact with the Vacation Island nation, we are quickly approaching it as we speak, to find out what exactly happened that their communication was lost completely like that\u201dRight after he said that, the unknown fog spread out around him, covered both him and the scenery in front of the camera, right now the only thing that can be seen onscreen was his blurry figure in the fog.Then a loud humming sound was heard from afar.\u201cPlease wait folks, I think we\u2019re picking up something\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck it that!?\u201dA loud scream, like the owner of that voice has seen something so terrible they couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cWhat is that!?\u201d\u201cNo! Save me!\u201dThen the camera stopped and the screen went black.Just a second later, image returned to the screen, but this time it was the news center.The two hosts face paled, barely unable to sit still as they explained: \u201cApparently our field team has run into some problems, we will update you as soon as we know what happens, after this, we return to our regular news\u201dOn the Square, everyone was talking discussing loudly among themselves.The news had also changed to the next piece.\u201cInfamous evil sect Mammon declared: The Apocalypse has come\u201d\u201cExpert opinion says that Mammon has always focused on nothing but making humanity\u2019s population grow, they know nothing about true events happening around the world and as such their words can\u2019t be trusted\u201d\u2026..Gu Qing Shan sped up his steps and quickly left the Square.The fog has already covered the ocean, from now on, the ocean itself will become a no-man\u2019s land.In the past life, the fog only appeared half a month after the archipelago disappeared.Another event that happened ahead of time!It\u2019s like everything had become different during this lifetime.It wasn\u2019t until the monsters start to try invading land was when the calamity truly begins.Then what would happen next?Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t sure.He quickly went into a secluded alley.\u201cThe cool down time has finished, does the user want to enter the cultivation world?\u201d\u201cEnter\u201dA bit after he disappeared.Some people that were tailing him arrived, entered the alley to find no one there.One of them smelled the air, saying: \u201cWe lost him\u201d\u201cThis brat is very strange\u201d\u201cTo be able to kill Hyena, of course he would have some abilities that others don\u2019t know about\u201dAnother one shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s return first, even though the bounty has been removed, but since he killed one of our own, the top won\u2019t give up that easily\u201d the person in lead said.A few moments after they left, a few more shadows appeared in the alley, floating in midair.All the shadows emitted a strange and dangerous air.\u201cBiological signature detector says that he was just here\u201d one of the shadows spoke.\u201cBut he isn\u2019t\u201d another one commented.\u201cLet me\u201d one of them stepped forward.He raised a finger, pointed at the alley and stood still for 1 minute.\u201cStrange indeed, I have no idea where he went as well, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a rare hiding-type God's Chosen Skill\u201d he pulled back his hand and said.\u201cThen we have no choice\u201d the leader ordered: \u201cIt\u2019s only been 10 minutes since the contracted time started, you report the situation to Bai family first\u201dThe call quickly connected, and quickly ended.\u201cHak\u201d the person holding the communicator complained: \u201cThat\u2019s why I hate these Aristocrats the most, they said to terminate the contract now and they\u2019ll pay the fees\u201dAll the shadows were in a riot, obviously angry.\u201cThat\u2019s normal, Aristocrats has always been stingy\u201d the leader said, to calm his subordinates down: \u201cJust going around the city for 10 minutes, doing nothing and we already made 1 billion, you all should be happy\u201dAs they heard that, the shadows really did calm down a bit.The leader thought for a bit, then said again: \u201cBut to go out and accomplish nothing, that does hurt our reputation as the world\u2019s best hitman company, from now on we\u2019re not taking any more jobs from Bai family\u201dThe shadows all nodded.They quickly melded into the dark of night and disappeared from the alley.Just like that, Gu Qing Shan accidentally escaped the most dangerous situation that would have happened ever since his return, due to the interlacing timeline of the two worlds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Understood\u201dLeng Tian Xing was a bit happy, but at the same time confused.He quickly excused himself and left.As he left, he took out a communication talisman and gave it to Gu Qing Shan.Using this, Gu Qing Shan is able to reach him at any time.After Leng Tian Xing left, Bai Hua Fairy told him: \u201cI\u2019ve saved Gong Sun Zhi, and my incarnation at the frontline has told them everything, your contributions this time isn\u2019t small, so I believe your ranking will increase by at least one rank\u201d\u201cThank you Shifu\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.As he glanced at the War God UI, he found the Quest displayed as \u201cFinished\u201d.But since right now isn\u2019t a suitable time to check on it, Gu Qing Shan only let loose his tense spirit and temporary paid no attention to it.Bai Hua Fairy smiled in a strange manner, then said: \u201cThere\u2019s still one other person, you can go in place of teacher and escort them to meet up with Gong Sun Zhi\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked back in surprised.Bai Hua Fairy looked at him like she was looking at an idiot and answered: \u201cI\u2019ve told her to wait at Sky Hall, you\u2019ll know when you see her\u201d\u201cGo\u201d Bai Hua Fairy swung her sleeve.Stupid disciple, teacher can only help you so much.Bai Hua Fairy sat on her throne and silently thought.As Gu Qing Shan walked towards the Sky Hall, it wasn\u2019t until halfway that he was able to react.Since Gong Sun Zhi is at the main gate, then the other person would of course be Ning Yue Xi.Strange, so the two of them were treated separately?Ning Yue Xi is a female cultivator, so the wounds on her body mustn\u2019t be seen by outsiders, since Bai Hua Fairy brought her to Sky Hall to treat her, that must have been the reason.Yup, that must be it, as expected, Shifu wouldn\u2019t do things without a reason.Gu Qing Shan thought to himself.As he got to Sky Hall, sure enough, he saw the familiar figure.A white mask, a snow-white long Blade, slender golden armor that closely covered her body, as well as accentuate it.Before she even reveals her face, her first-rate beauty could already be seen from her figure.\u201cHow are your wounds?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cThe Saint has treated them for me, together with my old wounds as well\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear, General Sun Zhi is waiting for you at the main gate\u201d\u201cBe my guide, we\u2019ll leave together\u201dThe two of them walked side by side.On the long jade road of the palace, there was a light smell of flowers, as well as the gentle breeze of the wind, but no one to be seen.Ning Yue Xi looked at Gu Qing Shan, settled her tone then said: \u201cThis time I owe you for saving my life\u201dGu Qing Shan dismissively waved his hand: \u201cNo need to be so formal, you and I met on the verge of life and death, don\u2019t mention it\u201d (1)On the verge of life and death huh, Ning Yue Xi repeated that in her mind, then glanced at the sword on Gu Qing Shan\u2019s waist.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s heart sank, blunder, how could he have forgotten to stow the Earth sword away.Sure enough, right after, Ning Yue Xi asked: \u201cThis sword -------\u201cGu Qing Shan already cut off her words: \u201cThe Saint gifted it to me\u201dSince it was a gift from the Saint, as a qi training realm cultivator, Gu Qing Shan of course would not dare to refuse.Not to mention, the Saint has just saved you, healed your wounds and dealt with all the demons by herself.Would you dare to say something to disgrace the Saint\u2019s reputation right now?This line of thought was extremely easy to arrive at, enough so that Ning Yue Xi could only hesitate for a bit before silently accepting.She spoke with a low voice: \u201cIf you\u2019re able to not learn the sword, then try not to learn it, ok?\u201dGu Qing Shan took that time to nod his head.Don\u2019t joke, this is a peak Rejuvenation realm cultivator, with Gu Qing Shan\u2019s current cultivation, he simply can\u2019t beat her.And he doesn\u2019t want to have to grovel on the ground and beg for forgiveness.Ning Yue Xi then said: \u201cAfter I leave, you have to work hard, learn some real skills from the Saint, otherwise you\u2019ll get trouble everywhere because of your low cultivation\u201d\u201cI know\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.\u201cRemember, I forbid you from learning the sword\u201d Ning Yue Xi said again.\u201cOf course\u201d Gu Qing Shan said with confidence.Ning Yue Xi calmly looked at him, then took off her mask to reveal her stunning beauty.She said: \u201cLater, if you have the time, come visit Heaven\u2019s Limit Sect, just tell them my name\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t think too much of it and only replied with the flow: \u201cSure\u201dAs she heard him said \u201csure\u201d, Ning Yue Xi suddenly felt her face flushed, then quickly put on her face.-----------luckily she made it in time, otherwise when her face flushed, he would definitely have noticed.\u201cHoh! Could that have been a bit too unnatural?\u201d she silently thought.It was only now that Gu Qing Shan was able to react in time.Ah?Did I just get hit on!?But time doesn\u2019t go backwards, and so Ning Yue Xi had already quickened her pace and continued walking.\u201cHah! This disciple of mine! Why did he have to chicken out at such a crucial time!\u201dAt the same time, in Bai Hua Palace, Bai Hua Fairy slapped her ten thousand flowers throne as she complained full of regret.Note:(1) meeting on the verge of life and death: I'm not sure how to translate this properly, but it basically means \u201ca friendship forged from going through life and death situations together\u201d. What he\u2019s basically saying is they\u2019re comrades, no need to explicitly say it every time they save each other\u2019s lives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)\u201cA speed technique\u2026 just how afraid of me are you\u2026\u201dHe went silent and gave up on chasing.Of course he doesn\u2019t know, right now Ning Yue Xi\u2019s face is already as red as a tomato.Ning Yue Xi was much more sensitive than he is, so she already noticed, since this is Bai Hua Palace, even if the Saint doesn\u2019t want to, she\u2019ll see and hear clearly everything that they say.As soon as she realized, she couldn\u2019t do anything anymore, not even speak a single word.As they walked one after another, they quickly arrived at the main gate, where Gong Sun Zhi and Leng Tian Xing were waiting.\u201cHow surprising, you actually managed to do so much, you even got accepted as the Saint\u2019s disciple\u201d Gong Sun Zhi sighed, his face clearly shocked.\u201cIt all thanks to General Sun Zhi not wanting me to die right there and sent me away that I was able to do what I did\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.\u201cI guess that\u2019s called you get what you give huh?\u201d Gong Sun Zhi smiled.\u201cYes, you get what you give indeed\u201d Gu Qing Shan also smiled.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to return to the frontline immediately, everyone is waiting for our report on the matter\u201d Gong Sun Zhi said.Then he gave a communication talisman to Gu Qing Shan.\u201cContact me anytime you need\u201d Gong Sun Zhi said.\u201cI still don\u2019t have my own communication talisman yet\u201d Gu Qing Shan explained.\u201cNo worries, you had better work hard on your cultivation, the next time we meet, I hope to see you much stronger than you are now\u201d Gong Sun Zhi patted his shoulder.This youth, his talent, personality and means are all first-rate, the only thing that\u2019s not good enough is his cultivation.Leng Tian Xing also walked forward and patted his shoulder.Ning Yue Xi didn\u2019t say anything, only looked at him for a while and turned around.Their airship quickly left, Gu Qing Shan only needed to wait for a bit before the ship has gone far past the horizon.Then he returned to Bai Hua Palace.Only to see a white goose standing in the main palace, looking at him in disdain.Gu Qing Shan was puzzled.--------isn\u2019t this one of Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s clones?Then he heard Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s voice from the ten thousand flowers throne, saying: \u201cQing Shan my disciple, come greet your first brother, Bai Ying Tian\u201dGu Qing Shan was speechless.Bai Hua Fairy actually split one of her clones to become her first disciple.Right now, Gu Qing Shan really wants to know, just how goes on in Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s head.Of course, Gu Qing Shan wouldn\u2019t say it out loud, only clasped his hand and bowed to the white good: \u201cBefore, at the green rock, I still have to thank big brother goose for letting me through, thank you\u201dThe white goose lightly scoffed and muttered: \u201cNing Yue Xi wouldn\u2019t eat you alive, this kid, why do you act so meek in front of a girl?\u201dGu Qing Shan truthfully answered: \u201cBecause the first ever lesson Shifu taught me was to not offend a beautiful woman with high cultivation without a good reason\u201dDid I just say that?It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t feel as much pressure when he talks to the white goose as much as when he talks to Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s true self.Hm, that\u2019s normal I guess.He can be respectful to Shifu, but if he also acts meek and respectful to a senior brother then what kind of sword cultivator would he be?Not only will that make Bai Hua Fairy suspicious, with his personality, Gu Qing Shan wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up that act for too long.Thinking that, Gu Qing Shan decides to let go and act normal.As the white goose hear that, he really couldn\u2019t say anything in response.A while later, he flapped his wings: \u201cLooks like you gotta learn a bit from your second brother regarding this matter\u201dSecond brother?Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t very clear.On her throne, Bai Hua Fairy explained: \u201cYou have two senior brothers, and one --------let\u2019s say junior sister, I\u2019ll officially accept both of you into the sect today\u201dAs they spoke, two people walked into Bai Hua Palace one after another.As Gu Qing Shan looked back, they were a male and female.These are the only two other people of Bai Hua sect.The male seems to be a bit older than him, while the female was only 7-8 years old, basically a child.The male was quite handsome, or you could even call him pretty, in his hand was a jade fan and wore a bright belt around his waist, truly an elegant person, enough that you\u2019d mistake him for a girl wearing men\u2019s clothes.While the little girl looked like she was carved from jade, with a big curious pair of eyes and twin tails, she had the shyness and nervousness of someone that suddenly met a stranger, making her very cute and lovable.The male walked forward first, circled around Gu Qing Shan once and breathed out.He said: \u201cSeems like in our Bai Hua sect, I\u2019m still number one in good looks\u201d\u201cPeh! You? You sure can talk with that girly appearance\u201d the goose Bai Ying Tian scoffed at him.As he heard the goose say that, his face twitched a bit, but ignored it and patted Gu Qing Shan on his back, saying: \u201cJunior brother, I\u2019m Qin Xiao Lou ---------- Xiao Lou from \u2018Xiao Lou Yi Ye Ting Chun Yu\u2019\u201d (2)The white goose interrupted him: \u201cThat\u2019s right, swindle everywhere, lying to steal the ladies\u2019 hearts, that\u2019s why he\u2019s the Lou from Yi Hong Lou\u201d (3)Qin Xiao Lou got angry, turned to the ten thousand flowers throne and bowed: \u201cShifu, junior brother had just come and first brother has already ruined my stage, he\u2019s bullying me in front of you\u201dBai Hua Fairy simply ignored him and said to Gu Qing Shan: \u201cThis is your second brother, Qin Xiao Lou, he has his flaws here and there, but he\u2019s extremely smart, well versed in all of the 6 arts\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at Qin Xiao Lou and clasped his hand: \u201cI\u2019m Gu Qing Shan, first time meeting second brother\u201dSo he\u2019s the famous womanizer, Qin Xiao Lou.Well versed in all of the 6 arts, to receive this praise from the Saint herself, just how heavy a praise that would be.Divination, formation, pills, smithing, talisman, cooking, these are the 6 arts of a cultivator. A normal cultivator who is an expert in any of them would receive overwhelming recognition and able to get vast amounts of resources for their own cultivation.Qin Xiao Lou is a true monster in that respect, as he\u2019s an expert in all of the 6 arts, called the seed only seen once every 1000 years of the cultivation world.If it weren\u2019t for that, how would he be able to satisfy Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s high standards and become her disciple?The only problem is that he\u2019s not fond of cultivating and doesn\u2019t like conflict, he\u2019s always blindly looking for fun, and squanders his time, seen to outsiders as wasting his own talents.Bai Hua Fairy doesn\u2019t mind all that, saying that he just hasn\u2019t found his calling for cultivation yet.The first time that Qin Xiao Lou truly began to focus on cultivation was 7 years later, on the day that Bai Hua Fairy passed away.That day, from Golden Core first stage, he advanced all the way past Rejuvenation and only stopped at Ascended last stage.That event shocked the entire cultivation world.But no matter how hard he tries, he can't revive Bai Hua Fairy anymore.This later became his eternal regret, stopping him from leaving the realm of mortals and enter Sainted realm.Qin Xiao Lou breathed angrily, saying to him: \u201cJunior brother Gu, from now on, let us be good brothers, ignore first brother\u201dSeeing him like this, Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cSaint, this is my junior brother?\u201d a timid voice was heard.As Gu Qing Shan turned to look, it was the little girl that asked that.He could see the expectations in her eyes, occasionally peeking a glance at Gu Qing Shan.The white goose flew over and consoled her: \u201cYou can\u2019t be a senior sister yet, he\u2019s your senior brother, my 3rd junior brother\u201dSure enough, Bai Hua Fairy also spoke: \u201cXiu Xiu, before I\u2019ve not officially accepted you as my disciple yet, and you\u2019re the youngest, so today I will welcome both you and Gu Qing Shan into our sect, with you being the last\u201dShe then spoke softly: \u201cThis way, they can all take care of you\u201dAfter hearing the later part of what she said the look of disappointment on Xiu Xiu\u2019s face disappeared, instead turned into a happy \u2018yes\u2019.Bai Hua Fairy waved her hand, as two small jade cards floated in front of Gu Qing Shan and Xiu Xiu.Looking at the jade cards, Gu Qing Shan could see on them were the two words, \u201cShan\u201d and \u201cXiu\u201d respectively.Note:(1) Speed techniques: this might not need to be explained, but it\u2019s basically footwork, body movements and usage of spirit energy that can increase a cultivator\u2019s speed. They say that a cultivator that uses a speed technique can move at least twice as fast as one that doesn\u2019t. The original word literally means \u201cbody technique\u201d(2) Xiao Lou of Xiao Lou Yi Ye Ting Chun Yu: due to there being many words that have similar pronunciation in Chinese, this used to be the way someone usually explain their name to someone they\u2019ve just met. Xiao Lou literally means \u201csmall building\u201d, and \u201cXiao Lou Yi Ye Ting Chun Yu\u201d is just a sentence that means \u201cOne night of listening to the Spring rain in a small building\u201d.

(1)\u201cYes Shifu\u201d Qin Xiao Lou bowed and looked down.\u201cYou can take Qing Shan around for a tour first, explain our sect\u2019s situation, in the afternoon you\u2019ll replace your first brother, go to the green rock to pick people to attempt Bai Hua lists\u201d\u201cYes\u201d Qin Xiao Lou said.\u201cQing Shan, Xiuxiu, tomorrow you two can begin your cultivation, it\u2019s almost time for the semester examination already, when that time comes, the two of you will both go to see the other cultivators of the land\u201d\u201cGo, you can leave now\u201dGu Qing Shan and Xiuxiu both bowed: \u201cYes\u201dThe three of them left Bai Hua Palace.Walking on the road paved with white jade, Qin Xiao Lou rubbed his stomach and suddenly said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit hungry\u201dXiuxiu\u2019s eyes lit up, and even Gu Qing Shan held a bit of expectation.The Womanizer is famous for being an expert in all of the 6 arts, but he\u2019s most known for his skills with cooking.Spirit Cooking made by Qin Xiao Lou is not only beneficial to the cultivator\u2019s body, but it also tastes amazing, definitely first-rate in the world.In the past life, Qin Xiao Lou is the target of many gluttonous players to flatter and try to get close to.Xiuxiu asked with a soft voice: \u201cSecond brother, what do we eat today?\u201dQin Xiao Lou looked at her a bit, then at Gu Qing Shan, then said: \u201cOk, since first brother isn\u2019t here, and today is both of your happy day, we\u2019ll have some roasted goose\u201d (TN: \u201chappy day\u201d the way Xiao Lou said it can also mean wedding day)Gu Qing Shan suddenly understood why Bai Hua Fairy called him \u201chopeless disciple\u201d.\u201cNo, no, no\u201d Xiuxiu\u2019s angry face became red: \u201cWhat you do mean our happy day, also, if you dare to cook roasted goose, I\u2019ll tell first brother\u201d\u201cNo don\u2019t, don\u2019t tell him, junior sister Xiuxiu\u201d Qin Xiao Lou panicked.Gu Qing Shan suggested: \u201cI heard that Bai Hua Immortal country\u2019s spirit flowers and spirit herbs are highly desirable everywhere, can we have a vegetarian meal today?\u201dQin Xiao Lou \u2018hoh\u2019 in surprise, then said: \u201cSeems like junior brother has done his homework, my vegetarian meals are the best in the world you know\u201d\u201cOk then\u201d he thought for a bit \u201cWe can use the Cloud ship, just outside Bai Hua country, around Cang Shan sect\u2019s territory, there\u2019s a Yi Hong Lou there, we can listen to the songs, as well as --------\u201cXiuxiu glared at him strictly.Qin Xiao Lou immediately changed his words: \u201cHm, or maybe we won\u2019t go there, let\u2019s instead go to the Bai Gie Temple on South Street, they have ready-made vegetarian ingredients there\u201dHowever, he secretly blinked a few times at Gu Qing Shan, hinting that there will be more chances from now on.What a piece of work this guy is, Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but think so in his mind.The three of them left the palace and went to Bai Gie Temple in the South.While Qin Xiao Lou was busying preparing the meal, Xiuxiu weren\u2019t too familiar with Gu Qing Shan yet, so she was a bit shy, stood up and walked around looking at the Buddha statues.It was only now that Gu Qing Shan was a bit free, so he opened the War God UI.On it, a text box has opened for a long time.\u201cDestiny Quest: The fight to death (completed)\u201d\u201cQuest description: Gong Sun Zhi and Ning Yue Xi have made it safely back to humanity\u2019s territory, bringing the world\u2019s secret with them to report to other human cultivators. At the same time, the traitor in humanity\u2019s top brass ---------Blade Emperor has been killed by Bai Hua Fairy, humanity as a whole is now in a never before seen situation\u201d\u201cQuest rewards: War God Thaumaturgy (special story quest)\u201d\u201cWould you like to receive the quest reward?\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t hesitate to choose: \u201cYes\u201dOn the War God UI, the text box disappeared, replaced with a round wheel.There were five slots in the wheel, on them were some complicated patterns and symbols.Another line of text appeared.\u201cThe user has 48 hours to collect items that match the description of the wheel and put them in the slots\u201d\u201cNo matter if the 5 items are collected or not, after 48 hours, the user will get the chance to pick one War God Thaumaturgy\u201d\u201cThe quicker the collection speed, the higher grade the items, the higher the chance to get a powerful thaumaturgy\u201d\u201cCountdown begin\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the description, then rubbed his chin.No matter if he collects the items or not, he\u2019ll still get a thaumaturgy.But if he doesn\u2019t take too long, and the items he collects are high quality, he\u2019ll be able to guarantee himself a strong thaumaturgy.The time limit is only 48 hours.Gu Qing Shan also quickly looked at the 5 patterns.The first one, a monster whose face can\u2019t be seen laid on the ground, gnawing on corpses.The second one, a complicated stairway that leads downwards, all the way to a black bottomless pit.The third one, a sea of stars, in it a planet being swallowed up by a monster with its body.Gu Qing Shan looked at that and contemplated: \u201cThese patterns, could it be\u2026\u201dHe then continued looking, the fourth pattern was a scene of the dead rising from their graves, while the fifth is a thick sea of clouds with arms and legs sticking out of them.They are Huang Quan type and Unknown type respectively, Unknown type is also called chaos-species.The Faceless Giant is one of those chaos-species monsters.Sure enough, Gu Qing Shan felt relieved.This is thanks to him returning from the Apocalypse that he\u2019d know so many types of monsters.If it was anyone else, they probably wouldn\u2019t even understand what these patterns are meant to represent.These five patterns depict the types of monsters and demons that attacked the two worlds, dividing into 5 types total.In order, they are Chaos type, Abyss type, Space type, Huang Quan type and Unknown type (TN: chaos type and chaos species are apparently different)If that\u2019s the case, then these 5 slots are meant to be filled with the body parts of those five monster types?Gu Qing Shan has already solved the puzzle.But then, he frowned.I don\u2019t have much time, where the heck would I go to find enough materials from the five types?While he was thinking, he felt someone tapping his shoulder.\u201cWhat are you thinking about that so deeply that you\u2019d frown?\u201d Qin Xiao Lou set out the plates on the table and asked.\u201cAh, I was thinking of where to get some monster body parts\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.Qin Xiao Lou face turned serious, then said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you some advice, those things don\u2019t taste very good\u201dFrom the way he said it, it seems he has already tried.Gu Qing Shan felt a chill and quickly explained: \u201cNot for eating, I was going to use them for something else\u201dQin Xiao Lou then laughed and said: \u201cI was wondering why you looked so worried, it seems like you haven\u2019t understood what your status means\u201d\u201cStatus?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d Qin Xiao Lou stuck his chest out, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re a part of Bai Hua sect, direct disciple of one of the three Saints, the entire Bai Hua Immortal country belongs to your Shifu, what kind of cultivation resources could you possibly want that you can\u2019t get?\u201dHe then continued: \u201cI\u2019m managing about half the treasuries, after lunch I\u2019ll bring you there --------you can take as much as you can carry\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cShifu won\u2019t say anything?\u201dQin Xiao Lou turned around and looked at him again: \u201cShe won\u2019t mind, just take whatever you like, as long as you don\u2019t make her lose face during the semester examination\u201dGu Qing Shan understood, saying: \u201cNaturally\u201d\u201cIs the semester examinations hard?\u201d a young girl\u2019s voice was heard.As they looked back, they saw it was Xiuxiu who just returned.Note:(1) Hopeless disciple: the original word had a much stronger meaning, usually this is what masters call students that have betrayed their expectations, with a slight tone of wanting to kick them out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re in Tian Wang in which age?\u201d Qin Xiao Lou asked with interest.The middle-age phantom was stunned as he didn\u2019t expect to get this kind of reaction.He thought for a bit, then: \u201c3000 years ago\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already out of date, old man\u201dQin Xiao Lou didn\u2019t wait for him to finish, only put the sword back in the sheath and threw it on the ground.As the sheath glowed, the sword inside struggled twice before becoming silent again.\u201cBullshit Tian Wang realm, never heard of it before\u201d\u201cEven dared to try taking over this young master\u2019s body, I\u2019ve only let you go because you\u2019re a property of our sect\u201dAs Qin Xiao Lou said that, he kept going.\u201cWait\u201d Gu Qing Shan suddenly picked up the broken sword \u201cCan I take it?\u201d\u201cAs long as you have a use for it\u201d Qin Xiao Lou answered.Gu Qing Shan tapped his Inventory Bag and put the sword inside.This would be a Huang Quan type, and quite the unique one as well.Gu Qing Shan was very happy to find it.After that, he found a duo-horned Grey Dragonewt claw, a monster skull with ten eyes, and a corpse piece that\u2019s covered by a small cloud on the mountain.Gu Qing Shan was convinced that there\u2019s nowhere else that\u2019s easier to get monster corpse parts than here.The broken sword is a unique Huang Quan type, the duo-horned Grey Dragonewt is a Chaos type, the ten-eyed monster is an Abyss type, and the cloud-covered corpse piece is an Unknown type.The only one left is Space type.This world doesn\u2019t have any Space type, so Gu Qing Shan will have to find one after he returns to Reality.This Quest would be at least 100 times harder to complete if he weren\u2019t Bai Hua Fairy\u2019s disciple.Gu Qing Shan looked a bit in his Inventory Bag, confirming that all the parts he picked were also high quality.He breathed out in relief.The Quest is already more than half-done; Gu Qing Shan is itching to know what kind of Thaumaturgy will he be able to get.While they went down the mountain, Gu Qing Shan looked at all the corpses and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWho killed all these? Shifu?\u201dQin Xiao Lou shrinks his neck, a rare sight, and said: \u201cShifu isn\u2019t that free, all this is the goose\u2019s doing\u201dSo it IS her.Gu Qing Shan silently said in his mind.Where they got off the mountain was conveniently not too far from the green rock.Around the green rock, hundreds of cultivators were sitting down, silently meditating, a very magnificent sight.This was the Saint\u2019s territory, so no one dares to riot of complain.Since there\u2019s no one here mediate the Bai Hua list attempts, and they didn\u2019t want to just leave, they all decided to just sit and meditate on the spot.Qin Xiao Lou: \u201cOk, I\u2019ll have to replace that goose with choosing the people to attempt the lists, are you going to wait for me or go back first?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait\u201dGu Qing Shan answered, since Qin Xiao Lou already went with him to pick out corpse parts for so long, if he were to leave right now that\u2019ll be rude.\u201cOk then, if you feel like you can\u2019t wait you can just go back to Bai Hua palace first, the goose is probably almost done anyways\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201dAs they finished speaking, Qin Xiao Lou flew upwards, landing on the green rock.He shouted: \u201cNow! Bai Ying Tian have business to attend to, for the rest of today, I, Qin Xiao Lou, will be picking people for the lists\u201dNumerous cultivators stood up, saying: \u201cThen please give us the test, fellow Dao seeker\u201d\u201cHm, that\u2019s right, the test for today, let me think\u201d Qin Xiao Lou thought for a bit.While every cultivator was tensely waiting, he clapped his hand and said: \u201cRight\u201d\u201cThe test for today, is to make me pleased\u201dAll the cultivators were speechless.Qin Xiao Lou looked happy beyond compare, as if he was so proud of what he had thought of: \u201cAll of you line up, if you can please me in any way at all, you can go left and attempt a list!\u201d\u201cFair warning, no seduction allows, and I don\u2019t need spirit stones!\u201d he thought a bit more then added.As Gu Qing Shan saw this, he was completely flabbergasted.He knows from history that Qin Xiao Lou was a person with a free spirit. But having lived 2 lives, this is the first time he knows that someone can be this free-spirited.\u201cSee, clearly unacceptable right? That\u2019s why we urgently need a normal human cultivator\u201d a voice was heard from behind him.As Gu Qing Shan turned around, it was the white goose, Bai Ying Tian.Could it be this is the real reason why Bai Hua Fairy took me in as a disciple?Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but think that.\u201cLet\u2019s go, no need to watch his antics, your place is already settled, I\u2019ll guide you\u201d the white goose said.Gu Qing Shan clasped his hand: \u201cThank you first brother\u201dThe white goose nodded and took Gu Qing Shan flying.\u201cIf you can, try to take care of your junior sister a bit more\u201d the white goose said.\u201cAh? Ok\u201dEven though Gu Qing Shan wasn\u2019t very clear why, but since Bai Hua Fairy said so, he just agreed.As the white goose was afraid Gu Qing Shan wouldn\u2019t understand, he continued to explain: \u201cShe was an old acquaintance of the Saint\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From now on, I hope we can become like true brothers and sisters while living together\u201dXiuxiu softly asked: \u201cShifu isn\u2019t coming?\u201dThe white goose said: \u201cShifu is a Saint, she\u2019s always busy with something, so we can just do this kind of celebration on our own and not disturb her\u201dBut you\u2019re already here.Gu Qing Shan rolled his eyes.Xiuxiu was a bit disappointed.Qin Xiao Lou glanced at her and said: \u201cJunior sister Xiuxiu, from tomorrow onwards, Shifu will be teaching you cultivation every day, so tonight will be the only night happy night that you get to escape her evil grasp you know\u201dThen he used chopsticks to grab and put a drumstick in Xiuxiu\u2019s bowl, saying: \u201cHere, I marinated this chicken drumstick for very long, guaranteed you\u2019ll like it\u201dXiuxiu smelled it, then happily said: \u201cThen I won\u2019t hesitate\u201dThe white goose jumped up, stood on Qin Xiao Lou\u2019s shoulder and used his wings to hit him while angrily saying: \u201cEvil grasp! What do you mean evil grasp! Come on, say it! How dare you talk about Shifu like that\u201d\u201cFirst brother please spare me; I\u2019ve prepared for you a lot of wine you know!\u201d Qin Xiao Lou begged to be forgiven.\u201cHmph, then why haven\u2019t you brought them out yet?\u201d As the white goose hear that, it flew back to its seat.Qin Xiao Lou fixed his hair in annoyance, then tapped his Inventory Bag and took out more than a dozen different bottles.\u201cQing Shan, come, taste these drinks that I brewed myself\u201d he called out, ignoring the white goose.\u201cYes\u201d as Gu Qing Shan saw so many kinds of wine, he also couldn\u2019t help himself.Xiuxiu only looked up, then continued chewing on her chicken.The white goose scoffed, then took a bottle for his own.\u201cThis shot is for first brother\u201d Gu Qing Shan held up his cup and said.The white goose also brought up his own cup, pleased: \u201cHm, that\u2019s right, then bottoms up\u201d\u201cYes\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You sure?\u201dHe only glared at Qin Xiao Lou and said nothing else.Being glared at, Qin Xiao Lou lost his confidence and also said nothing.Gu Qing Shan also didn\u2019t say anything, only silently studied the spell.It\u2019s quite strange.What Qin Xiao Lou said wasn\u2019t wrong, this is simply a method to expand your spirit energy outwards, using it to touch another person and help them remove mental and bodily fatigue.This spell is extremely simple, but also ingenius, since it\u2019s not something anyone can just think of.Dismissing the small incident, they all returned to drinking.While everyone was in high spirits, a shy timid voice asked: \u201cCan I also drink this?\u201dXiuxiu\u2019s eyes were full of anticipation and said: \u201cI also want to cheers with brothers\u201dGu Qing Shan and Qin Xiao Lou looked at the white goose.\u201cFirst brother?\u201d Qin Xiao Lou asked.The white goose reluctantly shook his head and silently sent his voice: \u201cShe can\u2019t drink yet, the wound on her soul vessel hasn\u2019t fully healed, and her body is still in treatment, she can\u2019t drink alcohol or there might be problems\u201d (1)When Xiuxiu saw first brother shook his head, she sorrowfully lowered her head.The two men and a goose looked at each other, feeling a bit awkward.Gu Qing Shan then thought a bit, smiled and said: \u201cXiuxiu, I actually have something here that you could drink\u201dHe grabbed a few spirit fruits on the table, threw them all in the air and shouted: \u201cSecret Art!\u201dBoth the white goose and Qin Xiao Lou became serious, expand their inner sight to see Gu Qing Shan\u2019s movements.Only to see Gu Qing Shan made a single hand seal and said: \u201cJuicer!\u201dAs spirit energy escaped his body, it crushed and squeezed the fruits flat.When the juice flowed out, it was caught and guided by the spirit energy into an empty cup on the table.A refreshing cup of juice was made.This is one of many daily skills that players made after spirit energy became commonplace.\u201cThis is a juice mix\u201d Gu Qing Shan held the cup and put it in front of Xiuxiu, \u201cI remember these fruits taste quite good together, you can try\u201dXiuxiu\u2019s eyes lit up as she extends her small hands to hold the cup and drink.Once started, she didn\u2019t let go, as a gulping sound was continuously heard from behind the cup.Xiuxiu drank the entire cup in one go, placed it down on the table and cheerfully said: \u201cThird brother, I want another one!\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled and said: \u201cHere, I\u2019ll teach you how to, then you can change the flavor yourself\u201dOn the other side, both the white goose and Qin Xiao Lou had already made their own cups of juice.This type of simple spell, they only need to look to know how to use.However, this world has only ever known to eat fruits, no one has ever thought of the concept of drinking the juice from them before.Xiuxiu also very quickly grasped the spell, made her own cup of juice and knocked her cup with white goose.\u201cMay first brother become strong without equal\u201dThe she knocked cups with Qin Xiao Lou: \u201cMay second brother become more reliable soon\u201d\u201cHey, I don\u2019t like to hear that\u201d Qin Xiao Lou said, a bit annoyed.White goose looked at Xiuxiu being happy, glanced at Gu Qing Shan and nodded, showing a hint of a smile in his eyes.Xiuxiu raised the cup again, smiling sweetly: \u201cThird brother, thank you for teaching me such a cool spell, you\u2019re always welcome at my Orchid Cactus Hall\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear\u201d Gu Qing Shan also raised his cup and lightly knocked it with Xiuxiu.Right now, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s mood couldn\u2019t be better.A happy meal for both guest and host.Qin Xiao Lou learnt to make cocktail and drank himself to sleep.His cultivation originally wasn\u2019t that high, yet still drank so much spirit alcohol without expelling the alcohol, so he just slept on the table.Gu Qing Shan can\u2019t help but bring him to his bed and let him continue to slumber.White goose carried Xiuxiu, who was also sleeping and reminded him before leaving: \u201cThird brother, sleep well tonight, tomorrow I\u2019ll help you with cultivation\u201d\u201cThank you first brother\u201d Gu Qing Shan answered.He doesn\u2019t ask why it\u2019s him but not Shifu, and he also doesn\u2019t ask what kind of cultivation.This really pleased white goose.\u201cShifu took you in\u201d white goose burped, \u201cseems like she took in the right person\u201dThen he brought Xiuxiu away.Gu Qing Shan laughed a bit, then slowly returned to his own Orchid Hall, recalling all that has happened today.With this meal, he seems to have successfully settled himself into Bai Hua sect.Returning to Orchid Hall, he silently sat on a cushion to rest, waiting for the hourglass to run out of sand.As the screen lit up, Gu Qing Shan disappeared from the big hall.Note:(1) Sending voice: a very common technique in cultivation novels, used to send a message directly into someone\u2019s mind. Basically one-way telepathy, some novels explain it as using a technique to control so that only the person and people you want is able to hear your voice, so it can be tapped, unlike real telepathy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ting! Ting! Ting!4 consecutive system sound was heard as the complicated patterns and the slot inside spun around, finally turned into 4 balls of light.Only the last slot was still empty without any change.The pattern in there was a sea of stars, where one of the planets was being covered by a giant monster using its body.\u201cThere\u2019s only Space type left\u2026\u201dGu Qing Shan mumbled.Cultivation world doesn\u2019t have this kind of monster, so he must find it from Reality.Interstellar Warp technology enabled humanity to find out the truth about space.After intense and costly battles, humanity found out that it wasn\u2019t easy to win against the numerous kinds of planter-sized monsters.And this kind of battle, from their current standpoint, is meaningless, as they don\u2019t gain anything from it.The only thing they got was a bunch of space monster corpses.With current technology, the rate of research on utilizing these monsters are too slow.After much discussion, humanity reached a unanimous decision to temporarily stop the exploration of other galaxies.Glancing at War God UI, Gu Qing Shan confirmed that there were still a lot of time, so there was no need to rush.No matter what, as soon as the time limit is up, he'll still be able to pick a Thaumaturgy, but given the chance, Gu Qing Shan of course would want to do everything perfectly and get a powerful Thaumaturgy.But space monster corpse parts aren\u2019t exactly easy to get.How should I go about doing this?Gu Qing Shan suddenly remembered someone.He turned on his phone, found a certain person\u2019s number and called.Shortly after, they picked up.\u201cHow surprising for you to actively contact me\u201d Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s calm voice was heard.\u201cThere\u2019s something I need, and seeking your help seems to be the most convenient\u201d said Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThat\u2019s great, that means our relationship isn\u2019t just acquaintances anymore\u201d Zhang Ying Hao replied.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t busy, then come\u201d Gu Qing Shan gave the other party information on where he was, \u201cbecause this matter is better discussed face-to-face\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon\u201d Zhang Ying Hao hung up.Gu Qing Shan only had to wait for 10 minutes.Wearing a black coat and open finger black gloves, Zhang Ying Hao appeared from the other end of the alley.As he walks, Zhang Ying Hao spread his arms and said: \u201cHow miraculous, the 9 Lords still hasn\u2019t been able to get their hands on your scientific research\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid I\u2019ll drop dead in just a few seconds?\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled and said.\u201cThere were some problems with the Su family, Elder Su is very angry right now, and my second uncle supports Su family\u2019s stance, together with the Lee family that has always been on good terms with Su family, the situation is still changing\u201d Zhang Ying Hao summarized.Then he clapped his hand: \u201cOk then, since you called me all the way here, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dGu Qing Shan said: \u201cI need some space monster parts\u201dZhang Ying Hao didn\u2019t ask why, only looked at him and asked: \u201cAnd you thought I could help?\u201dGu Qing Shan answered: \u201cRegular methods definitely can\u2019t get what I need, since you\u2019re not only an Aristocrat but also a member of the underground, I thought----------\u201c\u201cI understand\u201d Zhang Ying Hao said, \u201cthen what do I get from helping you with this?\u201dGu Qing Shan replied: \u201cThen I\u2019ll give you two choices, you can choose either one, how about that?\u201d\u201cChoosing is my expertise, go ahead\u201d Zhang Ying Hao answered.\u201cFirst choice, I will owe you a favor. For example, if you want me to give you a certain research right of use, or in the future, when you clash with another hitman company, I can help you deal with them, once\u201d\u201cThen the second choice?\u201d\u201cThe second choice, from now on, your company and I will become official partners, allies\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.After hearing all that, Zhang Ying Hao silently nodded and contemplated.Seeing for himself how Gu Qing Shan killed Hyena, was well as the Blazing Angel, he of course wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of underestimating him.Zhang Ying Hao lit a cigarette, took a drag from it, then made a crucial decision.At the time, this decision might seem to be dumb, but all the things that happened later proved this to be the best decision he has made in his life.Zhang Ying Hao bit on the cigarette and extended his hand to Gu Qing Shan.\u201cTo a great partnership\u201d he said\u201cTo a great partnership\u201d Gu Qing Shan also extend his hand as they shook.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s start now\u201d Zhang Ying Hao spoke quickly.\u201cSince my partner has requested something\u201d he squatted down and knocked on the ground, \u201cI\u2019ll have to try my best to help\u201dRight where he knocked, the ground opened up to be a hole as large as a cutting board.Zhang Ying Hao placed one hand on the ground to brace himself, the other reaching inside the hole, looking for something.\u201cA God's Chosen Skill?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked curiously.\u201cThat\u2019s right, when I was young, I squat down to pick up a toy, but accidentally picked up a rooster instead\u201dAs Zhang Ying Hao said that, he suddenly lifts his hand from the hole.It was rooster that\u2019s black all over, being held by the neck, that was pulled out from the hole.The rooster looked at Zhang Ying Hao, then at Gu Qing Shan, as it was about to cluck.\u201cCo-----\u201c\u201cThe fuck, I\u2019m not looking for you\u201d Zhang Ying Hao said and casually shoved him back in.He searched again.Suddenly, he jumped up, bowed down a 90 degrees angle and said: \u201cHello Boss! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d bother you, I\u2019m very very sorry\u201dInside the hole, an eye with a vertical pupil was looking back at him.From the look of it, the eye was actually a little bit bigger than the hole.As Zhang Ying Hao said that, the vertical pupil eye left.Zhang Ying Hao took out a handkerchief to wipe his sweat then said: \u201cLet\u2019s continue\u201dHe squats down again to search; this time he was also imitating a cat.\u201cWhere~ are~ you~ precious~? Meow~\u201dA few minutes later, Zhang Ying Hao took out a black cat from the hole.\u201cHello precious\u201d Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s tone became soft.\u201cMeow\u201d, the cat answered back.\u201cWhat did you say you want? Erm, what kind of parts?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao looked up and ask.\u201cSpace monster parts\u201d Gu Qing Shan quickly answered.\u201cYou heard that?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao looked at the black cat seriously, \u201cwe want to find space monster parts\u201d\u201cMeow, meow meow\u201d The black cat swung its front paw, shaking its head.Gu Qing Shan: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, he doesn\u2019t know either?\u201d\u201cNo, he says he wants some first-grade egg yolks\u201d Zhang Ying Hao stood up, \u201clet\u2019s go find a convenience store\u201dGod's Chosen Skills are always like this, strange and unusual.Sometimes, even after using it, other people can stare for half a day and still not know what it does.A president of a hitman company and a returner from the future, bringing along a black cat, bought a bunch of egg yolks and cracking them open for the cat to eat on a street corner.Only a God's Chosen Skill can make such an unthinkable situation happen.After the black cat is full.He circled around Zhang Ying Hao once, then started to run towards a direction in the night.\u201cWhere is he going?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.Zhang Ying Hao answered: \u201cHe\u2019s looking for what you want, let\u2019s chase after him\u201dGu Qing Shan was surprised, so the cat\u2019s ability is to find objects.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To enter the core facilities, you\u2019ll need to exchange Merit for betting chips\u201d\u201cI might not have much else, but Merit I never lack\u201dWhen he heard about Merit, Gu Qing Shan suddenly felt a bit more confident.As he used Merits to exchange for a large amount of betting chips, a servant arrived and respectfully led them to the elevator.There were about 20 elevators in the main lobby, and the elevators only allow one group of customers to enter at a time.As the servant entered one of them, he asked: \u201cSo what do you want to enjoy, dear customers?\u201d\u201cWe -------\u201c Zhang Ying Hao glanced at Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThe more special the better\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled at the servant.The servant took a look at their betting chip box.The chip box was filled to the brim with the highest valued red chips.Then he showed them a smile: \u201cDear distinguished customers, I guarantee you won\u2019t be disappointed\u201dThen he pushed a button on the elevator.-70th floor.The elevator quickly moved and only started to slow down after a few minutes.Ting!The clear sound of the bell.Doors opened.What appeared in front of them was an impressively large lake.\u201cAn underground lake?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao.Getting off the elevator, they were led by the servant to a high VIP boxed seat near the lake.Along the lake, many other VIP boxed seats were already filled with customers.The boxed seats are all reinforced, there were even weapons prepared on the side that faces the lake.After the servant took out an intercom to ask below, he addressed them: \u201cThe previous round has ended, so the next round will start shortly, please wait for a bit\u201dSome excellent dishes as well as famous wine were served.As the two of them didn\u2019t care for the food and drinks, they only sat silently, waiting until the servant said: \u201cIt\u2019s starting\u201dA figure flew towards the center of the lake.As the lake was too large, he only made it halfway before he started to fall down.But then he suddenly stepped on the air, gained more force and continued to fly forward.Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao exchanged looks.To borrow power from the air, this is a Martial Eminence.A Grandmaster that wants to reach this level would need resource, talent and luck, not even one factor could be lacking.As the Martial Eminence made it to the wooden dinghy in the middle of the lake, he dropped something down from his shoulder.It was an unconscious man.As he put the man down, the Martial Eminence flew off the dinghy and out of the underground lake.Then, the man started to move again as he regained consciousness.It was now that the servant said: \u201cYou can make your bets now\u201d\u201cHow do I bet?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao asked.The servant: \u201cFrom 0 seconds being the lowest, you can bet how long he\u2019ll survive, the longest you can go is 3 minutes ----------as the man will be considered to have won if he survives for 3 minutes.\u201cThere is a total of 3 rounds today, the person who wins the most today will also get the lucky grand prize\u201d\u201cWhat is the lucky grand prize?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao asked.\u201cIt\u2019s different every day, but today it\u2019s either a space monster part, or a strange person\u201d the servant replied.They looked at each other.Gu Qing Shan spoke in a low voice: \u201cYour God's Chosen Skill isn\u2019t too bad\u201dZhang Ying Hao shrugged: \u201cI use it to make a living after all\u201dGu Qing Shan looked down at the lake, asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the lake?\u201dThey could only see a large shadow swimming under the lake.\u201cAn extinct ancient beast, revived using genetic modification, it\u2019s been left hungry for 2 days\u201d the servant smiled.At the same time, on a VIP boxed seat to the right of Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao.A middle-aged man laughed as he stood up and tossed a glass full of red liquid at the lake.His throwing strength is quite good, as the glass fell right near the middle of the lake.The red liquid flowed outward and quickly spread.You could see the shadow under the lake become more agitated.Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s noise twitched a bit, muttering: \u201cThat\u2019s blood\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no problem with him doing that?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked the servant.\u201cYou can\u2019t directly kill the person in the middle of the lake, but aside from that, you can do as you please\u201d the servant smiled and replied.On the right boxed seats, the middle-aged man spoke like he was showing off to his companion: \u201cLook, this giant thing is really good with his mouth, last time he only took one bite to shear a person in half\u201dThe woman sitting next to him yawned, uninterestedly answered: \u201cIs that right? How scary\u201dThe woman casually looked away, glancing at the other boxed seats to see Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao.Those two are quite good looking.She was a bit surprised, then decided to lean over to look at them carefully.The woman\u2019s eyes lit up.Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s figure is only decent, but from many years of good education and living a fulfilling life, he naturally exudes an aura of high Aristocracy.Gu Qing Shan was a bit younger, but he had a handsome, youthful face, as he elegantly sat there, he carried a clean air, emitting an unknown aura that draws you in and leave you unconsciously satisfied as you watch.As they\u2019re both her type, she held nothing back staring at them.This type of blatant staring, how could it not draw the two\u2019s attention?Zhang Ying Hao is still fine. Since he has been in and out a lot during the last few years, he\u2019s already used to being stared at by both men and women. Thus he only took notice before ignoring the woman entirely.But Gu Qing Shan isn\u2019t the same. As soon as his spirit sense felt someone watching him, he immediately reacted and looked.Who? What do they want?He saw the woman right away.As the woman was hit by his sight, her entire body couldn\u2019t help but instinctively tense up and freeze solid.In a single moment, her entire mind was blank, unable to think.This feeling was just like the time when she was 6 years old, when she slipped and fell into the predator den at the zoo. The same feeling as when she was seen by the lions there, slowly walking forward as they prepared to lunge and strike.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This isn\u2019t a good thing as he could easily hurt innocent people like this.While Gu Qing Shan was remonstrating himself, he saw the servant from the other boxed seat brought over a plate.\u201cSir, this is a drink from the lady, as well as her business card\u201dAfter the servant left the glass of wine and the business card on the table, he politely returned.Zhang Ying Hao whistled, saying: \u201cA glass of Godfather, and a card that lead to her heart, seems like she thinks of you as a true man\u201d\u201cThis method is a bit out there, but very effective, I\u2019ll have to learn it as well\u201d Zhang Ying Hao muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s only a misunderstanding\u201d Gu Qing Shan checked the business card.Fuxi Empire, Zhan Dao Weapons Group, Du Guong QiongEven after thousands of years, Fuxi Empire still keeps its old ways, even their names are still the same old-styled double surname, as if their traditions haven\u2019t been affected at all the change in era. (1)This is an ancient and old-fashioned kingdom state.Gu Qing Shan lifts the glass as he greeted the woman called Du Guong Qiong.Du Guong Qiong also politely smiled back.When the middle-aged man next to her saw that, his face went dark.He then gulped down a whole glass of wine, pointing at the lake: \u201cCome, look, he\u2019s awake, it\u2019s about time we bet on him\u201d\u201cServant, come\u201d he said\u201cYes sir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet 10,000 Merit on that man will be completely eaten within 10 seconds\u201d\u201cThank you sir, I\u2019ve recorded it\u201dThe middle-aged man looked at the two of them belligerently.Both Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao paid him no attention.Right at this moment, someone raised a frenzied laugh as he threw a bloody animal carcass down at the lake.The shadow underneath the lake quickly swam and bit at the carcass.In a matter of seconds, the entire carcass was gone.The shadow underneath became more active, quickly diving downwards.\u201cHow about it sir, how much would you like to bet?\u201d the servant asked.Zhang Ying Hao shrugged, looked at Gu Qing Shan and questioned: \u201c20 seconds?\u201d\u201cNo\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled, pushing the entire chip box forward.\u201cAll in, I bet he\u2019ll survive\u201d\u201cSir, are you sure? This isn\u2019t a small amount you\u2019re betting\u201d the servant looked at Gu Qing Shan in surprised, asking to confirm.\u201cI\u2019m very sure\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.The servant silently nodded, after recording their bet, took the entire chip box away.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao asked in a low voice, \u201cthat guy can\u2019t possibly survive\u201dGu Qing Shan also replied in a low voice: \u201cOnly betting like this will give the highest return, don\u2019t forget, only the person that win most gets the grand prize\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s too hard for him to not die\u201d Zhang Ying Hao mumbled.Clang! Clang! Clang!The bell rang.As if that was some sort of stimulation, the shadow under the lake became much more agile and began swimming much faster.Everywhere it swam through, the water spit into waves on both sides.What insane explosive power.A loud speaker on the lake shore spoke: \u201cTime starts!\u201dOn every single boxed seat, everyone stood up.\u201cGo, eat that mother fucker!\u201d the middle-aged man on their right side swung his hand and cheered.The shadow under the lake seemed to understand him as it swam directly to the lake center.\u201cEat him!\u201d\u201cEat him!\u201d\u201cEat him!\u201dEveryone shouted in excitement.While the man on the dinghy was already scared out of his mind, screaming and begging for help.The shadow moved closer and closer.----------it only needed to jump forward once again and it\u2019ll get the delicious food on the dinghy.Quite a few people quickly checked the timer on their tables.11 seconds!12 seconds!13 seconds!Right at the edge of the dingy, the shadow rose from under.14 seconds!Finally showing itself, the monster was a giant crocodile with thick purple-colored hide.This is an ancient species. They\u2019re known to be as strong as they are cruel, and already went extinct over 2000 years ago.Thanks to the advent of technology, it has once again been artificially bred with modified genetics.As the crocodile rose up next to the dinghy, its eyes showed a deep sense of cruelty, mocking the man.It slowly closed its jaw to bite on the man\u2019s leg.The man was scared into dodging backwards, but the dinghy is only so big, he doesn\u2019t really have anywhere to dodge.The ancient crocodile went underwater again, slowly circling the wooden dinghy this time.That\u2019s right, it\u2019s playing with its food.25 seconds!More and more people are breathing out in regret, obviously they\u2019ve lost.Suddenly, the man on the dingy raised a desperate scream.As they looked, they saw there was a short spear stabbed into the man\u2019s thigh.He was pierced tightly onto the dingy, he wanted to move to dodge, but couldn\u2019t.His blood flowed out, quickly went from inside the dinghy onto the lake water outside.The giant shadow underwater swam quicker, obviously excited by the smell of blood.On one of the boxed seats, a man laughed like crazy: \u201cThis time you\u2019ve got nowhere to run, quickly eat him! I want my money!\u201dIt was easy to see that he was the one that threw the spear.Gu Qing Shan turned around to look at the servant and asked: \u201cIs that allowed?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s allowed, as long as you don\u2019t directly kill the prey, anyone who put in a bet can do anything to mess with the prey, it\u2019s part of the fun after all\u201d the servant answered.In the lake, the ancient crocodile finally couldn\u2019t hold back anymore, jumping out of water and latching onto the dingy, his immense weight also made the dingy rocked.\u201c38 seconds!\u201dSomeone shouted.The ancient crocodile slowly opened its foul, bloody mouth, snapping at the man.This time, he was biting down at least 3 times faster than when he was toying with his prey before.The man cried in desperation.39 seconds!Gu Qing Shan suddenly held a bow in his hand.Drawing the arrow, putting it on the bow, pulling the string, the entire series of action was done fluidly.Skills activate!---------pwoon!The suddenly force knocked the ancient crocodile into the air, spinning and flying into the water.The clock ticks.40 seconds.After the ancient crocodile sinks, it slowly floats up again.On his head was an arrow, the arrow accurately pierced through its eye.Around the arrow, all the flesh is already broken off.It\u2019s dead.The entire room was silent.Gu Qing Shan glanced at the surprised servant, then at Zhang Ying Hao.He said: \u201cSeems like I missed the guy\u201dZhang Ying Hao shrugged: \u201cHmm, but your \u2018miss\u2019 is a bit scary\u201dNote:(1) Double surname: \u201cDu Guong\u201d is one of the few double surnames in China. Double surnames are, like the novel suggest, very old and outdated, usually only royalty or aristocrats would have double surnames. Even though it\u2019s 2 words, it\u2019s considered to be a single surname, instead of the surname and middle name. There\u2019s no special meaning to them aside from showing that they come from a very long lineage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019ll only take what we need\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled and answered.The fact is that the other party still has what he wants, so he can\u2019t make too big a ruckus. Otherwise, if the other party were to destroy the item, his Quest will be very hard to fully complete.The servant stared at the youth before him.What youth, he\u2019s more like a sly old man.To win from exploiting a casino, if anyone were to cut casino profits that way, the boss will be the first to not let him go.But now he\u2019s openly showing his needs, not caring a single bit about the insane amount of chips, and only want one of the two special items.This kind of action that doesn\u2019t account money isn\u2019t only rare, but also make people weary to make light of him.Not to mention, what he suggests also benefit the casino.The servant took up the communicator again, reporting the situation.As the voice inside the communicator replied, the servant listened, nodded and looked at Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThe boss praises you very highly and he agrees with your idea\u201d\u201cExcellent choice. Now can we begin? My time isn\u2019t something to waste\u201d Gu Qing Shan stood up and said.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll ask them\u201d the servant excitedly reported to someone else with the communicator.After a bit, he turned it off and politely bowed to Gu Qing Shan.\u201cSir, we\u2019ll make the arrangements now, please come down to the lake first\u201dAt the same time, the loud speaker on the lakeshore once again spoke.\u201cToday, a hero had killed our dragon, losing us a lot of betting chips, so let us see, if he really is a hero, or just a wannabe zero!\u201dA small boat drifted over, stopping where Gu Qing Shan\u2019s boxed seat was.\u201cYou -------\u201c Zhang Ying Hao was about to say something.\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, when you need to ask others for something, you have to be friendly, no need to make them hold a grudge\u201d Gu Qing Shan patted him on the shoulder and jumped down.The boat took Gu Qing Shan to the center of the lake.The guests around them whistled and clapped in excitement.\u201cWhat an idiot\u201d\u201cLooks like a good show is about to begin\u201d\u201cA more exciting bet indeed, not bad, not bad\u201d\u201cHow will he die?\u201dZhang Ying Hao glanced at Gu Qing Shan moving away, muttering in confusion: \u201cSpace monster parts\u2026 There\u2019s no research so far that shows their worth, just why does he want it so badly?\u201dThe loud speaker system spoke again.\u201cRight now, ladies and gentlemen please place your bets!\u201d\u201cTo clarify, this time we\u2019ve prepared a total of 3 giant crocodiles!\u201dOn the other side, Du Guong Qiong suddenly sat straight up, thought for a bit, then stood up and walked to the edge of her boxed seats, looking down at the lake.Only to see the boat moving forward, as the youth stood at the front of the boat. His face was calm.Around the lake, all the people were shouting in excitement.\u201cGreat!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bet 300,000 chips he won\u2019t survive for 20 seconds!\u201d\u201c20? Ahaha, I\u2019ll bet 15 seconds!\u201dWhen he got close to the lake, Gu Qing Shan jumped lightly as he landed on the small dingy.As he stood up, the loudspeaker spoke again.This time was a highly penetrating voice.\u201cThe cruel show is about to begin, this bet is yours to make, just how long do you think he can survive?\u201dThe voice raised higher: \u201cMy friends. Place. Your. Bets!\u201dOn all the boxed seats, everyone\u2019s emotions got highly agitated and so they quickly made their bets.Zhang Ying Hao sat down, then suddenly called the servant over.\u201cYes sir?\u201d\u201cI want to exchange for a few betting chips\u201dHe took out his personal Holo-Brain, transferring a large amount of Merit over.As the servant confirmed it, he quickly went and get the chips.Just then, a female voice was heard from behind Zhang Ying Hao.\u201cHello sir\u201dZhang Ying Hao stood up, turned around and greeted: \u201cNice to meet you, beautiful lady, may I ask what can I help you with?\u201d\u201cYour friend\u201d Du Guong Qiong pointed at the center of the lake, \u201cyou\u2019re not worried?\u201dZhang Ying Hao evaluated the other party for a bit.This woman was relatively tall, her almond-shaped eyes were calm and charming, as well as having a graceful hourglass figure and demeanor.A woman with three perfect qualities, a first-rate woman even with his standards.Unfortunately, this woman was a bit of a masochist, after being frightened with killing intent she actually became interested in that man-shaped monster.Zhang Ying Hao silently sighed, but still answered: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about him at all, he\u2019s a very good hunter, so you also have no need to be scared for him\u201dDu Guong Qiong thought for a bit then: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I would like to enjoy this round with you\u201dZhang Ying Hao looked at the boxed seat next to him.Du Guong Qiong followed his eyes, then said: \u201cThere\u2019s no problem, no need to pay any attention to him, he\u2019s just my subordinate\u201dWhen the middle-aged man saw her turn her head, he smiled back bitterly.Zhang Ying Hao: \u201cThen please have a seat\u201dIt was now that the servant brought back another full box of chips.\u201cSir, your betting chips\u201d the servant said.\u201cMake a bet for me, I bet that he\u2019ll live\u201d Zhang Ying Hao casually said.\u201cHow much sir?\u201d\u201cAll in\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u201d the servant confirmed, then took out his Holo-Brain to record the bet.As Du Guong Qiong glanced at the chips, she changed her impression a bit.This box of chips, to convert it into Confederate credits, would be worth about 200 million.Zhang Ying Hao noticed her look, smiled and said: \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, there\u2019s a good chance to make quite a bit of money right now, you can also place a bet with me for a spot of profit, if you lose then I\u2019ll pay you back\u201dDu Guong Qiong: \u201cNo need\u201dAs Zhang Ying Hao failed to hit on her, he asked curiously: \u201cWhy not?\u201dDu Guong Qiong gracefully smiled, then said: \u201cYou can always make more money, today I\u2019m only here to be entertained\u201dZhang Ying Hao went silent for a bit, then asked: \u201cPardon me for asking, but what would your surname be?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Du Guong Qiong\u201dDu Guong Qiong.Zhang Ying Hao gasped, then silently regretted.-----------why couldn\u2019t it have been me just now that let out that killing intent and seduced her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Female cultivators affected by it will have a good impression thanks to feeling elated in both body and mind.Imagine the scenario. When the handsome, brilliant Qin Xiao Lou stood near them, female cultivators will feel like their entire body is dipped into hot water, refreshing their spirit and improve their mood.Under these normal circumstances, a female cultivator\u2019s first reaction would be -----------bastard, who the fuck dares to use soul magic on me?Then they\u2019ll check their protection treasures and find that whatever happened was actually harmless.As they find they weren\u2019t being attacked, the female cultivator would relax a bit, then look at the graceful, handsome young man in front of them.Ah? What\u2019s wrong with me? Why do I react this way to him?At this time, Qin Xiao Lou will show a glowing smile and ask: \u201cBig (little) sister, can I have the pleasure of knowing your name?\u201dNo matter what, as they\u2019re in a good mood, they won\u2019t refuse to at least chat with him.Just like that, a spell that was supposed to be used for nurturing body and soul was turned into an evil spell in the hands of Qin Xiao Lou.Because of this, white goose didn\u2019t let him teach it to Gu Qing Shan, since he was afraid Gu Qing Shan might go on the wrong path.Qin Xiao Lou thinks of his spell as already perfect, but he didn\u2019t know that Gu Qing Shan would think so far outside the box that it would actually be more effective.Within a short time period, Du Guong Qiong was scared stiff by Gu Qing Shan\u2019s killing intent, then had a nurturing spell used on her, making her body went from one extreme to another, being lifted so high after dropped so low, even the strongest mind would show a small opening.This was a complete coincidence, Gu Qing Shan himself knew nothing about it.Zhang Ying Hao also doesn\u2019t know all the details in there, so his impression was a bit off.Skipping past this small matter, Zhang Ying Hao introduced himself.\u201cNice to meet you, beautiful lady Du Guong Qiong, I am Zhang Ying Hao\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, then what about him? May I know his name?\u201dDu Guong Qiong\u2019s eyes were practically glowing, staring at Gu Qing Shan in the middle of the lake.Zhang Ying Hao sighs, knowing that he doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201cHim, he\u2019s my business partner, Gu Qing Shan\u201d Zhang Ying Hao said.Du Guong Qiong leans herself on the chair, asking in interest: \u201cWhat business are you running?\u201d\u201cMurder\u201d Zhang Ying Hao purposefully answered.Du Guong Qiong thought for a bit then said: \u201cNo wonder\u201dNo wonder he was so scary just now.\u201cIt seems like you two won just now?\u201d She asked.Zhang Ying Hao crossed his legs, answering: \u201cThe casino won\u2019t admit it, probably banking on the fact that they have a Martial Eminence\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s going down there himself?\u201d Du Guong Qiong asked.Zhang Ying Hao: \u201cThis guy\u2019s way of doing things is a bit dry, but I\u2019ll admit, compared to a Martial Eminence, dealing with a gene modified beast is much easier\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u201d Du Guong Qiong agreed.Outside the military, every single Martial Eminence is a big shot with their own turf.Martial artists are different from other Professions, each time they go up a rank, their close combat power increase by at least two fold, scary enough that not many would offend them for no reason.One Martial Eminence once said something that represents the essence of all Martial Eminences: \u201cNo matter what kinds of tricks you use, I\u2019ll just go and kill you\u201dThis is the reason why Gu Qing Shan was afraid that he might anger them enough that they\u2019d rather destroy the space monster part than to give it to him, or they might use the name of Martial Eminence to overturn the rules at the casino, finishing off the business there.He's very clear-headed, the only thing he wants is the Space type, he doesn\u2019t mind everything else.As the two of them were talking, everyone was quickly putting down their bets.The lake shook again and again.Then three large shadows appeared underneath the lake.Slowly and languidly swam around.Every shadow is at least bigger than the previous crocodile.Gu Qing Shan suddenly felt something and checked his Holo-Brain.\u201cWhy did you automatically connect?\u201d He asked in surprise.\u201cHumanity\u2019s daily life is very interesting, so I want to observe them a bit more\u201d Impartial Goddess answered.Impartial Goddess had connected herself to Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Holo-Brain, quietly watching everything that ensues.And then, the loudspeaker announced: \u201cTime starts!\u201dThe bell rang again.This was probably their feeding bell.The three shadows immediately became agitated, searching around the lake for something.Someone threw a bloody arm into the lake, landing near where the wooden dinghy was.The three shadows were like sharks that smell blood, rushing forward right away.Very quickly, they saw Gu Qing Shan, stopped their advance, then rushed him.Gu Qing Shan didn\u2019t have time to care about Impartial Goddess\u2019 matter, stowed away his Holo-Brain and grabbed the air.The Earth sword was in his hand.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then muttered to himself: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, with my current power, I can use the Earth sword\u2019s 30,000 tons\u2019 strike. This way, even without Kai Shan Style, I can still keep to the spirit of---------\u201cThe first ancient crocodile jumped up, his dozens of eyes all latched onto Gu Qing Shan\u2019s figure.The people on shore broke out shouting in excitement.Gu Qing Shan turned his sword a bit to its side, using the broad side of the blade to strike at the ancient crocodile\u2019s head.Bang!A dull sound was heard as the crocodile was hit flying.Its bulky and heavy body flew backwards, splashing water as it bounced, making giant waves.Just like the sea, or a flowing river.\u201c---------peace makes wealth\u201dGu Qing Shan finished his sentence.Everyone went silent.Splosh!The crocodile fell into the water, making another splash.The other two crocodiles were shocked, hesitant to move forward.While the first crocodile very quickly floated up to the surface, its body was half-submerged, but no longer moving.It was already knocked unconscious.Gu Qing Shan was very pleased with this strike.The crocodile didn\u2019t die, the casino doesn\u2019t lose anything, so they probably won\u2019t stop me from getting the Space type.\u201cYou see that? Lady Du Guong, his attitude isn\u2019t that great, it\u2019s not too late to return to your seat now\u201d Zhang Ying Hao said.\u201cNo need\u201d Du Guong Qiong slightly smiled, then paid some attention to something else: \u201cThat sword of his, it\u2019s about an inch longer than a regular sword, do you perhaps know why?\u201dIt was only now that Zhang Ying Hao seriously looked at it and felt a bit surprised.Such a minor detail, he didn\u2019t notice at all.He honestly answered: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t know much about his weapon\u201dDu Guong Qiong squints her eyes, looking at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s sword and muttered: \u201cThis sword isn\u2019t just unusual, it\u2019s also mesmerizing, such a rare specimen\u201dAfter a while, the other crocodiles couldn\u2019t help the allure of food, so they once again tried to move up.\u201cPeace makes wealth\u201d Gu Qing Shan chanted once more, jumped forward and struck.BANG!This time, the strike is much heavier compared to before.The crocodile\u2019s entire body was hit into the air, crashed into one of the stands, then rolled back down into the lake.The crocodile couldn\u2019t do anything except roared in pain before diving down into the lake, no longer seen.When it saw that, the other crocodile also dipped down into the water and hide away.They\u2019re avoiding him.Gu Qing Shan put away his sword, clasping his fist out of habit.\u201cAn old greeting\u201dDu Guong Qiong muttered, feeling the allure of mysteries about him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What business?Gu Qing Shan again looked at Zhang Ying Hao.Zhang Ying Hao turned around, looking down at the lake like he was interested in something down there.\u201cDo you have any business with me then?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.Du Guong Qiong smiled again: \u201cNo business, I\u2019m only here to say hello, I\u2019ll be leaving-------\u201cShe cut her words short.Gu Qing Shan smiled back, asking: \u201cYes?\u201dDu Guong Qiong asked: \u201cYour sword seems to be very special, your bow as well, I\u2019m a professional weaponsmith in Fuxi Empire, if you ever need weapons, just come find me\u201d\u201cSpecifically, my expertise is in special weapons for Professionists\u201d she added.Gu Qing Shan felt her good will, thought a bit then said: \u201cThen how about we exchange contact information?\u201dDu Guong Qiong eyes lit up a bit, that\u2019s right, having the man say these words is the correct procedure.She took out her Holo-Brain and exchanged contacts with Gu Qing Shan.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave, see you later\u201d she said\u201cYes, see you later\u201d Gu Qing Shan replied.It was only after Du Guong Qiong happily left that a servant stepped forward.Different from the previous one, this servant is a firm and calm middle-aged man.\u201cGentlemen, please wait here for a bit, my boss will see you shortly\u201d\u201cVery well, we can wait\u201dGu Qing Shan looked around to see everyone slowly leaving.The servant also quickly left, went all the way to the top floor of the casino.The entire capital nightscape is visible from here, and it\u2019s also a room that\u2019s furnished lavishly.A large man with a mustache is sitting on the large sofa in front of the room, next two him were two beautiful girls, one massaging his shoulder, the other pouring him a drink.If Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao were here, they\u2019d notice, this was the Martial Eminence from before, on the lake.\u201cBoss, it\u2019s finished\u201d The servant said.The Martial Eminence received a glass of strong wine with ice, shaking it.The Martial Eminence thought for a bit, then said something hard to understand: \u201cVery well, we\u2019ll talk after they\u2019ve all left\u201dIt was now that two other servants arrived, reporting: \u201cBoss, your guest have had her fun\u201d\u201cThen bring her in\u201d The Martial Eminence spoke.A few minutes later, Du Guong Qiong was escorted here.The Martial Eminence stood up and greeted: \u201cWelcome, welcome, our distinguished Grandmaster weaponsmith\u201d\u201cFor what reason did you invite me here?\u201d Du Guong Qiong asked straight.The boss rubbed his hands: \u201cI want to order myself a weapon -------no, a full set of weapons\u201d\u201cThen prepare the necessary funds, and show me your ability\u201d Du Guong Qiong casually said.\u201cOf course, of course\u201d the boss smiled and replied.He turned on the surveillance TV, looking at the screen.On the screen, all the people around the lake have left, there were only two young men silently sitting there.\u201cIt\u2019s them?\u201d The Martial Eminence asked.\u201cYes\u201d a servant replied.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go meet today\u2019s grand prize winner\u201d The Martial Eminence said.Just as Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao were about to run out of patience, a huge mustached man came together with his men.The only thing they didn\u2019t quite expect was that Du Guong Qiong was also with him.Du Guong Qiong only nodded her head and smiled as a greeting.\u201cGentlemen, welcome to my casino, how was it, did you have fun?\u201d The Martial Eminence sat down across them and asked.\u201cMartial Eminence sir, your attractions were truly exotic\u201d Zhang Ying Hao praised him a bit.A Martial Eminence\u2019s status is very high, even he can\u2019t face them with a rude attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you had fun\u201d The Martial Eminence said, then give them each a golden-colored card.\u201cThis is the casino\u2019s VIP card, it\u2019s limited to only 30 at a time, I\u2019m presenting each of you with one, from now on, whenever you come to play, you\u2019ll get to enjoy a lot of extra services\u201dThere\u2019s also such good treatment?Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao looked at each other, then both said: \u201cThen we thank you\u201dThe Martial Eminence then spoke: \u201cThat\u2019s good, well I have a lot of business to attend to, so I won\u2019t keep you, feel free to leave\u201d\u201cThen sir, where do we receive our grand prize?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cAbout that\u201d The Martial Eminence just waved his hands, \u201cthat\u2019s only a business trick to attract customers, no need to think of it as real\u201dIt\u2019s not real? Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao were both surprised.Gu Qing Shan looked at Zhang Ying Hao.Zhang Ying Hao answered: \u201cThe black cat won\u2019t lie\u201dGu Qing Shan\u2019s face changed.He made so many concessions, just to finish the War God Quest, but he\u2019s being made light of again and again. Even if his temperament is good, it\u2019s very hard to not get angry right now.The Martial Eminence looked at his expression, then lifted his lips into a mocking smile, saying: \u201cWhat, do you want to blame this one for your loss?\u201dHe leaned forward, showing a hint of blatant threat: \u201cI\u2019ve invited a Grandmaster weaponsmith here to make my weapon, but I just happen to lack a couple of human-shaped punching bags, would you like to try?\u201dA Martial Eminence\u2019s destructive power isn\u2019t something a normal 5-Elementalist and God's Chosen can fight against.If you talk about ranking, then a Martial Eminence is one step below a 4th stage 5-Elementalist, but in actual battle, as long as a Martial Eminence is willing to risk his life, he\u2019ll be able to make a suicide attack with a 4th stage 5-Elementalist.If a Martial Eminence wants to kill somebody, there are very few that can stop him.Gu Qing Shan coldly laughed and spoke: \u201cIf you talk strength then I really have to call you a senior. But in the casino business, they say you only play if you can take the loss, you\u2019re in the business yet you won\u2019t respect its rules, then I --------\u201c\u2018Also don\u2019t need to respect you\u2019 those six words didn\u2019t escape his mouth yet; he didn\u2019t even get to pull his sword before the Holo-Brain suddenly shook violently.Gu Qing Shan couldn\u2019t help but take out his Holo-Brain to check.As he saw the text displayed on there, Gu Qing Shan\u2019s knitted brows started to raise.The killing intent in his eyes started to be replaced by surprise instead.\u201cThen you what?\u201d the Martial Eminence cracked his knuckles and asked.Gu Qing Shan suddenly stood up, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao was already prepared to kill, but was shocked by what he heard.Gu Qing Shan pulled him away and didn\u2019t even look back.As the Martial Eminence saw that, he laughed mockingly: \u201cThey\u2019re just a couple of soft bodies after all\u201dThis clenched fists loosened.\u201cJust look, two young\u2018uns that think they\u2019re right, at least they weren\u2019t scared shitless by me, but in the end, my casino does welcome these types of lambs\u201d The Martial Eminence said to Du Guong Qiong.Du Guong Qiong only stood without saying anything, feeling that something was off.Outside the casino.Zhang Ying Hao eyes were opened wide looking at Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal Holo-Brain.\u201cGreetings, Confederate Aristocrat Zhang Ying Hao, I am Impartial Goddess, I ask that you back away from the screen. As the trial is about to begin, please keep your manners straight to maintain the solemnity of the Confederate Court\u201d\u201cCourt, trial?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao was shocked\u201cA civil compensation case, regarding the compulsory delivery of personal property, of course, the specifics will be dealt with according to the creditor Gu Qing Shan\u2019s will\u201d Impartial Goddess replied.\u201cWe will now begin the trail\u201d\u201cIn accordance to today\u2019s betting ratios, sir Gu Qing Shan had put in a total of 1 billion Confederate credits, as such he should receive the following amount of winnings: 6 billion\u201d\u201cIn accordance to today\u2019s betting ratio in the second round, sir Gu Qing Shan had put in a total of 6 billion Confederate credits, as such he should receive the following amount of winnings: 20 billion\u201d\u201cThrough surveillance video footage evidence and witnesses, the debtor refused to pay the corresponding credits. Using on-site monitoring as physical evidence, and my words as testimony in front of the court, in accordance to Confederate Judicial procedures, the defendant was tried in absentia. The judgement has been obtained, initiating compulsory civil compensation program\u201d\u201cDebtor, Zhou Kai Wu, owned assets as follow\u2026.\u201dA long list.\u201cSir Gu Qing Shan, please proceed with the property deliverance process\u201dAs Impartial Goddess finished speaking, they were both stunned.Zhang Ying Hao muttered: \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Since when does Impartial Goddess care about a casino\u2019s business?\u201dGu Qing Shan remained silent, then laughed.He pointed at the top floor of the casino: \u201cI want that floor first\u201dThat should be the casino boss\u2019 daily living space.Impartial Goddess quickly replied: \u201cFrom now on, that floor has become sir Gu Qing Shan\u2019s personal property, after deducting handling fees, taxes and notary fees, you have 19,99841 billion left, please continue to choose\u201dZhang Ying Hao doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s imagining it or not, but Impartial Goddess\u2019 tone seems to contain a bit of excitement, like someone about to watch a riot happens.\u201cVery well\u201d Gu Qing Shan said, \u201cI\u2019ll pay the fees, help me demolish that floor\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

him silently.She doesn\u2019t know why, but she keeps thinking about the strange look on Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face as he walked out.When Zhou Kai Wu reached the shore, about to jump in, suddenly his subordinate shouted: \u201cBoss, your Holo-Brain\u201dZhou Kai Wu was surprised, glared back behind him.The subordinate that was glared at couldn\u2019t help but shiver.Being interrupted at such a time made Zhou Kai Wu very annoyed.But this subordinate is his close-aide, so without a real emergency, he wouldn\u2019t interfere at such a crucial time.Zhou Kai Wu couldn\u2019t help but return, picking up his Holo-Brain.\u201cI am Impartial Goddess\u201d a solemn female voice was heard from the Holo-Brain.Zhou Kai Wu was stunned.After I started to work in the Underground, it\u2019s been so many years since I made contact with the governing Confederate AI, why would she personally contact me now?Du Guong Qiong was interested and looked over at the Holo-Brain.She has heard that the entire Confederate is under Impartial Goddess\u2019 supervision, so it can connect to anything, anywhere within a matter of seconds, but only now did she really see it in action.From the Holo-Brain, Impartial Goddess was narrating the judgement she made before.Zhou Kai Wu\u2019s face was beginning to pale.\u201cWhat do you base it\u2026\u201dBefore he could even finish his sentence, a loud sound and slight tremor could be felt.Oom oom oom oom oom!Impartial Goddess\u2019 voice was heard again: \u201cPlease do not be alarmed, Confederate civil office is currently dealing with personal property deliverance, the demolition of the highest floor is being done with the most cutting edge explosive technology, its level of safety is highly guaranteed and will not affect your own personal safety\u201dAs they heard that, everyone there was shocked.Zhou Kai Wu cursed loudly: \u201cBastard, that\u2019s my property!\u201dHe didn\u2019t even mind Du Guong Qiong anymore and rushed outside.Du Guong Qiong just stood there, digesting the information she just heard.Then she broke out into laughter.Zhou Kai Wu jumped into the elevator and went straight up to the ground floor, the casino\u2019s lobby.In his anger, the elevator door was kicked flying.Zhou Kai Wu rushed outside the casino, stood at the main gate to look at the top floor.That\u2019s where he would look down at the entire capital cityscape, where he drinks and relax, his place to rest, but now, it\u2019s nothing but a flat floor.Numerous worker robots were doing their job cleaning the rubble, finishing up their task.Two large construction-grade shuttles were flying next to the building\u2019s roof, carrying the debris away.A huge amount of dust floated down, covering everything beneath in it.Quite a few people were leaving the casino.This type of high-rise unmanned construction would make anyone worry for their own safety, and the constant loud noises from the construction-grade shuttles as they worked made the entire casino sound like a night market.Very quickly, the official casino on the 1st to 3rd floors were affected.Many gamblers and customers were leaving on their shuttles, frowning as they did.Zhou Kai Wu\u2019s whole body was shaking in anger, then he turned and saw Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao standing on the opposite side of the street.\u201cYou shitty brats, it\u2019s time to die!\u201dHe shouted in anger and jumped forward.A lightning arc flashed----------With a sudden sound explosion, Zhou Kai Wu was knocked flying back into the casino, breaking numerous walls and furniture before falling down at the elevator entrances.As the chaos ensues, all the people on the normal casino were crying, screaming in fright.All the gamblers that come here to have fun panicked, ran and scattered from the casino.This time, the casino is truly no longer fit for business.Zhang Ying Hao dropped the small-scale nano-disintegration cannon shell in his hand, regretting as he spoke: \u201cThis one shot cost me 2 million Confederate credits, I don\u2019t care what happens, you\u2019re paying me back for it\u201d\u201cFine\u201d Gu Qing Shan spoke, \u201cshoot another 10\u201d\u201cYou think this is horse radish or something?\u201dZhang Ying Hao scoffed at him and put the cannon down.As he did, the cannon slowly wrapped around itself, magically turned into a small black square.Zhang Ying Hao carefully put the black square away in his pocket before speaking: \u201cI can only shoot one shot at a time, this is still an experimental weapon, aside from me, no one else can get it\u201d\u201cNever mind then\u201d Gu Qing Shan looked at the time on his Holo-Brain, \u201cthey\u2019re about to come here anyways\u201dMartial Eminence Zhou Kai Wu stood up, wiping at his chest.Seeing the blood on his hand, he could feel himself go into a frenzy.I got hurt?I actually got hurt by two snot-nosed brats?The frenzied scream was heard all the way outside the

You\u2019re a really good business partner\u201dBut then he spoke regretfully: \u201cA partner\u2019s assets increased like this could benefit my business quite a bit, sadly a hitman firm can\u2019t be listed, otherwise my stocks will surely soar\u201d\u201cAh, but I can make a dummy company to go on the market instead, hm, let\u2019s just call it the Butchering Firm then?\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at him like this an unconsciously thought about Qin Xiao Lou.If the two of them were to work with each other\u2026He shook his head to dispel the idea.Impartial Goddess once again spoke: \u201cI\u2019ve dispatched forces to enter the building to collect evidence of Zhou Kai Wu\u2019s crimes, requesting permission from the owner, sir Gu Qing Shan\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled: \u201cPlease go ahead\u201dGu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao now stood up, walking towards the entrance and happen to meet Du Guong Qiong.\u201cThanks to you, my business here is shot\u201d Du Guong Qiong smiled teasingly.\u201cMy apologies, would you like me to compensate?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cMoney is no subject, today I\u2019ve been thoroughly entertained ---------well, I\u2019ll leave first, contact me if there are any business\u201d Du Guong Qiong quickly and gracefully exited the casino.\u201cThis woman is quite fine, sadly she has a disposition of liking abuse\u201d Zhang Ying Hao muttered as he saw her off.Gu Qing Shan ignored him and looked for a servant.One of the servants on the first floor saw the entire process, quickly changed his attitude and lead the two of them down an elevator.As he pushed the button, the elevator began to climb downward.Ting.As it arrived at the last floor, the door opened.This was a prison, the long rows of cell extend far into the darkness, enough to not be seen by the naked eye.There\u2019s only the occasional sound from the cells that claws at your heart.Gu Qing Shan could hear very clearly there was something inside the cells, gnawing on bones.To Zhang Ying Hao, such a thing only sounds strange.Only Gu Qing Shan who\u2019s a returner from the Apocalypse knows for sure that was the sound of monsters doing what they did.The servant turned around and asked: \u201cI need to confirm a bit, you gentlemen were looking for the grand prize, correct?\u201dGu Qing Shan became serious, sincerely said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I only want the grand prize\u201dZhang Ying Hao also nodded.The servant spoke: \u201cThen please come with me, and do be careful, there are many weird things here, so please don\u2019t carelessly touch them\u201dAs he finished, he started going down a certain direction.The two of them followed, arriving at a cell after a while.This was a completely sealed steel room, if it weren\u2019t for the row of buttons on the side, no one would even know there was something kept in here.The servant stepped forward, pressing the buttons on the wall in a certain way.Then as the heavy steel doors opened, the steam escaped from the room, showering them in the bone-chilling cold air.\u201cOriginally we had quite a large piece, but it\u2019s already all rotten, since we didn\u2019t have any other choice, we could only do this\u201d the servant explained.Walking inside, Gu Qing Shan felt the chill reaching him deeply.Inside this freezing cabin was a large chunk of ice.Inside the ice was a piece of flesh the size of a person.The flesh slowly contracted, then slowly expanded again.\u201cThat\u2019s some good stuff\u201dGu Qing Shan complimented.As the servant and Zhang Ying Hao heard that, they were a bit shocked.Gu Qing Shan ignored them, going around the large chunk of ice once to confirm its value.This was a space monster heart, or at least, a small piece of it.The lower value piece on a space monster\u2019s body is the outer shell and skin, the true value of it lies in the flesh and bones, while its innards are the most valuable.And of all the innards, the most valuable thing is the heart.Gu Qing Shan paid no attention to the other two, took out the Earth sword and starts cutting up the chunk of ice.The freezing hard ice, was cut like soft tofu with the sword.Where the Earth sword cut, the ice was easily removed.As Gu Qing Shan swung his sword, he quickly extracted the piece of space monster heart.The servant had already prepared beforehand and gave him a suitcase with the miniature freezing apparatus to store it.Gu Qing Shan put the piece of space monster heart inside, smiling: \u201cThank you\u201dThe servant lowered his head, saying: \u201cYou are our new boss, so it\u2019s natural for us to serve you\u201dThe servant leads them further in to another large sealed steel cell.\u201cThis was the second grand prize, a strange person\u201d\u201cDo we want this?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cOf course not\u201dGu Qing Shan originally didn\u2019t want to look at it, but then suddenly he felt something.Something buried deep inside his mind was now making his heart beat faster.Gu Qing Shan was surprised, and a layer of cold sweat formed on his back.Why did I react like that?Gu Qing Shan immediately took notice.Sometimes, a cultivator will suddenly have a moment of his heart beating faster, to signify something bad about to happen.\u201cWait a minute\u201d he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look first\u201dAs the servant heard that, he opened the door.Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao were both curious.As the servant said before, the 2nd grand prize is a strange person.Then what exactly would you call \"strange\"?The steel door slowly opened.Gu Qing Shan and Zhang Ying Hao were stunned.Unlike before, this was quite a smaller cell.In it was a thin old man, both his hands and feet were bound tightly, stuck fast to the steel wall.His stomach was already ripped open; the inside was devoid of any organs.But looking at his chest moving up and down, you can tell he was still breathing.\u201cHe\u2019s alive?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao\u2019s face became serious.\u201cYes, alive\u201d The servant replied.Zhang Ying Hao opened his mouth wide, but unable to say anything.As a member of the 9 Lords Aristocrat, he has seen many many strange things ever since he was small.But all those things didn\u2019t hold a candle to this scene before him, as well as the meaning it represents.A person who has lost all their organs is still alive.If this is thanks to a genetic mutation, with current DNA technology, they only need to extract a small piece of DNA to find the secret to immortality.From both medical and biological standpoint, this would be the most important event in the entire history of humanity\u2019s civilization.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The boss only needed one swing to kill him, but unexpectedly, he didn\u2019t die\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fortune in misfortune, luckily the one he chose to attack was the Martial Eminence\u201dGu Qing Shan said as he stepped forward.As the man on the wall felt signs of life, he opened his eyes wide, growling as his spit flew.Gorgggggg!The growl became a roar as he struggled, trying to escape from the wall.Seeing the frenzied look in his eyes, Zhang Ying Hao suddenly understood.------------this person is very hungry, and he wants to eat me.Such a thought left Zhang Ying Hao stunned on the spot, unable to move.Gu Qing Shan emotionlessly walked towards the wall, raised his Earth sword and thrust it.A full power thrust.He held nothing back, piercing through both the steel wall and the old man, creating a giant hole in the wall.They felt the entire building shook.This time, even the employees from the casino were in a rush to escape the building.\u201cYou ----------even if you don\u2019t want this bastard, you didn\u2019t have to do that, this is our property you know\u201d Zhang Ying Hao couldn\u2019t help but yelled.\u201cProperty?\u201d Gu Qing Shan\u2019s face showed a bitter smile\u201cThis property is about to go down very soon\u201d he said.\u201cWhat do you mean? What happened?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao noticed something was amiss.Gu Qing Shan pulled him away: \u201cWe don\u2019t have time; I\u2019ll explain as we go\u201dThe two of them quickly left the casino.Gu Qing Shan looked at him and spoke very solemnly: \u201cI\u2019ll give you some advice right now\u201d\u201cGo on, I\u2019m listening\u201d seeing Gu Qing Shan so serious, Zhang Ying Hao also became serious.Gu Qing Shan: \u201cThese creatures have absolutely no value, if you run into one then immediately break its neck, blow up its head if you can\u201d\u201cDo not let it scratch you, and absolutely do not let it bite you\u201dZhang Ying Hao asked: \u201cWhat happens if I\u2019m bitten?\u201dGu Qing Shan didn\u2019t continue.Zhang Ying Hao asked: \u201cWhat happened to you? I keep feeling like you aren\u2019t quite well in the head?\u201dGu Qing Shan sighed deeply again, saying: \u201cDo your best to protect yourself, I don\u2019t want to lose a business partner\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhang Ying Hao still don\u2019t understand.\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Gu Qing Shan suddenly shouted: \u201cThat\u2019s an Infected, people who are wounded or bitten by them will become Man Eater Fiends!\u201d\u201cThe Apocalypse is upon us! Do you understand!? The ocean! Humanity itself! There will be even more of them from now on! It\u2019s changed, everything is changed!\u201dZhang Ying Hao was stunned.He hasn\u2019t seen Gu Qing Shan so distressed and angry like this before.Even after he got played by Martial Eminence Zhou Kai Wu so many times, Gu Qing Shan still didn\u2019t get this angry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d Gu Qing Shan noticed his mental state wasn\u2019t quite right and spoke again, slowly: \u201cIf you have someone dear to you that\u2019s frequently in a crowd of people, quickly go protect them\u201dZhang Ying Hao stepped closer to Gu Qing Shan: \u201cTell me, tell me that you\u2019re joking with me right now\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling the truth, I swear it on my own head\u201d Gu Qing Shan looked straight at him without backing down.Very sincerely, he said: \u201cI highly encourage you to go save them right now. Because if they\u2019re bitten, they can\u2019t be saved anymore\u201dZhang Ying Hao stood in place, then finally took in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s words after a while.\u201cMy little sister!\u201dAs he remembered, his facial expression warped.\u201cPlease make it in time!\u201dHe pressed his hand downwards, roaring: \u201cCome out, black cat! Reindeer!\u201dA large hole appeared on the ground.The black cat jumped out first.After him was a reindeer with incredibly long antlers wearing a bell on its neck.Zhang Ying Hao coughed up blood, but didn\u2019t mind it as he wiped the blood from his mouth.He jumped on the reindeer and put the black cat on his shoulder.\u201cBlack cat, lead the way to my little sister! Please run as fast as possible, please!\u201dThe reindeer lightly nodded his head, then started galloping into the air, flying.It quickly gained speed, finally became a brown streak as it jetted across the sky, flying somewhere far away.After Zhang Ying Hao left, Gu Qing Shan forced himself to calm down and figure out what he can do to counteract this.Su Xue Er is now in secluded training in her family estate, the Su family\u2019s security is guaranteed, not to mention they\u2019re on the lake island, with 4th stage Supernaturalists protecting them.There probably won\u2019t be any problem with her personal safety.Anna herself is also strong, so there won\u2019t be any problems there as well.The real problem are the citizens, normal, everyday people that have very little or no fighting strength.Gu Qing Shan took out his Holo-Brain and turned it on.\u201cImpartial Goddess\u201d he called.One second, two seconds, three seconds.\u201cI\u2019ve heard your call, what do you wish to do, sir Gu Qing Shan\u201dImpartial Goddess\u2019 voice was heard.Gu Qing Shan started to explain: \u201cI\u2019ve found a unique situation, hopefully it\u2019ll be able to gain your attention\u201dAs he remembered something, he then added: \u201cRight, if you could, connect to the President as well, I\u2019ll explain the situation to him too\u201dImpartial Goddess said: \u201cVery well, to connect to the President requires using the highest leader authority, do you authorize?\u201d\u201cI authorize\u201d\u201cReceived, connecting to the President\u201dJust a few moments later, the President\u2019s face appeared on the Holo-Brain.You could see the fatigue on his face as both his eyes were bloodshot.Gu Qing Shan can see that he physically appeared older than before.The last few days of oceanic disturbance seems to have brought a lot of pressure on him.\u201cQing Shan, Impartial Goddess said you were looking for me?\u201d the President asked with a friendly face.\u201cTo be exact, I\u2019m looking for both Impartial Goddess and you\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we talk later tonight ---------tonight I can finally go back to rest, heck, we can even have dinner together\u201d the President laughed.He then continued: \u201cI\u2019ve promised to have lunch with you a few days ago, but lately work has really been piling up, all the assistants and I have been stuck at the office\u201dGu Qing Shan smiled wryly, saying: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t make it back home tonight\u201d\u201cHm? What do you mean?\u201d The President didn\u2019t quite understand.Gu Qing Shan sighed deeply.The first thing he said made the President extremely surprised.\u201cFrom now on, I authorize the President full usage of my research results, he will have full right to use it without my permission\u201d\u201cWhat happened? Did some Aristocrat threaten you?\u201d the President\u2019s tone became strict.Gu Qing Shan shook his head, then continued: \u201cImpartial Goddess, have you recorded my authorization?\u201d\u201cAuthorization recorded. Please continue, sir Gu Qing Shan\u201d Impartial Goddess replied.Gu Qing Shan nodded, then started to explain.\u201cTwo never-before-seen viruses have appeared\u201d\u201cThe first virus is infected through wounds. The infected will lose their consciousness and obtain an immense craving for human flesh, I call it the Man Eater Fiend syndrome\u201d\u201cThis virus is inversely affected by the person\u2019 physical constitution, those that have stronger constitution will be less likely to be infected\u201d\u201cThe good news is, Man Eater Fiend syndrome will only affect the vast majority of the population, but it won\u2019t evolve\u201d\u201cHowever, aside from the Man Eater Fiend, there\u2019s another, more frightening kind of virus, and it\u2019s the one that I will talk about now\u201dGu Qing Shan stopped here a bitFuck, just what is going on with this world?Even Professionists isn\u2019t immune to the other virus.The bit his lip tightly, calming himself down a bit before continuing.\u201cThe second type of virus, will make humans change into a highly evolved Man Killer Fiend\u201d\u201cAnyone can be infected, there\u2019s no separation between royal or not, rich or poor, no matter how well your security is, aside from reaching the 4th stage of a Profession, there is no way to ensure safety from its grasp\u201d\u201cEven if you inject the Infected with a high concentration of Heroine, their brain will not secrete any Dopamine\u201d\u201cThe only thing they can do to feel pleasure is killing, and that\u2019s the only thought left in their brain\u201d\u201cAn Infected will feel a compulsive desire to kill any and all living things in their sight\u201dGu Qing Shan paused.Then he spoke the truth that made humanity fell into despair.\u201cThe virus is transmitted through the air\u201d\u201cAnd it can evolve\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

certain amount of consciousness, the stronger they are, the clearer their consciousness\u201dThe President still couldn\u2019t believe it, hesitantly asked: \u201cImpartial Goddess?\u201dImpartial Goddess went silent for a while before speaking again: \u201cBoth types of viruses has been identified in Bai Sha county Central hospital, Chang Zhou county second-level County hospital, and the Capital\u2019s Emergency Assistance Center, it\u2019s also showing signs of spreading\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s true\u2026\u201dThe President muttered, his expression was like a boxer in a boxing ring, trying to get up after receiving a straight punch, but couldn\u2019t.As Gu Qing Shan saw that he suddenly realized, the President was also just an old man.The President lifted his head strongly, looking at Gu Qing Shan: \u201cQing Shan, you\u2019re the most brilliant scientist the Confederate has had over the last couple dozen years, you have to help me, help all the innocent people\u201dGu Qing Shan went silent for a bit, then said: \u201cI will come, but not yet, right now the most important thing is that Impartial Goddess needs to take immediate measures\u201dBoth of them looked at their own Holo-Brain.Impartial Goddess suddenly spoke up: \u201cRequesting authorization from both Highest Leader, Impartial Goddess will fully take over all matters of the Confederate government\u201dThe President: \u201cI authorize\u201dGu Qing Shan: \u201cI authorize\u201dImpartial Goddess:\u201d Authorization received, the Confederate will now enter the highest state of alert, connecting to the 9 Lords, connecting to the Presidential Office, the three armies have entered Dark Red warring state of emergency\u201d\u201cBegin analyzing appropriate measures\u201d\u201cMeasures generated: 1985 types\u201d\u201cBegin selecting measure with relatively highest chance of success\u201d\u201cSelection complete\u201d\u201cMeasure selected numbered: Zero\u201d\u201cBegin the next step of intelligence gathering\u201dThe screen began to dim, and finally turned off.Even with Impartial Goddess\u2019 speed of operation, she couldn\u2019t even spare a moment for Gu Qing Shan, not even a \u201cWe\u2019ll take later\u201d.Gu Qing Shan was a bit surprised looking at his Holo-Brain, but turned it off after a few moments.As long as Impartial Goddess take notice of it early, this matter can probably be contained.She is the crystallization of all humanity\u2019s best technology, as long as she knows the reason and the specifics regarding how the virus works, she should have a chance to limit the virus from being too wide-spread.There are no guarantees, but at least there\u2019s a chance.That\u2019s already much better than the alternative.But that wasn\u2019t enough to make Gu Qing Shan any less tense.This life, from today onwards, will be completely different from his last.In the past life, the monsters and virus appeared a whole year apart from each other.Within that year, many important things were able to happen.The viruses weren\u2019t supposed to start showing up until a whole year later.As a returner that knows the future, fate really has a way to toy with Gu Qing Shan.No returner could possibly expect something that\u2019s supposed to happen a year later to happen so early.It\u2019s like the hand that\u2019s supposed to be dealt was completely washed away, making place for a new hand of cards.This time, not only will the sea monsters very quickly make it onto land, but the virus will spread at the same time.What about the other calamities?Would they also happen at the same time too?If that\u2019s really the case, the entire world will fall into ruin much sooner than before.During the past life, World\u2019s Apocalypse Online has already launched when the viruses hit, people already have the ability to travel to the other world and quickly increased their strength.But this time, the Apocalypse is already creeping upon them, yet he hasn\u2019t even seen a shadow of World\u2019s Apocalypse Online yet.If the game still hasn\u2019t launched when the Apocalypse comes, then\u2026They\u2019re done for.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s steps were heavy.This deep sense of helplessness makes him unable to stay still.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, your mood doesn\u2019t seem to be too good\u201d a soothing female voice that\u2019s like wind chimes was heard.Gu Qing Shan looked up to see Anna standing atop a wall, her crimson red hair flowing in the wind as she stared at him without blinking.\u201cAnna\u201d he called her with a husky voice.In the previous life, Anna died in an endless encirclement of high-level demons.At that time, he travelled for days on end without rest, but still didn\u2019t make it in time to save her.The situation is even worse right now, compared to before.Does he have no choice but to helplessly watch her die in front of him again?No!He can\u2019t let that happen!Gu Qing Shan suddenly remembered.Anna\u2019s first tragic fate was to begin about 1 month later.There\u2019s still a month left.But, with the entire world experiencing immense change, how could Gu Qing Shan be confident that Anna\u2019s safety would be guaranteed in the period before that?That fate nearly drove Anna to mentally collapse and suicide.No, he definitely can\u2019t let that fate befall Anna again.He can\u2019t let Anna return to the Holy Empire!The rapid changes in Gu Qing Shan\u2019s emotions showed in just a few moments, but all of it were caught by Anna\u2019s eyesBeing affected by the frenzy and sorrow in his eyes, Anna looked down, asking: \u201cWhat happened to you? Which blind son of a bitch dare to offend you, I\u2019ll go beat him up\u201dGu Qing Shan just looked at her without saying anything for a while.Being stared at like that, Anna suddenly felt her face flushed.Oh no, I didn\u2019t wash my hair today.She silently thought.Gu Qing Shan\u2019s expression suddenly changed.On the War God UI, a red light flashed in his eyes, turning into lines of text\u201cSpace-time is in chaos, the user must immediately enter the cultivation world, otherwise the space tunnel will be shut off completely, unable to open again\u201d\u201cDoes the user want to enter? YES ---- NO\u201dGu Qing Shan looked at the message on War God UI and suddenly realized.Space-time is in chaos, probably not just because of the terrifying world of monsters he saw before, but also because the world itself was changing rapidly.He didn\u2019t have much time to think, because some lines of text were flashing on the UI.\u201cPlease enter the cultivation world immediately!\u201d\u201cPlease enter the cultivation world immediately!\u201d\u201cThe tunnel is closing!\u201d\u201c15 seconds countdown begin!\u201dGu Qing Shan quickly took the time and said: \u201cNo matter what happens, do not leave the Confederate, you must absolutely wait until I return\u201dAs he said that, Gu Qing Shan also jumped on the wall, took off something from his neck and put it on Anna\u2019s.After that was done, he held Anna\u2019s hands tight.\u201cWait for me\u201dHe said.Then the screen flashed and Gu Qing Shan disappeared without a trace.Anna was stunned for a bit, looked down and took off the thing on her neckA lonely old man, holding a scythe while sitting at rest on a rock.Death\u2019s Relic, the Life Exchanging Contract.He returned it to me.Does he not know what that means?From now one, if anything were to endanger my life, he would have to pay twice the life force.Does he know?Anna stared blankly at the Life Exchanging Contract for a while.---------right, he must know, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t put this legendary object on me before leaving.Because I was willing to sacrifice my own life force to save you, that you\u2019re willing to do the same for me?Anna\u2019s lips lifted up a bit, then lowered.She lightly pouted, then smiled brightly.She has already forgotten what it\u2019s like to feel warmth after her mother passed away when she was still a little girl.Just now, she suddenly found that that feeling again.A few minutes later, a shadow ran like the wind from afar, then morphed into Feng Huo De on the wall.He asked: \u201cHave you said your goodbyes?\u201dAnna answered: \u201cNot yet\u201d\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\u201cProbably busy doing something, seems like he has a very uncommon type of God's Chosen Skill\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine then, we\u2019ll have to leave first, you can use your Holo-Brain to contact him later\u201d Feng Huo De said.Anna stood in the shadow of night, not speaking.A bit further away, a fire had started, the screams and cries could be heard even from here.And then, more and more cries of agony exploded everywhere.It was like everyone in the entire city had made an appointment to chew their food at the same time, making the same unsavory sound of chewing on meat and bones.The air was filled with a pungent smell of blood, making you feel like you were in a slaughterhouse.A deafening scream of agony was raised.It seems to have signaled something, like the next phase of something even more terrible about to happen.The air was filled with the roaring sound of engines as police shuttles were quickly dispatched.A crowd of people were screaming in fear as they ran down the streets.\u201cSeems like something isn\u2019t right, Your Highness, we\u2019re leaving now\u201d Feng Huo De said.\u201cNo\u201dAnna suddenly said.Then she added with a determined voice: \u201cI\u2019m not leaving\u201dFeng Huo De said: \u201cBut his majesty ordered us to quickly return, we have to go back right away\u201dAnna: \u201cI want to wait for him\u201dFeng Huo De shook his head in reluctance: \u201cSo what if we wait for him, all you can do is talk for a few minutes, his majesty has issued a higher-than-first-rate military recall, if we arrive late then both you and I will be severely punished!\u201dAnna slowly sat down on the wall, dangling her legs in the air.She said without care: \u201cSince he told me to wait, I\u2019ll wait for him, I\u2019m not leaving\u201dFeng Huo De sighed helplessly.Suddenly he turned around to look at the street corner.On the opposite street, there seems to be a few drunk people staggering towards them.But then they suddenly got down and ran on all fours, looking extremely unsettling as they picked up speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Worlds\u2019 Apocalypse OnlineCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslated and Edited by: La0o9Orchid HallIn the dark of night, Gu Qing Shan returned.He silently took a small bottle in hand, dropped a pill in it on his hand and swallowed it whole.This is a top-grade healing pill, capable of curing all wounds except fatigue.After two double hours, Gu Qing Shan woke up from deep meditation, as he viewed himself with inner sight, he found himself returned to peak conditions.Tapping his Inventory Bag, he took out the large suitcase with the miniature freezing apparatus attached.Opening it, he took out the piece of space monster heart.\u201cGo in\u201d Gu Qing Shan ordered.Immediately, the heart was sucked into his War God UI, into the last remaining empty slot.The slot disappeared.All the slots on the wheel has been filled in, turning into 5 spheres of light.The light gradually spread out to the entire wheel.A flashing light of text appeared on the UI.\u201cConditions has been meet ahead of time\u201d\u201cQuest: War God Thaumaturgy has been completed\u201d\u201cThaumaturgy gacha has been prepared, the user can begin breakthrough at any time\u201dIt\u2019s done!Gu Qing Shan breathed out in relief.Thaumaturgies can only be obtained when breaking through a realm when cultivators and the essence of the world are resonating. Even the System has no way to give him a Thaumaturgy prematurely.Right now, all he has to do is break through qi training realm and reach Foundation Establishment realm!Once he becomes a Foundation Establishment realm, his strength will be increased exponentiallyThat way, during the world calamities, he would at least have enough strength to protect himself.Gu Qing Shan was itching to do it right away, but stopped himself.Breaking through a realm is always a dangerous task. If you aren\u2019t careful you can easily lose your mind, all your hard work poured down the drain as you become crippled forever.Qi training to Foundation Establishment is the very first large step of a cultivator. Even with the experience from his previous life, Gu Qing Shan doesn\u2019t dare to underestimate it.In the past life, so many players, even with the help of the System, faced immense hardship when breaking through from qi training to Foundation Establishment.Countless people didn\u2019t die in the belly of monsters, but instead threw away their lives in the process of breaking through a realm.When your cultivation is higher, moving up from a high realm to a higher realm, you\u2019ll eventually have to face the Lightning Trial, a frightening obstacle to many. (1)But right now, he\u2019s a disciple of Bai Hua sect, a disciple of the Saint. What rush could he possibly be in that he can\u2019t wait until dawn to ask for help from Bai Hua Fairy?This is the surest way to do things.Not to mention, with the insight and experience of the Saint, he might be able to gain some knowledge that he didn\u2019t have while breaking through during the past life.As Gu Qing Shan decided, he sat still on the cushion and continued to meditate.Dawn comes.White goose flew into Orchid Hall.\u201cJunior brother. Ah? You\u2019re preparing to break through?\u201dWhite goose scanned Gu Qing Shan and found that his spirit energy has already reached its peak. His state also the best it could be, almost like a bow that\u2019s already pulled but haven\u2019t been released.\u201cVery well then, I knew you were at qi training stage 7, so originally I was about to give you the method to break through today\u201d white goose nodded his head.\u201cThank you senior brother\u201d Gu Qing Shan said.\u201cNo need to be so formal, let\u2019s go, first we\u2019ll have breakfast, your second brother and I will give you guidance\u201d white goose said, then turned around and flew away.Gu Qing Shan also stood up and followed him.Breakfast is eaten in the main hall of Bai Hua Palace.This is the place where Bai Hua Fairy deal with all matters big and small, but it\u2019s also where the entire Bai Hua sect go to have their breakfast.\u201cWe\u2019ll eat right here?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cNo worries, Shifu likes things to be just a bit rowdy\u201d white goose answered.Their breakfast today is Snow Spirit Flowers.This type of flower has a mild sweet flavor, very beneficial to a cultivator\u2019s soul vessel.You can use these flowers to make pills, or made into spirit cooking. Eating them for an extended period of time will help nurture a cultivator\u2019s soul vessel\u2019s flexibility.A soul vessel that\u2019s more flexible is harder to be charmed, and isn\u2019t easily wounded.One Snow Spirit Flower is worth 10,000 low-grade spirit stones.What can you do with 10,000 spirit stones?You can rent a shop front of a busy business district for a month; you can buy yourself a position in the military that\u2019s mostly odd jobs and doesn\u2019t require you to kill demons; it\u2019s enough for a single cultivator to use from qi training realm all the way to Foundation Establishment realm.Yet the bowl in front of Gu Qing Shan had a total of 5 Snow Spirit Flowers in it.This breakfast of his cost 50,000 low-grade spirit stones.He breathed in, looking at the bowls of others.Both white goose and Qin Xiao Lou had the same thing him does, 5 Snow Spirit Flowers, while Xiuxiu\u2019s bowl had 9 instead.Xiuxiu\u2019s wound on her soul still hasn\u2019t fully healed, and she\u2019s also the youngest, so that\u2019s understandable.But you can see, breakfast for the 4 of them cost a total of 240,000 low-grade spirit stones.Gu Qing Shan is so used to spending sparingly in both the previous life and this one, that when suddenly met with such luxury, he couldn\u2019t help but silently sighed.Then he suddenly remembered a line from an old poem.Painted gates have the stink of meat and wine. (2)Hmm, but flowers are vegetables, so it doesn\u2019t count, yeah it doesn\u2019t count.\u201cWhere\u2019s Shifu?\u201d Qin Xiao Lou asked.\u201cThere\u2019s some important business at the frontline, so Tianzun and Great Monk are both there, Shifu also left just this morning\u201d Xiuxiu said.\u201cA! So Shifu isn\u2019t here!\u201d Qin Xiao Lou\u2019s eyes glowed.\u201cThat\u2019s great, I\u2019ve eaten so much of this kind of stupid flower that my mouth is bland\u201dAs Qin Xiao Lou said that, he put all the flowers in his bowl into Xiuxiu\u2019s.Then he tapped his Inventory Bag, taking out a long metal skewer.Then some firewood.And then spices.And finally a skinned and washed two-horned spirit goat.\u201cEating this in the morning, wouldn\u2019t it be a bit hard to digest?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked\u201cIf you won\u2019t eat, you\u2019re free to not help me\u201d Qin Xiao Lou looked back down as he rubbed spices onto the goat.Gu Qing Shan thought for a bit, then decided to help.\u201cEating this in the morning isn\u2019t good for your stomach\u201d white goose said.\u201cIf you won\u2019t eat, you\u2019re free to not help me\u201d Qin Xiao Lou looked back down, rubbed more spices onto the goat.White goose thought for a bit, then swung his wings, arranging the firewood neatly for grilling, even the fire was already lit.Xiuxiu chewed on her flower and muttered: \u201cI want a goat\u2019s thigh, second brother\u201dQin Xiao Lou is known for being an expert at all the 6 arts, but if you had to pick one as his best, it would have to be his cooking skills.Each and every one of his dishes leave lasting impression, enough that as long as people know he\u2019ll be cooking, no one would miss it for anything.A bit laterThree people and a goose laid flat on the Bai Hua Palace floor, unmoving.They all ate too much.\u201cXiao Lou, Qing Shan is about to breakthrough\u201d white goose suddenly mentioned.\u201cHm, that\u2019s a good thing, but I can\u2019t move right now, I think he\u2019s also like that\u201d Qin Xiao Lou said as he picked his teeth with a toothpick.Hah, I still had to breakthrough today, I shouldn't have eaten so much, Gu Qing Shan remonstrated himself.\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it first\u201d white goose said\u201cOk, let me think for a bit\u201d Qin Xiao Lou answered.As they heard that, everyone left him alone and waited for his answer.After a few moments, they heard a snoring sound.White goose jumped up, kicking Qin Xiao Lou right on his face.\u201cAaaa---------\u201cA cry of agony.A while later, three people and a goose was sitting in a circle.\u201cBreaking through a realm really is dangerous indeed, I think we\u2019ll need to use some formation, plus first brother has to be there ready to protect you to ensure safety\u201dQin Xiao Lou seriously spoke with a face swollen like a meat bun.\u201cWhat about the method of breaking through?\u201d Gu Qing Shan asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that, I\u2019ll go prepare it\u201d white goose said as he flapped his wings and flew away.\u201cI\u2019ll be here to cheer for you\u201d Xiuxiu shook her little fists and said.\u201cThank you, junior sister\u201d Gu Qing Shan smiled to Xiuxiu.Breaking through a realm is very serious business, enough to mobilize the entire Bai Hua sect.--------although they only had 4 people in total.Note:(1) Lightning Trial: a very common thing in cultivation novels, also called Lightning Tribulation. Here\u2019s an excerpt from another novel that I think explains it very well: \u201cLegends say that the act of cultivation itself is going against the heaven, as humans take in the essence of the world, they gain karma, and when their karma reaches a certain breaking point, they have to face it in the form of lightning strikes from the sky. Those that survive this Trial is rewarded by the karma they faced, until one day, when enough karma builds up again\u201d.(2) Painted doors has the stench of meat and wine: this is part of an old poem. The poem is meant to say that people who can afford paint their doors are so rich that they\u2019d frequently have enough meat and wine lined up to leave a stench on the door. I think. It might have some other meanings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
