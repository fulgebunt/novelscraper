Good at deception, placation, and persuasion. Is intelligent and has excellent speaking skills. Be careful while interviewing. High possibility of getting caught up or persuaded by conversation.\u201d\u201cI never lied.\u201dThe long cry of a steamboat filled the stillness of the cabin.They were on Vehes, traveling to the island of Monte.The man was the officer in charge of transporting prisoners, and she was a prisoner, her hands bound with chains.A rat from the slums of Leoarton scurried across the desk of the handsome man in front of her.It was funny.That someone like her, who had nothing, became famous before he did. Him for a good reason, and her for a bad one.If she had to live like a rat until she died, she wanted to be a famous rat.She didn\u2019t know if it was good, but at least it was fun.\u201cYou repeated those words in the courtroom.\u201d\u201cIs there anything written on that piece of paper? Of course, the judge didn\u2019t listen to anything I had to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026Even though you were found guilty?\u201d\u201cI felt wronged.\u201dHe wrote something with an expressionless face, as if he knew it all.\u2018What is he writing?\u2019\u2018D*mn.\u2019At times like this, she was sad that she couldn\u2019t read.Even though she knew it was of no use, she met his cold eyes.\u201cPrisoner number?\u201d\u201c24601.\u201d\u201cName?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that? Does anyone here not know my name?\u201dIt was not arrogance.Wherever she went, her story was everywhere. Her face appeared in the newspaper daily.She was as famous as Ian Kerner, who was sitting right in front of her. It was not necessary to defeat enemy squadrons with great ingenuity to become famous.\u201cIt is an administrative process. Name.\u201d\u201c\u2026Rosen Walker.\u201d\u201cThe document has a different name.\u201d\u201cThat name is right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not curious about your real name. What I want you to do is to confirm the name on this document by saying it out loud.\u201d\u201c\u2026Rosen Haworth.\u201dHigh-ranked people were always savvy and never thought outside the box. Whatever that piece of paper said, she was Rosen Walker, not Rosen Haworth.That fact did not change.She propped her foot up on his desk and scratched it. Her foot, which had been chained for a long time, had formed sores.Puss from the wound dripped onto the pristine wooden furniture. As a result of scratching, dead skin cells scattered in the air like dust.She felt sorry for the owner of this cabin, but there was nothing she could do.It had been months since she had been able to stretch out like this. Vehes was originally a military supply ship, but after the war, it was converted into a passenger ship. That was why there were not many cabins, but regardless, the nice rooms were not given to prisoners.She thought he was going to say something, but surprisingly, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. She grew excited and scratched harder.What a blessing it was to be able to scratch an itchy spot as much as she wanted.It really sucked that her hands were tied. The same for her feet.\u201cAt the age of 17, you were sentenced to 50 years in prison and sent to Perrine Women\u2019s Prison. Staged a jailbreak one year later. Climbed down a cliff and crossed the Dove Mountains\u00a0[email\u00a0protected], spent three months as a fugitive in Saint-Bin-Nses before getting arrested. Sentenced to an additional 25 years in prison and transferred to the high-security Al Capez prison. Five years later, escaped again. This time you escaped the Imperial army\u2019s pursuit for a year\u2026 \u201dAs he was reading the documents with an expressionless face, his forehead suddenly wrinkled.\u201c\u2026It is written that, in Al Capez, you escaped by digging a tunnel with a spoon. Is it true?\u201d\u201cSure. I had to sleep a hundred times with a fat guard who smelled like rotten cheese just to get that spoon. His belly was so big that it suffocated me when he laid on me. It\u2019s a shame. It would have been less disgusting if I didn\u2019t have to look at his face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt took five years, but by the time I left, the long spoon had shortened to the size of my nail. It\u2019s sad. If I had stayed a little longer, I was going to beat the a$$ of that guard raw as retribution.\u201dVulgar words poured out of her mouth. She didn\u2019t know what she sounded like to Ian Kerner. She was confident that she knew men well, and from what she had seen so far, men were brutes. However, she had never dealt with such a rich and handsome young man before.A man who wore a neat uniform, had his hair neatly cut and combed, and always smelled clean from head to toe.\u201cDon\u2019t say unnecessary things, only answer the questions asked.\u201dIan Kerner raised his head. It was nice to see the shape of his beautiful eyebrows. After escaping from her cramped and unpleasant prison cell and dealing with ugly potato-like guards, she was very happy to see a handsome man. She nodded her head without saying a word.Besides, he was not just handsome. He was a war hero. He was also the face of the Empire. The famous Ian Kerner.Who didn\u2019t see his face during the war?Pasted on every surface was a flyer, depicting him riding on an airship.Whenever airships flew, flyers fell like rain. A young, tall pilot in a khaki uniform with a red scarf and goggles.The moment the broadcast with his voice rang from the sky, everyone looked up, as if possessed.[We will win. Don\u2019t give up. The war is coming to an end. People of the Empire, you don\u2019t have to worry.]Cheap paper and ink made his image somewhat indistinguishable. But even a poor-quality acoustic amplifier could not dampen his sweet voice.\u2018Cheap government b*stards.\u2019As expected, those who were in power were different. They knew how simple it was to mislead people. What would the enemy do if a broadcast told their people to surrender to the sky, promising paradise, comfort, and glory? He was an inspiration.Submission is comfortable, resistance is painful. The future is also unpredictable. People were swayed by anxiety and despair. So they needed Ian Kerner.The confident smile of the handsome and capable commander was certainly something that calmed their anxious minds.She was sure that his radiant beauty contributed at least partially to the Empire\u2019s victory. There was even a time when she was possessed by a flyer that had fallen from the sky, and hung it in her kitchen\u2026\u201cWhat is your crime?\u201d\u201cWhat did I do wrong\u201d?\u201cThe reason you\u2019re being sent to Monte Island, the worst prison on earth.\u201dHis voice cut off her flow of consciousness as soon as it hit her ears. She opened her eyes wide and shrugged with an innocent face.\u201cI escaped from prison twice. Because of me, the pride of the Imperial army was crushed\u2026\u201d\u201cNot that. Why did you end up in jail in the first place?\u201d\u201c\u2026I am innocent.\u201d\u201cAs I said, this is an administrative verification procedure. I am not interested in your argument.\u201d\u201cI am innocent.\u201d\u2018Procedure, procedure, procedure.\u2019Now she was getting irritated.She kicked his desk, dissatisfied. What she knew, he knew, and everyone knew. The people of high ranks were anxious to ask one more time. To try and get her to admit her guilt.They were not going to listen to anything she said.\u201cIt is rare for a prisoner to honestly admit that they have committed a crime.\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cSaying you\u2019re innocent doesn\u2019t erase the fact that you were convicted.\u201d\u201cJust because a judge handed down a guilty verdict doesn\u2019t eliminate the fact that I\u2019m innocent. The truth trumps all. God knows.\u201dShe took a deep breath and stared straight at him. He accepted her gaze calmly.\u201cAnswer me straight.\u201dHe spoke in a tone that communicated that he wanted to end this boring interview quickly. She felt sorry for him, as he wanted to put her back in her cell and rest, but she hadn\u2019t given up since her arrest. She responded stubbornly.\u201cI am-\u201cThen the door slammed open.\u201cCommander Kerner! What are you doing?\u201dA man, dressed in a lieutenant\u2019s uniform, stood in the doorway, a shocked expression on his face. He looked about four or five years younger than Ian Kerner, which meant he was her age. Although he looked too young to take on such serious duties, his superior, Ian Kerner, was just over 30.\u201cThis prisoner is being interviewed.\u201d\u201cNo, why are you doing that? After all, the trial of these people is over, so there is no need to listen to their nonsense.\u201d\u201cIt is proper procedure for the commander in charge of transportation to know the identities of their prisoners. This is the prisoner we should pay the most attention to.\u201d\u201cI know you are knowledgeable, Commander-in-chief, but you don\u2019t have to follow rules to the letter. Moreover, those who go to Monte Island are the worst prisoners. It is a great trouble to deal with\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s feet, clad in Imperial-style metal-soled boots, approached. Contrary to the cool, angular look of his boss, his messy and curly hair paired with his drooping eyes gave the impression that he was quite free-spirited. He pulled back her flaxy hair, which had been stuck to her face with sweat and dirt, and opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re the witch of Al Capez, aren\u2019t you? Why the hell are you interviewing such a dangerous prisoner?\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201dIan Kerner looked her up and down, startled. She knew what he was thinking. A skinny body due to lack of nutrition, and a pale face deprived of sunlight. He couldn\u2019t be afraid of her. She was chained, so even if she wielded a knife, he could overpower her with just one hand.\u201cShe escaped from prison. Didn\u2019t you hear? Even if she looks small and harmless, you must not let your guard down. She alone escaped Al Capez. You saw the report I gave you. When she was seventeen-\u201d\u201cHindley Haworth. I allegedly murdered my husband.\u201dAfter cutting off the lieutenant\u2019s words, she spoke through gritted teeth.\u201cHe was stabbed thirty-six times. The corpse was unrecognizable, and the coroner confirmed it was a crime of resentment. Even after Hindley died, the killer didn\u2019t stop attacking. They stabbed, stabbed, stabbed until he became mush. I was pointed to as the culprit. Just because we had a quarrel the night before!\u201dSilence fell. She took a deep breath.\u201c\u2026Are you married?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. You would know if I did. How common is a couple\u2019s quarrel? If there is a couple who has never had a fight, ask them to come forward.\u201dTwo pairs of eyes were glaring at her. Only the sound of a steam engine chugging and gears grinding against each other filled the room.\u201cI\u2019m not the culprit. I was a good wife who loved her husband. I was set up. I loved Hindley, but honestly, I didn\u2019t expect to spend a hundred years with him. Hindley had a lot of enemies. He said nothing was strange, even when he was hit on the back of the head by a brick. So how can you put me in jail without investigating other suspects and ignoring everything I say?\u201dThose words had been repeated many times, and her tear glands, once again, squeezed out a decent amount of water. Salty droplets ran down her cheeks. She knew she wasn\u2019t a great beauty, but she looked pitiful when she cried. Her skinny body, flaxy hair and watery eyes harmonized with each other and often aroused the sympathy of others.\u201cDo not cry.\u201dBut her reward wasn\u2019t even consolation. The meaning of his words seemed close to \u2018don\u2019t squeeze out fake tears because it\u2019s disgusting\u2019. The chill in Kerner\u2019s voice was terrifying. Realizing that her operation had failed, she quickly wiped away the tears she shed.\u2018D*mn, are my tears not working because I look so dirty? Would the outcome have changed if I had a chance to wash up?\u2019Whether it was a smart guy or an ugly guy, men always reacted the same way. This outlier was strange to her.\u201cPeople lie, but evidence doesn\u2019t. There is no one in the world who can\u2019t do that.\u201dBut the moment she lifted her head to glance at the Empire\u2019s proud hero, she knew that such a shallow trick would not work on him.Ian Kerner\u2019s expression remained unchanged.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as the verdict stands, you are guilty. The Imperial judicial system is not incompetent.\u201d\u201cBut look at this, look at my arms. I don\u2019t even have muscles. Hindley was over one meter and eighty centimeters* tall. He was big too. Do you think I could\u2019ve killed him?\u201d[*E/N: about 5 feet 9 inches]She hurriedly lifted up her chained hands. If she hadn\u2019t been shackled, she would\u2019ve rolled up her sleeves.\u201cNo one thought you would be able to break out of Perrine and Al Capez.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you did.\u201dGray eyes stared straight at her. They looked cold, with no room for sympathy.\u201cIt\u2019s the same. Just because you\u2019re a small, weak woman doesn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t have killed Hindley Haworth. There are many ways. If all the evidence points to you, you are the culprit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are lying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying! Have you ever been to jail? Did you know that jailbreaking can be done easily? I did it because I thought it was unfair, because I felt wronged!\u201dIan Kerner ignored her. He got up, grabbed the chain hanging between her wrists, and pulled her to her feet. His lieutenant looked proud of his cold-hearted boss. It was almost as if he was saying, \u2018Did you see that? He won\u2019t fall for your crocodile tears.\u2019\u201cFollow me.\u201dIan ordered. She struggled to follow his instructions. It was difficult to balance with cuffs on. As the chair slid back, her ankles hit the legs. The lieutenant caught her before she fell. It was more like an instinct than an action to take care of her.The lieutenant pushed her back again. She stumbled helplessly.\u201cHenry Reville, the prisoner will get hurt. If you\u2019re going to help her, help her properly. Our mission is to escort these prisoners safely to the island of Monte, and except in unavoidable circumstances-\u201d\u201cI know, I know. But get a whiff of this smell! D*mn, rotting corpses on the battlefield smelled better than this. Actually, I was bothered from the moment I entered the room. Commander, are you okay? I was on my way to meet the beautiful ladies having a party on the upper deck, and I was excited.\u201d\u201cOn the battlefield, we were no different.\u201d\u201cThe war is over. Besides, isn\u2019t this different? We had a hard time fighting, and this woman killed her husband while we were anxious to save even one citizen! She isn\u2019t grateful that we didn\u2019t hang her on the spot, instead, she escaped twice, wasting manpower and taxes\u2026\u201dIt was childish to insult her because she stank.If anyone didn\u2019t wash for a long time, they would stink. Whether it was a man or a woman. The beautiful ladies on the deck, Ian Kerner, or that lieutenant, who seemed very angry at her.She had a bad feeling about Henry Reville. She would remember his name. Although her hatred wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of his bright future, who knew when there would be a chance for revenge?She glared at Henry. Ian scolded him.\u201cBe careful, Reville, don\u2019t put emotion into your work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just as bad as showing more favor to a prisoner than is necessary, showing more hostility than necessary.\u201dHenry immediately bit his lip. Soon, Ian\u2019s large body obscured her view. She raised her head as he reached out to her. His hand was covered in calluses, but they were more delicate than she expected. She pondered for a moment whether to accept his help or not. Because she was as childish as Henry Reville.\u201cShe stinks. I\u2019ll keep her locked up in the stinky prison cell. Who brought her into this clean and noble room?\u201d\u201cI apologize for my subordinate\u2019s rudeness. I can\u2019t say that you don\u2019t stink, but I\u2019m used to it. Both of us are. So don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cCommander! Sir Kerner! What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cBe quiet, Reville.\u201dFor a prisoner, it was almost too polite of an apology. She bit her lip and grabbed his hand. As soon as she was on her feet, he grabbed the chain between her wrists and dragged her out the door.\u201cKeep walking. I have something to show you.\u201dShe stared intently at the back of his head. He was just doing his job, and he was doing her a favor. He must be a good and decent person. But that\u2019s not why she should be against him.He was a jailer, and she was a prisoner. They both had knives behind their backs and did fierce calculations in their heads. It was like a fight between a mouse and a cat. If you were careless, you would be caught, and the moment you let go, you would miss an opportunity or attack.Her specialty was to be cunning. No matter how strong a wall was, there was always a mouse hole somewhere. Mice are insignificant beings, but they are overlooked because of it.She made a promise as she stared at Ian Kerner\u2019s muscled back.\u2018This time, I will win.\u2019Several keys were attached to his belt. Perhaps one of them could set her free, and the other could give her a lifeboat. She just had to wait for a moment when he was distracted. As always.***\u201cIs the party over?\u201d\u201cOf course. The commander is escorting the witch of Al Capez, how could we show that to the ladies?\u201d\u201cThey are on this boat to tour Monte Island. The prisoners are all women and are bound by chains. I thought it would be interesting for them.\u201d\u201cJust because they are eccentric doesn\u2019t mean they enjoy facing prisoners. They\u2019re afraid. Not everyone in the world is as brave as you are, Sir Kerrner.\u201dHenry Reville gripped his gun tightly as he pushed her forward. Ian still didn\u2019t understand why Henry was so vigilant around her. Actually, it was kind of funny. A big bear-like man paying keen attention to the movements of a mouse-sized woman.\u201cCommander, don\u2019t let your guard down. This woman might be a witch. Was she really lucky enough to escape prison twice with such poor physical abilities?\u201dHenry whispered into Ian\u2019s ear gravely, as if he was revealing a dark secret. But he was so loud that she could hear everything.\u2018I\u2019m lucky, so what? After all, many things in the world are determined by luck.\u2019She moved slowly, pushing away the traces of the party scattered at her feet. Confetti, instrument cases and glasses.She looked at the food that was left on the table, but her hands were tied. She couldn\u2019t eat anything unless she put her head down like a dog. There\u2019s no way they would let her fill her stomach.She gave up and kept walking.Looking down from the deck, the sea looked like a black dragon. It was like a gigantic creature that wriggled its spine with each wave. It was more eerie than majestic. She didn\u2019t expect to ever see the sea in her life.The sea breeze was refreshing. Ian Kerner, who was staring at her excited face, pulled her chain. Her breath hitched, and her mood quickly subsided.\u2018Look. As expected, guards have to do something to offend prisoners.\u2019He asked, staring at her pale and dry face.\u201cThey said you escaped by digging a tunnel in Al Capez.\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cHow did you dispose of the excavated soil?\u201d\u201cI ate it. It was delicious.\u201dIan frowned. She giggled. It was funny that she had offended such a straight laced man. Ian paused for a moment and asked again.\u201cDid you really go down the cliff [email\u00a0protected]?\u201d\u201cThen should I have come down with a parachute like you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 People said you used magic. Is it true?\u201dAt that, Henry opened his eyes wide and looked at her. She snorted.\u201cIf I were a witch, would I live like this?\u00a0 I wish I was one. Then I wouldn\u2019t have gotten caught. My hands wouldn\u2019t have been tied up like this. If I could really use magic, would high-ranking officials allow tourists to board this ship?\u201dThe last successful escape from Al Capez was 36 years ago by a witch. So when the jailbreak was first reported to the press, people were convinced Rosen was a witch.Decades had passed since the steam engine was invented. The continent was lined with trains, and with steam power, they could float airships in the sky. An era where magic was persecuted and science was developing. However, traces of the old days still remained. The number of witches decreased and they hid themselves in the dark, but they did not disappear.\u201cSir, it\u2019s best not to believe her. This woman lies whenever she opens her mouth. They say she\u2019s fluent in lies. It\u2019s also mentioned in her documentation, right? When she was arrested for killing her husband, she shed tears while pretending to be pitiful, and almost deceived the entire nation.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t lie. Really.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk sh*t, witch.\u201d\u201cLook. If I were a witch, I would have sealed your lips so that you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk. I even passed the magic test. Is Sir Kerner\u2019s lieutenant so stupid that he can\u2019t comprehend objective facts?\u201dShe glared at Henry again. Henry was flushed, as if he was ashamed of being rebuked by someone like her. He pulled her chains tight and raised her voice.\u201cDon\u2019t you know manners?\u201dShe snorted, sticking out her tongue. It wasn\u2019t funny. Henry was like a child, so she didn\u2019t feel scared when he got angry. He was so hot-tempered. The battlefield was a place where the lives of children who couldn\u2019t control their boiling blood were used as a driving force.\u201cReville, stop and do what you are ordered. If you can\u2019t control your emotions and run wild, I will report it to upper management.\u201dHenry disappeared with his tail between his legs, like a scolded puppy. Only then did she understand how Henry had survived the war. He listened to the orders of his capable superior.Ian pulled her chain. She was drawn to him. When Ian and Rosen got close, he bowed down to meet her eye level. His gray eyes scanned her from head to toe.\u201cRosen Haworth, the most famous escapee in the Empire, the witch of Al Capez. Whether you\u2019re a liar, or telling the truth, a witch, or an ordinary person\u2026 I don\u2019t care. I just want to tell you a few clear facts. First, you are a convicted criminal. You are sentenced to life in prison on the island of Monte. Second, I have been ordered to take you to the island.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Third, there are prisoners who escaped Al Capez, but none have escaped Monte. No one gets out of there. Some can go down a cliff barefoot, but no one can cross the sea without a boat. Even a witch.\u201dThat much she knew. She looked down at her hands, shackled by chains. She couldn\u2019t cross the sea unless she was a mermaid. That\u2019s why she decided to escape before reaching the island.\u201cAnd it\u2019s the same before the island.\u201dThe door to the cabin opened abruptly. Henry approached, carrying an iron bowl full of red chunks. There was the heavy smell of blood. She watched them exchange knowing glances.\u2018The red meat has a lot of fat on it. Pork? Chicken? It\u2019s definitely meat, but what is it?\u2019While trying to figure out the identity of the meat, Ian pulled her chain once more. As she fell forward, she grabbed the railing on the edge of the deck. The sea breeze, which had felt refreshing a moment ago, swept down her back eerily. She screamed that she was about to fall.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\u201cLook, witch! What is the sea like?\u201dHenry shouted excitedly, whistling like a zookeeper as he poured the bloody meat into the sea. In an instant, bubbles rose in the black water, and dozens of mast-sized fins circled. The sound of teeth gnashing and flesh tearing could be heard clearly.As the blood spread, the color of the water changed. It was still not clear enough to see under the surface, but she could tell what kind of chaos was unfolding beneath the waves.\u201cHuge sharks, krakens, cannibal whales, and other unknown marine beasts that have not been recorded by academia.\u201dHe slowly raised her back up, who had turned blue and collapsed to the deck. Ian gave her detailed information in a friendly tone. How big, ferocious, quick, and fond of human flesh these monsters were.\u201cIt\u2019s breeding season, so everyone is starving. If you want to be a snack for monsters, you can go on an adventure in a lifeboat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI feel like you want this.\u201dHe untied the keys from his belt and waved them before her eyes. She realized that he knew where her eyes were headed from the beginning. Also, he wasn\u2019t very polite.She knew her image of him was an illusion.Was it because the flyers with his trusty face comforted her during the war?\u201cRosen Haworth, have you changed your mind?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think that would be best.\u201dHis face approached hers, slowly.A straight nose, curved eyebrows, and cool eyes. It was the same as the flyers. However, the smile she saw was far more dazzling than what a piece of paper could capture\u2026It was creepy.Ian Kerner was not a gentleman. A jailer couldn\u2019t be a gentleman. Throughout her life, she had never been treated as a human by these people, let alone as a lady.\u2018I\u2019ve always been a rat.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Joyful voices were heard everywhere. She tried to smile, but nausea and dizziness overwhelmed her.About 30 female prisoners were packed into a small space with no ventilation. Not only could they not go to the bathroom properly, but many got seasick. The room was full of human waste. After breathing fresh air for a while, the smell was disgusting.In the end, she vomited, making the room even more filthy.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dMaria patted her back and asked softly. They had been together since Al Capez. The time when she was captured and the time when the unconvicted woman was sentenced to go to Monte coincided. Should she call this a coincidence or a purposeful action?She wiped her mouth and frowned.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIan Kerner. Didn\u2019t you say he called you for an interview?\u201d\u201c\u2026I did.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\u201cI think it would be best not to think about escaping.\u201dMaria laughed. Her yellow teeth were revealed through the chapped lips. Teeth needed to be brushed so they didn\u2019t rot, but there was no way prisoners could afford such luxury. Rosen asked if she wanted the bad ones pulled out with tongs, but Maria said she would die anyway, and refused.\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\u201cWhat? A young, pretty prisoner went to the commander\u2019s room, who is also very young and handsome\u2026 my imagination keeps running wild. I mean, tell me in detail.\u201d\u201cAm I young and pretty? Are you saying that even when I\u2019m in this state?\u201dShe tucked her tangled hair behind her ear and chuckled. Maria shrugged.\u201cAnyway, you are the youngest among us. Did nothing really happen?\u201d\u201cIan Kerner is a very famous man. Would he really touch a filthy prisoner if he was in need of a woman?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you listen to me? Just like in Al Capez. I\u2019ve lived long enough anyway. I\u2019m old enough that I can live in a cell and go out as a corpse, but you won\u2019t, right?\u201dMaria had always been like this. Rosen knew that they would rot in prison for the rest of their lives, but on the pretext that Maria was old and Rosen was young, she always urged her to do something. Maria was the one who pushed her whenever she felt weak or wanted to give up.Digging a tunnel for five years in Al Capez would not have been possible without her help. She sighed as she looked at Maria and the other prisoners listening to their conversation.\u201c\u2026There are monsters in the sea.\u201d\u201cSo you want to give up?\u201dMaria looked at her sharply. Her fingertips soon began to tremble. Rosen glanced at her. She wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think that Maria cared for her or loved her, and that\u2019s why she helped her escape.She was called the witch of Al Capez, but it was Maria who better suited the name. If the guards controlled the prison, she was the one who controlled the cells. Anyone who displeased Maria died before they could serve their full sentence.From the beginning, Rosen was Maria\u2019s favorite. The reason was simple. She escaped from the Perrine Women\u2019s Prison, and then she was caught and transferred to Al Capez. Maria found out about her second jailbreak while she was digging under her toilet in Al Capez.After making a name for herself as a prison breaker, her life became rather boring. Ironically, she did better in Al Capez, which was worse than Perrine Women\u2019s Prison. The inmates treated her well. Their favor was strange at first, but now she understood why.\u201cAre you going to give up?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRosen firmly shook her head. There was relief in Maria\u2019s eyes.\u201cI ran away twice. There\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do three times. I\u2019ll at least try.\u201dThey wanted her to succeed. They hoped that she could live a peaceful life somewhere and destroy the pride of the Imperial Army. She was charged with murdering her husband and escaped twice. She was their idol.\u201cI thought so. Smoke this.\u201dMaria gave her a cigarette. Rosen smiled at the unexpected gift. It must have been difficult to find, as there were no supplies on the ship. She lit a match and put the cigarette in her mouth.Gray smoke rose from the tip. She thought of Hindley as she watched the hazy air. She didn\u2019t smoke until after he died. He often tried to hand her cigarettes, but she hated the smell and said no every time.But now she enjoyed it.After savoring the smell for a while, she suddenly thought of something.\u201cThe commander, Ian Kerner. Wasn\u2019t he originally a pilot?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMaria replied. She asked curiously.\u201cHe must have done great things during the war. What is he doing here? This isn\u2019t even a job in the Air Force.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he demoted because he\u2019s broken?\u201d\u201cHe looked fine.\u201dShe frowned. Ian Kerner and \u2018broken\u2019 didn\u2019t go well together. His limbs were intact, and he didn\u2019t even have an awkward prosthetic or a fake-looking nose. Although there were lots of disabled soldiers on the streets of the Empire, Ian Kerner stood before her with a perfect appearance.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be cut somewhere to be broken.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. How would I know? But war twists people in one way or another. There aren\u2019t many who can survive the chaos. I\u2019ve seen a lot. I can\u2019t always pinpoint when they get weird, but they change.\u201dMaria put her hand on her forehead and sighed. She was over sixty. That meant she lived through all the wars that took place before Rosen was born. But her stories weren\u2019t easy to understand.\u201cNot Ian Kerner. That man is brave. He is gifted, and he has many achievements. Everyone says so.\u201d\u201cIt has nothing to do with that. He\u2019s broken.\u201dMaria chuckled. Then she started poking her in the side again.\u201cMy head is spinning right now\u2026 After you sleep with him once, do you think he will give you another trial?\u201dIs hope\u2019s only purpose for people to have such absurd delusions? Besides, she had no hope that she would ever be set free. She screamed in embarrassment.\u201cIt\u2019s Ian Kerner. Ian Kerner!\u201d\u201cAll men are the same.\u201dOf course she agreed with that. In fact, she had similar thoughts until she was called to his cabin for an interview. All she had planned to do was distract him and steal keys from his belt.But she realized something after seeing him in person. He was a man who couldn\u2019t be fooled that way. Even if she managed to get him to sleep with her, he would not give her anything like the stupid guards at Al Capez.\u201cWill you look better after washing? You are too dirty.\u201dMaria grabbed her skinny body and spun it around. She pouted her lips. It was really annoying, but the sight of Ian Kerner left her with no energy to be annoyed at Maria.\u201cHe\u2019s not like that. I told you.\u201d\u201cReally? Do you have any other plans?\u201d\u201c\u2026I honestly don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dSuppose she succeeded in getting the key. It was impossible to cross the sea full of monsters in a lifeboat without an engine. She didn\u2019t think there was any other way. Maria hardened her expression and started stroking her hair.\u201cThink about it, Rosen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking. So please, let me.\u201dMaria took the cigarette out of Rosen\u2019s mouth and puffed on it. Maria was clever, quick to make decisions, and her execution was good, so she had an aptitude for politics in prison. However, her patience was too short. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person to escape.Had she been a little less hot-tempered, the most famous prisoner in the Empire would have been Maria, not Rosen.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll still be-\u201c\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dMaria looked at her, confused. It turned out that the sound was coming from outside, not from inside. Rosen looked around with a puzzled expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Running this way, that way, hiding and looking around again like they were playing spy. The soldiers who guarded them did not stay past their shift hours. The guards must have thought that it was okay because the cell was locked. It was common when shifts overlapped.The kid was hiding in the gap\u2026\u201cWhose child is she? How did she get here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. She brought my cigarettes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you threaten her with? Can you do that to her?\u201d\u201cShe wasn\u2019t even scared. What kind of threat are you talking about? I just asked for it.\u201dHer hair was neatly combed and braided. Her body was clean and injury free. She didn\u2019t think the child was a neglected one. She soon realized that the clothes the child was wearing were quite luxurious.She was a child of the upper class. If so, she was likely a child of one of the tourists.\u2018Who is her guardian? How could they let her come to such a dangerous place?\u2019She grabbed the bars and whispered.\u201cLittle girl!\u201dThe blonde child, who was bouncing around, looked back. With a sound that was neither too loud nor too soft, she began to whisper-yell at the child.\u201cYou can\u2019t stay here. Where are your parents?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShe motioned for her to go away, but the child didn\u2019t listen. Rather, when she saw her, she was more excited and ran to the door of the cell. Rosen glanced anxiously at the dirty floor. She could catch a disease, or an odor could get on her clothes.Contrary to her worries, the child babbled on, as if the scenery didn\u2019t make her sick. Children were different from adults, so if there was something interesting, they didn\u2019t care if it was dirty.\u201cI am Layla Reville, hello! May I ask you something?\u201dIt was a name she knew.\u201c\u2026 Do you know Henry Reville?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about my uncle? Do you know of my uncle?\u201d\u201cYou could even say I know him personally.\u201dShe had just met him as a prisoner.That stupid b*stard should\u2019ve taken better care of his niece when it was his time to watch her. Rosen swore she was going to tear his mouth apart the next time she saw him. She made a terrifying expression and shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that you can\u2019t come here? This isn\u2019t a children\u2019s playground. Go play on the deck or go back to your cabin. Or call your uncle.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve already bragged about it to my friends. If I come here, I can meet Rosen Walker.\u201d\u201cRosen Walker?\u201d\u201cYes, Rosen Walker. The most famous jailbreaker in the Empire! Al Capez\u2019s Witch! People said she was on our boat.\u201dOf course, her name appeared in the newspaper several times, but she didn\u2019t know she was famous enough to be known by children. Before she could say anything, the child started revealing information about herself.\u201cNo one believes me because my grandfather is the captain, so I had to go to the prison cell. I need to go meet Rosen Walker and tell the kids before Grandpa finds out.\u201dThe captain\u2019s granddaughter. She was a much more precious child than Rosen thought. She was more anxious than the child. She didn\u2019t know what would happen if she got involved with a kid like this, so she wanted to send her away as soon as possible.\u201cI am Rosen Walker. Now that we\u2019ve met, go back and brag about it. Don\u2019t stay here long.\u201d\u201cAre you Rosen Walker? Really?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe child squealed. She sounded like a dolphin. It was also loud enough for a guard to notice and come inside. If she hadn\u2019t been tied up, she would have covered her little mouth.\u201cCan you please be quiet? If you\u2019re caught here, I\u2019ll get my a$$ kicked.\u201dShe put her finger over her lips. The child covered her mouth and nodded her head. The girl\u2019s eyes still shone. She realized that she had made a mistake by revealing her identity. Rosen should\u2019ve just said she wasn\u2019t there.\u201cIs it true that you got out of jail by digging a tunnel?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cWith a spoon? Is that possible?\u201d\u201cAs long as you have enough time and patience.\u201d\u201cWow! Everything in the newspaper was real!\u201dShe tried to answer in such a dry way that the child would get bored. Unfortunately, what she had done was too interesting. Even if you recorded the simple facts of Rosen\u2019s life, it was a thrilling story.\u201c\u2026So can you really use magic?\u201dThe expectant face was sincere. She was about to say no, but Maria, who was listening to their conversation, gently nudged her. She frowned and mouthed, \u2018What?\u2019. Maria whispered.\u201cAre you a fool? Say you can use it, and get something from the child. She brought cigarettes.\u201d\u201cYou sure are proud that you asked the kid to bring you a cigarette.\u201d\u201cAre you really the woman who escaped twice? When an opportunity comes, you have to take it.\u201d\u201cIf it was Al Capez, I would have asked for a tool, but we\u2019re on the sea. It\u2019s useless no matter what that kid brings. Unless I tell her to steal the keys of her uncle\u2019s boss.\u201d\u201cWhat can\u2019t we ask for?\u201dJail drove people crazy. She, too, had been in prison for a long time, but she had enough reason to determine that Maria\u2019s dream was impossible. But since this kid had come all the way down here, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask a few questions. After glaring at Maria, Rosen lowered her voice.\u201cDid you say your name is Layla?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s Layla Reville!\u201d\u201cI have a few questions, can you answer them?\u201dThe child, who was excited to answer, unexpectedly paused. Rosen understood. It was normal to get scared when you thought a simple game had real consequences. She gently comforted the child.\u201cDo you want to see magic?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 \u201d\u201cHuh? I won\u2019t ask anything weird. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll try to answer.\u201dRosen tried to look as harmless as possible. Without even trying, she knew she looked pretty weak. She didn\u2019t look like a threat to anyone. After hesitating, the child nodded her head.Rosen raised the corners of her lips slightly. Everyone said that an easygoing appearance was a fatal weakness in this harsh world, but she thought differently.Whatever you used was up to you.\u201cYou know Kerner?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s my uncle\u2019s boss. War Hero! Best pilot! His name is Ian.\u201d\u201cAre you close?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s blunt and strict. He\u2019s not interested in me. But Uncle Henry said that he doesn\u2019t express it, but he cares about me. Because he\u2019s known me since I was in my mom\u2019s womb. I should think of him as another uncle\u2026But I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIs he married? Does he have a lover?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t even have a fianc\u00e9e\u2026 The people around him are clamoring for him to get married soon. But Ian doesn\u2019t seem to think much of it.\u201d\u2018Are you not interested in women at all?\u2019She refined the question she wanted to ask, and uttered it in a form suitable for a child\u2019s ears.\u201cHave you ever seen women come out of Ian\u2019s room? Or maybe you saw him with one.\u201d\u201cA woman? Nope. Why?\u201dFortunately, without noticing her intentions, Layla gave her exactly the answer she needed.\u2018D*mn, upper class men are all moral and neat.\u2019There was only one option left.\u201cIan Kerner\u2026 is he a compassionate person?\u201d\u201cWhat is compassion?\u201dPerhaps it was a difficult word for a child, and Layla opened her eyes wide.About half of her life she struggled to get compassion out of people, so when the child asked what it was, she couldn\u2019t answer. The heart made people careless, and she had come this far by using countless hearts. That was all she could say.\u201cA feeling of pity for someone, sweetheart.\u201dMaria cut through the silence, and responded with a cheerful voice.\u201cLetting a dog in from the rain. Holding the hand of a child with a fever and praying. Bursting into tears when someone else is crying. That\u2019s compassion.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s pity, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s pity too.\u201dMaria\u2019s long explanation was abbreviated by the child\u2019s words. Maria nodded with a caring smile, but Rosen only smiled bitterly.It wasn\u2019t Layla who didn\u2019t know what compassion was, it was her.The compassion that Maria and Layla experienced was different from hers. Even though they were called by the same word and fell within the same category\u2026The soil that made different people\u2019s hearts grow varied. The people she had met weren\u2019t pure of heart. What they had was too ugly to even be called a heart.\u201cIan\u2026 I don\u2019t think he likes anyone that much. He is not very friendly.\u201d\u2018As expected.\u2019She remembered those gray eyes that were indifferent even when she cried. Ian Kerner was a soldier and a warrior. Being sympathetic was a flaw for soldiers. If he were such a person, he would not have been able to survive the war.Layla, who was monitoring her expression, added hastily. Was she afraid that she would think badly of him?\u201cStill, I think Ian is a good person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is a hero who saved us all\u2026\u201dLayla was worried about nothing.\u2018I mean, it doesn\u2019t matter what I think of Ian Kerner.\u2019Even if she cursed Ian Kerner until her throat tore, his honor would not be tarnished.No one would listen to a witch\u2019s words.Besides, she didn\u2019t hate Ian Kerner. She rather liked him. Ian was a hero to her. Just because he was not as kind as she thought did not change her mind.The only reason she was planning to trick him was because he was a guard. If it weren\u2019t for this situation, she would probably be doing something silly to get his attention and talk to him.\u201cThank you, Layla. That\u2019s enough. Now it\u2019s my turn to keep my promise.\u201dShe reached through the bars. Even though the bars were set at close intervals, there was enough space for one of her wrists to pass through. Layla looked at her hand and flinched. Rosen tried to calm the child.\u201cDo I have a lot of scars on my hands? It\u2019s just that I burned them while working in the kitchen.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t they hurt?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine now because they\u2019re old scars. More than that, since I don\u2019t have anything, can you give me something? Even a small thing is fine.\u201dLayla\u2019s big eyes moistened. She was a compassionate child.Were all children like that?Layla rummaged through her pockets and shook her head.\u201cI have nothing. Just a few coins.\u201d\u201cA coin? That\u2019s enough.\u201dLayla put a coin in the palm of her hand. Rosen stared at the slightly rusted copper coin.\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d\u201cMagic always needs a medium.\u201dShe answered like a skilled storyteller, and Rosen spread her palms out in front of her. Seeing her empty palms, the child exclaimed.\u201cThe coin is gone!\u201d\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t go away.\u201dShe smiled and stretched out her chained hands as far as she could, bringing them close to Layla. She pretended to pull something from behind her ear, making the coin reappear.Layla couldn\u2019t even utter an exclamation this time. Rosen was a little surprised by her innocent face, her mouth wide open. She smiled.\u201cCome on, take it. It\u2019s a lucky coin.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a secret, but it will turn into gold by sunset.\u201dThat much was enough to send the child back. Layla excitedly put a coin in her pocket and left the room. Rosen took the cigarette back from Maria and inhaled deeply.\u201cDid you really use magic?\u201dMaria asked playfully.Rosen smiled mischievously.\u201cYou know I didn\u2019t. It was a simple trick. Not even as good as a street magician. When the sun goes down, she\u2019ll notice, \u2018Oh, I was fooled.\u2019 But it\u2019ll be too late then. I\u2019ve gotten all the information I needed.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Walker\u2019s consistent argument that she can\u2019t lie?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026How shameless. If I were a real witch, I would have caused a prisoner\u2019s rebellion and escaped.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s water everywhere. Where would I go?\u201d\u201cIt would be unreasonable to sail in a lifeboat, but there is a place to go. The island of witches, Walpurgis. It\u2019s not far from Monte Island.\u201dMaria knew she was talking crazy, so she burst into laughter after she finished speaking.She inserted cold truths in the middle of her wide smile.\u201cEven if the power of the witches has decreased, it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s their last refuge. If anyone from the general public approached, their bodies would be torn apart before even landing on the island.\u201d\u201cI know, I was joking.\u201d\u201cYeah, good one.\u201dShe laughed quietly. Maria narrowed her eyes and tried to say something more, but Rosen waved her hand to stop her. She was about to start a conversation that had already been tediously repeated.\u2013 Did you really kill your husband?\u2013 I didn\u2019t kill him.\u2013 Are you really a witch?\u2013 Do you think I\u2019m a witch?\u2013 You sound frustrated. I\u2019m not a judge, so why don\u2019t you be honest with me? Tell me, did you kill him?\u2013 Do you think I killed my husband?\u2013 Everyone else thinks so.\u2013 I really didn\u2019t kill him.\u2013 That\u2019s what everyone says in prison.Maria always smiled meaningfully with an expression that she knew everything. She didn\u2019t necessarily deny or believe her words. There was no need to spill tears like she did in the courtroom. It made no sense. Whether she lied to Maria or not, nothing would change.There was no need to change her argument.\u201cLies work well on kids, Rosen.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI wish you could do the same to Ian Kerner. What do you think?\u201dRosen realized that Maria already knew her thoughts about him.\u201cMaria, I was thinking\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d\u201cI want to talk to Kerner.\u201dIan wouldn\u2019t want to sleep with her. Maybe until the end.But he was a soldier, a hero, a pilot.That meant\u2026he was used to looking down on everything. What did it feel like to breathe in the air above everyone\u2019s heads? How small and insignificant did the world look from the sky?His life was a series of victories. Ian Kerner was addicted to it.\u201cHow helpless, easy, and powerless the witch of Al Capez is. How easy it is to have her. How interesting the night you spent with her can be.\u201dMen liked poor women. Surprisingly, appearance didn\u2019t matter that much. They were attracted to women whose eyelashes were wet by tears rather than pretty and confident women. Endlessly helpless\u2026They loved the position, not the woman. That\u2019s why they wanted a woman who they could pet and cuddle, then wield and trample as they pleased.That was their compassion. It had a completely different meaning from what Layla and Maria knew. She just had to prove it. She was the kind of woman who could never defeat anyone, and who would only give them a sense of conquest.She was able to match Ian\u2019s level. She could be an infinitely humiliated person. Actually, that was her specialty.She could be a poor rat, crouching, tears in her eyes, with trembling hands and feet.\u2018Please save me. Even though I look rough, I\u2019m actually very weak. Have pity on me and do something for me. I need you to conquer me. Then I can win this time too.\u2019She believed that conquering was a sweeter and more addictive emotion than love.And it was a much easier feeling than love.A moment of humiliation could be tolerated.Because ultimately, she would win in the end, and have the last laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s more fun to travel through a sea of monsters to the island of Monte than to look at scenery. Those who haven\u2019t been to the military don\u2019t know how precious a peaceful life is.\u201d\u201cAfter the war, you\u2019ve become a geek, Henry.\u201d\u201cIf this is being a geek, I\u2019m a geek.\u201dHenry snorted at Ian\u2019s teasing. When they first entered the military academy, the old officers always said \u2018Look at these boys that have never been in a war!\u2019. It was annoying at the time, but after the war, he understood.How could a person who had never escaped from a crashing plane discuss his life? What could be more difficult than drowning in the open sea or surviving twelve hours with only a life jacket?Ian responded with an indifferent expression.\u201cThe army tells us that we are children. What do pilots know, who only looked down on the battlefield? Can you call a man a soldier if he has not crawled into the heaps of his dead companions in a wasteland of bullets and shells?\u201d\u201cDo crazy b*stards talk like that to Sir Kerner? They\u2019re half lost without us! Those ignorant old folks who don\u2019t even know how important the sky is to war\u2026 We worked hard to save them, and they don\u2019t even thank us!\u201dHenry grabbed the iron railing as they walked down the stairs. The strangely built stairs vibrated and shook unsteadily. Ian sighed as Henry raised his voice again, unable to overcome his temper.\u201c\u2026 You must learn to put yourself in other people\u2019s shoes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to learn that. What is the point of living in a world where it is too much to live alone?\u201dHenry clenched his jaw and stared blankly around the engine room. Coal piled up on a conveyor belt was thrown into a huge, burning furnace. The coal made flames, the flames boiled water to make steam, and the steam created power that fueled engines.It was a boring landscape.Henry looked over at his superior, who was standing as straight as a pillar.Ian Kerner spent most of his time in the engine room. If he wasn\u2019t in his cabin, he was in this humid and steamy space. His eyes were always glued to the heart of the ship; the engine glowing red like a huge sun.\u2018How many hours have you stared at this?\u2019To be honest, Henry hated the engine room. He wouldn\u2019t have ever come here if it weren\u2019t for Ian. After the war, he felt sick to his stomach just looking at the color red. He even threw away his red clothes and only wore blue. Moreover, what was appealing about a huge engine that made grating sounds?Of course, Henry wasn\u2019t always like this.There was a time when he, too, was fascinated by the new energy that powered the world. In a world where you could fly without magic\u2026 How wonderful it was! Even a few decades ago, there were airships, but witches were essential to launch them.Naturally, there were only one or two airships in each country. They were for events, not battles. Once a year, they were launched during the harvest festival. Henry\u2019s childhood revolved around those beautiful airships he saw at the festivals he went to with his parents.-Can I fly an airship like that?-Now, even if you\u2019re not a witch, you can drive an airship. By the time you become an adult, ships will move not by magic, but by steam.-Really?-The age of magic is over. Now everyone will be able to fly. We don\u2019t need witches anymore.\u201cThat woman, the witch of Al Capez.\u201dAs soon as he said \u2018witch\u2019, Ian looked at Henry with pitiful eyes. It was as if he was saying \u2018This again?\u2019.Did he think she was helpless just because she was shackled by chains?Henry didn\u2019t care. What was wrong with being careful? Even with such an indifferent face, he knew his superior couldn\u2019t get rid of the uneasiness that remained in the corner of his heart. The military academy drilled the perpetual fear of an attack into them.\u201c\u2026 She said she was also from Leoarton.\u201dLeoarton.Ian immediately responded to the name of the city. He furrowed his brow, withdrew from the railing, and turned his body completely toward Henry.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me with those eyes. Leoarton, Leoarton, Leoarton. I\u2019m fine now, d*mn it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyway, yes. Rosen Haworth is from Leoarton. She must have committed a crime while living in the slums nearby.\u201d\u201cYes, because it\u2019s in her documentation. So I\u2019m telling you, I think that\u2019s why you care about her. You even interviewed her separately.\u201dLeoarton.It was the name of the city that was devastated by bombs during the last war. They couldn\u2019t even call it a city anymore. All that was left were the remains of blackened buildings, and countless bodies buried so deep in the ground that they could never be recovered.It was the hometown of Ian Kerner and Henry Reville, and where they attended military academy. It was also the place where he first flew on an airship.\u201cIn a sense, she\u2019s an annoyingly lucky girl. She escaped from the city, escaped death.\u201d\u201cAnyway, she\u2019s a prisoner. It\u2019s a life sentence.\u201d\u201cYou saved my life back then. It\u2019s thanks to you that I\u2019m alive right now. You have become a total celebrity,\u00a0 and I\u2019m on my way to Monte Island under Sir Kerner\u2019s escort.\u201d\u201cYes, Henry. Monte Island. Don\u2019t you know what that means?\u201dIan spoke sharply and glared at Henry. Monte was a punishment worse than the death penalty. The Empire didn\u2019t save the witch, but pushed her into a pit worse than hell. Hard labor and torture over minor mistakes, starvation and poor conditions. The prisoners there never served their full sentences, and only left as corpses.\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re alive!\u201dUnable to contain the emotion that erupted while he was speaking, Henry started raising his voice again. Henry sometimes violently poured out his emotions, not directed at anyone in particular. It was a habit from the war.Ian carefully listened to Henry every time. He didn\u2019t say much until it was over, unless he was asked directly.\u201cThe war hero escorts the witch of Al Capez to the island of Monte. I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. A soldier obeys orders.\u201d\u201cSir Kerner, after this job, you will immediately advance to a key position, right? Maybe a minister? It\u2019s no joke to have so many achievements, especially in the military.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk vaguely. The only people in the Empire who hate Sir are the homeless and Leoarton. What are we fighting against right now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. Why did they entrust you with this kind of work?\u201dIan glanced at Henry, who was speaking passionately on his behalf. It was ironic, but after the war, those who opposed Ian Kerner were his fervent supporters during it. Their lives in ruins, they ground their teeth and poured out their hatred for Ian Kerner.\u201cIn a nutshell, you couldn\u2019t protect Leoarton, so they\u2019re asking you to punish a witch from there. They say that if you drag that b*tch to the ghastly island of Monte, they will support you again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe military and the government knew that and ordered this. Ian Kerrner has to be the perfect hero of the Empire. Flawless.\u201dIan narrowed his eyes. His words were burdensome. He tried to stop Henry\u2019s chatter, but he hesitated, reflecting on the psychologist\u2019s advice.\u201cJust finish this, and live a comfortable life. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\u201cA light\u2026\u201dHe was the hero of the war, and people admired him. After the war, he realized that fact only when he passed through the Arc de Triomphe* in uniform. People gathered in crowds, shouting his name. Colorful petals were thrown onto the road he walked on.[*E/N: The Arc de Triomphe is a famous monument in France. It was built to honor those who passed during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.]But was he happy in that lively landscape? Was his heart full?How did he look when he passed through the Arc?Suddenly, anxiety crept into his chest.He should have smiled. Did he?A commander should always have a confident smile on his lips. But he couldn\u2019t remember the expression he had made. Henry spoke hastily, as if he had noticed his senior\u2019s dark thoughts.\u201cYou can\u2019t protect everyone. Who achieves perfect victory? Sir is not a God. The commander has always had to choose the lesser evil, and everyone knows that. They don\u2019t really hate you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone expected too much of Sir Kerner\u2026 that\u2019s all.\u201dIan lifted his head, clearing his thoughts. He climbed the iron stairs slowly, leaving Henry behind.He had to get out of the engine room. When he looked at the steam engine, futile thoughts consumed his mind. It was not good to think too much. Bad decisions came from ignorance. If you started to think, understand, and put your heart into something, you wouldn\u2019t be able to take a single step forward.A commander shouldn\u2019t be like that. So, he tried not to think about the war. It worked to some extent. He had broken away from that hellish road and stood here today with a healthy body.But he was no longer a commander or a pilot.The moment he felt the gravity of the earth, and the moment he realized he was no longer holding a control stick in his hands\u2026 his legs moved outside of his control and carried him to the steam engine.Ian Kerner was no longer anything.\u201cCommander.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. The war is over, I am no longer a commander.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s become a habit, Sir Kerner. Anyway, don\u2019t worry about Rosen Walker. I\u2019ll threaten her more myself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it, Henry. Don\u2019t worry about it. Concentrate on healing.\u201dIan stopped and shook his head resolutely. Henry bit his lip, stopping himself from saying more. Ian knew what Henry was going to say anyway.-I am no longer a patient. You don\u2019t have to take care of me like you would a newborn baby. I\u2019ll find my way on my own, so, Sir, get back on your airship. Follow the light.No, Henry was a patient. He was a butterfly with broken wings. No matter how much Henry insisted, that fact did not change. The talented young pilot was no longer allowed to board an airship. Not because his limbs were blown away, but because the memories of war broke his mind.Leoarton\u2019s cadets were no longer laughing and flying at 35,000 feet. The only thing that was left was young and wounded soldiers who couldn\u2019t climb up the three flights of stairs due to their heart beating and shortness of breath. All they could do was sit on the decks of sea-shackled ships with naval armbands, smoking.And it was he who ruined Henry Reville in the end. Ian Kerner. He didn\u2019t just destroy Henry. All of the squadrons he led were allowed back into the sky except for one man, Henry Reville.Many said it wasn\u2019t his fault, including scientists and military strategists. All the operations the military gave his squadron were crazy gambles, and without him, the government would have wasted all their resources on a war they couldn\u2019t win.But those words were not comforting at all.Leoarton. The city he couldn\u2019t protect.Ian Kerner closed his eyes as an unbearable headache rushed in. He remembered his duties.-Transport the prisoners to Monte Island. In particular, keep an eye on Rosen Haworth.Rosen Haworth\u2019s name seemed to clear his mind. Funnily enough, he thought it was fortunate that Rosen was the most troublesome prison breaker in the Empire. There was nothing that distracted him as well as a nuisance.He was deliberately paying attention. The justification was sufficient. Rosen Haworth was a felon that had been the focus of the Empire\u2019s attention. Moreover, she was so cunning that she managed to escape twice.He dug into, recorded, inquired, interrogated, and ignored. He blocked opportunities for her to escape. He interviewed her separately and even threatened her.If Rosen felt her sentence was unfair, he had nothing to say. It was true that he had a lot of personal feelings about the matter, and it was true that there was an obsessive side of him.He was most at ease seeing Rosen\u2019s face among the people on the ship. He felt relieved. Of course, Haworth was a ruthless murderer with no remorse for killing her husband, she brazenly cried, told ridiculous lies, and often offended his temper, but\u2026Still, it was better to endure all of that than to face Henry. It was much more comfortable than facing those who approached him as a hero.Rosen Haworth, whom he met face-to-face, was hectic, frivolous, and talkative. In addition, he didn\u2019t know whether she was smart or stupid, quick-witted or slow-witted\u2026 She was much stranger than he imagined. Time went by quickly when he watched her.He stared blankly at Rosen Haworth like a child watching hermit crabs in an aquarium. How they wriggled, struggled, and moved between large conch nests. Rosen was from Leoarton, but neither of them were in Leoarton on that nightmarish day.He was from Leoarton and was alive.He survived that day by simply changing the direction of his airship. That alone was reason enough for him to observe Rosen Haworth.Watching the survivors of the city he destroyed had always given him a strange sense of security. In addition, Rosen Haworth was full of energy. With a fine face that was neither discouraged nor broken, he even felt a little amused when she tried to trick him.He felt like he was holding a hermit crab and showing it off, shouting like a child.-Look at this. It\u2019s alive!At the end of his endless thoughts, Ian came to an embarrassing conclusion. He looked down at his watch and held his breath for a moment.\u201cIs someone bringing Haworth to my cabin right now?\u201d\u201cWhat? I think so. You said you\u2019d be interviewing her at this hour, and you told them to take her there.\u201dIan got frustrated. There was something left on his desk. Henry, noticing his hardened expression, shouted in amazement.\u201cDid you leave the key?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201dIan Kerner didn\u2019t answer. Henry called after him as he turned around and walked hastily.\u201cSir Kerner!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interview time. I forgot.\u201d\u201cYes? Need to run? You\u2019re also concerned, right? Because Rosen Walker is from Leoarton!\u201dAt the end of the sentence, doubts lingered. Whenever Ian talked about Rosen, Henry became as anxious as a puppy. Ian knew what he was worried about. He wanted to pour cold water over Henry\u2019s head.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Whatever you are worried about, it is not what you are thinking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, this is the last time.\u201dHe exhaled like a promise and hurried back towards his cabin, where Rosen was waiting. It was true that an interview with a prisoner was liberating for him. But he shouldn\u2019t pour his emotions into his work. It was like a war; an interview that needed to be finished before it got too long.He didn\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking, bringing his emotions all the way here.Ian gathered the emotions that had piled up and swept them into the black hole of his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how important a prisoner was, Ian Kerner didn\u2019t interview that often. She thought Ian was not wary of her, but apparently he was. He called her in and gave her a lecture on dangerous marine life every day.At first, she dragged on their interviews, but after a few days, she got tired of it. He had a knack for making things terribly boring, and he ignored her whenever she tried to change the subject.Sometimes she thought that it would be better to dig a tunnel. At least then, progress would be visible day by day.\u201cSharks are-\u201d\u201cPlease stop. I get it. To summarize, thinking about escaping from here is f*cking stupid. Do you think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s little difference between the stupid and the hero. Neither of them thinks about the future. If you start thinking about escape, you won\u2019t have the courage to do it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any thoughts?\u201d\u201cNot brave ones.\u201dHe spoke calmly, flipping through the papers on his desk.\u201cSome prisoners\u2026 Some people thought you were a hero. Right?\u201dHis expression was calm, but his tone was strangely sarcastic. She had lived her whole life being ignored, so she was sensitive to such things.She shot back immediately.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I\u2019m a fool?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a long way off from when you escaped from prison.\u201dShe glared at him and kicked the desk. When your hands were tied, the ways you could express your dissatisfaction was limited.The desk shook violently. The nib of his pen twisted and scraped the paper. Without a reaction, he took out a new piece of paper and calmly rewrote letters that she couldn\u2019t read.\u201cDon\u2019t be violent.\u201d\u201cYou said I was stupid.\u201d\u201cYou asked.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other so many times that we\u2019re not unfamiliar with each other, right? Let\u2019s talk openly. Should I have served 50 years straight? I think that\u2019s even more foolish.\u201dHe stared at her for a long time, as if she was funny. It was the biggest interest he\u2019d shown her in the past two weeks. And it was clear that it wasn\u2019t out of sympathy. It was the first time she had seen a man like him in her life.At first, she didn\u2019t mean to be treated as a mysterious creature by him.In order to play the role of a poor woman, she cried, no matter what he said to her. She tied her tangled hair into a ponytail, wiped her face with a towel she had stolen, and responded to his interviews. She often sent him subtle and sticky glances, and gently lowered her upper body to expose her chest\u2026He didn\u2019t even look at her. He didn\u2019t even bother to understand what she was trying to do.She was confused by his moral character when he didn\u2019t hand her a handkerchief while she cried. But now, she didn\u2019t know what was worse; a callous man who ignored a crying woman, or a crying woman who was trying to elicit sympathy through her tears.He was more interested when she talked than when she cried.So she decided to do what he wanted.\u201cThen what should I have done?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re smart. Tell me.\u201dHe let out a low sigh and raised his head. Surprisingly, that was how he showed his interest.He stared at her.\u201cIf you had confessed your crime when you were first sentenced, your sentence would have been commuted. If you had done well in prison, you might have been able to apply for parole before serving your full sentence, or you could have been transferred to a more comfortable prison.\u201d\u201cThen I would have been dead. I would have never gotten out of Leoarton.\u201dShe laughed, ignoring the chilly atmosphere.\u201cI was joking, wasn\u2019t it funny?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, in the first place, I don\u2019t know why an innocent person has to spend 50 years in prison.\u201d\u201cThe crime of murder ranges from 8 to 50 years. It\u2019s written in the law.\u201d\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t kill him, but let\u2019s say I did. Why 50 years? Charlie, who lived next door, beat and killed his wife, eight years.\u201dHe ignored her protest and pointed to the bookshelf.\u201cThe reason is written in the law.\u201dShe saw a thick book covered in cowhide. She quickly lowered her eyes and spoke in a soft voice.\u201cI can\u2019t read. I was not educated.\u201d\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t that why I told you with my mouth? It\u2019s written in the law.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end, you were sentenced to life imprisonment on Monte Island, which was purely your own fault. Rather than reflecting on your sins, you escaped from prison twice and deceived the Empire.\u201dHe threw the papers into a drawer and stood up. It seemed to mean that the possibility of her innocence was not worth considering. He seemed to regret talking to her about irrelevant topics for a while.She shouted with hope. If she missed this opportunity, she didn\u2019t know when they would talk again. She didn\u2019t want to take his marine biology lectures one-sidedly anymore.\u201cWait, wait! Hear my story!\u201cThe interview is over. Go back.\u201dHe pulled her chains. She got up helplessly from the chair and shouted loudly. Soon the door would open, Henry Reville would come in, and would throw her back into her cell. Now was the only chance to do some bullsh*t that would get Ian Kerner\u2019s attention.\u2018Think about it, Rosen. What do you have to say to get Ian Kerner interested in you?\u2019\u201cThen are you an idiot too?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThe difference between a hero and an idiot is one decision! Then isn\u2019t it the same for you and me? You are the hero of the light, I am the hero of the dark. Both are complete idiots. What\u2019s the difference?\u201dThe force holding her chains loosened. Ian Kerner had a subtle expression. She didn\u2019t know if he was excited or angry. She just said whatever came to mind.\u201cNo one believed we would win the war. We are a small country with only a grand name, and our opponent was Talas, who had already devoured many countries! That\u2019s why everyone ran away from the military. No one wanted to be a soldier of a defeated country. My husband ran away, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWho didn\u2019t know that Talas took people in before the war began? Elites like you are highly skilled workers. Honestly, it would be better to be treated as a war hero in Talas than being swallowed by them.\u201d\u201c\u2026We won in the end.\u201dHis jaw was tense. Ian\u2019s eyes burned with anger and hostility. But it didn\u2019t matter. The fact that she did something to elicit that reaction was important in itself.\u201cYeah, we won. So, did Talas fail? They just stepped down because they thought fighting would do more harm than good. I\u2019m relieved that our country hasn\u2019t been captured yet. On the other hand, what did we get? A humble and shallow patriotism? People were killed and land was destroyed. And you, the hero, wear shards of medals on your uniform, and escort meager prisoners.\u201d\u201c\u2026Shut up.\u201d\u201cYou call that victory? You must be so proud, right?\u201d\u201cI told you not to talk freely.\u201d\u201cWhy is the war hero doing this now? Aren\u2019t you broken too? Have you become an eunuch*? Like an idiot lying on the street?\u201d[*E/N: a man who has been castrated, especially one employed to guard women\u2019s living areas in an oriental court.]She didn\u2019t stop being sarcastic. He pulled her chain. She was dragged towards him like a dog. The medals on his chest drew closer, and her body was completely engulfed by his shadow.She believed that at that moment, he would raise his hand and slap her. Maybe he would trample her down with a baton. And, honestly, she thought that wouldn\u2019t be too bad. Violence by men was often accompanied by s*xual acts. With just a little bit of patience, she might get a chance to get into his bedroom.\u2018That\u2019s okay. I\u2019m used to the pain\u2019\u201cRosen Haworth.\u201d\u2026But Ian Kerner betrayed her expectations. He didn\u2019t hit her or trample her. He just stared at her and called her name in a cold voice.\u201cYou are right. But you don\u2019t deserve to say that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the skies of my motherland, my comrades died and were wounded countless times. As always, history will not remember them. But despite knowing this, they gave up their young lives to protect the people of the Empire. Including people like you who are mean, cowardly, run at the first sign of danger, and live only for their own comfort. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d appreciate it. But at least-\u201dHe paused, as if suppressing his anger.\u201cAt least you shouldn\u2019t have insulted them. You don\u2019t know war. You were a civilian under the protection of soldiers, and besides, you were in prison the whole time. During the war, it was paradoxically the safest place.\u201dShe didn\u2019t quite agree with him. But she didn\u2019t have the heart to come forward and respond. Ian Kerner was offended by her words.Her goal had been achieved.He was just disappointed. Angry, he reacted completely differently from what she had expected. Everything went terribly wrong.\u201cNot everyone lives like you. Some people seek something more than their own interests. And the world is maintained by them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want you to know that. Don\u2019t make me mad. Stop playing tricks I can see through. If you want sympathy, you\u2019d better find someone else. Your lies are too shallow to deceive me.\u201dIan, who returned to his indifferent expression, stared at her. He seemed to be daring her to say it again. If he were a stranger, she wouldn\u2019t be able to repeat the ridiculous lies about his dead companions.But unfortunately, she was a woman who had long since abandoned her shame and conscience.\u201c\u2026I did not lie.\u201dShe repeated what she always said. The long conversation they had been having, in fact, was only a variation of that one phrase.\u201cI am not lying.\u201d\u201cYou, in a really negative sense, do not deviate from expectations.\u201dHe was right. It was an absurdly shallow to appeal to faith. She didn\u2019t want to persuade him either. Because Ian Kerner wouldn\u2019t believe her. So, she tried to stimulate his desire to win and conquer.\u201cI\u2019ve fully figured out what kind of person you are. There will be no more interviews.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t explain it again. I think you understand.\u201d\u2026She failed cleanly, though.Clink ClankA stronger chain was shackled around her wrists. The old iron rings fell to the floor noisily. It was also the sound of her fragile hopes and expectations crumbling. She held back the desire to dig in her heels and stay in his cabin.Ian silently opened his cabin door. He was too gentlemanly to kick someone out. She knew it was just a habit of upper-class men. Even Henry Reville, who had sworn at her, caught her as she fell. Still, she thought it was annoying.That meaningless etiquette, combined with Ian\u2019s handsome face, which was pasted throughout the Empire as a symbol of victory, took away her sense of reality for a moment.\u201cActually, there is no need for chains on the sea. Hell is everywhere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNevertheless, you are standing here, immobilized by shackles. That is the weight of your sins. The sin of making a living person disappear from the world.\u201dSomehow, one person could speak in two wildly different ways. One of his broadcasts during the war played in her mind.[You can relax. No one will be able to hurt you. When the air raid alarm rings, turn off your lights, go to the basement, turn on the radio, and listen to the broadcast. You just have to wait. I am always guarding the skies of the Empire. For you. Until the end of the war, until we all go back to our peaceful lives and forget all of this\u2026]She heard his voice too much. He was her jailer, and she was his prisoner\u2026\u2018I mean, it keeps getting weirder.\u2019If he kept talking to her, she thought something warm would pour out from between those lips. But it would never happen, because she was a crazy woman who was mesmerized by his shining appearance.There was a time when his photos and his voice were her only comfort.\u201cYou really\u2026\u201dHe raised an eyebrow. He looked like an icy sculpture, who wouldn\u2019t bleed even if he was stabbed.But, unexpectedly, he waited patiently for her to finish speaking.With the feeling of a prisoner on death row who was allowed to say her last words, she glared at him and spat out.\u201cYou really are an idiot.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She would probably never get in again. Because of that, the salty wind didn\u2019t feel as refreshing as it did yesterday. It was pathetic.She comforted herself by chewing her lip.\u2018Don\u2019t be frustrated, Rosen. There will be another opportunity. There always is.\u2019She was shaking her head, wondering what to do, when she heard a snort.\u201cUgh. How are you?\u201dHenry, clutching the chains tied to her handcuffs, smiled twistedly. Then he examined her from head to toe. With a shameless expression, she raised her head and shrugged as if nothing was wrong.\u201cI tied back my hair and washed my face\u2026 If there was something red, I would\u2019ve painted my lips with it. I\u2019m worth seeing after I tidy up. Aren\u2019t I pretty?\u201cDelusion is also a disease. You smell so bad, it\u2019s useless.\u201d\u201cIf my smell is the problem, then that means I\u2019m pretty.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t try to be funny!\u201dHenry snorted, even louder this time.\u2018He laughed so hard that he snorted.\u2019She smiled. Children didn\u2019t know how to hide their emotions. When they denied how they felt, it exposed their inner feelings even more.\u201cWhat trick did you pull this time?\u201d\u201cI play tricks? Why don\u2019t you behave politely? That\u2019s hardly a nice thing to say to a Lady.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend. No matter what your tricks are, you\u2019re not going to escape.\u201dHenry raised his chin and brushed back her hair. She desperately tried to hold back her laughter.\u201cDo you know what tricks I can play?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know! Well, something like\u2026 this.\u201dHenry blushed. With his back to the deep, black, and distant sea, she stared at his large form. She wondered if it was quite a shock to him that Al Capez\u2019s witch was more ordinary than he expected?\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Are you talking about a man and a woman spending time together\u2026?\u201d\u201cHey! Shut your mouth.\u201d\u201cDo you want to sleep with me? I think so, because you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s a trick or not. Right?\u201d\u201cHey! Hey! Hey!\u201dHenry\u2019s ears, along with his face, were red. Whether it was because he was angry or because he was embarrassed, it didn\u2019t matter.\u201cAm I threatening you to sleep with me? Any man who passes up on this opportunity is an idiot. It\u2019s okay for you to reject me, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy our time together. Don\u2019t you trust your boss? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo? I don\u2019t believe it, but Ian Kerner does.\u201dShe muttered to herself. She didn\u2019t know that Ian Kerner was such a tightly wound person, but Henry must have known.Henry was silent as they moved towards the stern*, where her prison cell was. As they walked in utter silence, Rosen spotted a familiar head in the distance.[*E/N: the stern is the back-most part of a ship.]She had blonde hair that was as radiant as the sun, braided in two. Her cute body was closer to a doll than a human.Layla Reville.And Henry Reville.Rosen stared at Henry as he unlocked the layers of the chain on the door. Like a soldier, his head was shaved closely, but his bright blonde hair was clearly apparent. The two were of the same bloodline. What commonalities existed between that adorable kid and this rude, bear-like man?\u201cYour niece is cute.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLayla Reville.\u201d\u201cHow do you know her?\u201d\u201cI know everything.\u201dShe shrugged and answered vaguely. Henry growled, grinding his teeth.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer me?\u201d\u201cHenry Reville, this is my real trick. It\u2019s nothing but intimidation and perception. Look over there.\u201dShe pointed with the tip of her chin to the striking blonde child. Henry turned his head in amazement, dropping the bundle of keys in his hand.\u201cYou are a witch. Even when everyone said you weren\u2019t, I thought so.\u201d\u201cThink whatever you want.\u201d\u201cIt will be revealed soon! D*mn it!\u201dHe nearly fell down three times as he rushed to pull his keys from between the deck seams. She giggled loudly as she watched him panic. Why was he so afraid of a prisoner that had her hands tied? She couldn\u2019t grab the keys, and even if she kicked Henry\u2019s back with her leg, it would almost certainly break her knee.He attached the keychain to his belt and stared at her like he was going to kill her. Henry seemed to want to strangle her, but fortunately he had other priorities. He shouted loudly.\u201cLayla! When did you\u2026 !\u201dBut no answer came. Layla had barely turned her head towards her uncle, but they immediately noticed that something was wrong. The weak sound of coughing was the only response Henry received. Layla spun around, stiff as a music box doll. Both of her hands were wrapped around her neck. Her face was pale blue.\u201cAre there any doctors for first class passengers? Are there any?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnswer me, you idiot! There must be a doctor on the board! Wake them up! Are you out of your mind? I don\u2019t know how long your niece has left!\u201dHenry was not in a good condition. He stiffened and shook his head. She couldn\u2019t tell if he didn\u2019t know where the doctor was, if there wasn\u2019t a doctor on board, or if he was just spacing out. He was in a state of complete panic. He didn\u2019t move, he didn\u2019t blink, and he didn\u2019t run to Layla to check on her condition.As he stood there, his face turned so blue that Rosen thought it was fortunate that he didn\u2019t faint. Looking at him, she couldn\u2019t tell who the patient was; uncle or niece.Rosen soon realized that Henry was of no use in solving the situation. She clenched her teeth, thrust out her wrists to him, and shouted.\u201cRelease me!\u201dIt was midnight. She didn\u2019t know where the doctor was. The only doctor she knew of was the old man who worked at Al Capez, who boarded the transport ship with them. However, his mind came and went because he had dementia. By now, he was likely asleep in his room, which was deep in the hallway of cabins. By the time she woke him up and brought him all the way here, Layla would be dead. Moreover, she knew how incapable the little girl was right now.Doctors had a valuable talent. The government sent a minimal number of doctors to the front lines to reduce their fatality rate during the war. Therefore, the doctor assigned to Al Capez couldn\u2019t possibly be a good one, right?-Emily, do you even need to know these things?-Rosen, you should know. People don\u2019t just die during war. We are fragile creatures that get hurt and die for the most absurd reasons.She didn\u2019t know how long Layla had been like that.How many minutes did it take for a person who suffocated due to a blocked airway to lose consciousness? D*mn, she had been locked up for too long. The little useful knowledge she had learned had long since faded.But there was no time to complain. Besides, there were people here who were more useless than her. She was the only one who could save the little girl now. She kicked the frozen Henry and urged him.\u201cAre you going to kill her like this? The baby can\u2019t breathe! Release me for a second! I know how to save her!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you worried that I might run away in the midst of this? You have a gun! If I do something, just kill me! You know I can\u2019t run away! Time is tight! The later-\u201dHenry was released from his paralysis, like a man doused with cold water. Fortunately, without a single thought, he pulled the keyring from his belt and knelt in front of her. The key didn\u2019t fit well in the rusty lock hole. One fumbling second felt like an eternity. When the lock finally opened, Layla\u2019s eyes were half-closed. She was on the verge of losing consciousness.Rosen\u2019s chains fell to the deck with a bang. Her body staggered, unused to the light feeling of being released from her shackles. Barely holding on to her spirit, she ran. Her leg muscles screamed, but now was not the time to care.\u201cPlease save Layla.\u201d\u201cD*mn you, you\u2019re crazy, shut up!\u201dShe belatedly rebuked Henry, who was about to cry, and stood Layla up. She wrapped her arms around the child\u2019s body, below her ribcage.Honestly, she wasn\u2019t confident. She had never actually performed this maneuver, it was a method she learned far too long ago, and she was illiterate. But she believed in Emily. Unlike her, Emily was a very smart person. She had repeatedly practiced these unusual treatments and remedies. There were things she developed herself, and things she learned elsewhere.And Emily always said that the body had better memory than the mind. Just like an old soldier who had been discharged long ago who could still assemble a pistol, or a dog who had been abused avoiding people until it died.She took a deep breath and thrust her arms into Layla\u2019s body.\u201cOne!\u201d-So no one knows that you can heal people.-Yes.-How did you find this method and why don\u2019t you teach it to people? That\u2019s why Hindley ignores you and condescends. What Hindley doesn\u2019t know is that Emily taught me everything!\u201cTwo!\u201dOnce again.-Because one person can\u2019t save the world. There\u2019s no one special enough to do that.-No, Emily is special. Everyone ignores how special you are, Emily. I don\u2019t think Hindley is amazing.-Shhh! Don\u2019t forget to always be careful with what you say.-I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026-Rosen. I\u2019m a witch. That\u2019s why I started studying medicine. I can\u2019t use magic anymore, but there are moments when everyone needs healing.\u201cThree!\u201dThe child coughed loudly. It was a good sign. She prayed to a God she didn\u2019t even believe in.\u2018Please, please, please.\u2019-These past four years were useless. You always think you\u2019re so special.-Hindley, stop it. Please don\u2019t hit Emily. Hit me! Hit me instead.-She is my wife, not my friend! Know your place.\u2018Please, please\u2026\u2019\u201cFour!\u201dAt that moment, something popped out of Layla\u2019s mouth. She loosened her arms from around the child\u2019s waist. Layla, who had been gasping heavily, burst into tears. It was a sign of success. Being able to cry meant she was able to breathe.\u201cLayla! Are you okay? Are you really okay?\u201dHenry, his face wet with tears, ran and hugged Layla. Suddenly, their surroundings became bright. People with gas lamps rushed to the deck in their pajamas to investigate the commotion. It was surprising that none of them stopped her.On the surface, it must have looked like she, the witch of Al Capez, was holding this child and torturing her.\u201cLayla!\u201d\u201cGrandpa!\u201dA white-haired old man jumped out of the crowd, pushed Henry away, and hugged Layla tightly. He was wearing a navy uniform. He was the captain of this ship, and stunk heavily of engine oil.Standing to the side, she crouched down and picked up the hard object that had fallen to the deck. It was a rather large candy. That cute little kid nearly died from candy. Emily\u2019s words came true.A bullet and a candy could equally kill a person. Then\u2026 soldiers weren\u2019t the only ones who could save and kill people.She saved Layla. A strange sense of pride and satisfaction filled her heart. Even if she was misunderstood and was locked up in a cell, she could accept it now, without feeling wronged. She laughed to herself.At that moment, someone\u2019s long shadow was cast onto the deck in front of her. It was a tall one. The shadow approached slowly, and placed a hand on her shoulder. Rosen thought it was Henry, so she spoke to him meanly, without looking back.\u201cHenry Reville\u2026 If you are grateful, give me some water to wash. It\u2019s also okay if you just give us prisoners more food. We\u2019re not greedy.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll do that.\u201dA familiar voice responded.It wasn\u2019t Henry\u2019s. She stiffened as soon as she turned around.It was him. Ian Kerner. The face illuminated by orange lamp light was identical to the picture on the flyers. Before she was even aware of it, excuses poured out of her mouth.\u201c\u2026Hah. I was just saying that to mess with Henry. I didn\u2019t do this for a reward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in a position to make herself look good to him. Ian also cared about Layla, so this could be a good opportunity for him to do her a favor.\u201cWipe.\u201dJust like that.Looking at his handkerchief, she asked, even though she knew.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cYou sweat a lot.\u201dEyes containing various emotions poured over her. But none of them were as bizarre as Ian Kerner\u2019s. With an expression that she could not read, he tilted his head.In his hand were the chains that were released from her wrists earlier.\u201cThe Imperial Army always repays the price of a life. Even if you\u2019re a prisoner heading to the island of Monte\u2026\u201dIan took a step closer. He meant that he was going to pay her back properly, but was making sure of another fact at the same time.That she was still a prisoner.She looked into his eyes and answered with the most elegant smile she could muster.\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201dDoing one good thing didn\u2019t absolve a prisoner. It was easy to commit a crime, but it was difficult to pay for it. Even if it was a sin that they did not commit. She bowed her head and meekly held out her wrists. She didn\u2019t even consider that she could be free just by doing something like this.But this could be a chance.Her head began to spin at a fast speed. She molded her expression to be like that of a child looking at their angry mother. No matter how hard she tried, he did not change his expression in a meaningful way, but hope still filled her heart.\u2018Look, there are always opportunities.\u2019She asked excitedly.\u201cAre you really going to let me wash up?\u201d\u201cYes. But your hands will still be tied.\u201d\u201cD*mn, how do I wash up then? Will I only be able to soak my body in water like a vegetable?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll put people around you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make them wash me, like a princess.\u201dWhile she was being sarcastic, Ian quietly did what he had to do. Cold shackles wrapped around her wrists, and the lock was fastened between them. Contrary to her heart, her arms, which had become accustomed to restraint, welcomed the shackles. Were her muscles stiffened in the shape of submission now?She should have moved her arms a little more while she was free. It would have been nice to stretch in many ways. When she wriggled her fingers belatedly with regret, Ian grabbed her arm tightly and stopped her useless movements.\u201cI told you not to try, Haworth.\u201dAt that moment, someone blocked Ian from touching Rosen. It was the old gentleman she saw earlier, the Captain of the Vehes. He looked much older than he did from a distance. He gently held Layla\u2019s arm in one hand and swung his cane, smacking Ian\u2019s hand off of her.\u201c\u2026 Ian Kerner! What a rude fellow you are. Did I teach you to act like this? You want Layla\u2019s savior to be chained like this?\u201d\u201cCaptain.\u201dIan informally saluted him and stepped back. Ian was a former commander, and the old man was a captain. It was a gathering of great people.Was a captain higher than a commander on a ship? Was he powerful enough to wield a cane at a war hero? The relationship between the upper and lower ranks was a mysterious thing that she didn\u2019t know anything about. An old man of a reverent age knelt in front of a newborn to pay respect, and a patient who couldn\u2019t lift his limbs sat at the helm of the Empire.She observed their scuffle quietly.\u201cSet the Lady free, even if it\u2019s for a moment. After all, where will she go? The sea?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cWhy not?!\u201d\u201cUnder the Imperial Law-\u201c\u201cThe laws of the land don\u2019t apply to the sea! I\u2019m the law! At least on the Vehes!\u201dIt was decades ago that the era of absolute monarchy(1) was ended by revolutionary forces. The heads of the revolutionary army selected the Royal Family to suit their tastes, established them as scarecrow emperors, and started a republican government that advocated a constitutional monarchy(2).[(1)E/N: a form of monarchy in which the monarch is the only one to decide and therefore rules on their own.][(2)E/N: a monarch exercises authority in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution.]The kingdom had become an Empire, and classes had officially disappeared\u2026 But, according to the old man she met in prison, nothing had really changed. In the first place, the leaders who led the revolution were aristocrats. Only the name of their positions disappeared, and being a \u2018citizen\u2019 meant being of the upper class, with a certain level of culture and property.In addition, they were obsessed with the old families who eliminated themselves from power and became counts or viscounts. High society still considered their bloodlines important, so they only married and socialized among themselves.Rosen was born after the beginning of the revolution, so she had nothing to say about it. She didn\u2019t know much about thorny issues like politics or society.It was just that, in her eyes, the Captain and Ian Kerner were not entangled in such complex social hierarchies\u2026 They seemed to be close friends, just like father and son.\u201cDon\u2019t you have the tiniest amount of flexibility? What are you doing to Layla\u2019s savior? At least release her shackles while I say thanks. With them on, how can I face the Lady?\u201d\u201cShe is a prisoner.\u201d\u201cShe is a savior now.\u201dThe old man looked at his granddaughter in his arms.There were tears in his eyes. Even Rosen, a newcomer, was able to see his affectionate love for her.\u201cShe was a prisoner before she was a savior.\u201d\u201cYou never surrender the last word.\u201d\u201cI am a soldier on duty under orders from the military, and there should be no exceptions to the law.\u201dThe captain ignored Ian and smiled at Rosen.\u201cLady Haworth. Please forgive this young man for his disrespect and accept this old man\u2019s thanks.\u201dRosen immediately noticed that the captain had lived as a soldier for a very long time. Over the years, he frowned more than he laughed, and his wrinkles created an aura of authority and dignity.\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce myself. Excuse me, my Lady. I\u2019m retired now, but I was once an admiral of the Navy. I\u2019m ashamed to brag, but I\u2019m sure the Lady has heard of Alex Reville.\u201dThere was no one who hadn\u2019t heard the name. If the hero of this war was Ian Kerner, the hero of the last war was Alex Reville. Even she, who didn\u2019t attend school, was able to sing \u2018Hymn to Victory\u2019 and \u2018Brave Navy\u2019 from beginning to end. Alex Reville was mentioned in both songs.\u2018He\u2019s a famous man, cr*p!\u2019Henry Reville was so rude and Layla Reville was so cute that she didn\u2019t really think much about the name \u2018Reville\u2019.She knew it sounded familiar. They were the Reville family, who had no interest in the way of high-ranking people.\u201c\u2026I am neither a Lady nor a Haworth. My name is Rosen Walker.\u201dIt took a little courage to reject the disgusting title of Lady Haworth. She was originally someone who didn\u2019t respond well to authority, and it was still a bit like that now. It was strange, but it was true. This was the result of her struggle to live.\u201cThen may I call you Miss Walker?\u201d\u201cDo whatever you please. I don\u2019t know the etiquette of the upper class.\u201dShe tried to answer without trembling. The captain seemed to be trying to create a harmless armosphere in his own way, but she still felt like she was facing the Emperor. Henry Reville and Ian Kerner treated her like sh*t, so hearing such polite words from such a great man gave her a headache.\u201cLayla is my only granddaughter. If it had not been for Miss Walker, she would have died today.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 \u201dShe lowered her eyes and flinched.\u201cDid you say you wanted to wash up and eat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you could send supplies to my cell. It\u2019d be nice to have meat. As you know, it\u2019s hard for prisoners to get nutrition.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that. Repaying you in that way cannot happen. Our old Reville honor does not allow it.\u201dShe tried to refuse, but he was the only person who could only put food in her mouth, regardless of honor. It would be a dinner with high-ranking people, dressed in outrageous ways, eating with a fork and knife. Just thinking about it made her feel tired.\u201cI believe you can eat even if your hands are tied. If you don\u2019t have plans for tomorrow evening, I\u2019d like to invite Miss Walker to dine in the captain\u2019s quarters\u2026 \u201dThat\u2019s when Ian Kerner intervened.\u201cThat\u2019s too much. You shouldn\u2019t do that. Captain, this one-\u201cWithout realizing it, she turned to look at his handsome side profile. She knew exactly what he was going to say.-This woman is a murderer, a witch, a lowly woman, below our league, filthy, dangerous\u2026It was all correct.[I treat everyone equally.]But she didn\u2019t want to hear those words from Ian Kerner\u2019s mouth, in the reliable voice that had comforted her. With the same voice she had listened to throughout the war\u2026 It felt as if whatever he said would become the truth.[I hope that my squadron can better protect the weak, the poor, the unfortunate, the shunned, and the neglected.]\u201c\u2026She is a murderer.\u201d\u201cThank you, Captain. It\u2019s an honor. I\u2019m always hungry, and just because my hands are tied doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t eat. You eat with your mouth, not your hands.\u201dIan\u2019s and her voice overlapped. They looked at each other. Well, to be precise, he looked down at her with a puzzled expression, and she stared at him with sincerity.\u201cBesides, there is a risk of her escaping-\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t run away. Sir Kerner told me quite a few things about the beings under this sea.\u201d-Did you pick up a flyer again, Rosen?-It was just floating by\u2026She hated to admit it, but she had unreasonably high expectations for him. Every time she confirmed that Ian was different from her fantasies, she was angry and couldn\u2019t stand it.It would have been better if she hadn\u2019t met Ian Kerner. No, they shouldn\u2019t have met as jailer and prisoner. He should have remained in her fantasy.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? Sir Kerner?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut what could she do? Life always swept her in an unwanted direction. She swam all the way here with no fins or gills, flailing her hands and feet.She couldn\u2019t afford to waste her emotions on a weak fantasy.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was late afternoon. She couldn\u2019t resist the incessant pull of sleep. Just as she was about to fall back into the soft blankets, several people nudged her out of bed, took off her clothes, and submerged her in a tub of warm water.Only then did she remember what had happened the night before. She saved Layla\u2019s life, and thanks to that, she was sent to a room, not the prison. And she fell asleep on a strangely soft and warm bed. Of course, she was still under strict surveillance.She had also asked Ian to let her take a bath.\u201cMiss Rosen, are you really a witch?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cExcuse me for asking. Lady Layla came back one day and bragged about it\u2026\u201d\u201cChildren are easily deceived.\u201dWhispers passed through the steam. One of the attendants gently dipped soap into the water. The solid pink square magically turned into fluffy bubbles.Rosen stared at it with her eyes wide open in surprise, and the attendants burst out laughing, calling her cute. They were certainly Alex Reville\u2019s people. It wasn\u2019t easy for an ordinary attendant to have no complaints about bathing a dangerous prisoner.\u2018Do those of a high rank have others wash their bodies?\u2019At first, she was embarrassed because she felt like a baby, but when the sponge with fragrant soap bubbles started to massage her body, she couldn\u2019t resist.She remembered her childhood in the orphanage. The women scrubbed the children\u2019s bodies until their skin turned red with an annoyed look on their faces. If they moved even a little, they were immediately slapped on the cheek.Maybe it was because the memories of her childhood were so strong that she was surprised when people said they enjoyed taking a bath. For her, washing was something she forced herself to do to not get sick.However, if this was a real \u2018bath\u2019, it was understandable how ladies could spend all day in the bathroom.Cozy and warm. It felt like someone was coddling, and she had returned to being a baby.\u201cNow that the water has cooled down, it\u2019s a little lukewarm, isn\u2019t it? Do you want it to be warmer?\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t do that.\u201dShe shook her head. The attendants asked several more times to see if she would say yes, but she declined every time.The longer you stayed in a warm place, the harsher the cold wind felt. She didn\u2019t want to get used to the warmth. It was an obsessive habit.From the moment she acknowledged that warmth was a luxury, she was as wary of happiness as she was of despair.A few years ago she didn\u2019t know that. She was stupid. But not now. She wouldn\u2019t be fooled twice. She would never fall, hanging on to an iota of warmth like a [email\u00a0protected]\u2018Never\u2026\u2019However, the bath water was too warm, and her suffering body melted in the water. She mumbled \u2018never\u2019 in her heart, but eventually got tired, like a little beast basking in the sun and dozing off to sleep.How long has it been? A small commotion awakened her faint consciousness. When she opened her eyes, the bathroom was still steamy.\u201cHuh? You can\u2019t come in!\u201dThe attendants had jumped up, trying to block someone. A person who did not match the sweet atmosphere pushed into the bathroom and broke her drowsy peace. She was naked, so the sweet attendants made a fuss.\u201cD*mn, I don\u2019t want to do this either. But it\u2019s for surveillance purposes!\u201d\u201cSir Reville! Surveillance outside the bathroom door is sufficient.\u201d\u201cThis is Sir Kerner\u2019s order. There\u2019s nothing I could do.\u201dWhen she heard the voice, it seemed as though the intruder was Henry Reville. She reached out and casually pulled the shower curtain back so she could see him.\u201cWhat? Do you have anything to say?\u201dHe was embarrassed. When he saw her, he was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t even blush. He stared at her for a moment, speechless, and barely opened his mouth.\u201cYou know that I\u2019m male, right?\u201dRosen just shrugged. Her life was too turbulent to create s*xual tension with a kid like Henry Reville. Henry ordered the attendants while she washed her face.\u201c\u2026Please leave for a moment.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have a message for Rosen Walker. It\u2019s confidential.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 Miss Walker is not wearing clothes\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t do anything strange. It was Sir Kerner\u2019s order to deliver it now.\u201dThe attendants were still restless, so he finally pulled out his trump card.\u201cIt\u2019s also the captain\u2019s order.\u201dApparently, on this ship, Alex Reville was in a similar position to the Emperor. The attendants rushed out of the bathroom without saying another word.\u201cWhat? Are you going to search my body?\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a pervert? You took everything off. There\u2019s nothing to search for. Just stay there. I\u2019ll just say what I have to say and leave.\u201dIn spite of the announcement that he was about to leave, Henry closed the shower curtain and said nothing for a long time. The dirt on his boots dirtied the bathroom, making the bubbles stand out.\u201cYou\u2019re really obedient.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sir Kerner\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut you still need to think about your orders at least once. I wonder if your boss is really a good commander. I\u2019m starting to get suspicious.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean? If Sir Kerner is not a good commander, then who is?Henry was furious and began to refute her words. He seemed even angrier than when he cursed at her. She submerged her head under the water to block out his tirade. She spoke again when he calmed down a bit.\u201cNo. Does it make sense to put the lieutenant in the bathroom with me? He surely isn\u2019t worried that I would steal a boat naked.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYes? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little funny?\u201dShe lifted her legs, which had become incredibly soft after exfoliating off the dead skin cells, and squinted at Henry\u2019s shadow through the shower curtain.\u201cHenry Reville, you know what? You really can\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201c\u2026You came here because you have something to tell me. Something you want to say secretly. Of course, Ian Kerner might have ordered you to guard the bathroom door, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the type of person to tell you to go into a bathroom with a naked woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t make excuses. If you have something to say, say it.\u201dHe hesitated for a very long time before opening his mouth. He took so long that she began to suspect that he had passed out.\u201cIt\u2019s about Layla.\u201d\u201cOh, Layla.\u201dA strange sense of solidarity was bound to develop among those who had overcome a crisis together. One way or another, you became emotionally close. Rosen started to think of Henry Reville as an even stupider person, and Henry Reville thought of her\u2026 as a less dangerous witch.\u201cYou are so stupid, Henry Reville.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, I have nothing to say, Miss Walker.\u201dHenry\u2019s momentum faltered when she brought up Layla. His typically proud and guard-like stance shrank. His shadow through the curtain almost folded in half. As soon as he saw Layla last night, he had turned blue and froze up.He looked powerless, to the point that it was hard to believe that he ever flew a plane, protecting the skies of the Empire.\u201cAre you a real pilot?\u201d\u201cI have shot down over fifty enemy airships.\u201d\u201cHow great is that?\u201d\u201cIt means I\u2019m the second best pilot in the Empire. If you added up the cost of those airships, you could buy an entire district.\u201d\u201cSo why were you so scared?\u201dSilence fell again.\u2018Just say thank you, is that so difficult? You can\u2019t even do that, so you\u2019re standing there like that?\u2019If he couldn\u2019t say thank you, it was useless for their conversation to continue.Well, unlike her, he was the master of a prestigious family. He had a lot of achievements at a young age, so he must have a fairly high rank in the army. The Air Force had a shorter history than the Army or Navy, so there were probably fewer \u2018higher ranking\u2019 people above him. Except for his direct supervisor, Ian Kerner, she hadn\u2019t met anyone else from the Air Force.It wouldn\u2019t have been bad to meet someone like him. Under normal circumstances.\u2018Saying thank you doesn\u2019t kill your pride. And why does he really want to say thank you? Why does he keep wasting time after coming into the bathroom?\u2019While she was lost in her thoughts, Henry finally opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026I had an older sister. And brother-in-law. They were Layla\u2019s parents.\u201dIt was a little different from what she had expected.\u201cThey are not there, what? Are they dead?\u201d\u201cThe war.\u201d\u201cYeah, a lot of people died in the war. When I escaped prison, the whole world was on fire. I thought about crawling back about five times, but I gave up. It was a waste of time for me to suffer, and when I think about it, a world that\u2019s confusing for prison breakers is less dangerous.\u201d\u2018Why are you telling me this story?\u2019Rosen didn\u2019t want to know how Layla became an orphan during the war. She had grown up bright, lacking nothing. Rosen responded half-heartedly, but Henry continued.\u2018It\u2019s like talking to a wall.\u2019\u201cWalker, did you know there was a bombing in Leoarton?\u201d\u201cHow could I not know? I am from that city.\u201d\u201cWere you there that day?\u201dNo. That was the day of her first breakout. Her destination was Malona, which was about half a day away by horse-drawn carriage, but she stopped in the city of Saint-Vinnes\u00e9e. Of course, three months later she was discovered on the outskirts of Malona.It was in Al Capez that she found out about her hometown.One day, during exercise, someone said something that flew like an arrow to her ear.Leoarton was gone.\u201c\u2026No.\u201d\u201cMy sister was there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLayla was there too. She was a baby back then.\u201dAt first, she didn\u2019t know what it meant. She couldn\u2019t believe the city had disappeared. Was that possible? There were many uneducated people in prison, so she thought that the idiot misused his vocabulary. But it was real.Leoarton wasn\u2019t a small town. It had schools, marketplaces, and a large population. She couldn\u2019t read, but she wasn\u2019t stupid enough not to remember the familiar scenery of her hometown.Familiar roads, familiar buildings. But it wasn\u2019t the peaceful city she remembered anymore. All that was left was terrain. Everything else was gone.\u201cYou know what\u2019s funny? I could have stopped it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though I knew for sure my sister and Layla were in that city, I couldn\u2019t stop the bombing.\u201dHis story had nothing to do with her. She didn\u2019t want to know. Her own melancholic dark stories were overflowing. She had nothing left in Leoarton. If there was, they were just nightmares. So when she heard that the city had disappeared, she wasn\u2019t sad. Rather, she felt a sense of liberation that she couldn\u2019t tell anyone.Because she had wished hundreds of times that she could destroy that d*mn town.However, she had no choice but to ask Henry, who was holding back his tears and could barely say a word.\u2018Why?\u2019Because that was the minimum compassion that humans should show one another.\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cThat day, while flying with Sir Kerner, I saw an enemy fleet preparing for bombing. There were two groups. It wasn\u2019t difficult to figure out where they were going. Malona and Leoarton\u201d.Although Leoarton was a large city, Malona was the Capital of the Empire. If Malona fell, the country would be destroyed. How long could an empire that had lost its capital survive a war?\u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop them both.\u201dLife was a series of choices.\u201cWe had to make a choice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe had to make a choice\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a cruel word. No one could protect everyone. Henry Reville was a son, brother, and uncle. But he was also a soldier. At that moment, he was a pilot who held a city of thousands in the palm of his hand.\u201cWe chose Malona.\u201dShe thought of Ian Kerner, who was a natural leader. He was a commander who decided everything with a single word.He knew. That his lieutenant\u2019s family was in Leoarton. He knew Henry Reville, he knew his sister, and he would have watched Layla come into the world and burst into tears.He also knew.[You can relax. No one will be able to hurt you. When the air raid alarm rings, turn off your lights, go to the basement, turn on the radio, and listen to the broadcast. You just have to wait. I am always guarding the skies of the Empire. For you. Until the end of the war, until we all go back to our peaceful lives and forget all of this\u2026]That all of Leoarton believed in him. Ian Kerner would protect their skies. Throughout the war, he was a being who could reassure us with a single word. Before the raid, his voice would have resounded throughout Leoarton without fail.People would turn off their lights, close their doors, and go down to their basements. They would cover the ears of their crying children and whisper comforting words.What was Ian Kerner thinking?How did he say those heart breaking words?\u201cYou don\u2019t resent your boss, do you?\u201dIt was a stupid question. It was only after she said it that she realized it. Henry stared at her through the curtain for a moment.\u201c\u2026Sir Kerner made the right choice.\u201dYes, if Malona had fallen, they would be dead.But humans aren\u2019t beings who can think logically. Humans think they are, but in the end, they stone without question.\u201cI am not resentful. It was inevitable. Unavoidable\u2026 \u201dHenry told his story after that. It wasn\u2019t long. What he saw when he went back to the city that could not be recognised. The corpses lying at his feet, the crumbled houses, the ruins of everything and everyone he loved. He said he would never forget the look, smell and sound until the day he died.Layla was rescued from the wreckage five days after the raid. In a cradle with the lid half-opened and wrapped in a blanket, the child was crying faintly. It was Henry who found her. He had been searching through the debris like a madman for days.Henry slumped with the child in his arms, hugging her tight, and crying for the first time since his hair and beard had grown thick*. He bawled until the rescuers pulled the child out of his arms and took her to the hospital.[*E/N: essentially, this was the first time he had cried since he became a man.]A body was found nearby. It was the child\u2019s mother. Henry\u2019s whole body stiffened, her child in his arms.The child was severely dehydrated, but she soon regained her health in the hospital. Layla Reville was the last survivor to be found in the city. Doctors said it was a miracle.\u201cIt\u2019s strange to say, but I flew my airship in the war after that. I thought I had overcome it all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut as soon as the war was over\u2026 I couldn\u2019t get into the cockpit. The doctor said my body was fine, but in my head, something was broken. A wound that was left unattended and scorched, on the verge of bursting. I\u2019m no longer what I used to be. What kind of pilot can\u2019t climb a tall building because his heart pounds too heavily?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I thought it was okay. I had Layla. There was still someone I had to protect.\u201dWhat could Rosen say to him, whose wings were broken, but still tried to fly in the sky with all his might?Whatever this mean witch of Al Capez, who accidentally survived through her escape from prison, said, she would sound like she was pitying him.In the end, she asked an obvious and stupid question.\u201cBecause I\u2019m from Leoarton\u2026 Do you hate me? The city where your innocent sister lost her life, but the guilty survived?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHenry meekly admitted. She replied meaninglessly, playing with the bubbles in the cooling water.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s understandable to hate me. Keep on hating. That\u2019s normal.\u201d\u2018Hate me, until the ashes are extinguished and only dust remains in its place.\u2019Some said hate didn\u2019t change anything. Rosen wanted to refute that as bullsh*t. Hate was a cornerstone of life, just as important as love. People could live only when they hated someone as much as they loved someone.People needed witches as much as heroes. Even more so in a world where there was no war. Behind every person who received a rain of flowers, there was always someone who received a rain of stones.\u2018Like two sides of a coin, the hero on one and the witch on the other. In a sense, I am wanted as much as Ian Kerner.\u2019It\u2019s a pity that she accidentally took on the role of a witch, but honestly, she understood why people hated her. She would have done the same. She had hated someone as much as she had loved them.Perhaps he didn\u2019t like her answer, so Henry pulled back the shower curtain and pushed his face in. His expression was distorted and wrinkled.\u2018Did he stop being shy?\u2019As she stared, he raised his voice.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m here to apologize. I didn\u2019t come here to do anything to you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to apologize for?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 this and that. I told you you were dirty, and I didn\u2019t catch you when you fell. Also, I brought meat and showed you how scary the sea is. I admit it was mean. You\u2019re a prisoner, but you don\u2019t have to-\u201d\u201cWere they all your ideas?\u201d\u201cDo you think Sir Kerner would have come up with such things?\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me this now?\u201d\u201cAll right! Even if I\u2019m late, it\u2019s better than never!\u201dHenry Reville argued blatantly. But still, he accepted her words because they were true. He remained silent for a moment, and opened his mouth again. This time, his voice was as soft as a mosquito.\u201cThank you for saving Layla, Rosen Walker.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thanking me with such empty words?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sincerely thanking you, don\u2019t ruin the mood.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speaking sincerely, too. There\u2019s no sincerity in thanking me. You need to pay for it.\u201dShe smiled softly and made a circular shape with her fingers. Henry was dumbfounded for a moment, then snorted in surprise.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t give you, but what are you going to do with money? You can\u2019t even write.\u201d\u201cExercise your flexibility. You can give me something else.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, what do you want?\u201dHis eyes shook anxiously. Rosen burst into giggles. He thought he knew what she was asking for. But really, it was funny because she didn\u2019t even know what she wanted.\u201cYou want me to bring you the key to the lifeboat? I can\u2019t do that. Never. It\u2019s not just impossible, it\u2019s not something I can do in the first place.\u201d\u201cReville needs to pay the price for a life.\u201dAt her sarcastic remark, Henry became furious again.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the matter? Does it matter that I\u2019m a prisoner?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cBecause I killed my husband? Do you mean that I need to get punished? Many people say it\u2019s better to commit suicide than to go to Monte. Its a punishment one level higher than the death penalty. At least a gunshot would let me die clean. Even though I saved your niece, I still have to go there? Is Hindley Howarth\u2019s life more precious to you than Layla\u2019s?\u201dSeeing that there was no response, Henry didn\u2019t seem to be as stuck in his ways as Ian Kerner. If Ian saw her run away, not wanting to go to Monte, he would shoot her in the leg and bring her to the island, but Henry would likely turn a blind eye and shoot her in the heart, having mercy on her.She decided to continue her momentum and confuse him more. It was fun to watch his face alternate between red and white.\u201cAnd, do you think I really killed Hindley Howarth?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t kill him?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cMe? That big man? Of course, I didn\u2019t kill him, but let\u2019s say I did. What if there was a good reason for that?\u201dHenry, who was listening blankly, covered his ears and began to groan.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you. I can\u2019t hear you! Don\u2019t say that to me. Do you think I\u2019m easy? Do you think I\u2019ll fall for your tricks easily?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t lie. Of course, you are more deceitful than Ian Kerner.\u201d\u201cThere will be no one in the Empire who believes your words. Besides, you said you didn\u2019t save her for a price earlier. I heard what you said to Sir Kerner.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you came all the way to see me, and now you\u2019re showing off. In fact, if you don\u2019t repay me more than this, you won\u2019t be at ease, will you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, don\u2019t give up the key. I already know that even if I go on a lifeboat, I will be a meal for marine predators. How about this instead?\u201dShe made a gesture for Henry to move his face closer to hers. As she toyed with him, something came to mind. She grabbed Henry\u2019s ear and whispered. It was as if she was the devil enticing a devout priest, subtle and gentle. Like she had no ulterior motives.He hesitated, but listened to all of her whispers. He asked, frowning.\u201c\u2026What kind of trick is this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by a trick? This is a trivial request.\u201dHenry stared at her for a long time as if to gauge her intentions. Really, this was the prisoner\u2019s last request. But still, he seemed to be confused whether it was the beginning of a clever trick.\u201cHenry, you\u2019ll do it, won\u2019t you?\u201dShe smiled sadly.\u2018Now that I\u2019m clean, do I look a little prettier?\u2019It was then. She heard the bathroom door slam open. Henry and Rosen looked up at the same time.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dIt was a voice as cold as ice. Henry quickly jumped up from his seat with a blue face. Rosen shrank back, trying to avoid the sudden chill pouring in. Surprisingly, it was Ian Kerner standing at the door with a discontented look on his face.\u201cSir Kerner!\u201d\u201cI just asked you what you were doing, Henry.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201dIan furrowed his brows, alternating between Henry and Rosen, who was wet and naked. She could clearly tell what Ian was thinking. This was a scene that anyone would misunderstand. She thought Henry was a little pitiful, but it wasn\u2019t her business.Ian\u2019s gray eyes turned towards her. She didn\u2019t know how to react, so she just shrugged her shoulders. He stared at Henry again with a cold look.\u201cThis isn\u2019t what Sir thinks!\u201d\u201cReville, you\u2019d better come up with an answer that I can understand.\u201d\u201cI, so, um, something to say to Rosen\u2026\u201dHenry tried to explain, but the words coming from his mouth were disconnected and scattered.\u2018Well, what excuse could he give to Ian Kerner?\u2019\u201cI came here to say thank you. It was because I felt uncomfortable just serving her a meal. Besides, I wasn\u2019t going to grant her a questionable request without Sir Kerner\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\u201cGet out!\u201d\u201c\u2026Sir!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll hear your explanation later. It remains to be seen whether it\u2019s an explanation or an excuse, but get out.\u201dIan pulled Henry by the collar and threw him out the door. Henry was dragged like a doll and crumpled in the hallway, then the door closed again. Now, Ian Kerner and Rosen were the only ones left in the steam-filled bathroom.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCome out for a second, Rosen Howarth.\u201dHe grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the bathtub. It was like fishing a piece of meat out of a stew with a spoon. While she was being pulled up, she glanced at his muscular arm. It must be nice to be strong. No matter how hard she tried to do push-ups in prison, she couldn\u2019t get arms like that.Water splashed out of the bathtub. She shrank back.Of course it was not because she felt shy, but because it was cold. And because she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking. In fact, in the midst of everything, she was busy studying Ian\u2019s expression.\u2018Is this an opportunity? Should I pretend to be weak and attack him naked? Is it that kind of atmosphere right now?\u2019Unaware of the impure thoughts filling her head, he took a large, soft towel out of the bathroom cupboard and threw it at her. She wrapped herself in the towel and buried herself in it, blinking her eyes like a frightened mouse.Ian sighed as he looked at her, then the ceiling, and nervously messed up his hair.After a long time, he brought up something completely unexpected.\u201cDid Henry do something you didn\u2019t want him to do?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dShe knew, but she swore she didn\u2019t know. She really didn\u2019t understand Ian Kerner. No one had ever asked her about these kinds of things and genuinely cared. They just looked at her with disgust.He saw her blinking cluelessly, and sighed as he began to explain.\u201cDid Henry force you to commit a crime?\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cThen did he ever touch your body without your permission?\u201d\u201cNo! What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou can be honest with me. I am Henry\u2019s superior. If you wish, he can be removed from guard duty until you get to Monte, and blocked from approaching you.\u201d\u2018What is this person saying?\u2019He was acting as if he were her guardian, not Henry\u2019s colleague.\u2018You really know but you don\u2019t. You threatened me with a sea beast. It\u2019s Henry, not me, that he has to believe.\u2019He was treating Henry like a witch, a criminal. She was dumbfounded and asked.\u201cIsn\u2019t he your lieutenant?\u201d\u201cIf he did something to you, he would no longer be my lieutenant.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m the witch of Al Capez and he\u2019s a war hero like you!\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201dSurprisingly, he didn\u2019t understand her at all. She explained to him as she would a child.\u201cI hate this kind of incident very much. I\u2019ve seen it so many times throughout the war that I\u2019m sick just thinking about it.\u201dWell, he had a\u00a0 reason that she couldn\u2019t understand at all.She pulled the towel around her more tightly and walked through point by point what he was mistaken about.\u201cNo, aside from that, I\u2019m a prisoner, and Henry Reville is on your side.\u201d\u201cPeople are three-dimensional. Just because he is a good subordinate doesn\u2019t mean that he will be kind to you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even trust your subordinates? How did you get through war?\u201d\u201cThere are a few things that I teach the soldiers who come under me by force if necessary, and this is one of them. Never, under any circumstances, r*pe a woman from an enemy country. Don\u2019t molest a woman, don\u2019t buy a woman with money.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019Would a person mad with desire listen to him? She laughed. The battlefield was the home of those who lived. A place where the strong trampled the weak, the righteous died and the cowards survived.He said she didn\u2019t understand war, but was there anything else she should know about war?The rest were just numbers on a meaningless tabletop.\u201cAre you an idiot? You think they listened to you? Perhaps you were being fooled out of sight, where you couldn\u2019t see them.\u201d\u201cAt least they knew it was wrong, and they are probably trying not to stand out from me.\u201dIan responded without agitation. That was a relief for sure. She doubted for a moment that this war hero was an idiot. Still, Ian was smart enough not to trust her completely.\u201cReally, nothing happened?\u201d\u201cYeah, we were just talking.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201dIan raised his eyebrows and asked. It seemed that he was still suspicious of poor Henry, so she decided to clear up the misunderstanding.\u201cAbout Layla. I didn\u2019t really want to hear it, but he kept talking . He must have felt uncomfortable. What should I have done? I just listened to what he had to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNothing happened. It was just embarrassing for him to say thank you in front of others. Just because I\u2019m naked and Henry\u2019s in the bathroom doesn\u2019t mean something inappropriate happened, right? I don\u2019t play with kids like that because it\u2019s boring. I have nothing to gain, so what?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018gain\u2019?\u201d\u201cYou always have to pay a price to get through a crisis, right? As you know, there have been some crises in my life.\u201dShe explained in noble words.\u201cI used to sleep with the prison guards whenever I wanted a chance to escape.\u201dHe seemed to understand right away. His straight lips distorted.As expected, high-ranking people spoke this language. It was fun.She looked at him standing upright like a huge marble pillar. No matter how he sat down or stood up, he was always tall. There was a time when she squatted down and sucked on a chunky prison guard, but this man was so tall that she felt like he would have to bend around awkwardly to do the same thing.It was a ridiculous posture, so she laughed when she imagined it. Of course Ian Kerner wouldn\u2019t let her do that. He opened his mouth after staring at her for a long time with a smirk.\u201c\u2026I can see clearly in your eyes that you are only looking for an opportunity. It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re shedding false tears to look pitiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone has been fooled by your lies. I can really see your insides. It\u2019s like that.\u201dDid war heroes use mind reading? She felt a tingle in her stomach. She quickly lowered her gaze. She was embarrassed for no reason because she thought he read her specific thoughts.He sighed and slowly sat down. Now, his face, which was high in the air, could be seen up close. A straight nose, a blunt mouth naturally located underneath it, and a jawline that was sharp, as if carved out of marble.She was glad her arms were tied. Otherwise, she thought she would have reached out to his face as if possessed.Print was great. It made you develop indescribable affection to people whom you have never met face to face.The words she saw in the newspaper, and his vivid pictures.\u201cSir Kerner, are you curious about that? Do you want to know why?\u201dIan Kerner and Rosen Walker met for the first time on a ship heading to Monte in the worst relationship possible; a prisoner and a guard. However, she felt like they had known each other for a long time. It threw her off guard.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I deceived them, it was because they pretended to be deceived. Does it matter if I\u2019m good at lying or not? You only hear what you want to hear anyway. Whether you pretend to be naive or clever, the result is the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201d\u201cDo you think the world wants to know the truth? No one is curious about that. Pretend you don\u2019t, but you need witches as much as heroes. No matter what I say, nothing will change.\u201d\u2018What the hell was I thinking when I said this to him? If he listens to my words and starts interrogating me, what will I say?\u2019But like a patient who couldn\u2019t hold back his cough, she said useless things to her guard, who she was supposed to slap on the back of the head.She opened up to this strange man holding her chains who acted as her protector.She was going to ask why he was nice to her, but she stopped. Because she realized it herself while she was talking. For him, this was normal. As natural as taking her to Monte.\u201cYou are definitely a hero.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so righteous. It must be hard to care about a prisoner like me.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. It was pure admiration.Wasn\u2019t it difficult to always be fair?Everyone loves power. When you climb up high\u2026 It\u2019s human nature to treat the beings under your feet like worms.Few could have compassion even in heaven. She felt bad that she thought he was an unsympathetic person after hearing what happened to Layla. Yes, come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t just a warrior, he was a hero.To a warrior, compassion was a weakness. So not all warriors were heroes. Wasn\u2019t hero a title that could only be obtained by a few warriors who had overcome their weaknesses?Even after killing people, they were not called murderers, but heroes. Unlike her.Ian seemed surprised by her words. His eyes lost their way for a moment, wandered through the air, and then settled on her again. He asked her with a frown and clenched his jaw.\u201cYou think I\u2019m a hero, too?\u201d\u201cWhy? Does that mean I can\u2019t even admire heroes?\u201dShe wasn\u2019t surprised, she was just in a bad mood. Because he wasn\u2019t trying to protect a witch like her, but the good people of the Empire. However, fantasy was fair to everyone. The good and the bad, the rich and the poor all heard the same propaganda broadcasts.Whether you felt love or hatred, it was annoying to be denied your heart. She glared at him and grumbled.\u201cI liked you too. Like everyone else, you were a hero to me. Do you feel sick?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour voice and your appearance. When the flyers with your picture fell from the sky, I picked them up and put them in a drawer.\u201d\u201cDid you collect them?\u201dIan made a strange expression again. It was a face she had seen quite a few times in a short period, but she didn\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking. He certainly had a knack for hiding things. She couldn\u2019t read anything from his expression.\u2018Are you surprised, in a bad mood, or angry?\u2019She explained.\u201cYeah. It\u2019s nothing strange. There wasn\u2019t a girl in Leoarton who didn\u2019t collect your photos. I was just one of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are handsome and you are a hero. You know that the government has used you for propaganda.\u201dWhen she spoke those words, it felt strange. Her face heated up. Oh, why was she so angry that she was saying this to Ian Kerrner? She was drowned in her childhood fantasies and decided not to waste unnecessary emotions.To think about it at a time like this, how could she escape?She sighed and turned around.\u201cAnyway, stop accusing poor Henry and leave him be. Please send the attendants back in, I don\u2019t have any clothes to wear. I need to get dressed, right? Make sure no one comes in when I\u2019m getting dressed and just stand in front of the door.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t pry either. She gave up on being a desperate woman a long time ago, so it wasn\u2019t good to bother him too much. It was better to make him angry rather than sick of her.So when he answered unexpectedly, she was dazed, like a fool.\u201c\u2026I thought you might be right.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe may have similarities.\u201dOf course, she had spouted that nonsense to him. But that was never what she meant.\u2018How can Ian Kerrner and I be the same?\u2019She didn\u2019t even know if it was truly his voice that said it or an auditory hallucination.\u2018What on Earth should I say?\u2019Her inner self urged her to sit quietly.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cYou have to get dressed. Your dinner party is waiting for you.\u201d\u201cSo you have to go out so I can get changed\u2026\u201dIan pulled her out of the tub without waiting for her approval. This time he didn\u2019t pull her chain or hold her hand. An unfamiliar warmth wrapped around her waist. In a moment, she was lifted by him, though it wasn\u2019t a very romantic move. It felt like she was a wounded soldier on the battlefield, being carried to safety. He opened the bathroom door with her slung over his shoulder.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this! What\u2019s wrong with you? If you let the crew in-\u201c\u201cHow can I trust you? You have to take off your handcuffs when you get dressed.\u201dHe responded as if she asked something obvious. Her mouth fell open, shocked by the obscurity.\u201cSo it\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cI will have to keep an eye on you while you\u2019re getting dressed.\u201dShe snorted. It was funny that he called five crew members useless.\u201cPut Henry at the door.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t trust Henry anymore.\u201dShe struck him on the back with her handcuffed hands and kicked her legs in a meaningless rebellion. However, Ian Kerner did not budge, and the more she struggled, the less strength she had.\u201cI knew I was too easy on you.\u201dWhen? He didn\u2019t let her take off her handcuffs when she was taking a bath.\u201cI should have trusted your record a little more. \u2018Good at deception, placation, and persuasion. Is intelligent and has excellent speaking skills. Be careful while interviewing. High possibility of getting caught up or persuaded by conversation.\u2019 I guess I didn\u2019t pay enough attention even after reading it. Maybe you really are a witch.\u201d\u201cHow many times do I have to say it? I was tested\u2026 \u201dShe stopped struggling and took a deep breath. Ian abruptly stopped walking. His long shadow was cast on the red carpet in the hallway.\u201cPeople call women they fear witches.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou saved Layla Reville, Captain Alex Reville, the sailors, Henry Reville\u2026 I am the only one on this ship whose heart is not weakened by you.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter. She was on guard around him, and no matter what other people thought, it wouldn\u2019t change. He was holding the key.\u201cSo are you afraid of me? You\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll escape?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m afraid of you.\u201dBefore she could ask why, he opened another door and threw her on a bed. She grabbed a fluffy blanket to cover herself, reflecting on his words.\u2018Is this another way high-ranking people speak? Twisting my words to attack me?\u2019If so, she was a complete failure. Because she really didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about.-We may have some similarities.-I\u2019m afraid of you.What was wrong with Ian Kerner? It was him who had the key.He was a guard, and she was his prisoner. He was definitely the one to be afraid of.\u201cRosen! I brought a dress!\u201d\u201cNecklace and shoes, too!\u201dFive crew members rushed in at once and surrounded her, so her thoughts were cut off. Ian took out a key, released her handcuffs, and left the cabin casually. While the crew was making a fuss and dressing up her body, she stared at him, who was standing like a guard in the doorway.Ian blew smoke into the air after taking a puff from his cigarette. At first glance, his figure was as tall and straight as a statue, but\u2026For a hero of war returning home draped in gold, his figure looked lonely.***Ian Kerner suddenly felt anxious. The reason for his anxiety was unknown, which made him even more anxious.He sent trusted crew members to wash a guilty convict. There was nothing that could cause a problem. He didn\u2019t release the handcuffs on her wrists, and Rosen Haworth was neither military-trained nor a witch capable of sorcery.Was he afraid she\u2019d knock the crew down and make a boat out of soap and escape?Didn\u2019t he touch Rosen Howarth\u2019s arm himself?Her arms were skinny and made up of skin and bone. It may be because she was chained for a long time, but she didn\u2019t have a body that could form strong muscles.Even considering the worst scenario, there was no need to worry. He thought she might try to run away in the short time it took to wash and dress her, so he sent Henry. In addition, they were sailing on a sea infested with beasts. Where would she go if she escaped?He began to pace around his room again. Why did he get nervous?Because of Alex Reville?He was definitely showing excessive favor to the prisoner, but Alex wasn\u2019t acting outside of common sense at all. A captain was the Emperor of his ship, and the unwritten rule of sailors was that they never disclose what happened at sea. Moreover, this was payment for saving his granddaughter. Even if it was known to passengers, it would not be a problem.Was it because of Layla?She was a little shaken up, but she was fine. The doctor praised Rosen Howarth until his throat dried up.Rosen Howarth?She really only saved Lyla. Henry unchained her at will, but she did not make a fuss or try to escape by holding the child hostage. Rather than asking for excessive compensation, she calmly held out her wrists so she could be handcuffed again.So, in the end, he made himself uneasy. He stared at the desk, cluttered with papers.There was a notebook among the official documents, decorated in a familiar typeface font.It was a crude scrapbook that contained articles cut from newspapers. Ian picked up a notebook that was lying on the edge of the desk. He ordered it to be burnt, but it was still there. There was likely a miscommunication.Faded newspaper clippings rustled as he turned the pages. From credible newspapers representing the Empire to low-quality tabloids sold at market stalls. Rosen Haworth\u2019s name was mentioned in social gossip, advertisements, serials, and even reviews.He rubbed his forehead and sighed. The scrapbook was much thicker than he thought.He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he voluntarily collected it. Every day he opened the newspaper, circled Rosen Walker\u2019s name, and cut out the articles with scissors.It was just a pastime. A hobby that he started because it was hard to endure the slow crawl of time. It was definitely like that at first.Ian Kerner became too free after the war. He had returned to a peaceful daily life. In other words, he was unemployed.The Empire ordered him to take care of himself until a position became available for him. Perhaps this was, as Henry expressed it, \u2018precious daily life\u2019. It was a reasonable command. Because fame usually incentivised assassins. He stayed in his mansion as ordered.Only silence surrounded him.Of course, there were servants in the mansion. They swept the floor, washed the dishes, and didn\u2019t make enough noise to sour their master\u2019s mood. But he was always crushed by the unbearable stillness of everyday life.His thoughts raced every morning as he opened his eyes.\u2018Why is it so quiet?\u2019\u2018Where did the gunfire go?\u2018\u2018The roar of cannonballs?\u2018\u2018The engine?\u2019\u2018Did I fall?\u2019\u2018If I did, where am I?\u2019The nightmares choked him. When he woke, he felt as if he was on a crashing airship, being sucked into the black sea. In a cold sweat, he would open the window and urgently inhale the air, wandering aimlessly around his room until he encountered the bluish dawn.Ian knew that his condition was unusual. But he couldn\u2019t seek out a doctor or tell anyone about it like Henry Reville. No one could know about it. Ian Kerner was a symbol of victory that couldn\u2019t be broken.He had to be fine. If that wasn\u2019t possible, he had to pretend to be okay.That\u2019s why he, who wasn\u2019t an avid reader before the war ended, grabbed onto something and started reading and rereading it like an addict. If he didn\u2019t fill his head with meaningless words, he couldn\u2019t handle the terribly slow flow of time. One second felt like a thousand years. It felt like he was going crazy.During the nights when he couldn\u2019t sleep, he read the newspaper in bed. His secretary bought five types of newspapers from the Capital every day and put them on his desk. It took him exactly one hour to read every single letter from the first page to the last.Regular articles, feature articles, land sales advertisements, social gossip, crossword puzzles. He read it all regardless. He didn\u2019t read to understand the content, but the word \u2018Leoarton\u2019 caught his eye every time.A city devastated by his choice.A city he abandoned six years ago.His heart rate became faster and he broke into a cold sweat. Even though he knew it was better not to engage, he tortured himself by rubbing salt in his wounds. It was better for him to endure tangible pain than intangible anxiety.Oddly enough, his name was nowhere to be found in any article mentioning the bombing of Leoarton. No newspaper mentioned the fact that \u2018Ian Kerner\u2019s choice led to the bombing of Leoarton instead of Malona\u2019.Soon he found the answer. Each place where Ian Kerner\u2019s name should have been was a different name.Rosen Walker.Rosen escaped from the Perine Women\u2019s Prison six years ago, just before the Leoarton bombing. War was a very ironic tragedy indeed. What the military wanted to protect were innocent people, but in the end, it was a lucky and ruthless prisoner who survived. It was unavoidable, but officials could not help but feel bitter. Not satisfied with one lucky break, Rosen escaped Al Capez.This newspaper understood the injustice and deprivation of the Leoarton survivors. Rosen Walker had a bounty of 20 million gold. In order to catch the prisoner as soon as possible and restore the pride of the Empire, it was essential that the people of the Empire actively report it. Rosen Walker\u2019s description was\u2026Rosen Walker was a murderer. In her first trial, she was sentenced to 50 years and imprisoned in Perrine Women\u2019s Prison in Leoarton. And luckily, she escaped just before the airstrike.However, Rosen Walker did not destroy Leaorton. Her escape from prison and the Leoarton raid were two completely unrelated events.Ian soon realized that Rosen Walker was chosen as the scapegoat for Ian Kerner. For Ian Kerner\u2019s perfect return, the media, the government and the military worked together to create a witch. The public\u2019s attention span was limited. One person was always enough.Rosen was the villain who replaced Ian. She was the scapegoat for him.After realizing it, there were facts that you couldn\u2019t forget even if you tried. Things that kept piercing your heart and cluttering your head even if you wanted to forget them. Ian could no longer read the newspaper in an hour.Every time he saw Rosen\u2019s name, he had to close the newspaper and smoke for a while. There were days when he made cowardly excuses and comforted himself. His guilt about the city was enough. He didn\u2019t ask the government to put the blame on her, accuse her of his sins.\u2018We were just unlucky.\u2019\u2018You and me both.\u2019However, at the end of that thought, hatred for himself always soared. He couldn\u2019t pretend he didn\u2019t know. If they were just equally unlucky, then why did the world call them differently?Why was Rosen Walker an evil witch, and Ian Kerner a hero who saved the country? Because their intentions were different?A woman who killed one person with malice and a man who had no choice but to kill 15,623 people. If there was hell after death, both of them would go. Who would be punished more severely?A strange sense of identity, curiosity, sympathy, discomfort, guilt\u2026 he had a turbulent mind. Ian began to obsessively collect articles about Rosen Haworth.[Hindley Haworth and Rosen Haworth had a heated argument the day of the incident. Neighbours heard Hindley\u2019s screams early in the morning, and they testified that Rosen\u2019s scandalous behavior with other men had not been a good thing for the couple. A kitchen knife with Hindley\u2019s blood was found at the scene. This was the knife that Rosen Haworth usually used for cooking, and as a result of the investigation, a scar found on Rosen Haworth\u2019s hand matched the shape of the weapon. Despite all the evidence pointing to Rosen Walker, over the years she has consistently denied her crimes and asserted her innocence. But the basis for her claim is meager emotional appeal. She said that she loved Hindley, she had never cheated, and that they quarreled that night for trivial reasons. After her two escapes, some even hypothesized that Rosen Haworth was a witch, but an examination with a magic stone revealed it to be an unfounded myth\u2026]The public was eager to bite and tear into Rosen as intended by the government, but there were always two sides of the coin, so there were groups that followed the witch of Al Capez. In a chaotic world, crooked heroes were also in demand. There were those who turned to Rosen, who swindled the government, shunned soldiers, and spit on the triumph of a shining Empire.Suspicion of being a witch, two daring escapes from prison, a bizarre succession of fortune that was rumored to have been contracted with the devil, the fact that her tail had been barely caught, her young age, pretty looks, and charges of murdering her husband.All the conditions were perfect.Ian flipped through the tattered scrapbook again. On the leather-bound cover, he affixed a map of the Empire. Lines of various colors were drawn on it, tangled in a mess. Before going to bed, Ian would light a small gas lamp by his bedside and draw Rosen Walker\u2019s escape route following the newspaper articles.He knew it wasn\u2019t to help his comrades who were chasing Rosen day and night.It was Ian\u2019s secret self-consolation that no one could ever find out.\u2018Run away.\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t get caught.\u2019\u2018If you get caught, all the blame will be mine.\u2019\u2018Run away to a distant place and live a leisurely life. Just because you killed your husband doesn\u2019t mean you deserve the ill will of all of Leoarton. Whether you\u2019re a witch or a normal woman, it\u2019s either really unfair or you\u2019re just telling a blatant lie. In any case\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have to cover for my sins.\u2019\u2018This is unfair. I don\u2019t want to become a hero with the glory I got from trampling over you. I didn\u2019t fly my airship to be that kind of person.\u2019\u2018Not everything was a choice for you. You are a murderer who killed your husband, you are not an innocent victim.\u2019\u2018Nevertheless, after all, you are the only one I saved.\u2019\u2018I saved\u2026\u2019***[T/N: The last part T_T I\u2019m not crying.

That\u2019s what the military taught him. He was always sure who should be defended and who should be punished, between allies and enemies, victims and perpetrators. But now it was all mixed up in a mess.The thicker the notebook got, the more his judgment was paralyzed. Eventually, Ian stopped thinking. Every time he opened his notebook, he couldn\u2019t distinguish whether the voice ringing in his ear was his inner voice or the whisper of the devil.He was broken.He had become a madman, cheering for Rosen Haworth.Still, he thought he\u2019d be fine as long as\u00a0 no one found out. He had suffered so much and his heart was broken. He decided to let it run rampant. When its power dropped, the machine would eventually stop working.He knew that he had no fuel left. Sooner or later, this strange curiosity and passion would also cool down. His loyalty to his country, his affection for the airship, it was all burned up during the long war. What was left was intangible and couldn\u2019t be driven out\u2026There was only a feeling of deep guilt.Fortunately or unfortunately, the end came sooner than expected.-Escort Rosen Haworth to Monte Island.An order had arrived from the Emperor. Ian didn\u2019t think about his orders. He was trained that way. However, at that moment, what came to Ian Kerner\u2019s mind was doubt, for the first time in his life.\u2018Oh, you got caught in the end.\u2019What was the reason for his sinking heart? Was it just a guilty feeling?\u201cIan.\u201dIt was the voice of a child that freed him from his endless thoughts. There was only one child on this ship who called him so freely. He hurriedly tucked the scrapbook into the drawer and stood from his seat.\u201cLayla\u201d.Soon, the door opened, and a child with bright blonde hair entered the room. Layla was holding something in her arms. The child approached and poured it all over his desk. A teddy bear, a doll, a toy train, colored paper, a rubber ball\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a gift for Rosen, but I don\u2019t know what she likes.\u201d\u201cWhy did you bring this to me?\u201dIan was embarrassed. He knew that his image to children was not a friendly one. He had a stiff tone and a smileless face. Even Layla, who loved him, was afraid of him, so no child readily approached him.In addition, Layla Reville was a child who lost her parents due to Ian\u2019s decision. Henry wanted him to find comfort while watching Layla, but it was counterproductive. Ian felt unbearable guilt whenever he saw Layla\u2019s small face that resembled her mother\u2019s.Therefore, contrary to Henry\u2019s hopes, they were not very close.However, Layla had a bright expression today, approached him without hesitation, dumped junk in front of him, and chatted.\u201cIan, pick one for me. Ian knows Rosen well.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dBefore he could block the drawer with his arm, Layla quickly opened it and pulled out the ragged scrapbook.\u201cDon\u2019t you have this? I told the attendant that you didn\u2019t want to burn it, so he brought it back.\u201d\u2018Oh my god.\u2019Ian stiffened. He had never been as surprised on the battlefield as he was right now. His mind went blank. Layla, who wasn\u2019t aware of his internal torment, continued chirping like a happy bird.\u201cCollecting Rosen articles is a trend these days, so I\u2019m making a scrapbook. I didn\u2019t know Ian did it too! I can only collect the newspaper that comes to my house, but because Ian is an adult, he can buy all kinds of newspapers.\u201d\u201cL-Layla, since when did you know about this?\u201d\u201cSince a long time ago? I searched your trash can to get another newspaper, but all the Rosen articles were cut out.\u201dIan couldn\u2019t speak properly. He struggled to hide his embarrassment. After rubbing his face for a long time, he picked Layla up and put her on his lap. And he started to interrogate her in the most affectionate voice he could muster.\u201cDid you tell anyone other than the attendant?\u201d\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d\u201cWhat about Henry?\u201d\u201cUncle doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cLayla, promise me you won\u2019t tell anyone in the future.\u201d\u201cThen would Ian get in trouble?\u201d\u201cRosen Haworth is a prisoner. I\u2019m in charge of transporting prisoners. If this fact became known, there would be people who thought I had done\u2026 something to her.\u201dLayla was a quick-witted and clever child. His answer seemed to fully convince her. She nodded, looked around, cupped her hand to his ear, and whispered.\u201cThen I promise you. I won\u2019t make it difficult for Ian.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201d.\u201c\u2026But I don\u2019t think you have to worry. I thought Ian hated Rosen. I\u2019m sure everyone else thinks the same.\u201dIan had founded his own principles. No excessive emotion should be shown while carrying out an order. Again, he ruminated. Did he act so emotionally in front of Rosen Haworth that a child like Layla noticed?\u201cWhy did you think that?\u201d\u201cI can see Ian\u2019s expression changing. He usually has no expression, but in front of Rosen, he furrows his eyebrows like this and keeps sighing. Sometimes, his voice goes down.\u201dLayla frowned, imitating his expression. Ian shook his head.\u201c\u2026Layla, I don\u2019t particularly hate her. This is my job, so I can\u2019t feel that way. Besides, she saved you. Even if I used to be rude, I won\u2019t be from now on.\u201d\u201cThen does Ian like Rosen?\u201dThe child asked with an innocent face. He tried to deny it, but it was hard to say so when his scrapbook was in front of them. In the end, he answered honestly.\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to treat her.\u201dRather than being colorless in the neutral zone, his emotions towards her were more of a mixture of various colors.Layla, who hesitated while looking at his complexion, suddenly asked.\u201cI can like Rosen, right?\u201d\u201cLayla, it may not look like it, but Rosen Haworth\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, she\u2019s a murderer.\u201dLayla answered firmly. She began to explain slowly.\u201cBut she saved me. That\u2019s true, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIf you add 1 to -1, it\u2019s zero. Then, since she is starting over again.. Can\u2019t I decide? Whether I hate or like Rosen.\u201dIf you added one where one disappeared, it would be back to its original state. Ian was speechless at her transparent and pure logic. He could have refuted it, but he didn\u2019t want to.\u201cPick one, please. What would Rosen like?\u201d\u201cLayla, Rosen Haworth has to go back to her cell after dinner. Prisoners are not allowed to have any belongings.\u201d\u201cThen she can keep the present until she goes to jail. Revilles always repay their debts. \u201cThe bean-sized child was stubborn, just like Alex. Ian held his forehead and examined the cute objects Layla brought. He was desperate to tell her. What Rosen Haworth wanted was not a toy like this, but a lifeboat key on a keychain or the pistol he wore around his waist.However, saying so did not seem to be educational for the child. Ian pointed to the teddy bear. Because she couldn\u2019t hurt herself or anyone else with a bundle of cotton.\u201cOh, and I have something to give to Ian.\u201dLayla, wriggling out of his arms, dug her hand into her pocket and took something out. What she placed on Ian\u2019s palm was a rusty, ordinary copper coin.\u201cIt\u2019s a lucky coin. I think I\u2019m really lucky because I have it. Look! Without it, I would have been dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think Ian needs it more than me. Ian can never sleep properly. There\u2019s a saying that if you leave a coin at your bedside, instead of the monkey* making you have a nightmare, it will take the coin and leave.\u201d[*E/N: I believe this is the Korean version of Sandman, who brings children dreams and nightmares.]\u201cWhere did you get that, Layla?\u201dIan sensed suspiciousness and asked. Layla rolled her eyes and closed her mouth. Upon seeing her reaction, Ian immediately knew where the coin came from. Rosen Haworth was a prisoner who could not be taken lightly.\u201cDon\u2019t take anything from her next time. Rosen Haworth is not a witch, but it\u2019s just a precaution. There\u2019s nothing bad about being careful. She\u2019s more dangerous than you think.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to throw this away?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I\u2019ll take it. Thank you\u201d.Ian sighed and dropped the coin in a glass bottle where he stored his fountain pen. He was uncomfortable throwing it into the sea and uneasy about leaving it with Layla, so it was better to keep it.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the dining room\u201d.\u201cYes! Ian, do you know where my uncle is?\u201d\u201cHenry is monitoring Rosen. She\u2019s taking a bath.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that inappropriate? There\u2019s only a bathroom door between them!\u201d\u2018Ah.\u2019Ian realized at that moment the cause of the anxiety that had captivated him.-Sure. I had to sleep a hundred times with a fat guard who smelled like rotten cheese just to get that spoon. His belly was so big that it suffocated me when he laid on me. It\u2019s a shame. It would have been less disgusting if I didn\u2019t have to look at his face.[T/N: Flashback (Chapter 1)]He remembered Rosen Haworth, who eagerly shed false tears for sympathy. He didn\u2019t even pretend to believe them because it was such an obvious trick. So, who would be the next target for Haworth after being kicked out of his cabin?Henry Reville!The s3xual neglect of male lieutenants, which had infuriated him throughout the war, passed through his head.He really didn\u2019t want to see it. Henry Reville messing around with Rosen Haworth. It was even more terrifying because it was a distinct possibility. They were a young man and woman of about the same age, and Rosen Haworth had a track record of escaping that way. Not to mention that Henry\u2019s mind was endlessly weak when it came to Layla. It was safe to say that Henry\u2019s hostility toward Al Capez\u2019s witch had long since disappeared.No, it was more of a problem if Henry still hated Rosen Haworth. Men tended to dispel enmity in a vulgar way if their enemy was a woman. Henry had never let him down in that way before, but\u2026Ian knew well that there was no such thing as \u2018a person who could never do that\u2019. After patting Layla\u2019s head, he quickly stepped out of his cabin.He prayed that he wouldn\u2019t see a landscape of skin colors in the bathroom.The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, to the point where his mind turned white. Realizing that his temperature was higher than usual, Ian tried to calm down, but strangely, his reason never returned.Before he knew it, he had arrived in front of the bathroom. Standing in front of the door, he stiffened.\u2018What is happening to me?\u2019\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be this angry and heated up.\u2019Was this what they meant when they said the judgement gets swept away by emotions?Then, even simple things would go wrong. He was more excited than necessary.Neither the feeling of Henry\u2019s betrayal, nor the strange feelings he had towards Rosen Haworth could explain his feelings.\u2018What the hell am I getting angry at?\u2019However, it was a brief concern. Ian Kerner opened the bathroom door with a hardened expression. He was used to hiding and burying his emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We just had a conversation.\u201d\u201cThe act itself could have been a threat to Rosen.\u201d\u201c\u2026To be honest, when you think about it, it doesn\u2019t seem like a bit of a surprise, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to respond.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will correct myself.\u201dRosen hid behind the curtains in the hall, watching Henry sweat profusely. It was exhilarating because it felt like she was taking revenge, but it was also a bit sad to see him being scolded by Ian. Regardless, Henry was too weak-minded.\u201cRosen, come on out.\u201dOne of the attendants, who was excited to help with her makeup, pushed her forward. She had treated her with kindness, and asked,-You\u2019re a prisoner, aren\u2019t you?But she surprised Rosen by saying,-Everyone wants to kill their husband at times.\u201cEveryone will be surprised.\u201d\u201cBecause of me?\u201d\u201cYes, Rosen is so pretty.\u201dDinner was prepared in the deepest part of the ship, in a small hall next to the captain\u2019s quarters. She couldn\u2019t go to the grand banquet hall where the passengers ate. The banquet hall was filled with colorful gambling boards, chandeliers, crystal sculptures, and proms were held every night\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the same, but this hall was beautiful enough.Warm-toned lights gave the room a dreamy atmosphere. It was the first time in her life that she had felt the texture of silk. It felt like she was wearing a cloud, or walking in a dream. With a fluttering heart, she pulled the curtain back and took a step forward.As the sound of her heels reverberated on the floor, the two men turned their heads at the same time. It was Henry who greeted Rosen first.\u201cWho are you?\u201dHe asked with a serious expression. She seriously wanted to punch him in the face.\u2018Did you forget that I\u2019m a dangerous prisoner being transported to Monte Island?\u2019Confinement on Monte was the highest sentence possible. In other words, kicking the young Reville\u2019s \u2018jewels\u2019 wouldn\u2019t change her fate.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dShe spun around. The hem of her emerald dress fluttered. It was a perfect opportunity for her to stumble and fall, but since she was so used to being bound, she managed to stay balanced.Henry didn\u2019t seem to realize that she was truly Rosen Walker until he heard her voice.\u201cI\u2019m not joking. Who are you?\u201d\u201cAl Capez\u2019s witch, Rosen Walker.\u201d\u201cOh my God.\u201dHenry clapped, eyes wide open in astonishment.\u201cYou look like a real lady.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dIt was half a joke, and half sincere, so she answered generously. Her reflection in the mirror was quite stunning. She was so surprised that she stared at herself in the mirror several times.\u2018Do I have to roll my eyes and pretend to be shy?\u2019She finally lifted her head and glanced at Ian, who was standing behind Henry.It was a fact she didn\u2019t want to admit, but she was curious about Ian\u2019s reaction.\u2018Will he look at the neatly and beautifully decorated \u2018me\u2019 as if looking at a mysterious animal? Or will he be wary of me? I don\u2019t know why, but he said he was afraid of me\u2026\u2019\u201cCome here, Lady Walker. We will escort you.\u201dBut before she could see Ian\u2019s expression, Henry jumped forward, obscuring her vision. She returned the line Henry had spouted at her before.\u201cHow are you? Ugh.\u201d\u201cWhy are you like this, Rosen? I\u2019m good at escorting.\u201d\u201cAre you going to pretend to catch me again and push me away because I smell?\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. Did I do that, my Lady?\u201d\u2018Didn\u2019t Alex say that the Reville family always pays their debts?\u2019They certainly didn\u2019t seem like empty words. Henry, who always wore a crumpled military jacket over a black shirt, suddenly appeared in uniform and was acting like a gentleman.As she was about to put her hand on Henry\u2019s with a grin, something blocked her way. It was Ian\u2019s arm.\u201cYou are not allowed within a meter of Rosen Haworth, Henry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you to step back.\u201dRosen and Henry looked at him with absurd expressions. Ian separated Henry from Rosen, grabbed her hand, and hid it behind his back. She thought for a moment that he had misunderstood who he was supposed to protect, but in the end, it was her, not Henry, who was staring at Ian\u2019s wide back. It seemed that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cWhat? Wasn\u2019t the misunderstanding cleared up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s resolved. But I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cWhy?!\u201d\u201cYou said excessive favor or hostility is equally dangerous. At first, you were very hostile to Rosen Haworth, but now you like her.\u201d\u201cHave I lost Sir\u2019s trust? Don\u2019t you believe me? Do you think I\u2019ll break your orders and release Rosen? That won\u2019t happen!\u201dHenry looked shocked and asked several times,-No, right?However, Ian kept his mouth shut and didn\u2019t say anything.\u201c\u2026How could I know what the two of you did in the bathroom? Apart from what you told me.\u201dIan narrowed his eyes and looked at Henry and Rosen in turn. He seemed to have noticed that Henry had done her a favor. Rosen quickly lowered her eyes, feeling guilty.\u2018Does he really know how to read minds?\u2019Henry hurriedly confessed the truth.\u201cNo, I would never betray Sir! What Rosen asked me about in the bathroom was a meal! I told the chef that there was a dish she wanted to eat.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that true? Haworth.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. But you can\u2019t place faith in your lieutenant.\u201dShe glared at Henry and smirked.\u2018You\u2019re not loyal, no matter how small the request is. Why are you so easily scared?\u2019\u201cWhat do you want to ea-\u201cThe moment Ian turned around, trying to pry into her request\u2026\u201cRoseeeeen! Rosen is here! Rosen is so pretty!\u201dLayla, wearing a cute dress and shiny boots, ran up to her, bouncing like a ball. Rosen quickly turned towards the child and avoided Ian\u2019s gaze, as swiftly as a rat running out of an eagle\u2019s sight.\u201cHello, Layla. Will you be having dinner with us?\u201d\u201cYes! I begged my grandfather. Rosen is my savior! I can\u2019t be left out, right?\u201dKids were definitely annoying at times, but they were adorable all the same. Even more so if it was a child she saved. She wanted to hug her, but with her hands chained, she had no choice but to convey her joy with her eyes.Ian was still blocking her way. Layla\u2019s hand, which had reached out to Rosen, was quickly stopped.\u201cLayla, don\u2019t come near her.\u201d\u201cRosen saved me, and I have to thank her.\u201dUnlike Henry, who was foolish, Layla bravely protested with a voice as big as an ant. It was admirable.\u201cIt\u2019s enough to do it at a distance.\u201dHowever, Ian\u2019s coldness was equally applied to children, and Layla\u2019s protest was immediately dismissed. Layla quickly became depressed and hid behind Henry\u2019s pant leg.Perhaps there was no one on this ship who could express opposition to him\u2026\u201cIan Kerner, you stuck up man! Why are you so suspicious?\u201dThere was only one. Captain Alex Reville walked in behind Layla and shouted loudly.\u201cCaptain, Rosen Haworth is-\u201d\u201cMiss Rosen, I\u2019m sorry. Your meal will be ready soon. Please wait a moment.\u201dThe white-haired old man knelt before her, gently grabbed her hand, and placed a kiss on the back of it. She was embarrassed because she didn\u2019t know what to do, while Ian simply sighed.\u201cMiss Walker, I wish I could unchain you just for dinner\u2026\u201dAlex glanced at the handcuffs that bound her hands, glared at Ian, and then gave Henry a nod.\u201cHenry, please help with Miss Rosen\u2019s meal.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean, I\u2019m giving the task to you so she doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable!\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we just ask the crew?\u201d\u201cYou idiot! Are you even a Reville?\u201dIan stepped forward, pushing aside Henry, who was floundering stupidly. However, what Ian was trying to say was stopped before it even came out of his mouth.\u201cIan, if you\u2019re going to say no again, then leave! I am the law on this boat!\u201d\u201c\u2026Not Henry.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Henry?\u201dAlex was stubborn enough to overwhelm the great Ian Kerner. Rosen was deafened by his roar. She thought it was really fortunate that Alex Reville was on her side. If she had acted like Ian, she might have been thrown into the sea on charges of performing a bizarre procedure on his granddaughter rather than being rewarded with a meal.\u201cHenry can\u2019t do it anyway.\u201dIan had been contemplating whether or not to report the events that took place in the bathroom. Henry\u2019s face turned white. He shook his head so frantically that Rosen felt like he was trying to say \u2018please\u2019.\u201cCaptain, I\u2019ll feed Rosen\u201d.\u201cSir Kerner, I\u2019m-\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can do it again\u201d.The three men were talking over each other loudly. It was Ian Kerner who eventually won out over the others.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll help her eat instead of Henry, Captain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201dIt seemed she wasn\u2019t the only one surprised by his words. It was such an unexpected suggestion. Due to Ian\u2019s personality, she thought he would say, \u2018Let the crew do it.\u2019\u201cThere is nothing that can\u2019t be done.\u201d\u201cThen I will assume that you have no objections.\u201dOnly then did he distance himself from her and back off. She found that he was more attached to her than she thought. Her vision, which had been obscured by his large shadow, brightened.\u201cRosen Haworth, do you have any objections?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dShe shrugged and lifted her head to observe him.Ian had a different look than usual. Was it just an illusion?She did not know the meaning of his gaze, but the direction was certain. He was staring at her. No one could deny it.-We may have similarities.Rosen always tried not to make unnecessary assumptions. Assumptions tended to flow only in favour of oneself, and all that remained after being corrected was an embarrassing and miserable reality.But grey is an annoyingly vague colour. There was no doubt that red is hot and blue is cold, but grey\u2019s temperature is hard to determine.Her sociability stopped at the age of 17, causing her to grow up with spite and pretence. So she couldn\u2019t figure out what he was thinking about when he said strange things to her.After all, a prisoner didn\u2019t need great insight. They didn\u2019t have to know the truth.But Ian Kerner turned her into an idiot who kept getting hung up on meaningless things. It should be a crime to make complex expressions with such a handsome face. Even though she knew it didn\u2019t make sense, she wanted to know his heart. His true feelings.It was like she was going back to her stupid and naive days, waiting for Hindley in the kitchen\u2026 and when the flyers containing Ian\u2019s picture began to fall, she quickly ran out and smiled at the sky. She never wanted to do that again.She dropped her gaze. His rough, warm hands wrapped around her fingers tightly. She suddenly realised that Ian had started to hold her hand instead of the chain.She couldn\u2019t bring herself to like it. It was just proof that he was becoming a little less wary of her\u2026 but her crazy heart still jumped ahead and fluttered. He instilled in her a dangerous delusion.\u2018Perhaps. Perhaps\u2026 With a little luck.\u2019\u2018He might really give me a chance.\u2019A prisoner should always be alert, but she was afraid that she would act like a fool because of the meaningless sympathy he gave her. If a rat gets too bold, it will be destroyed.The foolish excitement that tickled her chest bothered her. She clenched her jaw and shook off her assumptions. And she pulled her hand out of his as hard as she could. She asked sarcastically.\u201cWhy do you keep holding my hand?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dHer chain shook and made a clunking sound. It was only then that Ian seemed to realize that he had been holding her hand the whole time. He stiffened for a moment, and then, like a guilty man, poured out a bunch of excuses.\u201cI\u2019m going to grab the chain\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you tried to pull her chain! Be polite to Miss Rosen! Have I taught you anything, Ian?\u201d\u201cOh, please be quiet.\u201dIan flinched as if he wanted to say something. His forehead was crumpled mercilessly.He looked at Rosen with eyes that seemed to make excuses.She stared down at the floor.Ian and Rosen seemed to have entered into their own world. Such an illusion haunted her.\u201cI didn\u2019t do that on purpose\u201d.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cReally, the chain\u2013\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u2018I know. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s all my imagination and it\u2019s just an illusion.\u2019[I will always protect you. There will be absolutely no danger.]\u2018Yeah, I knew everything. It was an impossible promise. How many facts in the world can be asserted as \u201cabsolute\u201d? Look at this situation. He, who was everyone\u2019s idol, ended up failing to protect Leoarton and became my humble guard. This is how I ended up meeting my hero.\u2019\u2018Nevertheless, I believed his lies. I needed something to believe. Even if it was a lie, it didn\u2019t matter. Even if it was an illusion or a fantasy\u2026\u2019Shameful memories came flooding back. She realized that saying she liked him was deceiving herself. There were days when her heart overflowed and she couldn\u2019t handle it. Moments when she took out a picture of him and comforted herself.[-Rosen, is it okay for a married woman to cherish a picture of another man like this?-As long as Hindley doesn\u2019t find out, it\u2019s fine. And I don\u2019t like him that way. I mean, it\u2019s just like how children love heroes.-Really?-Really!]\u2018I think I can admit it now. I had a crush on him in the fantasy I created. That\u2019s why I keep imagining him showing useless emotions to me\u2026\u2019Like an ostrich who buried its face in the soil, she finally paid the price. At the moment when she had to be cool, she couldn\u2019t even look at his face properly.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? What kind of misunderstanding do you have?\u201d\u201cIt means nothing.\u201d\u201cI know!\u201dHe kept chasing her. She didn\u2019t know what was making him so restless that he looked very upset at times. It was understandable. His agile sixth sense may have read her dirty inner thoughts. She kept failing to distinguish between reality and fantasy.She shook her head. Her heart was pounding. She didn\u2019t have to touch her chest to know how fast her heart was beating.\u2018You can\u2019t do this. Wake up, Rosen.\u2019She thought with her eyes closed.[I will protect you. I, too, love Leoarton.]Maybe it was her, not him, who had to be careful not to be deceived by lies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How hard would it have been to bring this onto a ship? The tablecloth placed on it was almost too gorgeous to be used. Rosen whistled in admiration, then hurriedly glanced at Alex. In the eyes of a high-ranking person, she was acting vulgarly.\u201cOh, sorry-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a bit extravagant, but it\u2019s not a table I use all the time. I only use it for formal dinners. Now I have enough people for a dinner party, but because of the circumstances\u2026\u201dAlex Reville mumbled the end of his words. She nodded. Treating a prisoner to a decent meal would not look good to others. Alex quickly smiled and added.\u201cShall we start eating, Miss Walker?\u201dThe moment he clapped his hands, a magical scene unfolded before her eyes. Beautiful attendants lined up carrying plates. When the first five dishes were placed on the table, she was stopped by Henry as she reached for food.He slapped her hand and gave her a scolding.\u201cFool, wait! You\u2019re going to eat with your bare hands? What are you going to do handcuffed? Even if your hands were free, you can\u2019t eat now. The Captain hasn\u2019t said you could yet.\u201d\u2018Oh.\u2019Rosen folded her hands in her lap and tried to hide her embarrassment.\u201cHe told me to start eating\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s another thing to ask, \u2018Do you want to start eating?\u2019 Besides, there\u2019s only soup. You have to wait for the appetizers to come out. What the hell have you been eating all this time?\u201dHe seemed to want to help her, but she couldn\u2019t understand Henry\u2019s explanation, so she became rather depressed. Rather, if they treated her like a prisoner, she would have eaten in her own way, saying that she did not understand the manners of high-ranking people\u2026It was embarrassing not to hide the tendencies she learned from the slums in front of those who dressed her in decent clothes and treated her politely.There was a misconception that people had, but it was the people of the slums, not the upper-class, who were sick of the slums the most. She, like many others, didn\u2019t know where she came from, couldn\u2019t read, and had a dirty appearance\u2026 It was a bit embarrassing.So she pretended to be confident. However, her concocted boldness did not work all the time.\u201cJust eat a little.\u201dIan Kerner shoved a spoon into her mouth. The soup filled her with warmth, so she forgot what she was going to say and just blinked.\u201cIt\u2019s all the same once it gets to your stomach. Henry, you ate with your bare hands on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cNo, Sir Kerner. It\u2019s a different situation. I didn\u2019t mean to humiliate Rosen\u2026 \u201d\u201cGo away. Did you forget that I told you not to come within 1 meter of Rosen Haworth?\u201d\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever spouted nonsense?\u201dIan responded coldly, and Henry was puzzled. Without a moment\u2019s notice, Layla criticized Henry.\u201cUncle should learn to be considerate of others.\u201d\u201cLayla! You too\u2026?\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dAlex glared at Henry.\u201cHenry, I\u2019ll speak to you after dinner.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201dHenry quickly became teary. Rosen was elated again. It was strange for her to have everyone on her side.\u2018I\u2019ve always been treated like a maniac.\u2019Ian ignored Henry and fed her soup as if he was feeding a baby. Rosen quickly swallowed what was in her mouth and asked.\u201cYou won\u2019t eat?\u201d\u201cI take care of my meals. Don\u2019t mind me and just eat.\u201dHer front teeth kept getting hit by the hard spoon. As she grimaced in pain, he switched to a smaller one.His facial expressions and hand movements played out independently. He had a prideful face, but his touch was infinitely meticulous. At first, Rosen, who was hesitant to eat out of awkwardness, began to make more and more shameless demands.\u201cGive me meat, not grass.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? Is it a waste to give me meat?\u201dAs soon as she spoke, he ripped off a large turkey leg and cut it into small pieces. After a long time, hot food warmed her stomach, and her hunger got bigger and bigger. She couldn\u2019t afford to stop. It was so delicious that she felt like crying. It made her forget that she had just been embarrassed by Henry and Ian Kerner was serving her.At first she was going to eat quietly, but suddenly she couldn\u2019t even speak, and gestured at the food she wanted to eat. She devoured whatever Ian offered.Alex just watched Rosen eat happily, but Ian frowned and put down his utensils as she was chewing.\u201cEat slowly.\u201d\u2018The way I eat isn\u2019t polite, is it?\u2019Rosen looked at Ian and raised her eyebrows.\u201cYou are going to have an upset stomach.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to see?\u201dRosen retorted. People needed to be consistent. If he was going to say her eating with them was okay, he should stick with that until the end, or show that he despised it from the beginning. She didn\u2019t know how many times he had given her hope and crushed it.\u201cDon\u2019t misinterpret what I\u2019m saying. Think about whose loss it will be if you eat like that and vomit it all up. If you get an upset stomach and start going crazy, Henry and I will suffer\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why are you frowning?\u201d\u201cMy face is always like this.\u201dHe pointed at his own face, dumbfounded. Rosen ran out of words to say. She suddenly realised that they were having a childish argument that even Layla wouldn\u2019t have. Of course, it was her who disagreed, but it was solely Ian Kerner who had turned this into an argument.\u2018Why do you keep answering when you know I have a bad habit of talking?\u2019She was just messing around as usual. It was okay if Ian ignored her, just like when they first met.He was a jailer. He didn\u2019t have to listen to his prisoner or respond.\u2018Didn\u2019t you say it with your own mouth? You don\u2019t care what I say.\u2019\u2018But now\u2026\u2019\u201cHey! Why are you being so childish? Miss Walker isn\u2019t in good shape right now, and she\u2019s tied up. If her words are sharp, shouldn\u2019t you be more gentle?\u201dAlex Reville shouted and threw a fork at Ian. Like a true combat veteran, Ian accurately grabbed the flying fork, though his gaze was still on her. He started asking questions again when she swallowed.\u201c\u2026Are you a nurse?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen where did you learn first aid like that? I\u2019ve never seen it in the Empire. Only doctors from Talas\u2026 Did you use magic?\u201d\u201cYou guys always say that a woman is a witch if she does something great.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t want to be interrogated during dinner. But now he was holding a delicious steamed pork hostage. If she didn\u2019t answer, that perfect food would never enter her mouth. In the end, she came up with an answer that most people would accept.\u201cI\u2019m not a nurse, but my husband was a doctor. Although he was an unlicensed quack, I learned a few things.\u201d\u2018Of course, Hindley had a real witch as his wife. Emily was a witch, I am not.\u2019\u2018And Hindley\u2026\u2019\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have much to say about Hindley.\u2019As soon as her husband was mentioned, the atmosphere at the table became awkward.\u2018Now you all remember that I am a murderer?\u2019Rosen chewed the pork Ian had put in her mouth and swallowed it. She didn\u2019t know why he was making her talk when everything was already printed in the newspaper.\u2018Thanks to you, the atmosphere got cold.\u2019It was Alex Reville who cleared the icy atmosphere.Age was not something to ignore.\u201cExcuse me Miss Walker, but how old are you? What appears in the newspapers is completely arbitrary. In the tabloids, they say that you are in your seventies and use magic to look younger.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The Imperial newspaper is correct. I\u2019m twenty-five.\u201d\u201cThen when did you get married?\u201d\u201cFifteen.\u201dThere was silence for a moment. The average age of marriage in the Empire was about twenty-three years old. The lower classes were more likely to get married at a young age, but even so, fifteen was too early.It was not strange for slum children to get married, even if they did not get their menarche* at an early age. Actually, she was like that. She was skinny from malnutrition, short of stature, and looked younger than fifteen.[*E/N: the first instance of a woman\u2019s menstruation, which usually occurs anywhere from 10-16.]\u201c\u2026 You did it very early. Was it something your parents decided?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an orphan.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe girls there get married early. Some of them get married at the age of twelve.\u201dRosen answered in a cheerful voice. Her intention was to rectify the atmosphere once again. As soon as she was about to tell a joke, Henry muttered.\u201cIsn\u2019t that crazy? Twelve years old? A twelve-year-old is getting married?\u201d\u201cNo, I was fiftee-\u201c\u201cHow old was your husband then?\u201dA piece of meat was popped into her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how old he was, but he was in his late twenties.\u201dHenry was shocked and shouted.\u201cHe should be locked in a cage!\u201dRosen smiled and responded calmly.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. He\u2019s dead.\u201dGreat care was taken to enunciate the word \u2018dead\u2019.\u201cLayla\u2019s here, so don\u2019t say such mean things. I enjoyed being married.\u201dHenry hardened in astonishment. He lost his words for a moment and stared at her. She felt like he was measuring whether her words were true or an extension of the lies she had told so far.\u201cYou\u2019re making excuses again, right?\u201d\u201cOh, do you want me to repeat the same thing over and over again? I didn\u2019t kill him, I loved my husband, and when I think of him now, my heart\u2026\u201dShe tried to say the same thing and squeeze out tears, but a large chunk of meat was stuffed into her mouth. When she looked up, Ian was glaring at her with an unpleasant look.\u201cLayla\u2019s here, so don\u2019t say useless things and just eat.\u201dRosen nodded in agreement. However, Layla shouted enthusiastically with a fork and spoon in both hands.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I saw the newspaper article too. As for Rosen\u2019s crime-\u201c\u201cLayla, let\u2019s focus on the meal.\u201d\u201cYou killed your husband. I know that!\u201dSilence fell over the table. Layla was a little wary, but eventually opened her mouth and said what she wanted to say.\u201c\u2026Couldn\u2019t it be that Rosen didn\u2019t do it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s enough evidence and a ruling, Layla. Rosen is guilty.\u201dIan answered immediately. He spoke kindly in his own way, but since he had lived as a soldier for a long time, his voice was hard and cold.\u201cBut she said it wasn\u2019t her. Why doesn\u2019t anyone listen to Rosen?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that you survived thanks to Rosen. But it is also clear that Rosen Haworth killed her husband.\u201d\u2018I swear, if Henry had taken my side, I would have bothered Ian by shouting that I\u2019ve never lied. But I don\u2019t want to put Layla in trouble, so I\u2019ll stay quiet.\u2019Layla dropped her head and ran into her grandfather\u2019s arms. She stretched her legs under the table and kicked Ian in the shin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why did you give Layla the coin?\u201d\u201cCoin?\u201dAt that moment, she remembered the lie she recently told.-Come on, take it. It\u2019s a lucky coin.-Yes, yes!-It\u2019s a secret, but it will turn into gold by sunset.After such a scam, she casually met Layla again and had completely forgotten the coin. Rosen naturally ignored it and answered only what Ian asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not mine, it was originally Layla\u2019s. I borrowed it for a while and returned it. I can\u2019t own anything in prison.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you feel uncomfortable, throw it into the sea.\u201dThe reason Ian dared to bring up the coin was probably to remind her of the lie she told Layla.He would probably say \u2018Rosen Haworth is a bloody liar.\u2019\u201cRosen didn\u2019t lie. It really was a lucky coin. I thought I was going to die, but I\u2019m alive!\u201dWhen coincidences overlapped, lies sometimes became the truth.But the coin didn\u2019t turn into gold. Children are naive, and their innocent minds are often taken advantage of. Rosen used Layla. That was it.\u201cLayla\u2026 all right. Let\u2019s eat. Whether I lied or not, don\u2019t think about it now. Anyway, it\u2019s nice to be able to have dinner with you all. I don\u2019t want to ruin this time.\u201dIan stared at Rosen and took a deep breath.She begged in her mind once again.\u2018Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in case you\u2019re mistaken, but you\u2019ll go back after dinner-\u201d\u201cI know, I know. I have to go back to my place. To prison.\u201dRosen nodded her head and dryly responded.Just in time, the crew cleared their empty plates and placed new food on the table. The moment she saw the colander of purple berries, she knew that Henry had fulfilled her favor.A smile formed on her lips out of nowhere.Ian looked over the new food and asked her.\u201cIs there anything you would like to eat?\u201d\u201cMaeria berries.\u201dWithout any hesitation, he reached out and took the plate. Rosen swallowed dry saliva. Maeria berries were a fruit that grew in the western part of the Empire. Because fruit rotted easily, raw fruit could only be tasted in its country of origin, but candied fruits could be stored for several years, so they were eaten everywhere in the Empire.It wasn\u2019t terribly expensive, but it wasn\u2019t particularly cheap, so it wasn\u2019t a staple food for the poor. Stewed berries were much cheaper than Maeria berries, and their quantity was large.In short, it wasn\u2019t strange to claim that she had never tried it.Ian scooped some berries onto a spoon. She opened her mouth wide. Even though the fruit hadn\u2019t even passed her lips, she got goosebumps down her back. It felt like she was forcibly swallowing a caterpillar, but there was nothing she could do.As soon as her molars crushed its crispy skin, the tart flesh burst into her mouth. Pain spread through her like she was chewing a knife. Blood oozed from her gums. She closed her eyes, enduring the disgust, and forced herself to swallow.She counted to three.\u2018One.\u2019\u2018Two.\u2019\u2018Three.\u2019Sure enough, the effect was clear.Her pupils grew larger and larger. As soon as the fruit touched her throat, an unpleasant heat rushed up her esophagus. Hives formed on her forearms and her chest tightened. She spat out blood that had pooled in her mouth.The bleeding started in her gums and got progressively worse. All of the sudden, her lips were covered in blood.\u201cWalker!\u201d\u201cMiss Walker!\u201d\u201cRosen!\u201dAt first, no one could understand the situation and were staring at her blankly, but they quickly got up from their seats and approached her with pale faces. Rosen, who was breathing hard, saw it and jumped for joy inside. A twisted smile spread across her face.\u2018All right, it worked.\u2019\u2018Ian Kerner, I\u2019ll never be taken back to jail.\u2019\u2018I need more time.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t believe Maria\u2019s bullshit that you like me, though I might have believed it 10 years ago.\u2019Because she, too, endured the war, looked up at the sky where Ian Kerner was, like an idiot, and had hope.But now she knew for sure.It was a lesson she learned only after paying a high price. There were no saviors in the world, and patience was always useless.A twinkling winter star could be a comfort in chilly darkness. But stars never came down to earth. A star was a star because it floated in an unreachable place. A beggar who only stared at the stars was buried in the snow and froze to death.\u2018I must not stand still.\u2019\u2018I have to save myself, even if it hurts me.\u2019Her thoughts were interrupted. That was the limit of her mental power. She grabbed her chest and lost her balance.Ian Kerner\u2019s face was all that filled her gaze. Her vision was blurred by the tears that fell regardless of her will, so she couldn\u2019t see what kind of expression he was making. Only his voice rang in her ears.\u201cHaworth!\u201d\u2018\u2026Ian Kerner should do what I intended. Please, I hope I can distract him for a moment.\u2019\u2018If I fall down like this, I will definitely hit the floor.\u2019Rosen thought a heavy pain would come over her soon. But that didn\u2019t happen. It was like wings had sprouted from her back.It was only as she lost consciousness that she realized that someone\u2019s sturdy arm was wrapped around her waist. He was supporting her as she fell. She could hear him calling her name in the distance.\u201cRosen!\u201d\u2018A hallucination.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s no way Ian Kerner would call my name so desperately.\u2019***\u201cSomeone poisoned the food.\u201d\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201dIan did not understand the doctor\u2019s words for a long time. As soon as Rosen Haworth ate the d*mn fruit, she vomited blood and collapsed. How was it not poisoned? As he fought in the war, he realized that an enemy on the inside was scarier than an enemy on the outside.And Rosen Haworth was a woman with many enemies. Everywhere in the Empire, there were people who wanted to kill this woman. Being in the middle of the sea was no hindrance. Obviously in the kitchen somewhere\u2026Ian bit his lip and spoke again.\u201cShe vomited blood as soon as she ate.\u201d\u201cI mean\u2026! It is true that it happened because she ate the fruit! But that does not mean that the fruit was poisonous!\u201dAlex Reville had been running wild since earlier, saying that a coward poisoned their food and made his guest collapse. The crew was busy chasing the Captain and stopping him, because he pulled out his pistol to duel the perpetrator right away. Henry Reville panicked again when he saw Rosen, who was covered in blood.In a word, Ian Kerner was the only person on this ship who could calmly listen to Rosen\u2019s medical diagnosis. The doctor had forced Ian to listen for an hour, sweating and explaining Rosen Walker\u2019s symptoms.Now that the doctor examined him, Ian Kerner didn\u2019t seem to be in a rational state\u2026For Ian Kerner, this was a turning point in its own way. Would he become a hero supported by the whole Empire? It all depended on the success of this job, whether he became a hero, or a heartless, emotionless villain who betrayed Leoarton.The doctor\u2019s gaze turned to the young woman lying on the bed. The most famous escaped prisoner in the Empire, and a war hero who must safely transport her to Monte Island.The first time he saw that naive, flabby face in the newspaper, she didn\u2019t look like a murderer at all. Well, that made it even more creepy. There was a reason why people called her a witch.The doctor swallowed his dry saliva and explained again.\u201cIt\u2019s just that this girl has a special condition. She has an allergy to berries. She was not poisoned, nor does she have food poisoning. Didn\u2019t you all eat together?\u201d\u201cThen you mean she did it to herself?\u201d\u201cThat may or may not be the case. If she didn\u2019t know about her allergy, it was an accident, and if she knew, she might\u2019ve been trying to kill herself. It could be a suicide attempt.\u201d\u201cA suicide attempt?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t she going to Monte? It\u2019s common. She would rather die than go there.\u201dThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. Ian felt his heart drop and was shocked.For a brief moment, his vision went white, and his chest squeezed.He knew this feeling. The moment he learned that Rosen Haworth had been arrested, the exact same feeling took hold of him.Ian looked down at Rosen, and unconsciously touched her pale face. It was cold. It was strange when a person who was full of energy a few hours ago was lying down like a corpse.Ian asked blankly.\u201cIs she going to die?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u2018Strange.\u2019Those were the only words that could describe his feelings for Rosen. He thought their first meeting was as a jailer and a prisoner, but in fact, they had known each other for a long time. She was a woman he had to deal with for a mission, but before he knew it, he was using Rosen Haworth as a way to relieve his emotions. When he saw Rosen, he felt guilty and angry, relieved and even disturbed.Although it was clear that he was receiving the punishment he deserved, he suddenly felt pitiful. He wanted to ignore her, but he kept paying attention.\u201cYou mean she won\u2019t die?\u201dAs he repeated the same question, the doctor became annoyed.\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? She is fine, just unconscious.\u201d\u201cThen why isn\u2019t she coming to her senses?\u201d\u201cHer body is very weak due to lack of nutrition. Her stamina is low, so when she faints, it\u2019s hard to wake up.\u201d\u201cThen if she doesn\u2019t wake up\u2026 Could she die?\u201d\u201cUntil we get to that point, I don\u2019t know. Aren\u2019t you a soldier who has gone through all sorts of hardships? It is not uncommon for prisoners to die. Even if she dies from disease\u2026 It\u2019s not unusual.\u201dJust then, the hem of Ian\u2019s pants was grabbed by someone\u2019s hand. It was Layla. The child who was quietly listening to the doctor and his conversation looked up at him with tears in her eyes.\u201cIan, are you going to put Rosen back in jail?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been there, and if you put Rosen back in this state, she will die tonight. Ian, are you going to kill Rosen? Can\u2019t we just let her rest a little bit?\u201dIan was amazed that he was agreeing with Layla. It was even more shocking that the reason wasn\u2019t to keep Rosen Haworth alive to take her to Monte Island.Ian put a hand on his forehead. His head hurt. He eventually opened his mouth and gave Henry a strange command.\u201cMove her to the cabin.\u201d\u201cWhich one are you talking about?\u201d\u201cMy cabin.\u201d\u201cYeah? A prisoner?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you worried about me?\u201d\u201cIs that possible? That\u2019s not it\u2026 \u201dHe understood. This was strange behavior.He was not in a position to convince Henry not to have feelings. Who on this ship had the most feelings for this prisoner right now? Was it really Henry?Fierce gazes flew between the two.Henry\u2019s mouth twitched as if he was about to say something more. Ian knew what he was going to say even if he didn\u2019t say it, so he spat out an excuse.\u201cI have to watch her myself.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t worried about the mission failing. These were his personal feelings. He couldn\u2019t figure out what it was, so he tried to push it aside out of fear, but they only grew.He was worried about her now.It was funny.\u2018You are a murderer, and I am dragging you to a hell that is worse than death.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s my job.\u2019\u2018Why the hell am I\u2026\u2019Ian firmly shut his mouth and looked down at Rosen. Her skinny body, with collarbones clearly exposed, trembled with every breath. She had not seen the sun for a long time, and her face was pale.Tired, squinted eyes, lifeless cheeks.He remembered the unexpected words that came out between those chapped lips.[I liked you, too.\u00a0 Like everyone else, you were a hero to me. Do you feel bad? Your voice and your appearance. When a flyer containing your picture fell from the sky, I picked it up and put it in a drawer.]He moved his hand towards her again. Rosen\u2019s frizzy flax hair curled around his fingers. It was thin and pale in color\u2026 she looked just like a ghost. It felt like she would crumble and scatter into dust at any moment.There was only one thing Ian could admit with certainty at that moment.He wanted Rosen Haworth to survive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If there is any food they can\u2019t eat or if they have ever been sick when they get close to specific foods.When she had a fever, Emily asked without fail.\u2013 Rosen, you have to tell me everything you know. It\u2019s information I need to create your medicine properly.Rosen insisted that Emily didn\u2019t have to worry about anything. She didn\u2019t know what Emily was talking about, but apparently, it was a unique chronic disease called an \u2018allergy\u2019 that the rich and poor had alike. Rosen had never encountered anything negative with food in her life. She ate everything well.And she paid a very high price for ignoring the words of a competent doctor. Surprisingly, there were some food items she shouldn\u2019t eat. Because of the Maeria juice mixed with the drug, her airway swelled and she almost suffocated. In the aftermath, she stopped taking her medicine and suffered from a fever that lasted 10 days.\u2013 You understand now, right? You almost died. You have to be very careful when you make medicine. In an instant, medicine can become poisonous. Think again, Rosen. Is there anything that you ate before that hurt?\u2013 In the orphanage, the director often ate purple fruit in a can. I was itchy whenever I went near it.\u2013 Don\u2019t ever eat it from now on. You could really die.\u2013 \u2026What\u2019s the name of the fruit?\u2013 Maeria berries.Emily must have taught her the name of the fruit so she could avoid it thoroughly. But Rosen had a different thought as she heard the name.\u2018Isn\u2019t suffocation a comfortable death?\u2018When life was unbearably painful, Rosen sometimes thought of the purple fruit.\u2013 Dirty! You haven\u2019t been a virgin since I bought you, right?\u2013 I saw you with the butcher\u2019s son, Tom. You did it with him secretly, didn\u2019t you? Did you like it so much that you moaned?At least it was better than being beaten to death by Hindley.The fact that she could choose a more comfortable death\u2026Paradoxically, it always soothed her heart and allowed her to continue on. If she had to die, she wanted to choose the way she went.***But she didn\u2019t mean to kill herself this time. She had no intention of dying. No, if she were going to die in the first place, she wouldn\u2019t suffer.When you die, it\u2019s over.When she opened her eyes again, it was evening. That was certainly the case, given that rays of red leaked through the deck above her head.\u2018One day?\u2019\u2018Two?\u2019Rosen couldn\u2019t figure out how long it had been.She was lying on a fluffy bed. When her consciousness returned, her senses slowly returned. Her body was itchy and her stomach was nauseous, as if her intestines had been flipped inside out.Her hands were handcuffed to the bedpost, but she didn\u2019t mind. She wasn\u2019t put back in prison. It was a prize worth the pain.She looked down at her body. She was wearing a clean and light chemise, something she had never had the luxury of wearing before. It must have been the kind attendants from before who changed her into clean indoor clothes. She felt sorry for them having to touch her blood and vomit. When she forced her stiff body to rise, she heard a voice.\u201cMiss Walker.\u201d\u201cSir Reville?\u201dUnfortunately, it was the Captain, not a crew member, who was sitting by her bedside. He soothed her with a smile. His grey hair glittered gold in the sunset.\u201cDo you know how much time is left before we arrive at Monte Island?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know? How much time is left.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201dRosen gave a stupid answer. In fact, it was difficult to tell whether this situation was a dream or a reality. Her senses had not yet fully returned, and she felt like she was in a lingering dream. Alex sat on the edge of the bed.\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive at the island in three days. We\u2019re continuing to head west, even though the wind is blowing in the opposite direction.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSince the invention of the steam engine, we have been able to easily fight the wind. Young people are more amazing. We overcame gravity and flew up into the sky in my lifetime. It looked so cool that I wanted to quit the Navy and join a squadron, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought.\u201dAlex\u2019s voice was sweet. Rosen didn\u2019t think he was guarding her bedside to personally explain how long she had left.She asked blankly.\u201cIs this the Captain\u2019s room?\u201d\u201cNo, this is Ian\u2019s cabin.\u201dWhen she came to her senses and looked around, she was sure. This was Ian\u2019s bed. She had noticed it when she was brought in for her interviews. She did not readily notice because of the change in perspective.Ian was not in the cabin. When she remembered Alex and Ian arguing, she paused. Ian was more unfriendly and principle-ist than she had imagined. It was unlikely that he would have willingly left the Captain and her alone.\u201cI guess you won this time\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s stubborn, I\u2019m strong. Now that I\u2019m older, I\u2019m running out of stamina, so I pretend to lose to him.\u201d\u201cThen where\u2019s Sir Kerner?\u201d\u201cHe went out to smoke for a while. I\u2019m just glad that I\u2019m able to talk to Miss Walker for a while.\u201dFor health and safety reasons, she had heard that pilots couldn\u2019t smoke.Yet, come to think of it, Ian smoked even when she was changing for dinner.When she looked at him with a strange expression, Alex replied with a smile.\u201cThe war is over, right?\u201c\u2026But Ian is still a pilot. Airplanes don\u2019t fly only during war, right?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to quit.\u201dShe was shocked for a second.But in the back of her mind, she always thought it might be so.Ian Kerner did not have to remain an active pilot. Being a pilot was an attractive but dangerous job, and he had earned all the honor he could achieve in the war. The military would have to create a higher position for him.Leaving the front line, training juniors, and directing operations would bring Ian a more stable life. And he deserved it.However, a strange sense of loss filled a corner of her chest. It wasn\u2019t because she had feelings for Ian. Everyone in the country would feel the same way.\u201cHe was very worried about Miss Walker.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not worry, it\u2019s regret. He hates to deviate from principles. He must be thinking that he\u2019s done me unnecessary favors and created a nuisance.\u201d\u201cIt is true that he is more blunt than his public image, but he is not as cold-blooded as you think.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you still have sympathy for me. He\u2019s an important person who demands respect.\u201dAlex smiled and asked again.\u201cDo you like Ian?\u201d\u201cOf course. Is there anyone who hates him?\u201dAlex chuckled at her words.Without notice, he began to search through Ian\u2019s desk. The wooden drawer made a creaking sound. Alex frowned.\u201cHe\u2019s so weird. It\u2019s rare for people to organize places that others don\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a soldier.\u201d\u201cI usually clean up when I roll call. If you go to an army dormitory once, you won\u2019t be able to say that like it\u2019s natural.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s still here. I gave this to Ian as a present. Was it when he was 12? I went on a voyage to the Canary Islands and got it for him.\u201dThere was something in his hand that glittered green. He held it out to Rosen. It looked like a small furry beast or a bird\u2019s nest made from a bush.\u201cIt\u2019s luminous moss that grows in the water. It has a lifespan of 20 years! It can\u2019t shine bright enough to read by, but the color is pretty, so it\u2019s perfect for a nightlight.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, this is a telescope and a chart that I also gave him as a gift. Surprisingly, he hardly throws anything away. Fan letters he received during the war are piled up in his mansion.\u201dAlex showed her a multitude of other mysterious clutter. They were all new to her.Once he was finished he approached her and sat down, opening an old sea map. With his wrinkled hands, he pointed out where they were and explained sailing as if he were teaching a child.Rosen gripped the moss tightly and looked up at Alex.She was inexperienced socially since she married too early and spent most of her life in prison. She didn\u2019t understand the meaning or analogy of words well. It meant that it was a pain to talk to ordinary people.But she never missed one thing.Information that people inadvertently spilled.She listened to the direction of the wind, the temperature, and the weather. Even if she didn\u2019t understand all the terms he spoke, she grasped their distance and trajectory towards the island. He was speaking without boundaries because he didn\u2019t know her and thought she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape, even if she knew these things.And in fact, Alex was not wrong.She didn\u2019t understand half of his simple explanation, and it would be crazy for her to jump into the sea with crude knowledge and equipment.Could she row safely to the mainland just because she vaguely knew the location of the ship and the direction of the wind? How likely was that?It wouldn\u2019t be long before she would die of dehydration or become shark food.But\u2026At least now she knew that when she obtained a boat, she had to steer eastward.People wondered how she succeeded in escaping from prison twice. The answer was simpler than they thought. She was able to succeed because she was reckless. When everyone thought it was hopeless, she took a step.Relying on a raft in the stormy sea, or climbing down a high cliff without a parachute.\u2018Ian Kerner thinks I could never cross this sea. That\u2019s good.\u2019Because that belief would blind him.She didn\u2019t know how long her luck would last. But she wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u201cI guess you\u2019ve known Sir Kerner since he was young.\u201d\u201cHe was Henry\u2019s senior at the military academy. He entered the military academy at the age of 10, and I\u2019ve been watching him ever since.\u201d\u201cYou two must have been close.\u201d\u201cNo, Henry hated him. He was his direct senior, and when we watched his training, he said Ian was a demon for how hard and inflexible he was.\u201dAlex paused.\u201cIn fact, even if it wasn\u2019t for Henry, I would have known about him. He was a noticeable boy in the military academy.\u201dRosen nodded, recalling Ian\u2019s handsome appearance and brilliant achievements. Even when he stood still he was noticeable, so it was fun learning what his childhood was like.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI wish I had a son like him.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ian has no parents.\u201dA heavy answer came back in the form of a casual murmur.Oh, she found out another fact she didn\u2019t want to know.There was a moment of silence. Soon Alex spoke in an unusual manner.\u201cHe lost both of his parents to an epidemic when he was very young. After moving from one relative\u2019s house to another due to his inheritance, he entered the military academy as soon as he could. He must have been furious by his mistreatment. The state manages cadets\u2019 property until they reach adulthood, so that method was the best.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause he became an adult too early, he rarely reveals his inner feelings and is never honest about them. As for me\u2026\u00a0 I feel sorry for the child who has been forced to grow up. If he has offended you, please understand.\u201dHe made excuses for Ian\u2019s personality while Rosen silently reflected on Alex\u2019s words. She didn\u2019t know why the Reville people were so anxious to defend Ian Kerner in front of her.Certainly, he wasn\u2019t the kind man she had imagined. Rather, he was a blunt person who thought it was easy to utter comforting broadcast messages throughout the war. So why was she disappointed in him?She was a prisoner for life, and he was a shining hero. It didn\u2019t matter what she thought.\u201cI don\u2019t hate Sir Kerner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI listened to his broadcasts a lot. You may not believe it, but I still like him. Rather, that\u2019s the problem. I mean\u2026 I\u2019m not used to it. He whispers sweetly that he will protect me, but then he speaks meanly to me in front of others.\u201dShe revealed her teeth and laughed mischievously. Alex stared at her for a long time before grabbing her hand tightly.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t try to end your life. Please.\u201dIt was only then that she realized the reason why Alex stayed at her bedside, chatting idly. He thought that she had attempted suicide.Alex must have had a hard time, too. It may be due to the myth that if someone commits suicide on a ship it is considered unlucky, or that if a prisoner who saved his granddaughter died after eating the food he served her he may not look good, or simply because he didn\u2019t want to disrupt Ian Kerner\u2019s mission. Regardless, he was sitting here warning her not to act this way again, gently.\u201cAh, I understand why you are misunderstanding, but that\u2019s really not the case. It was just a coincidence. When I was a child, I saw someone eating candied fruit. I\u2019ve wanted to try it at least once since then. I am-\u201cAs the reason for his warm attitude became clear, it became easier for her to answer him. It was kindness without cause, not hostility without cause that made her uncomfortable.But she received a completely different answer than she expected.\u201cI had a daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou share many similarities, so I keep thinking of her. She was our first child after 15 years of marriage. I got her late and lost her early.\u201dLayla\u2019s mother, Henry\u2019s older sister, and Alex\u2019s daughter. Rosen imagined the woman, whose name she didn\u2019t know.\u2018Was she like me? No, she couldn\u2019t have been.\u2019That would be an insult to her.A lady of the Reville family, who had brilliant blonde hair like the sun. But how could a father who lost his daughter be cold? After he lost his daughter, his heart would have broken when he saw a young woman of her age. Struggling to find a similarity, realizing that his daughter was no longer of this world, he must have been sad again.Tears blur your vision\u2026While looking at a prisoner\u2019s hair as dull as wheat, he saw his daughter\u2019s brilliant blonde hair.\u201cIt hurt when she left my sight. I wanted her to live with us for the rest of my life. But children grow up, and not even parents can stop it. My daughter had a man she loved.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I told her that if she was happy, I would let her marry, so I let her go. But\u2026 her marriage seemed to have been unhappy. She was a proud child, and seldom showed her emotions, but I could see it in her eyes\u2026\u201d\u2018What was the problem?\u2019\u2018Did the man who married such a prestigious lady cheat on her? Was he mad that she didn\u2019t have more children?\u2019\u2018Or maybe she got hit?\u2019\u2018While I was cowering in fear of Hindley, did the lady suffer the same thing?\u2019Rosen was a girl from an orphanage who had nowhere in the world where she belonged, so she endured everything and lived. But why didn\u2019t the lady who had a strong family end her marriage? Was she afraid of embarrassment? Or maybe she didn\u2019t want to be a burden to her family?At the end of her train of thought, Rosen suddenly realized the crucial difference between her and the lady.The lady had a child\u2026Alex didn\u2019t say anything more. Rosen did not intend to open old wounds by digging further.\u201c\u2026 How is your body now? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201dHe laid her back on the bed and advised her to get some rest. She nodded hesitantly and rolled over, hugging the blanket. Instead of leaving right away, Alex spoke softly.\u201cTake care of yourself. Didn\u2019t I say we still have a ways to Monte?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think Miss Walker is a person who never gives up. It\u2019s been like that ever since\u2026\u201dRosen could always interpret meaningful words straight away. It was done by intuition and instinct.Three days, wind, current, location, and weather. How to row and the distance to the mainland.\u2013 The Reville family will surely repay this favor.Alex didn\u2019t inadvertently leak information.He hinted that he wouldn\u2019t stop her from escaping.Alex already knew she hadn\u2019t given up. And while he wasn\u2019t in a position to help her outright, he was willing to at least assist.She clenched her fists. Chains still bound her wrists, but Alex\u2019s words lightened her heart quite a bit.\u2018Now think, Rosen Walker.\u2019\u2018You\u2019ve been given another chance, so you mustn\u2019t blow it.\u2019He placed the luminescent moss on the bedside table. It emitted a faint blue light in the darkened cabin.To her, it looked like a lighthouse in the middle of a distant sea.\u2018Everything you need is here. You just need to find the key.\u2019\u2018Ian Kerner, enslave me or kill me, as long as I get the key to the lifeboat from that [email\u00a0protected]@rd.\u2019\u2018If only I could steal a gun\u2026\u2019At that moment, the ship shook, almost as a reminder that she was isolated and surrounded by water. The sound of waves crashing and gears creaking filled her mind. Naturally, she had no choice but to remember the scene Ian had shown her.The sea was stained with blood the moment fish were thrown into it.-The sea is full of monsters.\u2018To say that I am not afraid is deceiving myself.\u2019\u2018But I also know how to overcome fear.\u2019An old memory unfolded before her eyes. The night Hindley died, she held Emily, who was sobbing, hugged her, and said.-Emily, go to Walpurgis Island. You are a witch, so you will be able to get there just fine.-Rosen, you\u2026!-I won\u2019t die. I will never die. I promise, Emily.At that moment, she was proud of how brave she was. That day, she realized for the first time what pride was.Why people gave up comfort and chose the thorny road, and how wonderful that was.In her humble life, it was the brightest moment. A memory that sparked a flame in her heart whenever she remembered it.Fear melted away, flames created steam, and she soared into the sky.-We\u2019ll see each other again.Her engine was still burning. She would never die in prison as a handcuffed criminal. She would win in the end.\u2018I will never, ever lose. To any being, or anything.\u2019***Ian did not enter the cabin until midnight. Rosen thought he would stick around and keep staring at her, so she was surprised.A large form entered the cabin.She fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the door opening. The buttons on her top had been loosened. She spoke to Ian with a languid expression on her face, as if welcoming her husband, who had returned to home.\u201c\u2026Where did you go?\u201dUnfortunately, he completely ignored her, so her gestures were meaningless. She wasn\u2019t expecting much anyway. He stood by the bed without saying a word for a long time. When he did speak, he spat out short words in a voice that was dripping with anger.\u201cYour body\u2026\u201d\u2018Is it that hard to ask how my body is?\u2019She asked again, pretending he hadn\u2019t cut himself off.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cI was standing in front of the cabin.\u201d\u201cYou have a very busy life. Don\u2019t you usually leave these kinds of chores to subordinates?\u201d\u201cIt is the minister\u2019s direct order for me to transport you.\u201d\u201cDoes that person hate you? Is that why he\u2019s making you do this? Is he jealous because you are young and handsome?\u201dHe stared at her smirking face and reluctantly replied.\u201cYou tend to underestimate your fame. You are more famous than me.\u201dHe intervened and she burst into laughter. There was truth to his words. It was true that her articles were more interesting than Ian Kerner\u2019s, which were all praise.Good news was usually more boring than bad news.\u201cI\u2019m certainly more notorious than you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done eating, am I going back to jail now?\u201d\u201cNo, you can stay here until we reach the island. I heard you have health problems.\u201dShe wanted to hug and kiss him. She was dying with happiness.That doctor was really amazing!The quack in Al Capez would have been babbling like he was a genius as soon as she regained consciousness.\u201cI\u2019m fine. But this is your cabin. Can I use it? Where are you going to sleep?\u201dInstead of answering, he pointed to his armchair. Although quite large for the cabin, he was so tall that he could barely lie down, even if he crumpled his body.\u201cAre there any other cabins?\u201d\u201cThis is my cabin. Where would I go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t roll your eyes. I see everything.\u201d\u2018He must really be a mind-reader.\u2019She coughed and looked away. Naturally, he wasn\u2019t as dumb as Al Capez\u2019s guards, so the lifeboat key was removed from his belt after her first interview.\u201cNo, what? I\u2019m sorry. Then I\u2019ll sleep over there. You sleep on the bed.\u201d\u201c\u2026A sofa is lighter than a bed.\u201d\u2018Oh my God. Are you worried that I might steal the sofa and jump into the sea?\u2019\u2018He came right up to me and shook the handcuffs on my wrists to make sure they weren\u2019t rusted. He even checked whether the chains were tied tightly to the bedposts!\u2019He stared at her for a long time. His expression was enraged, but she understood why. It would have been easier if she had been quietly thrown into prison, but things got messy while he was doing her a favor.Ian opened his mouth while she was contemplating whether they could share the bed or if she should push for the sofa.\u201c\u2026You were about to die.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThere is a law against doing that.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tie me up in this room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe didn\u2019t mean to die. She shook her head vigorously, but he didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cYou really didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know. You knew that eating that fruit could kill you. So, with an excuse, you asked Henry for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026No-\u201cRosen wanted to cover her ears, but she couldn\u2019t. Her hands were still bound by cold chains.\u201cAre you happy?\u201d\u201cNo, listen to me-\u201d\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d\u201cSir Kerner! Listen to me!\u201d\u201cYou made me feed you with my hands.\u201dIan didn\u2019t even pretend he heard her. As he continued to raise his voice, color gathered at the nape of his neck. It was the first time Rosen had seen this side of him. It was unfamiliar.He was not easy to anger. He didn\u2019t even yell when he was interrogating her. It was the same when she offended him or said rude things to him.If Alex Reville was the epitome of the classic hero who took control of a fleet with a roar, Ian Kerner was a gentle hero who was famous for his broadcasts and looks.He dominated radio waves and led them to triumph, a hero worthy of a new era.He was also a great human being. It wasn\u2019t easy to make Ian Kerner angry.But he must have been so excited that he had forgotten how to think calmly. She was a jailbreaker.\u2018If I am going to die like this, then why have you suffered so much?\u2019While trying to come up with a refute so that he would calm down, Rosen suddenly realized that she didn\u2019t have to. Why should she?Ian\u2019s face was close to hers. She tried her best to form a sad expression.\u201c\u2026Yeah, I\u2019ll die before I arrive. What am I going to do alive?\u201cIf he misunderstood, she would just leave it as it was.He wouldn\u2019t believe her anyway.\u2018What will cause him to feel sorry for me?\u2019\u2018Will he feel sorry for me with this opportunity?\u2019She started babbling whatever came to mind in a raspy voice with a face that looked as pitiful as possible.\u201cIt would be better to die cleanly now, rather than going to an island and being tortured and enslaved to death.\u201dBut, as it turned out, the return was not the sympathy she wanted. He sighed and grabbed her cheeks with one hand, forcing her to face him, and spat out one word at a time.\u201cDo you think this is up to you? Are the handcuffs on your wrists not enough? Do I have to tie up your limbs to wake you up?\u201dIt was a warning, close to intimidation. The tears that were welling up in her eyes threatened to fall out.\u201cAre you crazy? You\u2019re going to tie me up here again?\u201d\u201cIf you do something stupid, I\u2019ll tie your legs to the bed.\u201dHe threatened her again without hesitation. He seemed sincere as he gestured at a rope in the corner of the cabin with his chin. Now, Rosen had a reason to be angry. She glared at him and started an argument that she couldn\u2019t win.\u201cI will bite my tongue.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll gag your mouth too.\u201d\u201cThen I will hold my breath.\u201d\u201cSay something that makes sense. You cannot die by holding your breath.\u201dIan finally declared and gave strength to the hand holding her. Not having anything to say, Rosen bit her pouty lip. Her wrists were pulled tight. The distance between him and her, who were already close, became narrower. It was a breath-taking distance.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t understand. Why would a person who escaped from prison twice try to commit suicide in vain?\u201dThere was no time to cower awkwardly in embarrassment. More nonsense came out of his mouth. Rosen chuckled.\u2018Are you calling that into question now? You don\u2019t know about that? Or are you making fun of me without knowing it?\u2019Unknowingly, she raised her voice.\u201cBecause I can\u2019t escape! As you said, we\u2019re surrounded by the sea, and I\u2019m on my way to that d*mn island!\u201dIt was Ian Kerner who taught her that with childish threats.\u2018Give up and be quiet.\u2019\u2018You have sinned and are being punished as you deserve.\u2019Wasn\u2019t it ironic that he came to ask her why she gave up?\u201c\u2026I was really wary of you. But I never thought you\u2019d commit suicide. I know you. You\u2019re not the kind of person to give up until you run out of breath.\u201d-I know you.\u2018Do you know me?\u2019Those words stood out. Up until now, she was just annoyed, but now she was so angry that her hair turned white. Rosen asked, smirking.\u201cSir Kerner, did you eat rat poison for lunch?\u201d\u2018I like him. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s the guard who\u2019s going to throw me into prison on Monte, if he scares me with monsters, or even if things don\u2019t go well and he points a gun at me.\u2019Ian Kerner was a soldier, and he was just doing what he was supposed to do. That was the man she knew and liked.\u201c\u2026Do you know me? How much do you know? What do you pretend you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSir Kerner, answer me. What do you know?\u201dBut he didn\u2019t know her.No one in this Empire could say that they knew her.The witch of Al Capez.Murderer.Such nicknames she had become accustomed to.She didn\u2019t really care what anyone said.But she couldn\u2019t stand pretending to know those who didn\u2019t even understand her.He was her hero.So Ian Kerner should never say that.For a long time, she took deep breaths and glared at him. He kept his eyes level on her, watching her expressions. Annoyed and angry, he seemed to have regained his composure as she simmered.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t be angry. Of course, I don\u2019t know.\u201dHer vision suddenly brightened.Ian was staring intently at her, tucking the flax hair that was covering her eyes behind her ears.He didn\u2019t care if her breath hit his cheek.\u201cBut I definitely know more than you think. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201dHis voice was so soft that it didn\u2019t suit the situation.That was the voice she knew.His broadcast voice.It was the first time she had heard it after getting on this ship.Habit was a scary thing, and she was calmed down by that voice. Like a tamed dog.Even though she was angry with him, she became as quiet as a child. Not wanting to admit defeat, she raised her voice more sharply.\u201cDo you think you know me because you read some newspaper articles?\u201d\u201cI read all the articles about you.\u201d\u201cExplain so I can understand. What the hell are you trying to say to me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t die.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026Promise me you won\u2019t kill yourself. Stay calm as long as you are on the ship.\u201dIan sighed and explained.In fact, it was a reasonable command.It was a request so simple that she couldn\u2019t understand why he had avoided saying it.Rosen laughed.\u201cWhat? Wouldn\u2019t it be good for you if I stayed calm and went to Monte Island? Why should I give up my last way to screw myself? Regardless of what happens to me, I\u2019m going to die anyway. I can\u2019t stay long on Monte Island. That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t escape. I showed you-\u201d\u201cYes, I know that! Listen. I\u2019m making a suggestion. It won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dIan stared at Rosen with a strange expression and picked up the chain that was laying on the floor. He took one of his keys out of his front pocket.And in the next moment, Ian\u2019s actions made Rosen startled.He got down on one knee and unlocked the handcuffs that were holding her. The chains that had bound her forever fell from her body in an instant, like magic. Her body, which had suddenly become relaxed, was awkward and unable to move.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dIan got off the floor and finally answered.\u201c\u2026I will release you while you are under my watch in my cabin. It won\u2019t be for long, but you\u2019ll be able to sleep and eat properly. You\u2019ll be able to look back on your life calmly until the voyage is over.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, promise me, Rosen.\u201dHe bent down and came to her eye level.As if soothing a crying child, he spoke sweet words in the voice that she loved.Ian Kerner was a soldier.And he was ordered to transport her safely to the island of Monte.He believed that she would kill herself whenever she had a chance.He was a man who must accomplish what he had to do.So, this may seem a little absurd, but from his point of view, it was a reasonable proposal in its own way.\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s right to think that way.\u2019-You made me feed you with my hands.-Are you happy?-\u2026I don\u2019t understand. Why would a person who escaped from prison twice try to commit suicide in vain?Rosen raised her head and stared at him.\u201cPromise me. You will not commit suicide.\u201dHe furrowed his handsome eyebrows, urging her.-Promise me.This misunderstanding was not her fault.Obviously, that was a bit weird to say.\u2018Doesn\u2019t it sound like Ian Kerner doesn\u2019t want me to die?\u2019***[T/N: A wonderful and long chapter!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if this was a trap, she had nothing to lose.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI hate jokes.\u201d\u201cThen I promise.\u201dThe ship would arrive at Monte Island in three days.She didn\u2019t have much time.She was afraid that he might retract his offer, so she quickly nodded and kicked the shackles that had fallen to the floor. Still, she made a face that was as neutral as possible, hiding the budding hope in her heart.She had to keep tricking him. From now on, she was a woman who gave up on her life. If she showed any signs that she had hope, the quick-witted man would ruin everything.\u2018Think about it, Rosen. What does a prisoner who has given up everything and has only three days to live want?\u2019It wasn\u2019t long before she found the answer.\u201cBring me a drink, please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTobacco too.\u201dAlcohol was strategically brought up, but the request for a cigarette was sincere. She didn\u2019t smoke too often, so she thought he\u2019d say no. Ian hesitated for a moment. Rosen hurriedly justified herself before he denied her request outright.\u201cYou don\u2019t allow inmates on death row to have their \u2018Last Supper\u2019?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only three days. Can\u2019t you do that?\u201dWithout saying a word, Ian pulled a cigarette from his chest pocket and held it out. She shook her head and put the cigarette into her mouth. Sadly, he lit it for her, as she was not allowed to draw a match.Familiar smoke rose. It was only then that she was able to breathe properly, like a person rescued from deep underwater. Ian stared at her for a moment and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll bring you a drink tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s late.\u201dShe inhaled the smoke again and again and smiled casually. The first cigarette burned out quickly. With a sad expression on her face, he held out another. She did not refuse.\u2018He\u2019ll make me sleep the moment I finish smoking, and I don\u2019t want to go to bed yet\u2026\u2019There was no particular reason.They needed to talk about something. It was a waste to pass the time in silence. They had to build something similar to intimacy by asking and answering questions.\u2018Why don\u2019t I look at the sky to see the stars? If I keep my mouth shut, nothing will happen.\u2019The problem was that Ian Kerner arbitrarily ignored her questions. There were a lot of things she wanted to ask, but they were all things she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to answer.Like, \u2018Where is the lifeboat key?\u2019She shook her head, searching for a question he could answer.As she looked at the cigarette pack in his front pocket, she thought of something. A question that was trivial, not very intimidating, and had tickled her before.\u201cSir Kerner. I have a question.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhen did you start smoking? Pilots can\u2019t smoke.\u201d\u201cSince the war ended.\u201dHe responded surprisingly succinctly. Looking at him in the dark cabin with minimal light, she could tell he had a very straight face, and was sitting in the armchair with his arms crossed. She tilted her head, staring at his face as if possessed.\u201cWhy do you smoke?\u201d\u201cCan I not smoke?\u201dIt was the tone of a rebellious adolescent boy.She might\u2019ve been mistaken, but at least that\u2019s what she heard.She laughed a little.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, but it doesn\u2019t suit you. You\u2019re a pilot.\u201dShe said and looked at him.She heard through Alex that Ian had decided to quit piloting. But it was a fact she didn\u2019t want to believe until she heard confirmation from his own mouth.Heaven was his place.He shone the most there.A red scarf, goggles, and army fatigues. In the fliers, he was always smiling confidently. Each time the Imperial Squadron flew over like a flock of migratory birds, Rosen ran up the hill and looked up at the sky.\u2013\u2018Ian Kerner is a commander, so he must be on the most advanced plane.\u2019Thinking like that, Rosen looked for him, her arms stretched out, grabbing at the fighter jets that looked like little toys.Then, for a moment, her body seemed to float away. Away from reality that was holding her back. It was like she was really flying in the sky.It was an immature idea, but looking back, she didn\u2019t have much interest in winning or losing the war. She just liked him flying across the blue sky. She liked the sense of freedom he gave her.\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\u2018\u2026But wishing him to keep flying is just my greed. What does he want to do with his life?\u2019\u201c\u2026Because the war is over.\u201dTheir conversation was quickly cut off. He turned his head and looked out the dark window.The night sea spread out beyond the cabin window. Because of the yellow lighting installed on the deck, the water was more beautiful than in the daytime. It looked like they were part of the night sky, embroidered with stars.This was not the time to be immersed in sentimentality, but the scenery was unrealistically beautiful. She felt strange for a while. Her lips moved on their own. Thoughts came out in words.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt was a confused tone. He didn\u2019t seem to have expected her to ask such a pointless question. She nagged.\u201cThe war is over, so why don\u2019t you get married? Do you have a girlfriend?\u201d\u201c\u2026You are curious about everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just me. Your fans all over the Empire are curious.\u201dWas it because it was night?Or did he feel sympathy for the soon-to-be-dead prisoner and become more sensitive?Although these were negligible questions, he answered them without a hint of annoyance.\u201cBecause you never know when a pilot who goes to war will die. After an accident, it is difficult for the ones left behind to recover. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have a family.\u201d\u201cSo, what soldiers can marry? Did you go to war without a picture of your lover on inside of your military cap?\u201dAs Rosen giggled, Ian\u2019s lips moved slightly.She didn\u2019t know if he was really smiling or if it was just an optical illusion created by the shadows from the moonlight.\u201cIt\u2019s true that there are a lot of them, but not everyone does such silly things.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s silly?!\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t stand the silly faces of men looking at their lover\u2019s picture. I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a silly thing to do. Even if it\u2019s a family photo.\u201d\u201cIs your personality that dry?\u201dHe raised his eyebrow. However, given that he did not deny it, he seemed to think so himself.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a little different from your broadcast.\u201d\u201cOriginally, I didn\u2019t have that aptitude. It was difficult.\u201dIndeed it was. In fact, the person she met wasn\u2019t the type to be sarcastic enough to say such unfamiliar words. He must have reluctantly read the scripts someone had written for him. Oddly enough, she wasn\u2019t disappointed after she found out the truth.Wouldn\u2019t it be the same as believing Ian Kerner when he said he would protect everyone, even though that\u2019s impossible? We needed him and his lies. Just like how we love rainbows after rain, even though we know we can\u2019t catch them.\u201cThen why did you do it? Did you get pushed to?\u201d\u201cBecause I thought it was necessary.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a sin to be born handsome. It\u2019s better than not being able to do it even if you want to because you\u2019re ugly, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe definitely laughed this time. It was small, but it was definitely a smile. After all, he didn\u2019t say he was not, so he seemed to know that he was handsome.It was a fact that she knew even without a mirror.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think marriage is that necessary.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t understand. If I were you, I would have had three wives. I didn\u2019t know it when I was young, but when I got older, I realized that it\u2019s much better to have a third of a good man than all the bad men. It\u2019s fun to play with a good man.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s the wisdom of married women. Like\u2026 firstly, the existence of a man is not necessary in life. Oh, that doesn\u2019t mean I killed Hindley.\u201dRosen quickly added, just in case. After smoking for a long time, the tension between them subsided. He was speechless and looked at her with a puzzled look, then smirked.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? The Empire became monogamous a long time ago.\u201d\u201cWhy? Guys better than you have a lot of wives. I was Hindley\u2019s second wife.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Didn\u2019t the reporters write that in an article? Oh right, you didn\u2019t know. Because I didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201dThe cigarette that was spewing smoke eventually turned into a butt. Unfortunately, the bait she threw didn\u2019t seem to interest Ian very much. Without delay, he gestured to the bed.\u201cNow sleep.\u201d\u201cDo you want to hear more? I\u2019ll tell you a more interesting story than what was printed.\u201d\u201cNot interested.\u201dHe got up from his seat, laid her down on the bed, and pulled the blanket up to her shoulders. At the bedside was a dimly lit gas lamp. He pulled the chair close to the bed, and sat motionless as a statue, his eyes beating down on her.Rosen asked, pointing to the chain.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tie me up again?\u201d\u201cI just need to tie you up when I sleep.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to sleep?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t sleep that long.\u201dHis constitution could be like that, but he always looked tired.\u201cDo you not want to sleep? Or can you not sleep?\u201d\u201cBoth.\u201dHe gave a vague answer, and dimmed the gas lamp by the bedside further. Then he held out a wad of cotton.She was wondering what it was. It was a cute teddy bear.She stared at him, bewildered.\u201cI\u2019m not a child\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift from Layla.\u201dAt those words, he tried to put the bear away, but she grabbed it from him before he could.\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ll arrive at the island in three days, how can I fall asleep? I mean, you can\u2019t sleep a lot if you know you are going to die.\u201dAs she was almost pushed to bed, she protested loudly.\u201cBut you can\u2019t stay up for three days. Close your eyes and try to fall asleep. Hold the doll and count sheep.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know the truth?\u201d\u201cI already know the truth.\u201dHe ignored her words.\u2018Listen or don\u2019t, do whatever you want.\u2019\u2018As long as he has ears, he\u2019ll hear my words anyway. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can just cover them.\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll talk until I fall asleep. Whether you listen or not, I will speak.\u201dRosen was stubborn. She pulled the blanket around her and faced where he was sitting. She looked into his eyes and opened her mouth again.\u201cI didn\u2019t write the articles or the judgment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStories usually depend on the person telling it, and at least one person in this vast Empire should listen to me. Believe it or not, do whatever you want. You\u2019ll have to wait until I fall asleep anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe it anyway. Why? You\u2019re not confident? You\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll fall for it? It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s over. There\u2019s nothing compelling about what I say now.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even respond to the provocative words. She hugged the doll he had thrown her and curled up like a fetus. The engine still burning within her, she played up her despair as best she could.\u201cSo listen. Even prisoners have the right to say their last words.\u201dShe impulsively grabbed his hand as he sat on the bed. It wasn\u2019t a gesture of seduction, but a clinging out of desperation. Like the outstretched hand of a man hanging from a cliff, or the fragile grip of a child holding their parents\u2019 hand. Whether it was communicated to Ian or not, he didn\u2019t shake it off.He just left it as it was\u2026He didn\u2019t force it or hit it away.\u201cI\u2019ll start the story when I was fifteen. My life before that was really boring.\u201dThe sound of the waves hit her ears.Rosen moistened her dry lips.His body temperature moved through her fingertips up to her arms, making her heart race.Without obtaining his consent, she started talking on her own terms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the same every day. She lived in an orphanage for as long as she could remember, and she wasn\u2019t able to leave it for 15 years. She woke up early in the morning, cleaned like a maid, ate whatever was given to her like a pig, and barely fell asleep, exhausted.The funniest thing that happened there was making the director fall over by covering the floor with candles.Tired of labor, the children lost their innocence early. So did she. Due to lack of food, food had to be stolen, and if caught, they blamed anyone else. On bad days, you would be framed.It didn\u2019t matter. Because everyone was stealing, in the end, they were punished fairly. It was only the difference between getting hit early or late. Besides, she had a strong temper, so she gave back what she received. All the children who pushed her had to roll down the stairs and get bruises.Sometimes she was hit even though she didn\u2019t do anything wrong when the director or nannies were in a bad mood.-You little rat!She crouched like a ball and endured the harsh beatings. She always stole food on those days. She was always punished first, so she didn\u2019t feel regretful even if she made a mistake. If her stomach was full, the wounds felt less painful.When winter came, children who were not strong or not quick with their hands died one after another from pneumonia caused by malnutrition.Fortunately, she wasn\u2019t of that kind.Living was hard.Still, she was not pessimistic about life.She originally thought everyone lived like that. Because she didn\u2019t know anything else. The scenery inside the orphanage\u2019s gate was all she knew.But once, and only once, she had a glimpse of an ordinary life.She thought about it sometimes.\u2018If I hadn\u2019t seen it that day, would my life have been different?\u2019\u2018Could it have been a more dull and boring, but flat life?\u2019\u2018No hope, no despair.\u2019Even if it wasn\u2019t for that, she would have realized it someday. So she had no regrets.Knowing was always better than not knowing at all.At least she thought so.***It was winter.On her way back from washing laundry in the icy river with her red, frozen hands, she noticed a bright light leaking out of a house. That yellow light seemed infinitely warm. She approached it as if possessed.It was the feast of St. Walpurg, a festival that came once a year. It was the birthday of the greatest witch in history. People gathered with their families to enjoy dinner, exchange gifts, and came out to the square at midnight to light gas lamps and dance all night long.Witches hid on Walpurgis Island, and even in an age where witchcraft was persecuted to the point where a witch hunter was a popular profession, old customs were still strong. In the private sector, the Walpurg feast was still the biggest event.Brown-haired children were sitting around a table, hitting it as if playing drums. She couldn\u2019t hear a single word, but immediately recognized that they were sisters, as the children looked alike.Soon after, a kind-looking man appeared with a cake frosted with cream. The children jumped up and circled around the man. They put their hands together and prayed, and together they extinguished the candles and cut the cake.The eldest child took turns hugging her sisters, taking out the presents hidden under her table, and distributing them. Their faces were full of smiles. The children, who unwrapped the pretty wrapping paper like candy shells, each held their gifts and looked around.Without realizing it, she wiped the frosted window with her frozen hands. It was so cold outside that she couldn\u2019t feel her nose, but even the winter wind seemed to be unable to invade the warm house.A teddy bear with a pretty red ribbon appeared from the gift box of a girl of the same age as her.\u2018Wow, pretty\u2026\u2019Perhaps the child and her both exclaimed at the same time. She stood by the window, clasping her shivering hands, as the child ran to her father with the teddy bear and hugged him.Judging by the shape of her mouth, the child seemed to be thanking her father. She opened her eyes wide to peek at what the child\u2019s father was saying.\u201cI love you.\u201d\u2018I love you?\u2019A quiet shock took hold of her.She thought it was just a phrase from a radio play. A faceless male actor uttered fictional words to an actress who could only hear his voice. It was completely useless to her, so she thought it was a bit ridiculous and childish.On the day the play ended, she would giggle while saying \u2018I love you\u2019 in an exaggerated tone.But it wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t the actors who were stupid, it was her. That\u2019s what people actually said to each other. Daughter to father, mother to newborn, lovers to one another. The moment she realized that fact, she became unbearably sad.She only realized it at that moment.What a warm phrase \u2018I love you\u2019 was.And the fact that no one ever said that to her\u2026\u201cI love you\u2026\u201dShe mumbled those words blankly. The \u2018I love you\u2019 which came out of her mouth lingered in the cold air and entered her ears again. It was empty and lonely, unlike the silent \u2018I love you\u2019 seen through the window. Her heart ached the more she exhaled.She was the only one who could say \u2018I love you\u2019 to herself, and the thought made her burst into tears.\u201cI love you\u2026\u201dThe way back was long. She was beaten harshly for finishing the laundry late. Oddly enough, her heart hurt more than the leg that was beaten that day. She was cold and empty.She limped and went to the bedroom. It was a place where about twenty children slept, piled like luggage. There weren\u2019t enough cheap beds made of iron frames, so juniors were pushed to the cold floor. Her bed was also near the window with severe drafts.Of course, it was cold. She needed something soft and warm. The warm scenery she had seen a while ago hovered in front of her. Even if it was not a living being with a beating heart\u2026 something to hug. Even if it was a ball of cotton.She got up and wandered around the dark room. But there was no way such a cozy thing existed in this place. The orphanage was made of iron bars, cold stone floors, and icy wooden posts. People were the only ones who had warmth, but it was better to hug a pillar than to hug orphanage mates.The moment she got caught hugging someone with a tear-drenched face, they would brand her as a weakling. Laughter and bullying would follow.Craving for warmth was what Anna, who was weak in this place, did. The children despised her foolishness and tears. Actually, she was the same until yesterday. She thought it was pathetic to see a child crouching and crying because she had been beaten up or bullied a bit.Rosen was a child who never cried, because crying wouldn\u2019t change anything. No less beaten, no less work. Wasn\u2019t it enough to just endure it? You just had to spend today like yesterday and wait for tomorrow.She was wrong. Anna wept not because of pain, but because of longing. Not because she was weak, but because she was sad. Unlike Rosen, Anna knew what a bright and warm world was, and she knew how cold and lonely the place they were right now was.\u201cI love you, Rosen.\u201dShe found out that day.That she was lonely\u2026She leaned against the window, buried her face in her lap, and wept bitterly. It was dark before her eyes, and she had no one to hold her. There was nothing to miss at all.Cakes, warm houses, teddy bears\u2026She had nothing.She didn\u2019t think that was unfair. She compared the children\u2019s white, chubby cheeks with her blurry reflection in the window. The children were lovely, and she was like a corpse.Maybe this was normal.Just, she was upset. She was a child who was good at giving up. She was able to accept anything.Her tears were just\u2026 Because it was difficult to endure the cold and darkness. That was why. She wanted to believe so.\u201c\u2026I love you.\u201dShe got up and hugged the wooden posts that supported the orphanage building. They were hard and absurdly cold, but better than nothing.On the Feast of St. Walpurg, people put candles on cakes and make wishes to the greatest witch in history, Walpurg. Because they believed that Walburg would grant one of the poorest and most desperate of people\u2019s wishes. She had no cake to offer as a tribute to the witch, but she still made a wish shamelessly. She didn\u2019t prepare the most delicious cake in Leoarton, but she was sure to be the poorest child in Leoarton.-Walpurg, let me meet someone who hugs me warmly. Someone who sincerely tells me that they love me. Anyone. If that\u2019s too much to ask\u2026 Even if it\u2019s a lie when they say they love me, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll just believe it.-As long as that person hugs me warmly.***Even after realizing her loneliness, time flew by. Not much had changed. Her sad memories were clouded by busy daily life. She was sad a little more than before, but it was hard for her to just be sad. Tiredness or loneliness had to be dulled.So came her fifteenth birthday.\u201cRosen Walker! The director is calling!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201dShe realized that the final turning point of her life had come. She put down the laundry basket she was carrying and ran to the director\u2019s room.When a girl was over fifteen, she could no longer stay in the orphanage. The director sold the children raised with minimal resources at the highest possible price. The pretty children became the concubines of wealthy old people, and the strong children became maids.The director became the neighborhood\u2019s best businesswoman in her ten years of running the orphanage. The orphanage received a steady flood of donations, and her face was often featured in the local newspaper. Only the people inside the iron bars knew the truth.Anyway, she already knew her future. Some children said it was better to be a concubine, while others said it was better to be a maid.-Once you become a maid, you have no choice but to live as a maid until you die.-A concubine is swayed by their husband\u2019s planning. I\u2019d rather be a maid who earns money proudly.-Do you think a maid doesn\u2019t care about their master? If you\u2019re unlucky, you\u2019ll get a perv\u2026It\u2019s better to have a husband.She could have looked a little prettier if she put powder on her cheeks and rose water on her lips, but she wasn\u2019t sure which was better, a maid or a concubine. So she just went to the director\u2019s room with a bare face.The director smiled unusually and handed her candy and chocolate. It felt good.\u2018If you ask me how I could laugh like a fool in that situation\u2026 Well, I would answer that children like me did not think about the future.\u2019If you didn\u2019t surrender yourself to the joy of the moment and live, you\u2019d go crazy. In other words, life was like a tightrope walk in the circus. The moment your thoughts soaked in, you lost your balance and fell. So, you should live lightly as if you have wings on your back.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When her friends found out that her birthday was soon, they teased her all the time.-He must be an eighty-year-old man. He\u2019ll be stinky and perverted!Rosen would always retort,-He\u2019ll be your husband!But frankly, she was scared.\u201cI think you probably heard. He will be your husband.\u201dShe could see the top of his head sticking out over the sofa, though couldn\u2019t tell if he was bald or not because he was wearing a fedora. She sighed, wondering if she could see his face if she tried a little more, but when she saw the director\u2019s scary expression, she gave up.Fortunately, he got up just before she passed out due to nervousness.\u201cRosen Walker?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hello.\u201d\u201cNo, it is Rosen Haworth now. It will be like that from now on.\u201dHe looked better than she expected. His hair was white, but he had no age spots, no humpback, and no strange smell. He looked like he was in his late twenties or early thirties. He was an average man.He was definitely not handsome, but he was not particularly ugly either. He was tall and not bald.\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s healthy?\u201d\u201cOh, of course. You\u2019ve seen her health report. One meter and sixty centimeters* tall, normal vision in both eyes. Even if she looks frail, she\u2019s good at her job.\u201d[*E/N: About 5 feet.]\u201cShe should be able to have children, but she\u2019s too skinny.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s up to Mr. Haworth, isn\u2019t it? Her reproductive organs are all normal. Dr Robinson guaranteed it.\u201dTheir words sounded like a foreign language, even though it was obviously in her mother tongue. She didn\u2019t understand anything, but she smiled softly like a doll. A child who smiled well, be it a maid or a concubine, would always be loved. She was clever enough to know that.\u201cMr. Haworth, all you have to do is sign the paperwork.\u201d\u201c\u2026Payment will be made in cash.\u201dHe grabbed her hand, scanning her from head to toe.If she was rejected by this person, she would likely end up going to an older bald man. She smiled widely enough to strain her facial muscles. She was on the verge of convulsing.\u2018He\u2019s not an old man with age spots.\u2019\u2018It has to be this guy.\u2019-Walpurg, let me meet someone who hugs me warmly. Someone who sincerely tells me that they love me. Anyone. If that\u2019s too much to ask\u2026 Even if it\u2019s a lie when they say they love me, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll just believe it.At that moment, she remembered the prayer she had made to Walpurg a long time ago. She had been told she would be punished if she asked Walpurg for useless things, but she shook her head to dispel those ominous premonitions.She was lonely, and she could even love a bald grandfather if he hugged her warmly\u2026But she didn\u2019t want a grandfather. She thought her wish had a reasonable premise. If Walpurg had a conscience, she would have filtered that possibility out.\u201cIf you clean up, you will look good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, he seemed to like her. He gently slid something on her ring finger.It was a band made of brass. It must have been prepared in advance, but somehow it fit her finger perfectly. With her eyes wide, she glanced between the director and the man alternately. The director smiled as she trembled with an expression of admiration.\u201cLook here, Rosen. I have a keen eye, don\u2019t I?She said nothing and nodded. She was surprised and happy at the same time. She liked the fact that he was attentive.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for a long time. Of all the girls here, I liked you the most.\u201dHe seemed kind enough to pay attention to the finger size of the girl he was going to take, and to get a ring that was just right for her. That kindness was enough for her, who was hungry for affection. It was daunting.He pulled out another present from his leather bag.\u201cAren\u2019t you happy, Rosen?\u201dInside the bag was a very large teddy bear. A large, clean doll with a red ribbon. At that moment, she thought that she might fall in love with him. It was clear that Walpurg had granted her wish.\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\u201cHome?\u201d\u201cYes, my house.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you. Let\u2019s go.\u201dHe took her hand.It was a big, strong hand. The director unlocked the large iron gate. She took her first step into the bright world outside.That was her first meeting with Hindley Haworth.\u2018That\u2019s how I became Rosen Haworth.\u2019***Hindley Haworth was a slum outcast. It was kind of funny, but it was true. Although he was an unlicensed quack, he ran a cheap clinic in the slums of Leoarton, earning less than a lucrative doctor.He owned a fairly large two-story building. He said he had inherited it from his father, who inherited it from his father before him. The first floor was a treatment center, and the second floor was a living quarters.The house was perfect for two people to live in. There was also a kitchen and an oven, a wardrobe with women\u2019s clothes, and a dressing table. The clothes were not new, but they fit her body perfectly and were in good condition. The chair in front of the dressing table was too small for Hindley to sit on. When she saw it and laughed, Hindley laughed and said it was made for her.\u201cRosen, thank you.\u201d\u201cNo, thank you, Hindley.\u201dIt was sincere.\u2018Thank you.\u2019She hadn\u2019t been hungry since coming to his house.She no longer shivered in the cold wind, because she fell asleep sweating. Their nightly relationship was painful and difficult, and although he had no regard for his young bride\u2026It was better to be sick than to be hungry or cold. Besides, when he touched her body, her empty feeling disappeared. She was hungry for another human\u2019s warmth.He was generally nice to her. He didn\u2019t beat her like the director, and he didn\u2019t drink or smoke too much. When she got good deals at the market and made delicious food, he stroked her hair as if she were cute.\u201cWell, the food is very good. You are not as good as I thought at cleaning or washing dishes, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more careful from now on.\u201dSo she decided not to complain. There were some difficulties, but it was bearable.She only wanted to do things that made Hindley feel good.But he was a nagger, sensitive and picky. Even the slightest mistake wasn\u2019t overlooked. Of course, he did not lift a finger at home. In a nutshell, he was lazy with a terrible temper. It was common to be berated all day if he found even a single speck of dust.The emotional ups and downs were also severe. He took care of her when he was in a good mood, but used her as an outlet for his anger on days when he didn\u2019t like the meal she cooked or when he was tired. Especially in the morning, he was particularly irritated.Their honeymoon phase, which was not as sweet as a fairy tale, but not terrible, did not last long.He began to reveal his true nature a few weeks after she came to the house.\u201cIs this all you have?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs this the only food? It\u2019s the same as yesterday morning.\u201dHe said she was good at cooking. Until now, she had never been bruised or beaten by Hindley. So, the first time Hindley frowned and dropped his spoon roughly, she got scared and explained again.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. That was baked, this is fried. And I tried different seasonings\u2026\u201dHe sighed, glared at her, and flicked her forehead with his index finger and thumb. He didn\u2019t use much force, but he still had the stiff fingers of an adult man. Every time she was flicked, her head rang.It couldn\u2019t be called beating. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even bruised. And it wasn\u2019t like she had never been hit before\u2026But in that moment, she was gripped by a sense of misery she had never felt before.\u201cI was wondering if you could do anything right.\u201dWithout eating the rest of his food, Hindley threw his spoon and stormed out.After he left, she stared blankly at the table for a while, thinking about what just happened.Tears dripped down her cheeks. It was strange.This was not the most painful thing she had been through. She would rather be angry than cry. Embarrassed, she quickly wiped her tears with her sleeve.She could cry later. Instead of contemplating her feelings, she decided to put away the plates and go shopping. Before Hindley returned, she had to make fresh food. This time, she didn\u2019t know if it would end with a finger flicking her forehead.She remembered the stick wielded by the director.Hindley was twice as tall as the director. If he wielded violence with those large hands\u2026She tried not to think too negatively, though she was scared.\u2018It\u2019s okay, Rosen. It\u2019s not too late yet. Hindley is just feeling bad today, and if I do well, I can make up for this mistake. Prepare the next meal well. It is true that I lacked sincerity today.\u2019Hindley returned that evening. He silently ate the food she had set on the table. He beckoned her quietly, who was trembling in the corner.\u201cYou, come here.\u201dShe walked up to him, crouching like a dog that had been kicked. He raised his hand. She reflexively covered her head with her hands and ducked her body.But the pain never came. He stroked her hair with his hand.\u201cThis is delicious. You should have made this sooner. Why were you lazy? Lately, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out if you\u2019ve relaxed too much or if housework is just too much for you. I have to say something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at this! You can do it. Don\u2019t lose your nerve just because we\u2019re married. I don\u2019t want to have a wife who\u2019s fat and serves me the same evening every day.\u201dHer waist was pinched. She took a breath. She was sure she had gained more weight than before. As she flinched, Hindley grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s all. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI still love you, Rosen. Don\u2019t make me hate you, got it?\u201dSince then, she spent her days worrying about Hindley\u2019s menu. She woke up early in the morning, and prepared breakfast so intensely that she sweat. Then she hurriedly prepared lunch, and while he was taking a nap, she went to the market to buy dinner.However, Hindley never went to work. From the time she first came home, the treatment center was closed. It meant that she had to make him three full meals a day. After two months, she was running out of ideas.With the budget he gave her, she couldn\u2019t possibly come up with new recipes. She started having nightmares every night. She dreamt that he would get angry, she would be beaten mercilessly, and eventually, she was sent back to the orphanage.In the end, she couldn\u2019t help but carefully ask Hindley over breakfast one day.\u201cWhen will the treatment center reopen?\u201d\u201cSoon.\u201dHe frowned as he drank the potato soup.As she asked, she became more curious as to why the treatment center was closed.She had always been curious about it. If she had any questions, she would ask them. The director and nannies ignored most of her questions, but there were times when they were able to answer.\u201cWhy did you close it?\u201d\u201c\u2026I had some business to attend to.\u201dHis expression hardened. She thought that Hindley\u2019s expression hardened because it was serious. She was worried and asked for more details.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201dJust as she was about to inquire further, Hindley threw his spoon away. He closed his eyes tightly and flexed his body. The spoon hit her head, then collided with the plate and fell to the floor. She forgot her pain and picked it up with her bare hands.She was afraid he would get more angry if the floor got dirty.\u201cWhy are you talking so much?\u201d\u201cI was worried\u2026\u201d\u201cI warned you, Rosen. I hate noisy children.\u201d\u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIf it were now, she would have said that she wasn\u2019t a child, but his wife, and he likely would have hit her in the head with a frying pan and told her to shut her mouth\u2026 but back then she was young and naive.She was isolated. He didn\u2019t even let her talk to their neighbors. All she had was Hindley.He was the sweetest person she had ever met in her life.And at the same time, he turned her whole life upside down.She was terrified of being hated by him.Without voicing her opinion, she turned Hindley\u2019s meals into supreme feasts. Fearing that she would gain weight, she carried a small loaf of bread in her pocket, and only ate a pea-sized piece when she was unbearably dizzy.It was peace on the edge of a knife, but peace nonetheless. When she shut her mouth and obeyed him, he didn\u2019t get very angry. Life was good.***It was their third month of marriage when something unbearable happened.They were both at home when the doorbell rang.\u201cWho is it?\u201dBefore Hindley, who was taking a nap, woke up and became angry, she hurriedly ran out of the kitchen and went to the front door.\u201cWho is it?\u201dShe was puzzled.To the best of her knowledge, he had no friends. He said he was too lazy to get along with people. He was so lazy that it was surprising he ran a treatment center.That\u2019s why she was forced to live like this.Except for the postman, no guests came to the house. Besides, the postman had already stopped by that morning and handed over a lot of mail addressed to Hindley.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A woman strode inside. She was about ten years older than Rosen, and she looked as if she had traveled a great distance.Rosen blinked in bewilderment. But it seemed she wasn\u2019t the only one who was surprised. The woman asked, with a face as bewildered as hers.\u201c\u2026This is Hindley Haworth\u2019s house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cRosen Haworth.\u201dShe answered confidently. She was slowly getting used to the new name. At that, the woman tilted her head.\u201cAh, are you Hindley\u2019s relative? I never heard of him having a younger sister\u2026\u201d\u201cI am his wife.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe woman\u2019s face turned blue. She froze like a statue, gaping like a goldfish. She seemed to have lost her voice. Rosen continued explaining.\u201cHindley Haworth is my husband. We got married three months ago.\u201d\u201cMarried?\u201d\u201cYes, I am married to him.\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes turned to the clothes Rosen was wearing. It was the dress that Hindley gave her on the first day. The woman took a breath, grabbed Rosen by the collar, and threw her into the shoe rack beside the front door.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe cheap fabric was torn. Slaps landed alternately on both cheeks. Rosen was beaten with no time to counterattack. Without holding back, the woman sat on her and continued to hit her in the face.\u201cYou must be crazy. Crazy!\u201dShe also muttered words that didn\u2019t make sense.The situation was so unrealistic, Rosen couldn\u2019t even get angry. No matter how hard she thought, she couldn\u2019t figure out why she was being beaten.\u2018What\u2019s going on? Is she crazy? Why the hell is she doing this?\u2019Rosen stared blankly at the woman sitting on her.The woman\u2019s green eyes gleamed strangely. It was a different, but beautiful color. It was the first time she had ever seen such eyes in her life.She belatedly tried to raise her arm to defend her face, but her arm had no strength.At some point, the beating stopped. She grimaced and barely opened her eyes. Hindley, who had noticed the commotion, came down to the foyer. The woman on top of her struggled as Hindley pulled her by her hair.\u201cB*tch, what are you doing?\u201dHindley growled. The woman\u2019s face contorted.The woman took turns glaring at Rosen at Hindley with all her might. She shouted in a hoarse voice.\u201cHindley! How could you do this?!\u201dAs soon as those words fell from the woman\u2019s mouth, a pair of shoes floated into the air. Small objects around them flew through the air. They began to pelt Hindley and Rosen in flocks, like birds.It wasn\u2019t painful enough to kill, but it was enough to bruise. Unlike Hindley, who spat out swear words and pulled Emily\u2019s hair, Rosen forgot her pain and watched the fascinating scenery as if possessed.\u201cIt\u2019s magic\u2026\u201dGleaming green eyes.Flying objects.Emily Haworth was a witch.***Hindley threw Emily to the floor. He kicked Emily with his shoes, and then fastened a necklace around her thin neck like a collar. The moment the necklace was latched, the items fell to the floor helplessly.Emily spat out a cough.Rosen stiffened before the ruthless violence. It was like he was handling an animal.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, Rosen. She is very dangerous. You saw it, didn\u2019t you? Magic.\u201dNo, she wouldn\u2019t even treat a dog like that. And the thing in front of her was a human. Hindley lifted up Emily, who had lost her magic, and showed her to Rosen as if she were a dog.\u201cThis b*tch is a witch. I couldn\u2019t handle her strength, so I used this. If I take it off, we will die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not misunderstand. I\u2019m protecting you.\u201dHindley came over and caressed her red cheeks. He made excuses with a desperate face.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this, but\u2026 there is nothing I can do.\u201dRosen had a hard time accepting everything. She met a witch for the first time in her life, and saw her husband beat her like a dog. Only one word thought formed in her head and spilt out of her mouth.\u201c\u2026Is that woman your first wife?\u201d\u201cYou thought you were my first wife?\u201dHindley laughed as if he had heard a funny joke.Rosen felt something inside her shatter. She shouldn\u2019t have expected it. But the stupid Rosen Walker misunderstood once more. Some of the people who came to pick up girls from the orphanage were fine. And she, a girl from the orphanage, hoped that she could be someone\u2019s first.At her ridicule, all her doubts and emotions became insignificant.\u201cNo.\u201dHindley came up to her and held her face.\u201cRosen, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re a good woman, and you\u2019re not dangerous. I don\u2019t hit a good woman.\u201d\u201cYes, Hindley.\u201dRosen kept her eyes fixed on Hindley, and occasionally glanced at the woman who had passed out. Her lips moved on their own.\u201cI\u2019m not in danger.\u201dHindley smiled softly as if satisfied with her answer, and kissed her cheek tenderly.\u201cDon\u2019t be sad. Nothing will change. You\u2019re the only one I love.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t listen, I\u2019ll have to send you back to the orphanage, but nothing will change if you keep quiet. Because you\u2019re younger and nicer than her. Isn\u2019t your life better now than before?\u201dRosen liked him. He complimented her from time to time, stroked her hair, and held her in his arms at night. It was hard work, but life was definitely more bearable than before.It wasn\u2019t cold here.She didn\u2019t want to get kicked out of this place.And it wasn\u2019t her who got hit.Even though she was terrified for thinking like that, she erased all the questions that popped into her head.\u2018Is there any guarantee that a man who hits his first wife won\u2019t hit his second wife?\u2019\u2018Why does he have such a dangerous witch at home? And if she really was that dangerous, she could\u2019ve killed me anytime.\u2019Thinking back, her life got easier when she didn\u2019t think, when she kept her mouth shut.People had become kinder, and suffering eluded her.So she didn\u2019t say anything.Because Hindley liked quiet women\u2026***Emily came to her senses and burst into tears.\u201cExplain!\u201d\u201cWhat is there to explain?\u201d\u201cHow could you do this?\u201dThey moved away from Rosen and started a heated argument in the living room. She blankly watched their quarrel. It was more obvious than a cliche radio drama, so she quickly grasped the situation.Emily Haworth was Hindley\u2019s first wife. They did not sign a certificate in the government office, but it was a de facto* marriage. They had been neighbors for a long time, and Emily, who had nowhere to go after her parents died, was taken in by Hindley\u2019s father. They grew up together, and naturally developed a romantic relationship after they became adults.[T/N: A de facto marriage is a term used for couples who live together without being legally married.]It was questionable whether a romantic relationship could be established with one side wearing a restraint and the other holding the reins\u2026\u201cYou haven\u2019t had a baby for over ten years, so should I just stay still and do nothing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of trying.\u201d\u201cYou b*tch, they were all dead and female. So what are you saying?\u201dHindley needed a son. But Emily never gave birth to a living baby, let alone a boy. So, Rosen came into this house because he needed an heir.\u201cWhy should she live with us?\u201dEmily\u2019s scream split the air. Hindley\u2019s mouth distorted again.\u201cDon\u2019t shout.\u201d\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m screaming now?\u201d\u201cI warned you.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t do anything. Anyway, the treatment center is-\u201dHindley, who was trying to keep his composure, exploded, and his hand went up. Knowing that it wasn\u2019t directed at her, Rosen screwed her eyes shut. When she opened her eyes, Emily was holding her bare, swollen cheeks, with tears streaming down her face, and Hindley was laughing.Green eyes were glaring right at Rosen.She found out that day. The fact that inner feelings could be revealed through eyes.Broken pride, a broken heart, resentment\u2026She couldn\u2019t turn away from those eyes.\u201cB*tch, do you have anywhere else to go?\u201dHindley couldn\u2019t control his anger and screamed. Emily\u2019s words must have undermined his humble pride.Seeing that his momentum was immediately dampened by a loud noise, it seemed that he was not a harsh character. He was a soft-hearted man. Then this woman\u2019s presence cut off his last patience.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what the outside world is like, do you?\u201dEmily dropped her head without saying anything.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRumors are circulating that Talas is invading us. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll definitely lose. You know how unmarried women in defeated countries are treated, don\u2019t you?\u201dAs Hindley spoke, he looked at Rosen as well as Emily. Rosen immediately knew that those words were also a warning to her.Another war.-This war will be different.She remembered the tense atmosphere in the market and the unfamiliar words exchanged between merchants. In a month, market sales had reduced by a quarter.Yes, it was definitely a \u2018war\u2019. At that time, she only knew its figurative meaning. Merchants made a fuss about the sale of vegetables, saying that it was a \u2018war\u2019.If the word \u2018war\u2019 came into the ears of an orphan bride from another country, it was unlikely to be a rumor.\u201cThere are scouts in the sky.\u201dAnd their judgment was right. The history of the Empire was full of countless wars; there were big wars decades ago, and now, small battles were taking place on the border every few days. The children of this country grew up hearing war stories instead of fairy tales\u2026This war would certainly be different.Because times had changed.Magic was outlawed and science took off. They were able to easily float heavy metal in the sky without the help of magic. In other words\u2026The enemy could drop bombs from the sky.\u201cYou have nowhere to go, even if there wasn\u2019t a war. Think about how many places in this Empire accept witches.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even handle your strength, so you live by relying on my restraints.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Witch, The Groom and The Orphan (4)***The Witch, The Groom and The Orphan (4)***-I would like to clear up the recent rumors that have been circulating among the people. Small-scale local wars are taking place along the border, but the stories of Talas\u2019 invasion are completely exaggerated. The government wants you to focus on your own livelihood.Broadcasts denying the war played on the radio every day.\u201cDogs.\u201dShe turned off the radio before Hindley got up.The Empire was atrocious, but the village and Hindley\u2019s house were peaceful. People continued their daily lives with minimal anxiety. When she woke up in the morning, the sky was still blue. When the drowsy afternoon sunlight poured through the window, the sound of dogs praising the government filtered through the radio waves.However, airships often appeared in the sky. The trails they left behind remained until the sun went down, so they were not completely fooled by the lies of the government.She hung dark curtains on the windows and stocked food in the basement. And, as always, she prepared Hindley\u2019s meals.As Hindley said, nothing had changed.\u201cHey, you. Don\u2019t eat that.\u201dIt was just that there was someone who bothered her daily.\u201cDid you not hear me? Don\u2019t eat it!\u201dAt dawn, the witch crept up like a shadow and stole the boiled potatoes she was holding. Rosen glared at the witch who had taken her food. Emily, with her arms folded, raised her eyebrows cruelly like a step-sister in a fairy tale.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve cooked. I\u2019m giving it to Hindley. Why are you touching it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you keep stealing like a rat at dawn? Sit down at the table and eat on time. You\u2019re messy.\u201dHindley accused her of being overweight.When she sat down at the table and dug into her food, he often ridiculed her and made her lose her appetite. So the only way she could fill her stomach comfortably was to secretly eat the food Hindley had left behind. He was a hungry man, so all he left on the table were bones without any flesh or bread crumbs.Already sensitive to hunger, she exploded.\u201cYou don\u2019t know because you\u2019re a pig! I\u2019m fat!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHindley won\u2019t let me eat because I\u2019m getting fat! What do you want me to do? Do you want me to starve?\u201dRosen hated Emily Haworth. It was because the woman hit her as soon as they met, and her sudden appearance disrupted her life. Suddenly, she became the second wife.What she liked the most about her marriage to Hindley was the fact that he had no other wives. But that perk disappeared when Emily appeared.Of course, the root of all evil was Hindley Haworth, and Emily and Rosen were victims. But Rosen was too young, stupid, and cowardly at the time to accept that fact. Above all, she loved Hindley as much as she feared him.Like a dog that wagged its tail at its owner while being kicked. Even if the owner was worse than trash, that owner was the dog\u2019s whole world.So, she treated Emily as if she was an intruder. It was easier to hate Emily than to argue with Hindley.How stupid was she?Emily went on a trip to get herbs, and he brought a second wife into his house. The second wife brazenly stole the clothes that she used to wear.As they were uncomfortable with each other, Emily treated her as invisible, so she tried to be like that too. However, it was not easy to avoid each other in this small house.\u201cIs it a big deal for me to eat a potato?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry, what should I do?\u201dHer accumulated sorrow exploded. Rosen sat down and cried like a child. She couldn\u2019t make a sound because she was afraid of Hindley waking up, so tears silently poured down her face. Emily couldn\u2019t even get angry at the insults she had spat out, and just stared at Rosen with an absurd expression.That night, Rosen spoke ill of Emily to Hindley in bed. She was so frustrated that she wanted to do so even if she would be scolded. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly what she complained about. It was likely something that she made up. And her reason for choosing Hindley as a conversation partner was simple.She was isolated, and the only person she could talk to was Hindley.Surprisingly, he wasn\u2019t angry about her being noisy. Rather, he seemed happy.\u201cLet\u2019s get along well. Don\u2019t fight too much with Emily.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it, but she\u2019s weak-minded and gentle. If you don\u2019t show off and act prideful, she won\u2019t get mad at you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI hate the noise in the house, but it\u2019s pretty cute that you two are arguing over me.\u201dHe tapped her chest as his greasy face came closer.At that moment, her boiling anger cooled down. Contrary to what Hindley had hoped for, she became sober, calm, and very rational.Cute jealousy\u2026Those words were so disgusting.She didn\u2019t know exactly how she felt, but she knew it wasn\u2019t jealousy. She suddenly felt like a human again. She thought, forgetting her loyalty to Hindley and her hostility towards Emily.Jealousy was what you felt when you were afraid of losing your partner to a more suitable candidate.She imagined Hindley and Emily kissing.Was she angry?She wasn\u2019t.What if Hindley said something sweet to Emily (even though he wouldn\u2019t)?She didn\u2019t care. She decided to think a little bit more extreme. What if Emily was in bed with Hindley now?She would feel grateful to Emily for doing the hard and painful work, and she would feel sorry for her. Since at some point, sleeping with Hindley gave Rosen more pain than warmth.She realized.\u2018I\u2019m not jealous, I\u2019m just angry.\u2019Losing Hindley wasn\u2019t scary at all.She was just afraid of losing the home she had barely found.She didn\u2019t love Hindley. She loved the shelter that kept her safe from the wind and rain and the food in the cupboard. But Hindley was already taking the food from her.The sight of him beating Emily like an animal passed before her eyes. The fear she had forgotten, and the instinctive disgust she had been trying to bury in her heart after coming to this house came back to life.She had always thought he was kind. But a kind man never beat his wife, and never starved his wife because she was overweight. That was a fact that everyone knew.She felt the direction of her anger gradually change. The sword that was aimed at Emily suddenly turned towards Hindley and herself. To Hindley, who brainwashed her to this point, and to herself, who was just being stupid.\u2018Why did you choose me?\u2019\u2018Why do you\u2026\u2019\u2018Why do you leave me alone?\u2019Hindley, as usual, fell asleep after satisfying only himself. Rosen stayed up all night because of Hindley, who snored next to her.The next morning, three boiled eggs lay on the table. At lunchtime, she swept the yard and found a basket of sandwiches on the porch. Neither was made by her. It didn\u2019t look like it was made for Hindley either, because Hindley hated eggs. Seeing Emily didn\u2019t say anything when she ate it all, it was definitely for her.Rosen continued her train of thought from the previous evening, chewing the hard yolk in the sandwich.Suddenly, a fundamental question popped into her head.\u2018Why should we fight over someone like Hindley?\u2019***Only after Emily appeared did the doors to the treatment center open. Patients came rushing in like a tidal wave, as if they had been waiting. Cash piled up in the empty cupboard, and Hindley took it and spent it like water.In a nutshell, saying that Hindley didn\u2019t like meeting people was a blatant lie. He just couldn\u2019t go out because he didn\u2019t have money. He was a horse racer and frequented gambling venues.To be honest, Rosen was glad he left the house, because she didn\u2019t have to cook three meals a day. In a life where there was no time to catch her breath, she was able to finally breathe.So she followed Emily around and annoyed her. Unlike her, who had nothing to do after completing her chores, Emily was always busy. She cataloged herbs, cared for patients, and kept records of expenses and income.Every morning Rosen found snacks hidden in the corner of the cupboard and ate them in front of Emily. The crunch of the apple wasn\u2019t loud, but it was enough to annoy Emily.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t I look? You don\u2019t own this place.\u201d\u201cThis is my house.\u201d\u201cThis is Hindley\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cThe documents are in Hindley\u2019s name, but still, this is my home.\u201dRosen did not object to that. Even though she didn\u2019t know anything about their situation, it was Emily who was actually running the treatment center.Rosen couldn\u2019t understand why Hindley needed a son.What if he had a son who was just like him?Emily rolled up the duvet from a patient\u2019s cot and hung it outside in the sun. The wind was cool but refreshing, and the freshly washed laundry felt warm. She was able to feel a little happiness for a short time.She asked Emily as she sat on the porch and stretched her legs.\u201cWhy did you make sandwiches?\u201d\u201cThere were leftovers.\u201d\u201cYou could\u2019ve thrown it away. Why are you making sandwiches for nothing?\u201dIn a situation where it was enough to say thank you, Rosen played hard to get. Pushing Emily to her limits, who treated Rosen as invisible, was vital for keeping Rosen sane. Emily, who had suppressed her irritation with superhuman patience, couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and glared at her.\u201cWho taught you how to speak? Did your parents teach you that?\u201d\u201cI have no parents.\u201dRosen took another bite of the apple and replied calmly. She wasn\u2019t sensitive enough to be hurt by those words. It was a familiar taunt, too. But when she looked up, Emily\u2019s face was red.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI was mean, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for everything. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201dRosen snorted. Ignoring it, she pulled the hem of Emily\u2019s skirt like a child.\u201cBut really, why did you do it? Why are you taking care of me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Be quiet.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you hate me?\u201d\u201cOf course I hate you! Why would I make food every morning? It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny. Ugh!\u201dEmily eventually pushed Rosen away. Hindley was right. It was difficult to make Emily angry. Seeing that Hindley had accomplished such a difficult task, he was a real jerk.Rosen laughed out loud.\u201cWhat\u2019s funny? Why are you laughing?\u201dEmily frowned and poked her in the stomach. Rosen held her breath in surprise. She was fatter than she was in the orphanage, but compared to Emily, she was a twig.\u201cLook at this. I can\u2019t fight a skinny kid. If you want to argue, do it after you become strong.\u201d\u201cYou beat me first, didn\u2019t you?\u201cBecause there was nothing else I could do. Wouldn\u2019t you have done the same?\u201dEmily clicked her tongue.\u201c\u2026I wouldn\u2019t let Hindley eat this. That\u2019s why I give it to you. I\u2019m telling you to eat properly. When you become strong, you can make decisions that you couldn\u2019t before.\u201dRosen laughed again. Emily let out a sigh and turned away. Rosen followed Emily as she did the laundry, but was ignored. Rosen dropped a folded quilt on the lawn and overturned the scented candle that Emily had lit.Emily exploded.\u201cRosen! Hang the laundry if you have nothing to do.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do what you tell me to do?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay for the food if you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHindley eats even if he doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201dGrumbling, Rosen quickly picked up the laundry. It was nice to do something together, because she didn\u2019t get to hang out with anyone except Hindley.\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201dThe pile of laundry disappeared much faster when they did it together. They hung the laundry without saying a word for a while. The colorful fabrics fluttered in the wind. It was Rosen who broke the silence.\u201cBut can\u2019t you do this with magic? Laundry, washing dishes, all that trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEmily bit her lip. The restraint still hung around her neck. At first glance, it looked like an ordinary necklace, but it was much smaller and fit tightly around her neck. In the center was a brown gem, which turned green when it suppressed Emily\u2019s powers.Rosen pouted, interpreting the silence from Emily as affirmative. The witches in old tales could do anything. Fly in the sky, dance with the devil, or sweep away anything that bothered them.-Walpurg, let me meet someone who hugs me warmly.The wish she had made to Walpurg as a child was fulfilled. However, it was fulfilled in a twisted way. After all, she met Hindley Haworth.Had witches been reduced to a trivial existence in this day and age?\u201cIt\u2019s no good to be a witch. I have to wear a troublesome necklace and\u2026\u201dRosen picked up the laundry again, ignoring her words. It was then that a furious reply came back.\u201cI can do that.\u201dRosen was dazed.\u201cCan you show me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cIs it hard? If you use magic, you pass out because of the restraint, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThis kind of magic is fine, but\u2026 Why do you want to see such a thing?\u201dEmily asked with a look of wonder.Rosen wasn\u2019t crazy. It would be weirder if she didn\u2019t want to see magic, right?\u201cAre you kidding me? It\u2019s magic! Magic! I\u2019ve never seen anything like that in my life! When you were beating me, I was so distracted by your magic that I forgot my pain.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s good about seeing a witch\u2019s magic?\u201d\u201cI just want to see it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs Rosen spoke, her eyes lit up. Emily felt as though she couldn\u2019t disappoint her expectations. Hesitatingly, Emily snapped her fingers.When Rosen blinked, what she was faced with was, she swore, the most amazing thing she had ever seen.The duvet they were holding flew into the air, and the bucket containing the soapy water washed it by itself. Rainbow colored soap bubbles soared into the sky, like flags swaying in the wind.\u201cOh, I did it. It\u2019s been so long.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dWhen Emily asked with a shy smile, Rosen quickly responded.\u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201dRosen was speechless and stared at the blue sky for a long time. That moment made her forget everything. Hindley, being locked up in the house, and the loneliness that sometimes made her cry at dawn.\u201cI think I can have wonderful dreams tonight.\u201d***That exhilarating feeling was the last happiness she felt for a while. That night, she woke up to the sound of a siren piercing her eardrums. But she wasn\u2019t even annoyed. The siren, which made her head ring, wasn\u2019t just an annoying noise.A sound that shook the earth, stopped one\u2019s heart, and froze their body with fear.With the siren in the background, military speakers in the sky began to blast a man\u2019s voice.[Fellow citizens of Leoarton, I would like to inform you of what\u2019s happening in the Empire. I\u2019m Ian Kerner, commander of the Leoarton Air Squadron. We\u2019re issuing an air strike warning throughout the city. Talas\u2019 fleet is flying toward Leoarton. Please close your doors, pack your valuables, and go down to your basements. Our squadron will do its best to keep you safe. Please stay calm. This is a real alert.]It was an airstrike alert.A prelude to the beginning of a long war.The young man\u2019s voice crackled over the speakers.She grabbed the radio with trembling hands.She changed the frequency. The same broadcast was playing on all channels.[I repeat, this is a real alert.]***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rosen muttered that she would never fall asleep first, but, as expected, he was the victor.Rosen asked obvious questions during gaps in her story.-Are you listening? You\u2019re not listening, are you?-I\u2019m listening. I\u2019m not trying to, though.-Aren\u2019t you tired of it? Can\u2019t you fall asleep?-Don\u2019t be smart. You don\u2019t know where the key is anyway.Ian replied in an uninterested voice. On the other hand, Rosen looked tired. Her eyes fluttered shut as she muttered.-I was just checking to see if my story was interesting. I didn\u2019t want to share, but it\u2019s a shame if it\u2019s not even good.-\u2026Your story is too dynamic to fall asleep.\u2013 Is it good?-That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good.Ian Kerner was not a person who took pleasure in seeing a child\u2019s life destroyed by a single man.Rosen didn\u2019t last long. She repeated the same part in her story, then curled up and hugged the blanket, still holding his hand. As Rosen was about to fall asleep, he tried to pull his hand away, but each time she noticed and grabbed it again. Ian was eventually held captive almost all night.-I\u2019m just closing my eyes. I\u2019m not sleeping.-I see.-I\u2019m not really sleeping.-Yeah, you\u2019re not sleeping.Ian soothed Rosen, who was half asleep. He was only freed after she said what she wanted to say.-I wanted to hear you say \u2018I believe you\u2019.It was a common and obvious appeal from a prisoner. There was a saying that \u2018no one is guilty in prison\u2019. Where was there a prisoner who admitted to their guilt, and where was there a prisoner without a story? Ian was not foolish enough to believe the confessions of a prisoner.He didn\u2019t have to listen to it anymore. Rosen was trying to convince him that she was not a criminal, and that the crime was committed by another. But whatever she said, it was too late. Even Rosen herself acknowledged it. Her trial was over, and nothing would change.Nothing changed the fact that Rosen Haworth killed her husband. All evidence pointed to her. Murder was murder, even if there was a reason. Imperial law was not swayed by emotional appeals.He tried to get Rosen\u2019s story out of his head. Didn\u2019t he understand the points emphasized in red on her document?[Good at deception, placation, and persuasion.Is intelligent and has excellent speaking skills.Be careful while interviewing. High possibility of getting caught up or persuaded by conversation.]He was sure she had tricked the Al Capez guards in this way. It was an evaluation that someone who had been severely fooled by Rosen had written, one line after another. He fully agreed with the assessment, and when dealing with Rosen, he always kept those sentences in his head.However, not all accidents could be avoided by being careful. He was arrogant for thinking that he would be all right. All of a sudden he interjected.-Why didn\u2019t you say this in court?-Are you stupid? I should\u2019ve given the judge one more reason why I killed Hindley?If what Rosen said was true\u2026 he shouldn\u2019t have said what he did.-Not everyone lives like you. Some people pursue something more sublime than their own gain. But the world isn\u2019t maintained by them.He should have thought twice before speaking. Not everyone had the opportunity to lead a life in pursuit of the sublime. There were many people in the world who found it difficult to take care of what was in front of them.Ian had been looking down at people from the sky for too long. To the point that he forgot such a simple fact.Ian thought of Rosen, who had a crush on him.-I liked you too. Like everyone else, you were a hero to me.A hero.He didn\u2019t deserve such praise from a survivor of Leoarton.\u2018But why are you\u2026\u2019Rosen Haworth was curled up on his bed. Her hair was scattered all over the mattress like watercolors. Ian resisted the urge to touch Rosen\u2019s hair, rose from his chair and sat down on the bed.\u2018Why do you sleep like you\u2019re tied up even when your chains are gone? Isn\u2019t it worthwhile to enjoy this?\u2019Rosen\u2019s sleeping face was calm. Ian put his finger under Rosen\u2019s nose without realizing it. A thin breath fell on his fingertips. She was alive. But she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold out for long when she got to the island.Even prisoners were allowed a last will. It was for that reason that Ian released Rosen\u2019s handcuffs. Because Rosen Haworth would die on the island of Monte, and giving her the generosity to release her handcuffs for a moment wouldn\u2019t change anything.He didn\u2019t know what else to do if her requests were not met. Maybe she really would bite her tongue. That didn\u2019t mean she would die the way she wanted to, but she was not a normal person. If that didn\u2019t work, she\u2019d resort to banging her head against the wall. Ian didn\u2019t want to watch it happen.He had to keep Rosen alive until he brought her to the island. Because that was his job.However, the moment he found himself obsessed with the breath that touched his fingertips, he was engulfed in doubt.Was that really the only reason?Was it a rational decision to release Rosen\u2019s handcuffs?At some point, maybe even from the beginning, he couldn\u2019t ignore Rosen. That fact scared him. Ian was so impatient in front of the prisoner that he was easily angered. He could not make fair judgments.He thought it was dangerous.As he was about to withdraw, Rosen grabbed his hand. It wasn\u2019t the kind of gesture he expected. She wasn\u2019t squeamish or sneaky. It was more like a call for help than a temptation.\u2013Stories usually depend on the person telling it, and at least one person in this vast Empire should listen to me.In his nightmares, there were always hands. People whose faces he couldn\u2019t see were buried in the rubble. Hundreds of thousands of hands emerged from the black ashes and grabbed his legs. He couldn\u2019t shake them off, and they were sucked into the darkness together.He felt like he was caught in a trap. He knew it clearly. It was something he decided on his own.\u201c\u2026No matter what I heard, I shouldn\u2019t have taken the job of transporting you.\u201dIn the quiet room, Ian spoke to himself.\u201cIf there is anyone in this Empire who wants to set you free the most\u2026 I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s me.\u201dOnly after exhaling did Ian realize that he was sincere.He reached out and touched Rosen, even though it was not appropriate to sweep the cheeks of a sleeping person without permission. Ian moved as if possessed, and rolled up her worn-out sleeves to check her skinny arms.Old scars of abuse were exposed. Cuts, burns, abrasions. He couldn\u2019t bear to look any more and corrected Rosen\u2019s outfit.One thing must be true; her marriage was an unhappy one.With such a body, she rebelled with an evil spirit. She forcibly swallowed food that was poisonous to her, knowing she was going to die. Ian had to suppress the emotions that were building up inside him. He didn\u2019t know if it was frustration or anger.It was understandable that it was a natural act. She was Rosen Haworth, after all.So these were just his personal feelings. Anger, interest, and compassion.\u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d\u2018You have been my comfort for quite some time.\u2019\u2018You said you liked me\u2026 I bet I\u2019d give my heart to you as much as you have to me. Maybe even more.\u2019\u201cMaybe I like you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Rosen would break if pushed and step back if approached. He was a jailer and Rosen Haworth was his prisoner.Obviously, he shouldn\u2019t value her\u2026 but he didn\u2019t want to ruin her. And Rosen would soon be ruined if he didn\u2019t value her.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have listened to you. From the moment I met you\u2026 I knew it was going to be like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI wish your lies could deceive me.\u201dHe knew too much about the murder to be deceived. Excluding all possibilities, what remained was the truth. No matter how heartbreaking and inconvenient it may be, there was only one truth.Ian turned off the gas lamp. He opened the desk drawer and pulled out a bundle of incense. The doctor said that his dose should not be increased anymore, but what he used had long since exceeded the prescribed amount. He had to sleep in order to live, at least an hour a day.It was time to tie Rosen to the bedpost. He picked up the handcuffs\u2026However, his hands did not move willingly.He hesitated for a while. Rosen was deeply asleep. The handcuffs rustling did not seem to wake her up.It was the first time in his life that he had hesitated for so long in the face of something he had to do, even when he was making the most terrible decision of his life. He was always quick to judge and never mixed emotions with work.-Protect Malona.He chose Malona, knowing that the city he was born in would be destroyed.But now he was faced with a trivial and natural thing.Ian eventually put one handcuff on Rosen\u2019s wrist and the other on his wrist instead of the bedpost.This method was the most certain. Rosen was a prisoner crazy enough to cut off her wrist if necessary, but this way he would find out before it was too late.As the cold chain connected him and the prisoner, a strange satisfaction filled his chest.\u2018Actually, I don\u2019t know what I want to do with you. Why in the world did I release your chains?\u2019\u2018Now that I\u2019ve heard your story, if you run away\u2026\u2019\u2018Can I shoot you?\u2019Ian leaned against the bed. Having something to be tied to gave him a strange sense of security. By his side was his sin, his atonement, and his comfort.He closed his eyes like a pilot who had finally found a place to land after hovering for a long time.It was a comfortable restraint.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShaken (2)***Shaken (2)***\u201cSir!\u201dSomeone shook him hard. Ian Kerner opened his eyes in surprise. Instinctively, he checked the gun at his waist, picked up the boots he had placed on the bedside, and stretched his arms.\u201cCalm down, why are you grabbing for your gun when the war has already ended?\u201d\u2018Oh.\u2019Ian sighed and frowned at the bright sunlight. He felt strange. His body and mind were strangely refreshed. Soon he realized that the headache that had been bothering him for days had gone away.\u2018I didn\u2019t have any nightmares.\u2019\u201cSir Kerner!\u201dHenry\u2019s bewildered face caught his eye. Ian was half-asleep and tried to grasp the situation. It was the first time in years that he had not watched the sun rise. He went to bed late and got up early, both on the battlefield and in the military academy.\u201cWhat time is it, Henry?\u201d\u201cIs that the problem now? Sir, look at yourself!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dHe had a long sleep. Ian ignored Henry and tried to tidy up his messy hair, but he became stiff. His hand was stuck in something. He had a handcuff on his wrist. Henry freaked out even more when he saw it.\u201cOh, my God, have you gone mad? What did you do last night? No way\u2026\u201dIt was only then that Ian came to his senses and looked around. There was something warm in his arms. He was in bed, in chains, and right next to him,\u00a0 Rosen Haworth was sleeping. She was sleeping so soundly that she wouldn\u2019t even know if someone picked her up and threw her into the sea.\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019His tired body betrayed his head. He was so tired that he habitually crawled into bed.Ian rubbed his forehead. As soon as Henry entered the cabin, his headache came back to him.\u201cPlease tell me that Rosen Haworth came into the Sir\u2019s bed on her own.\u201d\u201c\u2026No, but I did.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake. And don\u2019t scream, she\u2019ll wake up. She just fell asleep. At last, she became quiet.\u201d\u201cDo I look like I won\u2019t scream? It doesn\u2019t matter if she wakes up or not! Is that important now? What is this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not what I think, is it? Please say it isn\u2019t!\u201dHenry appealed to him, on the verge of tears. Knowing what kind of misunderstanding he had caused, Ian firmly shook his head.\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\u201cYou expect me to believe that? Hurry up and give me an explanation that I can understand!\u201dHenry glared at Rosen, who was still clinging to him. Ian was speechless for a moment. It felt strange to be scolded the same way he had scolded Henry. Unlike usual, his brain didn\u2019t work well. He would not have been able to give Henry an understandable explanation, even with ten mouths.Ian finally threw back the duvet after much thought. Henry\u2019s eyes softened a little when he saw that Ian was still in the uniform he had worn last night. However, Henry also checked Rosen\u2019s clothes, as if that wasn\u2019t enough.Ian felt a surge of irritation for no reason. He carefully separated himself from Rosen and pulled himself out of the bed to stop Henry.\u201cWe are dressed, so go away. I told you. You can\u2019t come within a 1-meter radius of Rosen. Was the bathroom not enough?\u201dHenry scratched the back of his neck, embarrassed.\u201cWow, I\u2019m being kicked out then. Though I\u2019m not in a position to listen to my nagging superior who slept in the same bed as a prisoner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you really the Sir Kerner I know? Do you like her?\u201d\u201cWha-\u201c\u201cWhy the hell isn\u2019t she tied to the bedpost and why is Sir Kerner with her? No, you\u2019ve been strange ever since you needlessly interviewed her every day. What the hell-\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called monitoring.\u201dIan couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and cut Henry off. He removed the handcuffs that tied him to Rosen, took a cigarette out of his front pocket, and lit it. Henry had already decided not to believe anything Ian said, so why did it matter what he thought? Henry looked at him suspiciously and picked up the handcuffs.Ian gestured roughly.\u201cPut it down.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to let her loose, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cCrazy\u2026\u201dIan added before Henry had another seizure.\u201cShe tried to kill herself. We must keep Rosen Haworth alive until we get to the island.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You need to tie her up.\u201dIan shook his head. Rosen\u2019s blood was still fresh in his memory. It was likely the same for Henry.\u201cI told her not to commit suicide. I promised to release her while under surveillance. And Rosen promised to stay calm.\u201d\u201cAnd you believe that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather let it go. Otherwise, she will try to commit suicide again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs you have seen, she has an extreme personality. The more you suppress her, the more aggressive she becomes. When I\u2019m with her, I have to be a little more comfortable.\u201d\u201cWhy would she try to commit suicide when you\u2019re watching her? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was a problem to treat her to dinner yesterday. But look what happened!\u201dIan tapped his cigarette over the ashtray and pointed at Rosen, who was sleeping as if she were dead. Henry would usually retort, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if she dies or not since she\u2019s going to Monte\u2019. However, he just bowed his head, unable to answer.Henry panicked yesterday when Rosen vomited blood, and was taken to his room to rest. After the war, Henry had become particularly vulnerable to death, but the guilt must have been greater. Ian thought Rosen Haworth was definitely smart.Henry prepared the stewed fruit, and Ian fed it to Rosen. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to fault a superior and a lieutenant at once.\u2013Rosen!Ian held the fallen Rosen in his arms and ran to where the doctor was. At that time, he was in a hurry and forgot that there were people around him, and he was calling out Rosen\u2019s name. If the situation hadn\u2019t been urgent, someone would have thought it was strange.That was too intimate a title for a guard to use for a prisoner. He was surprised by the name that came out unconsciously. Although he had called her \u2018Rosen\u2019 countless times inwardly, he never said it out loud.\u201cWhy does she want to die? She won\u2019t live long if she gets to the island anyway, so why is she trying to end her life with her own hands?\u201dIt was a question that Ian knew the answer to. Ian stared silently out of the cabin window. Henry did not wait for his reply, but instead glared at Rosen, who was still asleep.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be strong, you need to be strong until the end. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just tell me why you\u2019re here.\u201dHenry responded without hesitation, having given up on questioning him further.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, but a group of sea monsters are passing in front of our ship. They\u2019re a bit large. My fath- no, the Captain told me.\u201dHenry stopped him from getting dressed and going to the Captain\u2019s office.\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cHow can a group of sea beasts be so insignificant?\u201dIan countered, recalling a bird strike. He knew what kind of catastrophe a bird could cause. It was not enemy planes, but birds that pilots were most afraid of when they flew. If a bird got sucked into an engine, no matter how good the airship was, it would fall.\u201cThe sea and the sky are a little different. Besides, we discovered it early. There\u2019s a big crowd, and at this rate, they might block our course\u2026 It\u2019s said that such a big ship will deter monsters but I guess they\u2019re wrong. You don\u2019t have to worry too much. If we can\u2019t scare them, we\u2019ll just have to adjust our course a little.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven in the worst case, our arrival will only be delayed by a day or two. Though, if the ship is delayed, I have to report it to the upper management.Father told me that you should know about that, too.\u201dHenry glanced at Rosen, who was still sleeping, and left the room. Until he closed the door and left, Ian tried not to reveal the strange sense of relief that spread across his chest.Henry was right. Ian realized as soon as he heard that the route would be changed, the schedule would be disrupted, and Rosen could live another day or two. He had finally gone crazy.At last, the moment Ian was left alone, he slowly sat down beside the bed. He crouched and examined Rosen\u2019s sleeping face, then shook her small shoulder with his hand.\u201cGet up.\u201dRosen frowned and opened her eyes. He tried to speak in the broadcasting voice that Rosen Haworth liked. The voice that had repeatedly comforted her.\u201cWhat drinks do you like?\u201d***It had been raining since morning, but it didn\u2019t matter since rain did not interfere with the navigation of large ships. She thought that when it rained at sea, the sound of the waves would not be heard. She was right, but other sounds became more prominent. Raindrops pounded on the window non-stop, the boat wobbled more than usual, and the air was cold.The sky turned grey and water flowed over the decks, as if the ship had become a submarine.Henry taught her a board game played at the onboard casino. It was a really boring strategy game about two countries fighting with airship models. It was a waste of time in many ways for someone who would be sent to an island within a few days. Moreover, the confrontation between beginner and expert was enough to tire both of them. After an embarrassing one-sided defeat, she threw the model airship away.She wanted to win something other than this stupid game. She had to deal with Ian Kerner, not Henry.\u201cCan\u2019t I go out? Let me take a break. The cabin is small, and this is not interesting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not small.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s small and suffocating.\u201d\u201cHow did you spend your time in prison if you\u2019re so bored here?\u201dSince the morning, Henry had been sitting in the cabin and glancing between Ian and Rosen alternately. For the first hour or two, she had nothing to do, so she left him like that, but he seemed unwilling to leave. After breakfast, he brought a board game and started torturing her.Ian Kerner condoned Henry\u2019s actions, like he was entrusting his child to a nanny. She didn\u2019t know which of the two was the nanny; Henry or Rosen.\u2018That\u2019s great. Play with each other.\u2019Then he sat motionless at his desk, reading a newspaper for hours. It had been a few days since they boarded the ship, so it wasn\u2019t the latest edition. Even if there were a variety of newspapers, the general contents would be the same, but he still read several newspapers alternately. It was hard to understand the hobbies of high-ranking people.\u201cI broke out of prison because I was frustrated. I love freedom.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t leave today. If I do, Sir Kerner and you will be alone. It would be a terrible thing.\u201dShe had played a mind trick on Henry, and he immediately revealed his innermost thoughts. He was such a pushover. Rosen reluctantly shoved the game board away.\u201cYou\u2019re not done talking about it? Didn\u2019t I convince you? I told you that you should believe your boss even if I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOh, I believed him. I believed him until yesterday, but not now.\u201dHenry mumbled something insignificant, glaring at his boss. She couldn\u2019t understand how Henry\u2019s blind loyalty to his superior had suddenly disappeared.\u2018Did you get brainwashed overnight?\u2019\u201cYou trust each other, don\u2019t you? And Sir Kerner-\u201d\u201cI know. Having said that, it\u2019s scary when someone loyal turns around, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHenry was openly sarcastic. The sound of pages turning stopped for a moment.\u201cDid you two have a fight? In a peaceful country, allies fight each other. Henry, aren\u2019t you supposed to obey Ian?\u201d\u201cA loyal lieutenant must be courageous when his superiors make wrong decisions.\u201dHer conclusion was that he was offended by something Ian did and wanted to make him feel bad. Maybe he was upset because Ian said he wouldn\u2019t trust him yesterday. She just wanted to throw Henry Reville into the sea.\u2018The two of you get along well, so why bring me into this? Thanks to you, I can\u2019t talk to Ian Kerner alone today.\u2019In the end, Rosen changed her goal to something more trivial; getting out of the cabin. If she stayed here, she\u2019d just stare at Henry until she got to the island.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You could slip and get hurt.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d\u201cIf you win this game, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201dIt meant no. The game was incredibly difficult, and she barely understood the rules. She was annoyed, but she decided to use a more effective method.\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive at the island soon\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, why are you crying again! Do you only show emotion when you need something? Are you really that cold?\u201dThere was a reason why Henry was proud that his commander was cool-headed; because he wasn\u2019t. Tears worked better on Henry than Ian.\u201cI\u2019ll be really quiet. It\u2019s raining, so all the passengers are in bars or restaurants. Let me go out for a little bit. I cleaned myself up, so even if we run into someone, no one will recognize my face.\u201d\u201cWhen you said you wanted something to eat yesterday, you told me there wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But then you spit up blood and collapsed.\u201d\u201cMy lies ended yesterday. I have no reason to lie now because I made a promise to Sir Kerner. Besides, isn\u2019t going out better than leaving me alone with Ian?\u201dRosen spoke with the most serious and genuine face she could muster. Henry shook his head and glared at her.\u201cYou\u2019re lying. You were trying to kill yourself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to die? You\u2019d like it if I did, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201dShe changed the subject in a way that would make him feel guilty. Henry was at a loss for words and couldn\u2019t answer. He replied in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019ve killed enough people. I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. And you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRosen Walker, you\u2019re so mean. Listen to what you\u2019re saying.\u201dHenry\u2019s expression was more distressed than she expected. She felt a little bad.In the end, Henry asked Ian with a look of reluctance.\u201cWhat shall we do, Sir? Should I take her out on the deck? It is up to you to decide, but I hope you will make a wise decision. Don\u2019t betray my remaining trust!\u201dHe was like a younger brother asking his older brother to do his homework. Even if they quarrelled, Henry seemed to rely on Ian alone. After all, living as the youngest was the best in many ways. All difficult decisions could be passed on.Ian put down his newspaper and ordered.\u201cHenry, go to the storehouse and get a drink.\u201d\u201cWhat drink?\u201d\u201cRosen Haworth asked for a drink yesterday. I agreed to get it for her.\u201d\u201cI asked if I should take her to the deck. If I leave, you two will be alone. How could I do that?\u201d\u201cGo.\u201dIan ordered without explanation. The military did a good job of training their soldiers. Their methods may be coercive, but their efficiency was superb. Henry Reville was a dog tamed to command. He reflexively got up from his seat and walked out the door.And so, she was left alone in the cabin with Ian Kerner. It was a problem that could be solved with just one command, without having to sacrifice her pride. She had two thoughts.One, she had to do her best to convince Ian Kerner.Two, the way they talked was really strange. She lay down on the bed. She asked Ian, who was still sitting at the desk.\u201cWhy is Henry upset today?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how he is. He has been an immature foal since birth.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re still holding his reins pretty well. I can see why you are a commander.\u201d\u201cI have to hold on tight. I lost everything except him.\u201dIt was a flattering remark, but he delivered it in a sullen voice. They were words that made her heart hurt. She knew what he was missing because she was also from Leoarton. He missed his hometown.So him saying something like that meant not to talk anymore. But she deliberately acted ignorant. She interjected brightly.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou read newspapers and reports, so you know everything about my life, but I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t read, so all I know is that you\u2019re a handsome pilot. I don\u2019t like it. You hate me and know me well, while I like you, but don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201dRosen found out last night. Ian was surprisingly unable to ignore her if she clung to him like a child. He hated fuss and considered his mission to be his life. And she was a troublesome prisoner. So he accepted her foolishness as long as she didn\u2019t cross the line. It was quieter that way.She couldn\u2019t fight back, nor could she weep and pretend to be sad. The answer was to hang on like a child. He couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to that. He had lived as a hero for too long.\u201cThe newspapers all say the same thing. Stop reading and play with me.\u201dThose words caused Ian to spring out of his seat. He seemed to be a bit shocked when she asked him to \u2018play\u2019.\u201c\u2026 What the hell are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cHow old are you, exactly?\u201dIan stared at Rosen. He seemed to have realized that she was going to ask useless questions while Henry was away.\u201cThirty.\u201d\u201cVery young! Much younger than I thought.\u201d\u201cI hear that all the time.\u201dAnd he knew very well how much trouble it would be if she started whining. As expected, war heroes were very wise. She began to pry in earnest.\u201cOh my God, when did you become a commander?\u201d\u201cThe war started ten years ago. Calculate it yourself.\u201d\u201cTwenty? How can a twenty-year-old be a commander?\u201dRosen got up from her seat with a startled expression and approached him. While she was at it, she pulled out a chair and sat down beside him. Of course, it was a distraction tactic, but she really was surprised when she heard twenty. He leaned away from her, keeping a comfortable distance between them.\u201cIf all seniors are dispatched, a twenty-year-old becomes the most experienced. Talas stole people before the war. I know you know it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Air Force has a very short history. On the other hand, it takes a long time to train pilots. There was a shortage of people.\u201dRosen was at a loss for words. Twenty years old\u2026 she remembered his voice ringing over the speakers in Leoarton. His voice had inspired the masses from that point on.So she guessed that Ian Kerner\u2019s current age was thirty-three or thirty-four\u2026 Perhaps she expected him to be a little older than that. He looked much younger, but she thought that was just because he was handsome.\u201cAll the good pilots were sent to the border or to Malona, so the pilots remaining in Leoarton were academy students. And the best cadets were dispatched one by one. My first squadron was only made up of four, including me. Lucy Watkins, Illeria Levi, Violet Michael\u2026 After they all died, it was Henry Reville, Sarah Leverett, and Mikhail Johnson.\u201d\u201c\u2026There were women, too?\u201d\u201cThere were quite a few. Everyone who could fly was enlisted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone in my squadron knew what they were getting into. The Air Force was new and dangerous. But they didn\u2019t expect to be forgotten.\u201dHe had memorized their names like a spell, but as soon as he saw her stiff expression, he bit his lip. He seemed to have unintentionally said too much.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Forget it. I said something rash.\u201dThe Empire did something crazy. They threw cadets, who had just begun to fly, onto the battlefield. The Leoarton Fleet, which the masses believed in, consisted of students. Contrary to expectations, they survived for a long time, so the government and military used Ian Kerner for propaganda purposes.She should have figured it out the moment she saw Henry Reville, but why didn\u2019t she?Having fought for a decade, thirty was a ridiculous age. Rosen bowed her head and apologized.\u201cI am sorry for insulting your colleagues. As you said, I\u2019ve never been taught properly, so sometimes I say things without thinking.\u201dHe sighed and shook his head.\u201cNo, I should apologize. What I told you was\u2026\u201dRosen realized that he had Henry fetch alcohol because he wanted to apologize to her. He was hesitant about what to say, but for her, what he had already said was enough.Because, like everyone else, she liked Ian Kerner. Wasn\u2019t that a hero\u2019s prerogative? He should forgive and be forgiven easily, and receive much love.\u201cNo, you think too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is so much, so much that it suffocates you. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t sleep. You don\u2019t have to apologize to a prisoner like me. This is just how I live my life, thinking about my future.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201dIf her observation was correct, Ian tended to get hung up on what he couldn\u2019t understand. The problem was that most of the things he couldn\u2019t understand were difficult for her to explain. She just poured out her emotions without thinking much.She shrugged.\u201cBecause I like you. I hope you feel at ease. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted in the first place?\u201d\u2018We can share our burdens and travel the thorny road. Even if you hurt me, I will forgive you in the end.\u2019And it wasn\u2019t just a pretense. Of course, she was trying to figure out a way to trick him somehow to get the key. If she succeeded, he\u2019d probably get into quite a bit of trouble.But apart from all that, she wanted him to live well. It was contradictory, but it was her sincere wish. She hoped for him to walk a solid path, paved just for him. As his scars faded, she hoped he would fondly recall how he was tricked by that crazy witch in the past.Ian stiffened as he faced her. His grey eyes stared intently at her.He was silent for a long time, and then he struggled to get his words out.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dRosen suddenly noticed that the distance between them was quite small. It was close enough to feel each other\u2019s breath.\u201cThat you like me.\u201d\u201cAre you upset?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\u201cAnswer me, are you offended?\u201dWhen he refused to answer, she repeated the question. It was childish, but she wanted permission. Like everyone else, she liked him. She hoped he would answer that he would be her hero.\u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. I feel weird. You seem to forget what kind of relationship we have.\u201dIan turned away from Rosen. His fading warmth made her feel greedy.She leaned over and kissed Ian\u2019s cheek. It was half impulsive, half with the intention of opening his mind. No, the impulse was greater.She wanted to touch him. It was a pure desire that occurred when a person who existed only in pictures stood vividly in front of you. Now, she was certain that he would not tie her back up if she was a little insolent.Ian Kerner stared at her in utter shock, reaching up to touch the spot where she kissed him.She thought he was going to push her away or get mad. She expected it. But surprisingly, he didn\u2019t do anything.He stayed still.The room became quiet. The only sound that could be heard was raindrops pounding on the window. She carefully reached out. She couldn\u2019t resist the growing urge.***If you like listening to music while reading, you can listen to this: https://youtu.be/R3OH4Es5Awc.I have posted this link at the end of the chapter because from now on, I feel like this particular music would suit Rosen and Ian\u2019s story. I love this track and listen to it when I want to clear my mind. Hope you enjoy it as well!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShaken (4)***Shaken (4)***At first, Rosen was definitely planning on subtly seducing him. But the moment she touched his cheek, she forgot her original goal.She touched his face for a long time, like a child holding a puppy in her arms for the first time. She stroked his cheek, touched his nose, and brushed his neat eyebrows.For a long time, Ian didn\u2019t stop Rosen. He just watched what she was doing with a confused look on his face.Her hand, which was about to go down the nape of his neck, was caught in his broad hand. She got embarrassed and quickly lowered her eyes. He awkwardly pulled his hand away and placed it in his lap, avoiding her gaze.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dIan wasn\u2019t easily able to speak.She understood how stupid she was. She was a prisoner who suddenly kissed him and touched his face as she wanted.She wanted to see if it was possible, but what caught her eye was that there was no desire in his eyes, only perplexity. And as she analyzed his expression, her sense of reality returned. What did she expect? Did she expect him to run after her like a mad dog, like Al Capez\u2019s stupid guards?No, it was better for him to run away, but\u2026She didn\u2019t know if she was feeling disappointment or relief.In fact, last night she thought he would comfort her, at least formally. It was easy for her to distract male guards. As they talked, she shed tears, naturally leaned on their shoulders, wrapped her arms around their necks, and everything went well.And if they drank together, everything became much simpler.But Ian Kerner sat with his arms crossed and listened to her from start to finish without a change in expression. He didn\u2019t even sleep. Until she, who couldn\u2019t stand it, fell apart.He didn\u2019t move at all the way she intended, so she made a mistake. She quickly clarified.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, forget it. I didn\u2019t do it to\u2026 I just wanted to touch your face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI mean, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s exactly the same as the flyer. I\u2019m going to die soon anyway, so it\u2019s like my wish was granted.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t have a lot of wit, but it was true that she was impulsive, so it wasn\u2019t a lie.She regretted it as soon as she said it. The orphan girl from the slums, the witch of Al Capez\u2026 She had always wanted to kiss his face, and this was her only opportunity.***She once hung Ian Kerner\u2019s flier in the kitchen. It was around the time when she fell asleep trembling in fear, not knowing when the piercing air raid warning might sound. After looking at Ian\u2019s face, that fear subsided a little. Most of all, his smile gave her strength even though she was at the end of her rope.She thought it would be fine. Hindley didn\u2019t come home often, and hardly ever stepped foot in the kitchen. The kitchen was a space for Rosen and Emily. Above all, she never thought that if her habit was discovered, it would be a big problem.She thought at worst, she\u2019d get smacked for ignoring Hindley.When Emily saw her hanging the flier on the cupboard, she grabbed her stomach and laughed.\u201cOh my God, Rosen. When I see you like this, I remember how young you are!\u201dIan Kerner was everyone\u2019s idol. Married or not, the Leoarton girls did the same thing. In fact, the men were no different.But Hindley seemed to think differently.One day, she was squatting by the river and doing the laundry when she saw Hindley walking towards her. In Hindley\u2019s hand was a horsewhip from the racetrack. She didn\u2019t have a good feeling. She quickly dried off her hands, got up, and tried to run away.But Hindley was faster than her. Her messy hair was caught. The wives who were doing the laundry together screamed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What did she do wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dHe gleefully threw a crumpled up flier at her feet.\u201cEveryone puts it up. I hung it on the cupboard neatly so it doesn\u2019t leave any marks. If you don\u2019t like it-\u201cRosen stuttered. In fact, she didn\u2019t quite understand why Hindley was angry, or why she had to make excuses. Before she could finish speaking, she was thrown to the ground. Hindley began to kick her endlessly.She crouched down, protecting her head with her arms. It was the first time Hindley had beaten her like that. At worst, he shoved her or hit her in the chest.She thought she was living a good life, holding her breath and not being noticed. In the end, the result was this. Hindley took away even the modest affection he had shown his new toy.Hindley couldn\u2019t resist trampling on the flier, picking it up again and tearing it apart. Ian Kerner\u2019s handsome face scattered and floated away down the stream. Hindley swung his whip at random.\u201cStupid b*tch, don\u2019t act like a wh*re. Do you like guys like this? With smooth faces?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201dRosen didn\u2019t think her words would work on Hindley. She already knew he wouldn\u2019t listen. But she couldn\u2019t stand being insulted in that way.\u201cI-\u201c\u201cThis mouse-like girl has high ambitions! Even if you spread your legs for this man, he wouldn\u2019t even blink. He wouldn\u2019t even look. Because countless women throw themselves at him daily.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think you can even reach the feet of this guy?\u201dRosen glared at Hindley for the first time, knowing nothing she did would change anything. Hindley snorted.\u201cDon\u2019t you normally cover your eyes?\u201dAnd the beating resumed.***Rosen stopped recalling her past. And again, she looked closely at Ian Kerner. A smirk crossed her lips. In rebellion against Hindley, she kept a collection of fliers in a chest of drawers after that. His face was certainly worthy of it.\u201cOnce upon a time, my husband was jealous of you. I liked your face.\u201dNow that she thought about it, it was obvious jealousy. It was the \u2018petty jealousy\u2019 that Hindley told her not to have. Ian only nodded, not knowing what to say.\u201cI hung a flier in the kitchen and got beaten up. My husband said a woman like me would never even reach your toes. Actually, he wasn\u2019t wrong\u2026 I don\u2019t think you know what life was like.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that I\u2019m facing you like this. You can touch me, too.\u201dAs she finished speaking, his hand approached. Rosen blinked. Ian silently reached out and tucked her hair behind her ear, brushing her cheeks. Just like she did. His eyes stared intently at her.She stopped breathing. Her face heated up and she froze, not knowing how to respond to his vivid touch.His lips twitched as if he was going to say something.At that moment, the doorknob clicked, and she hurriedly fell away from Ian. Ian picked up the newspaper he had put down.Henry came into the cabin. Instead of a bottle, he had something else in his arms.\u201cRosen!\u201dLayla, wearing a raincoat, shouted her name brightly. Henry\u2019s face was beet red. He looked as if he was about to die of embarrassment.\u201cI met her on the way, and she insisted on following me. I\u2019m sorry Sir Kerner\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope Walker will not harm Layla or anyone else. We\u2019re right here anyway.\u201dRosen cleared her mind and smiled warmly. Layla threw away her raincoat, ran to Rosen, and sat down on her lap. Ian didn\u2019t move, instead burying his face in the newspaper, as if he had given up on stopping Layla.\u201cRosen, Ian released your handcuffs?\u201dLayla didn\u2019t ask further why she was on the ground, or why Ian had unshackled Rosen. Rosen just smiled and hugged the little girl. She didn\u2019t want to bring up words like suicide or self-harm in front of the child. Although it was unavoidable, she was reluctant to vomit blood in front of Layla.She stroked Layla\u2019s blonde hair. It was the first time they met after her handcuffs had been removed. Layla\u2019s hair was much softer and warmer than she expected.Rosen didn\u2019t know how to feel a person\u2019s body temperature so freely. So, without fear, she touched Ian Kerner like a furry beast.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a party on the deck today. It\u2019s hosted by my grandfather, so I\u2019ll invite you.\u201dLayla clapped her hands. Rosen glanced at Ian. She still didn\u2019t know where the key was. In addition, it was necessary to visit where the lifeboats were at least once. In that case, it would be better to broaden her scope of action. He couldn\u2019t easily allow her to go to a party when she wasn\u2019t allowed to go out on the deck, but\u2026It might be a little easier if she had support.\u201cParty? Isn\u2019t it raining?\u201d\u201cMy grandfather said it would be sunny in the evening. Grandpa never gets the weather wrong. And today is Walpurgis Night.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, already.\u201d\u2018Has it already happened?\u2019After being imprisoned, her perception of time was dulled. In prison, yesterday was like today, and today was like tomorrow. She couldn\u2019t feel anything other than the change of seasons. It was winter when her fingers froze, and summer when sweat spots formed all over her body and prisoners began to collapse from heatstroke.The Feast of St. Walpurg.Walpurgis Night.The birthday of Walpurg, the greatest witch in history.Midwinter festival.It was a day when the whole Empire celebrated, so it seemed to be held on boats as well. After all, this ship was a passenger ship. The prisoners were housed like livestock in cells, while the rest of the passengers were on a pleasant journey.\u201cRosen, have you been to a boat party?\u201d\u2018Could it be?\u2019Rosen smiled and shook her head.\u201cNo, never.\u201d\u201cThere are fireworks and a ball. There is a lot of delicious food, and the band performs on the deck. I want Rosen to go with me.\u201dHenry shook his head and hugged Layla, who was excited. He had a hard time getting his words out.\u201cLayla, but that\u2019s\u2026 Rosen\u2026 \u201d\u201cLook, uncle, be quiet for a second. I\u2019m explaining. Did you not invite Rosen because she didn\u2019t know about the party?\u201dHenry was just trying to say that it would be a bit difficult. However, Henry, who was infinitely weak in front of Layla, could not firmly say no. He nervously looked between his superior and Layla.Rosen knew very well that Layla was a smart kid, and that Henry had no control over her. Layla cringed a little and then ran straight to Ian, who was still sitting at his desk. She grabbed the hem of Ian\u2019s sleeve and made a pitiful expression.\u201cI have already gotten permission from grandfather. Rosen said she\u2019s never been to a party, so-\u201dHenry interrupted Layla with difficulty.\u201cLayla, Rosen is famous. Almost everyone in the Empire knows her face.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s theme is a masquerade, uncle! Besides, no one will recognize a beautifully decorated Rosen. You saw it too, Ian! Didn\u2019t you see it?\u201d\u201cLayla.\u201d\u201cIf Ian is her partner, he can keep an eye on her. After all, it makes no difference whether you watch from close or far away. We\u2019re surrounded by water\u2026 \u201dLayla used her grandfather\u2019s logic flawlessly.But Rosen already knew what Ian Kerner\u2019s reaction would be. He wasn\u2019t the kind of person who listened to things just because a child said it. He\u2019d definitely shake his head resolutely and explain the reasons for not doing so one by one.Ian sat at his desk and listened to Layla\u2019s persuasion without saying anything. Rosen tried to read his expression, but his gray eyes were vague.In her mind, she put together words to appeal to Ian Kerner. Trying was always better than not trying.She\u2019d be quiet and wouldn\u2019t walk around. He wouldn\u2019t have to leave her side for even a moment. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry that she\u2019d pass out after eating food. He just had to pick out the foods that she had been eating and give them to her.Lastly, she really wanted to see the sea.The colorful lights too.Anyway, she\u2019d get to the island soon, and die.\u2018Let me dream, even for one night.\u2019\u2018Today is Walpurgis Night.\u2019\u2018Do you remember? What a miserable first Walpurgis Night I had. Please let me enjoy this last festival\u2026\u2019\u2018But when he asked me why I had to bear such a difficult burden, I had no answer. So what should I say? Is there no other way but to appeal to his sympathy?\u2019Ian Kerner suddenly asked an unbelievable question.\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWant to go to the party, Haworth?\u201dHe turned and looked straight at Rosen. She had to ponder for a moment whether the question was a trap. There was no way Ian Kerner would let her go so easily. She swallowed dry saliva and answered cautiously.\u201cWould it be strange if I didn\u2019t want to go?\u201dIan nodded his head.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go.\u201dIt was as if that was the simplest request in the world. She had to go through her memories carefully. Did she give Ian Kerner some weird medicine last night? Maybe he went insane?\u201cSir!\u201dHenry shouted in surprise. Ian raised his hand to stop him.\u201cYou\u2019ve already made too many exceptions. You\u2019ve done too much for her.\u201dIan closed his eyes. He swept his face with his hand and spoke in a tired voice.\u201c\u2026It wouldn\u2019t change anything if I did a little more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShe saved Layla.\u201dRosen remembered the man who had touched her cheek a moment ago. The reason that he belatedly added her good deed as an excuse was probably because that warmth was still vivid.Layla was excited and hung from Ian\u2019s legs, screaming in happiness. Layla, who rubbed Ian and buried her face in his arms, immediately climbed onto Ian\u2019s lap and began to show him affection. Rosen was a little sceptical that Layla was having a hard time with Ian Kerner.\u201cIan, you\u2019re reading the newspaper upside down.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTa-da! I put it back! I did a good job, right?\u201dAnd suddenly Rosen was curious.\u2018What was Ian trying to say to me?\u2019When she looked out the window, the rain was starting to get weaker. Each time the ship scaled a wave, the dark clouds receded. As the light of the sunset shone through the clouds, the black sea was dyed red.Walpurgis Night was approaching.The midwinter festival, a witch\u2019s birthday.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWalpurgis Night(1)***Walpurgis Night(1)***The second Walpurgis night she remembered was when she was sixteen. She spent it with Emily.The government and military shamelessly revoked the lie that nothing would happen. After the first raid, a war declaration against Talas was declared throughout the Empire. The South was occupied within a year. Refugees packed up and rushed North towards the Capital, Malona, the last stronghold of the Empire.It was around the time when news that the front line had been pushed North again was reported every day.Airstrike alerts were issued almost daily in the middle of the night, and the enemy approached Leoarton, slowly swallowing up the Empire by land and sea. And the planes\u2026 Occasionally they flew over the skies near Malona and Leoarton and frightened them.[It\u2019s okay. I will always protect you.]The young commander of the Leoarton Squadron repeated the same thing. Surprisingly, he kept that heavy promise. Enemy aircraft were shot into the sea before they reached the skies of Leoarton. Of course, in retrospect, it was more terrifying than great if you thought about how much the Empire sacrificed its young pilots in the process.But back then, the only thing they could count on was Ian Kerner\u2019s voice. He was always there. After enduring the night and turning on the radio in the morning, she heard his voice. He always survived.That fact was the only pillar that supported them. So they didn\u2019t think about it too deeply. It would be fine.Because Ian Kerner said so.They believed Leoarton would be fine.A year had passed since she came to Hindley\u2019s house. That same year, the feast of St. Walpurg was hosted.Even during the war, festivals were held. It was smaller and simpler than it was in past years, but people still baked cakes and lit dimmed lanterns in the square. It seemed to be able to blot out the bloody atmosphere of war for a while.After the beginning of the war, Hindley went to the racetrack every day to gamble. She liked when he went out, so she hummed as she kneaded the cake dough. Emily and Rosen took their favorite strawberry jam from the cupboard and spread it generously on the dough. It wasn\u2019t a waste because they were going to eat all of it.As they put the dough into the oven, Rosen whispered to Emily.\u201cWalpurgis Night is something special for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWalpurgis Night was, after all, the feast of witches. As the times changed, witches had to hide, so they couldn\u2019t participate in their own festival.\u201cOf course, the meaning is a little different now, but it was originally a Witch\u2019s Festival, and it\u2019s also my birthday.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday? Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201dEmily spoke so carelessly that Rosen felt sad. Had she known in advance, she would have prepared a small gift. Emily smiled and patted Rosen\u2019s head.\u201cRosen, maybe my definition of \u2018birthday\u2019 is a little different from yours. Every witch\u2019s birthday is Walpurgis Night. It\u2019s not that I was born that day, but\u2026 \u201d\u201cBorn as a witch?\u201d\u201cYes. Rosen, stop eating the dough. Eat it when it is properly baked. And don\u2019t say \u2018witch\u2019 too loud.\u201dEmily slapped Rosen\u2019s hand as she continued to scoop out the uncooked dough. Rosen hid her flour-covered hands behind her back with an innocent expression.The fact that Emily was a witch was a secret no one knew.Perhaps if it hadn\u2019t been for their fateful meeting, Hindley would have hidden Emily\u2019s identity from her as well. If she reported it to the government \u2013 which of course, she wouldn\u2019t \u2013 Emily would be shot immediately.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Emily. My lips are sealed.\u201dEven if someone found out and wanted to report her, Hindley wouldn\u2019t let it happen.Hindley never let Emily go. Hindley needed Emily. Emily was his only source of money and labor. He was attached to her like a leech.But did Emily need Hindley? Absolutely not. Hindley was just a parasite. The real doctor at the clinic was Emily.Hindley was just a figurehead. In the back room, it was Emily who prescribed medicine, processed herbs, and cared for patients.\u201cEmily heals people without anyone knowing.\u201dRosen said, flipping through Emily\u2019s notebook with her flour-stained hands. Like her, Emily didn\u2019t know how to read or write, so her notes consisted of symbols and pictures.\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t perform magic in the healing center.\u201dAt first, Rosen couldn\u2019t understand.Why was Emily, who was incredibly smart, married to Hindley?Why didn\u2019t she run away and start a new life? It didn\u2019t take long to find out the answer.\u201cRosen. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you, but\u2026 I\u2019m worried. You could be at risk too. You know\u2026 witch hunters are reckless. If you\u2019re suspected to be a witch, you may die even if you really aren\u2019t a witch.\u201dBeing locked up in an orphanage, Rosen didn\u2019t understand the world. The meaning of the word \u2018persecution\u2019 was far more terrifying than she thought. Witches could no longer wield their power as they pleased. Once admired, they were now hunted like cattle and despised.Science quickly took their place.But the question remained. The steam engine was a great invention, but that didn\u2019t make magic completely obsolete. There was still a void that science could not fill, and the magic tools left behind by witches were traded at high prices on the black market.So why did the Empire hunt witches when they still needed magic?\u2013 Old feelings of inferiority and anger.To quote Emily, it was ultimately due to a power struggle.\u2013 Magic is a power with mysterious properties. It does not flow through blood, so it cannot be used for political marriage between families, nor can it be obtained through money or power. It\u2019s a power that strikes like a lightning bolt from the poor to the wealthy. And it can only be inherited by girls\u2026They were afraid and uncomfortable with the fact that, in a sense, the power given very fairly is the power of the world. As soon as Rosen heard it, she understood it instinctively, but her chest constricted in anger. She asked a question she knew the answer to.-So no one knows that you can heal people?-Yes.-How did you find this method and why don\u2019t you teach it to people? That\u2019s why Hindley ignores you and condescends. What Hindley doesn\u2019t know is that Emily taught me everything!-Because one person can\u2019t save the world. There\u2019s no one special enough to do that.-No, Emily is special. Everyone ignores how special you are, Emily. I don\u2019t think Hindley is amazing.-Shhh! Don\u2019t forget to always be careful with what you say.-I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026-Rosen. I\u2019m a witch. That\u2019s why I started studying medicine. I can\u2019t use magic anymore, but there are moments when everyone needs healing.Emily did not try to monopolize her knowledge. She always shared recipes and small remedies to those in need without hesitation. Rosen didn\u2019t like that. If it were her\u2026She wouldn\u2019t have done that.If it were her, she would use her talents to live well. She would only spare the people she liked and kill the bad guys by pretending to heal them.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Emily hate the world? It\u2019s so unfair. The world treats you badly, so why do you keep trying to give back?\u201dEmily didn\u2019t answer. Rosen stared at the necklace that was always restraining Emily. Of course, she wasn\u2019t in a position to say that. Because she, too, was saved by Emily\u2019s goodness.Emily opened her notebook and tried to teach Rosen a number of useful things on the nights Hindley didn\u2019t come home.\u2013 It would be great if either of us knew how to read\u2026\u2013 It\u2019s okay. If you show me, I\u2019ll study hard. I\u2019m good at memorizing.Classes, where both the student and teacher were illiterate, were slow and sluggish. But Emily taught diligently, and Rosen studied hard. It was the first class she had ever taken. She learned addition, subtraction, and units of imperial money.How to say \u2018I\u2019m a civilian, help me!\u2019 in Talas.How to plant seeds in the ground according to the weather.How to process medicinal herbs to make pain relievers and hemostatic agents.Emily had also never been to school. She sometimes blushed as she apologized for not having enough to share, but Rosen always shook her head. The knowledge that Emily said was of little value was Rosen\u2019s only hope. The process of her world becoming wider was tearfully overwhelming.Now she had less of a chance at being scammed in the market. She helped Emily plant herbs in the fields and take care of the sick. It seemed that day by day she was becoming a more useful person.If Emily had been as strong and selfish as Rosen was, she wouldn\u2019t have stayed in the house.Rosen was sure that one of them would be killed or kicked out.\u201c\u2026Well, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever thought of that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRosen, you\u2019re smart.\u201dEmily smiled bitterly and stroked Rosen\u2019s hair once more. Emily looked sad and helpless. Rosen regretted making fun of her without thinking about it.What did she know about Emily\u2019s life to meddle in such a brazen way?There must be a reason why Emily couldn\u2019t do it. For reasons she didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t understand\u2026She changed the topic to make up for the subdued mood. She sat down at the table and asked in a bright voice.\u201cIf witches aren\u2019t related by blood, what is the criteria for a witch to be born? Is it really random?\u201d\u201cWitches are not born. They are made.\u201d\u201cIs it acquired?\u201dEmily sat across from her, turning on the gas stove and nodding her head. It was the first Rosen had heard of it. Strangely, her heart was pounding.\u201cThen that means that you became a witch at some point?\u201d\u201cYes. At the age of six.\u201d\u201cHow did you become a witch? What are the conditions?\u201dEmily did not miss the excitement in Rosen\u2019s voice.Emily squinted her eyes and looked at Rosen suspiciously.\u201cRosen, you\u2019re not saying you want to be a witch, are you?\u201d\u201cHey, I just want to hear it. I\u2019m curious!\u201dRosen shrugged and smiled. Emily was reluctant to use magic or talk about witches, but sometimes Rosen couldn\u2019t contain her curiosity and asked questions. She couldn\u2019t forget the wonder of seeing Emily\u2019s magic for the first time.Emily answered reluctantly.\u201cOne blood, one wish, one magic.\u201dWhat the hell did she mean?It wasn\u2019t anything like a recipe in a cookbook. Emily used words that were vague, like the incantations of legend.\u201c\u2026What do blood, wish and magic mean? Am I the only one who doesn\u2019t understand what you mean?\u201d\u201cWell actually, I don\u2019t know exactly what those conditions mean either.\u201dSo, without knowing it, the conditions were met and she became a witch.Rosen asked a little worriedly.\u201cDid Emily choose it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSurprisingly, she answered without hesitation. It was Emily\u2019s decisive attitude.Rosen did her own math. Twenty years ago, Emily was six. It must have been after the persecution of witches had begun.\u201cDon\u2019t you regret it?\u201d\u201cRosen, there are facts that once you realize, you can never go back. Obviously, after becoming a witch, my life became harder, more painful, and more tiring\u2026 I have no regrets though.\u201dEmily turned off the bright gas stove in the kitchen and lit a small lamp on the table. A cozy scarlet light enveloped the kitchen.\u201cRosen, you\u2019re holding back what you really want to ask, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHow did you know? Did you use magic?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need magic. I can tell from your expression.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She laughed bashfully. Hindley sometimes hit her, but it felt different when Emily did the same thing. She wanted to rip out all of Hindley\u2019s hair when he did it, but she was happy when Emily did.Emily took the cake out of the oven.\u201cOne blood, one wish, one magic. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means, but I can explain the meaning behind tonight\u2019s cake. It is related.\u201d\u201cCake?\u201d\u201cYes. The cake you eat on Walpurgis night. Did you know that if you make a wish on a cake, Walpurg will grant it?\u201dRosen\u2019s eyes were drawn to the cake, which had finished baking and smelled sweet. Emily noticed and plated her a large piece before putting candles on the cake.As the knife pierced the cake, strawberry jam spewed out.\u201cThis is the blood.\u201dWhile Rosen hurriedly shoveled the cake into her mouth, Emily lit the candles.\u201cLight a candle and make a wish to Walpurg. This is one wish\u2026 \u201d\u201cHow amazing. All of this has meaning. I thought it was just a festival made to eat cake.\u201dEmily smiled as she wiped the cream off Rosen\u2019s lips. Rosen thought hard, then asked again.\u201cThen what about one magic? Is it magic that makes wishes come true?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Rosen. Have you ever made a wish to Walpurg in front of a cake?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve made a wish every year. I didn\u2019t have a cake, but I didn\u2019t care. If Walpurg was real, she would think that I am such a shameless woman.\u201dAs Rosen spoke, she glanced at the cake for a second time. She remembered the family scene she had watched long ago after wiping a window with her cold hands.Suddenly she realized that she was now in the place she longed for so much. This time, really, Walpurg had granted her wish; someone who shamelessly loved her. And she didn\u2019t even need to use a cake.Warmth spread through her chest.It was euphoric.She was happy now. Everything was perfect.She ate her share of the cake happily. Once she was finished, she questioned Emily again.\u201cWill you answer one more question, Emily? I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat was the first magic Emily succeeded in casting after becoming a witch?\u201dEmily hesitated for a moment and answered softly, unable to hide her embarrassment.\u201c\u2026I made a cake.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really boring.\u201dAs Rosen burst into laughter. Emily pouted.\u201cRosen, it\u2019s all boring at first. Besides, I was six years old at the time. The thing I wanted the most in the world was a delicious snack. That was the limit of my imagination.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cSo, Rosen, what wish did you make to Walpurg without a cake?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s it.\u201dRosen replied with a mischievous smile.\u201cI asked for a cake.\u201dWhen Emily heard that, she smiled and shook her head like she was going to go crazy.After they finished eating the cake, they pushed the table to the side and danced together in the kitchen. Rosen wanted to go out to the square, but she didn\u2019t know what kind of punishment they would get if they did.That day, on the cake she ate for the first time in her life, she made a wish to Walpurg. Don\u2019t let Hindley come back tonight. These moments were so happy that she was afraid that if she made a bigger wish, she would be punished by Walpurg.But could it even be called greed?\u201cB*tches! Why don\u2019t you come out here?\u201dA drunken Hindley returned at dawn. He was angry after wasting his cash on the racetrack, so Emily and Rosen had to deal with his anger.There were things she feared more than war. Their peace was always broken at the sound of Hindley at the front door. Shells couldn\u2019t penetrate their basement, but\u2026 Hindley could at any time.In the most disgusting ways one could imagine.\u201cRosen, open the door!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOpen the door now. Open up and talk to me. Please!\u201dEmily\u2019s voice echoed through the bathroom door. Rosen covered her ears. She didn\u2019t want to hear anything.She grabbed a hanger and cried in the bathtub. It was terrible. Everything was terrible. It was terrifying that she was born a woman. If she could, she would vomit up all her internal organs.She was not interested in winning or losing the war. In fact, the war outside did not mean much to her. Even before the war, her life was like a battlefield.In the winter when she was sixteen, her menstruation stopped.***Ian Kerner sent Henry outside the cabin, and watched Rosen look at the dresses spread out on his bed.\u201cWhat do you think? Which one is the prettiest?\u201dRosen refused to let the crew members attend to her on the pretext of wanting to dress up for the last time in her life. He didn\u2019t know if it was a conspiracy or not, but Ian couldn\u2019t find any good reason to refuse her request.After Rosen was released from her handcuffs, her mood swings intensified. She was happy and then depressed. Then she recovered and giggled casually after a few minutes. And she was impulsive. Fortunately, she wasn\u2019t as dangerous as before.Earlier, she hugged Layla with all her might and played an annoying board game, and when she lost, she got angry and beat up Henry.She also kissed Ian\u2019s cheek.Whatever it was, it was preferable to a suicide attempt or self-harm. It was also natural for a person to organize their lives in the face of imminent death.Suddenly, he felt the touch of Rosen\u2019s chapped lips on his cheek again. The kiss was too short, and what was contained in it was longing, not sexual desire. He couldn\u2019t push her away.No, it seemed like an excuse to defend his honor. There were other reasons he couldn\u2019t shake her off. And a reason why he didn\u2019t want to admit it.He stood still because he understood Rosen\u2019s actions.Because\u2026-Sorry, forget it. I didn\u2019t do it to\u2026 I just wanted to touch your face. I mean, it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s the same as the flyer.Because he reached out to Rosen with the same feeling. He couldn\u2019t comprehend the impulse that had taken hold of him at that moment. What would he have said if Henry and Layla hadn\u2019t come in then?\u201cSir Kerner? Are you listening to me? Which one is better?\u201dThanks to Rosen waving her hand in front of his eyes, Ian was able to snap out of his thoughts.She pointed to a yellow, red, and blue dress in succession. He quickly grasped the subject and provided an appropriate answer.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s up to you. Does my opinion matter?\u201dHe had no sense for picking out the beautiful or the wonderful. It was probably true, as the broadcast experts and photographers said so when he was called to make propaganda.\u201cI like all three of them equally. It\u2019s better to hear more than one person\u2019s opinion and look a little nicer than to choose anything. I can\u2019t choose, so you choose. What\u2019s the best?\u201dIan pointed to the yellow dress without thinking. He hated the color red for reasons similar to those of other soldiers who fought on a battlefield. He also disliked the color blue. But if he said that, no one would believe him. Because he spent nearly ten years in the sky.It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t liked the color blue from the start. Rather, it was the opposite. Rejecting good assignments and stable positions, Ian Kerner chose the Air Force. It was for a trivial reason. He wanted to fly in the blue sky. And because of his longing for the airship he saw at the festival in his childhood.But now that everything was over, whenever he saw blue, he was reminded of it.His comrades being sucked into dark blue water. The bombs he dropped from the sky, the villages that were destroyed.The roar.\u201cDo you like yellow?\u201d\u201cNo. I just hate the other two.\u201d\u201cI actually like blue. I\u2019ll wear the blue one.\u201dIt seemed that Rosen had no intention of taking his opinion into account in the first place, but it was a good thing that her decision was clear. Ian tried to turn away, but Rosen\u2019s movements were faster. Rosen flung off her dress in a showy manner. A skinny body was revealed in front of his eyes.He knew that he should turn away, but he stiffened. His body did not move.\u201cWhat, do you want to see me undress? Take a good look. You are always welcome to.\u201dRosen pointed to the bed with a smirk that he knew all too well. Ian sighed. It wasn\u2019t because of her body Rosen was trying to show off that he couldn\u2019t look away.Scars.Rosen\u2019s exposed body was far more terrifying than he had seen last night. After hearing that Rosen had been abused and seeing the wounds with his own eyes, he was once again at a loss for words.-You don\u2019t know war.No, Rosen knew war. Maybe she knew it a lot better than him. The war started ten years ago and was now over, but Rosen\u2019s war started from the moment she was born and was still not finished.Ian asked a stupid question.\u201cHow much\u2026 was it?\u201d\u201cA lot.\u201d\u201cDid you get hit often?\u201d\u201cAlmost every day.\u201dRosen replied quickly as if she had been waiting for that very question. Where did the tears she normally spilled for sympathy go? Usually, Rosen shed useless tears in front of him, but she didn\u2019t cry when she should. That attitude often embarrassed Ian.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask why?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason in the world to unilaterally assault a person who cannot resist. I\u2019m not even curious.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know the real reason? You said you read the newspaper. It must have said that I cheated on him. But I didn\u2019t. There was a misunderstanding that day.\u201d\u201cEven so\u2026\u201d-But look at this, look at my arm. I don\u2019t even have muscles! Hindley was over one meter and eighty centimetres tall. He was big too.Rosen\u2019s words came back like a boomerang. His head was ringing as if he had been hit by something. Ian Kerner suddenly felt like the stupidest person in the world.One meter and eighty centimetres. Hindley was a little smaller than him and had Henry\u2019s build. He put Henry and Rosen side by side in his head, but stopped. There was no need to think about it. She was no match for him. A physical fight could never be started. And you wouldn\u2019t even be able to call it a fight. It would be a one-sided assault.And, at that moment, Ian remembered one more reason why he hated the color blue.Bruises were blue, too.***[T/N: Just how did Hindley die?!]***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWalpurgis Night (3)***Walpurgis Night (3)***He had to express his regrets over her sad story, even if he was a prison guard and she was his prisoner. Of course, that compassion had to be in a cold, dry form. Only the bare minimum of human-to-human courtesy.Before he could think, his mouth moved.\u201cThe newspaper didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cOf course. I told you everything last night. Even stories that reporters don\u2019t know.\u201dRosen gave the answer he had expected in a voice that was so light that it did not fit the situation. As if nothing happened.Even if Rosen had said it, it would not have been reported that Hindley assaulted Rosen. The whole Empire wanted to make Rosen a villain. No one cared about the sad story of a woman who was branded as a witch.Ian remembered the articles he had persistently collected. When he closed his eyes, he saw the headlines one after another. There was no mention of Hindley Haworth\u2019s abuse in any of the numerous articles that had been published since the incident.Hindley Haworth.A man in his thirties.An ordinary and good-natured doctor from the slums.Murdered by his wife.That was all he knew about Hindley from the papers.While Rosen\u2019s words, her expression on the day she was arrested, her behavior, age and clothes she usually wore were dissected and displayed in newspapers, the story of Hindley Haworth was not published at all. It was strange.For all this time, no one wondered about Hindley Haworth. Hindley had always remained a pure victim. Until he heard Rosen\u2019s story.Under Imperial law, all prisoners were considered innocent until proven guilty. But what about Rosen? Rosen never had a proper say during her trial. Because none of the court-appointed lawyers defended Rosen. And the public was eager to throw stones.Of course, the evidence was solid and sufficient. It wasn\u2019t just coincidental. Her fingerprints on the knife, cuts on Hindley\u2019s body that matched Rosen\u2019s height, and scars on her hands that might have been obtained during a struggle. If he were a judge, Rosen would have been convicted.The result would\u2019ve been the same. But the whole process was clearly not fair. Someone should have asked. They should have listened to Rosen Haworth\u2019s story.Even if everything Rosen said was a lie, it was a right given to all suspects, to all humans.Ian forced his mouth to open. His voice came out harshly, like scratching on a metal plate.\u201cYou should have made a statement in court that you had been assaulted. Even if it would have put you at a disadvantage\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou are a smart person, but sometimes you say stupid things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think that would have changed anything?\u201dIan couldn\u2019t answer. It was highly likely that they would not even admit the fact that she had been assaulted. They would have asked for proof. They would have wondered if it was true that her husband hit her, or maybe she did something to be beaten first.There was no way that a woman who was illiterate, uneducated, and poor could hire a lawyer and win. At best, it would have elicited sympathy.\u201c\u2026At least you wouldn\u2019t have been labeled as a witch.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Everyone is anxious about not being able to kill me.\u201dRosen laughed as if she had heard the funniest joke in the world.\u201cWe always need someone to hate. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m used to being hated by people who don\u2019t know me. This is nothing. It\u2019s harder to hate than to be hated by my standards. Besides, it\u2019s all over now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut why are you suddenly saying this? Like you\u2019re on my side? Now that you\u2019ve heard everything, do you feel sorry for me?\u201dRosen turned to him. He noticed she was struggling to finish putting on her dress, which seemed difficult to put on properly without anyone\u2019s help. Rosen was trying to tie a ribbon around her waist. However, her long arms were stiff and could not reach behind her back.He naturally changed the topic.\u201cYou look like you need help, so I\u2019ll call the crew.\u201d\u201cNo. You do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIan Kerner couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou said you felt sorry for me, so let me have a proud war hero wait on me. I heard from somewhere that a partner takes care of everything. Anyway, you\u2019re my partner today, as Layla said.\u201dRosen was a highly intelligent prisoner. She knew him too well. Even if he didn\u2019t like it, Rosen was a mastermind, picking trivial requests that he would grant because he didn\u2019t want to make a fuss.He sighed and walked over to Rosen.\u201cIsn\u2019t the only knot you can tie a rescue knot? You have to tie a ribbon. You know how to, right?\u201d\u201cI am not stupid. I know that much.\u201dHe leaned down and grabbed the ribbon around her waist. Her wounds were deeper than he thought, and Rosen was thinner. As soon as he began to tie a knot, he thought of Rosen, who always ate food in a hurry. When she was young she couldn\u2019t eat because she didn\u2019t have food, when she was a teen she couldn\u2019t because of her husband, and when she was older she couldn\u2019t because she was in prison.Ian stood there for a moment in front of her bare body. A lot of thoughts rushed to his head, making him dizzy. She had a body that made it difficult to endure the winter, let alone descending cliffs and crossing mountains.\u2018What made you live so recklessly?\u2019\u2018What made your engine burn all this time?\u2019\u2018It looks like you don\u2019t have any fuel left to burn.\u2019Rosen grinned as if she could feel his gaze.\u201cSir, you really think I\u2019m pitiful.\u201d\u201cI never said that. Don\u2019t make things up.\u201d\u201cThen why are you being so nice all of the sudden? Taking me to the party, releasing my chains\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I pitiful? No need to make excuses. I like that you have pity on me.\u201dSurprising words came out of Rosen\u2019s mouth. She got angry when he said he knew her. He thought she would have a seizure just hearing the word compassion. As if reading his thoughts, Rosen shrugged casually.\u201cWhy are you looking at me so strangely? It\u2019s better to sympathize with than to be despised by someone you like.\u201dIan didn\u2019t answer, and after he had finished tying the ribbon, he fell away from her. Rosen began to look at herself in the mirror. The hem of her blue skirt fluttered before his eyes like a wave. Rosen frowned and shook her head.\u201cYou were right after all. I want to wear yellow.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 10 minutes since you said you liked the blue one.\u201d\u201cBut look at this. All my scars are visible. This would be like advertising I\u2019m a prisoner. A high-class lady wouldn\u2019t wear something like this, would she?\u201dRosen pointed to her neck and chest. It was true. Unlike the clothes she wore yesterday, this dress did not cover her body much.\u201cAnd you said you like yellow.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think. Wear whatever you want.\u201d\u201cNo, your opinion matters. Because I-\u201dIan already knew what she was going to say. He could no longer put up with it, so he untied the red muffler he was wearing around his neck, and wrapped it around Rosen\u2019s. Then she wouldn\u2019t be able to say that she liked him.Rosen buried her face in his muffler and chuckled mischievously.\u201cDoes a blue dress with a brown coat and red scarf make sense? The colors don\u2019t match.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got your neck covered as you wished, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you were wearing in the fliers?\u201dIt was. When he was sent out by generals and took dozens of pictures, the photographer bombarded him, saying that this would be his symbol. It was incomprehensible to him, who always wore the gray scarf distributed to all Air Force personnel. But at the behest of the photographer, he wore a red scarf throughout the war.The result was as the photographer said. People went wild. So after the war ended, he could not take it off.\u201cA symbol of victory. Sir Kerner\u2019s red scarf! It was also sold at the store, but I couldn\u2019t buy it because it was too expensive. I made one myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little too much for me. Can I really borrow it?\u201dIan realized he had made a mistake. Prisoners were not allowed to have belongings.But he had already wrapped the scarf around Rosen. Giving and then immediately taking was foolish, and a bundle of yarn couldn\u2019t harm anyone.Above all\u2026It was satisfying to see that the red scarf, a symbol of victory, wrapped around Rosen\u2019s neck. It might\u2019ve been an unconscious rebellion against the Empire that had ruined him and killed his companions, or it might\u2019ve been compassion for Rosen.She endured a long war and an unhappy marriage. Through it all, she idolized him. It also could\u2019ve been that he wanted to give a belated gift to the only Leoarton native he saved.In any case, a muffler would be better than a chain. Ian looked at Rosen and was once again struck with strange relief.\u201cI can\u2019t believe we are partners! A prisoner and a guard. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a combination like this in history. I don\u2019t know much about high-ranking people, but I know that for sure.\u201dLooping her arm in his, Rosen laughed out loud.\u201cSir Kerner, let\u2019s go. Can I really borrow this? You don\u2019t like me. You gave it to me to throw it away, right?\u201dRosen asked in a confident tone, as if she knew the answer.-I don\u2019t like this. You hate me, but you know me well, and I like you, but I don\u2019t know anything.Ian Kerner realized belatedly at that moment. After Rosen kissed him, he knew what he wanted to say.\u2018I don\u2019t hate you.\u2019\u2018Even though you were called a witch, there were far more people who liked you than you thought\u2026 I was one of them.\u2019But Ian knew that was something he should never say out loud. He looked at the red scarf wrapped around Rosen\u2019s neck and nodded.\u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t strangle yourself with it.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes were full of doubt. But this time there was no shouting, so she greeted them with her chest puffed out and her arm in Ian\u2019s.\u201cSir, did she flirt with you again while I was away?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t, hand to my chest. I was very elegant\u201dRosen quickly answered Henry\u2019s question. She gently stroked Layla\u2019s hair, who was wearing a rabbit mask. Layla was Layla even with her mask on. Layla from afar, Layla from up close, Layla from anywhere. Henry, on the other hand, had only changed into his military uniform and was bare-faced.\u201cHenry, why aren\u2019t you wearing a mask?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d look stupid.\u201dHenry turned away, scratching the back of his neck. Whether it was a rabbit mask, a bear mask, or a butterfly mask, it would be funny if he put it on. In addition, the dazzling blondes of the Reville family stood out even when disguised, so there was no particular point in wearing a mask.\u201cUncle, did you just say I\u2019m stupid?\u201d\u201cLayla, you\u2019re cute, so it\u2019s okay. I said I would look stupid if I wore it. What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid that the mask will block your vision.\u201d\u201cLayla! Why did you say that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sick. The doctor said it\u2019s not good to hide the symptoms. People around you should know so they can help.\u201d\u201c\u2026Does Walker have to know that?\u201dHenry bowed his head with a flushed face. As expected, Henry couldn\u2019t say a word against Layla.\u201cHenry is sick.\u201dLayla soon explained, pointing to the eyeholes of her mask.\u201cIf he wears a mask, he can only see through the eye holes. The rest is dark.\u201dRosen couldn\u2019t understand Layla\u2019s explanation. She glanced at Ian. Ian began to explain, ignoring Henry\u2019s earnest gaze telling him not to say anything.\u201cIt\u2019s common for your vision to narrow when you\u2019re in a fighter jet. Blood rushes to your head and your vision turns white. You have to withstand gravity several times that on the ground. There are a lot of people who just faint. It\u2019s probably reminiscent of that.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so anxious that you can\u2019t wear it?\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s sick.\u201dLayla and Ian answered at the same time. Looking at the firm attitude of the two, it seemed that he had shown many worrying symptoms so far. He couldn\u2019t climb high, he couldn\u2019t watch people die, and he couldn\u2019t even wear a mask.Maria\u2019s words were true. War could easily kill a man, and destroy a man with his limbs intact. Henry Reville was suddenly in a position to retire from active duty in his twenties.A question arose naturally. Ian Kerner flew a plane, but was he okay? Come to think of it, Ian\u2019s outfit was no more suitable for the party than Henry\u2019s. He was not wearing a mask, not even changing into casual fatigues. In addition, Ian Kerner also announced that he would resign as an active pilot. Was it because he was sick?\u201cIs Sir Kerner okay?\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean? Sir Kerner is sick?\u201dThe pitiful Henry desperately implored her.Rosen shrugged.\u201cNo, well, I\u2019m not saying that\u2026 I was just asking. After all, you both fought in the war, and Sir Kerner didn\u2019t change clothes or wear a mask. I was wondering if he couldn\u2019t wear a mask.\u201d\u201cSir Kerner is different from me.\u201dHenry shook his head confidently.\u201cDoes it make sense that Ian Kerner is sick? If so, what\u2019s left of the Empire? It wouldn\u2019t have been worth our victory.\u201dRosen felt it in Henry\u2019s words. Henry could endure being a disabled soldier, but he would not be able to withstand Ian Kerner suffering the aftermath of the war like he did.For Henry, who had abandoned his hometown, lost his sister, and sat in the ruins with his young niece in his arms, Ian Kerner was the only comfort left for him. A symbol that what he did was worth something, a testament to the noble sacrifice he made.After the long war, too many things were ruined. So, shouldn\u2019t there be at least one thing that hasn\u2019t been broken? Ian Kerner must not be broken. In fact, it was natural.But for a moment she thought that it was a rather cruel statement.Of course, Ian Kerner was standing right in front of her. But what if\u2026 if he was ill like Henry, but everyone around him believed he was okay, he would have to suffer in silence.Her worries were cut off by Ian\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s not against etiquette for a soldier to wear a military uniform to a banquet.\u201d\u201cOf course, but aren\u2019t you tired of that d*mn uniform, sir?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a suit. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need any other clothes while on a mission.\u201d\u201cBecause your heart is so tightly closed, even after the war ended, you never took a lover, let alone a fianc\u00e9. After all, this is a passenger ship, so why didn\u2019t you bring a suit for a party? Do you know when, where, and what kind of relationship you will find? No! And, if you\u2019re going to attend a party, you\u2019re going to interact with ladies from good families\u2026 you can\u2019t take a prisoner as your partner\u2026 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m a prison guard. If not me, who\u2019ll keep an eye on Rosen Haworth?\u201d\u201cWhat are you using me for? I can take her with me. Layla is not at the age where she really needs a partner.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t trust you.\u201d\u201cAh, those words again! I can\u2019t believe it! This morning\u2026 I\u2019m more anxious because you\u2019re not even married.\u201dHenry was bold enough to scold his boss. Rosen didn\u2019t know what happened between the two. Ian looked at her for a moment, sighed, then changed the subject.\u201cStop talking about marriage. It\u2019s not your place.\u201d\u201cBut it is. I\u2019m younger than you, Sir, and I have no intention of getting married because I have to raise Layla.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention either.\u201d\u201cNo, I wrote off marriage for reasons that everyone understands, while Sir Kerner is just clueless. Why don\u2019t you get married? Have a stable family and raise children-\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re nagging about such a useless subject. Shut up.\u201dRosen burst out laughing. It was fun to hear Henry nagging Ian like he was his older brother. Ian, who was expressionless, frowned as if he was suddenly bothered by Henry\u2019s nagging, and secretly grabbed her arm. It seemed to mean that they had to get out of the cabin.The moment Ian opened the cabin door, a cool night breeze blew in and scattered her hair. Layla grabbed Rosen\u2019s skirt and walked alongside her. Unlike the morning, the deck was crowded with people. Everyone was wearing masks and colorful clothes.It was still a long way from midnight when the party started, but the celebration was already in full swing. An orchestra with various instruments Rosen did not recognize were playing light music.Layla was already grabbing Henry\u2019s hand and dragging him to the table filled with snacks. Rosen was fascinated by the colorful scenery that suddenly unfolded before her eyes, and for a while, she was frozen.How could the world be such a colorful place?Prison was gray.Soon, the tension in her heart was relieved. To be honest, she was worried that someone would recognize her, but now, she didn\u2019t think anyone would. There were so many people, and everyone was half drunk. It was an atmosphere where no one would notice if a gorilla joined in and danced.Besides, the man standing next to her was Ian Kerner. Who would dare to imagine? That he freed a high profile prisoner and brought her to the party.Rosen gripped his arm tighter. She didn\u2019t expect the fact that he was inflexible to feel so reassuring. He looked down at the sudden touch. His voice rumbled lowly from above.\u201cDon\u2019t get too close. You\u2019ll look more suspicious.\u201d\u201cWhat happens if we get caught?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? I have nothing to lose, but you do. It\u2019s going to be really hard.\u201d\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t get caught.\u201dIt was uncharacteristic of him to answer unguardedly. She felt a little strange and looked up at him. It hit her once again; how annoying and troubling she was to him.She felt funny and strangely proud, so she looked at him and laughed. He stared at her smiling face and sighed. Rosen interpreted it as him saying that he didn\u2019t like the way she giggled casually, even in this situation.\u201cJust in case, don\u2019t answer anyone. Just nod your head. I\u2019ll take care of it, but-\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dRosen answered meekly. He looked tired already.She knew broadcasting didn\u2019t suit him, but not only that, but all the publicity must not have suited him. Ian, who was staring at the drunk people talking nonsense and singing whale songs, soon asked.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI do not know. I\u2019ve never been to a place like this before. What should I do first?\u201d\u201cWhatever you want to do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201dIan had the same expression as when she showed the dresses to him.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve attended Walpurgis\u2019 night. Even if you are not from the upper class, this festival is-\u201d\u201cI was always at home. Hindley really hated me going out. He was angry that I received food from another man when I went to the market! So I couldn\u2019t go out as I wanted.\u201dRosen brought up Hindley, fiddling with the red muffler he put around her.Ian Kerner would hate to admit it, but she was sure. Initially he was cold, but he took pity on her now. He believed the unfortunate marriage story she brought up last night. That\u2019s why he kept making exceptions, fulfilling her demands, and being soft in front of her. Even if it was an involuntary action.Of course there was a long way to go, but it was a good start. It was proof that she was a little more likely to win. Signs that a mouse hole was beginning to form in a wall that seemed solid.He awkwardly removed her hand from his arm and spun her around. Gray eyes scanned her up and down.\u201c\u2026You\u2019d better eat.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. Actually, I\u2019m going to faint from hunger. I threw up everything I ate. And drinks! I want to drink alcohol, too. You promised you\u2019d bring some.. I just couldn\u2019t drink it because Henry brought Layla.\u201dHe led her to where the food and kegs were located.Several people spoke to him, but Ian drove them away with a moderately polite smile and a gesture of refusal. Occasionally, some people wondered about the identity of the lady who became Ian Kerner\u2019s partner. Each time, he casually brushed them off, describing her as \u2018a relative of Henry Reville\u2019.Rosen thought there would be more persistent questions, so it was unexpected. She whispered to him.\u201cEveryone accepts it.\u201d\u201cBecause it happens often. I didn\u2019t have anyone to take me to the parties I had to attend, so the Revilles found me a suitable person.\u201dNo wife, no sister, no fianc\u00e9. He must have had to do that because he was bitter towards his relatives. It felt good to be thought of as a lady of Reville. Her hair was too dull to be called blonde, but it was close enough.No one approached him to see if his actual personality was different from that of the broadcast. Ian stopped in front of a faucet equipped wooden barrel. The barrels of liquor were piled up like a mountain. He opened his mouth.\u201cAre you going to drink all of this?\u201d\u201cDrinking booze until drunkenness is the driving force of the feast of St. Walpurg.\u201dHe grabbed an empty glass and answered, pouring red wine into it.Of course, she knew. Everyone said that the legendary witches drank so much that they couldn\u2019t control themselves and danced with the devil. Under the pretext of this legend, people drank red wine on the night of Walpurgis, woke up slowly the next day, sipped white wine all day long, and ate a lavish dinner. Only then did the festival end.There was a reason why the government failed despite all its efforts to create another festival to replace Walpurgis Night. No matter how hard they tried, a festival organized by old officials was bound to be patriotic and healthy. In short, not fun.A festival where everyone ate, drank, and danced for two days. How could you make a festival that stimulated instincts as honestly as this? The fact that it was originally a festival of witches added to the thrill. The fact that it touched taboos made people more excited and loosened discipline. It leads to the heat of the festival, which could even make you forget the cold.The day when a strict school teacher smiled and held the hands of her students, or the handsome bachelor, who was usually cold, kissed the woman he had a crush on. A night when everyone became a little honest.\u2018It\u2019s like magic.\u2019***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t let her choose any foods that required a knife to eat. It was clear that he wouldn\u2019t be fooled twice.Holding out her glass, he sat down with his arms crossed and stared at her expressionlessly. Just like last night, he had an impenetrable attitude.\u201cDrink.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t drink?\u201d\u201cHow could a prison guard drink during a shift?\u201d\u2018Sh*t.\u2019It wasn\u2019t going how she had planned. What\u2019s the use of all this if he didn\u2019t drink?\u201cD*mn, so prisoners can drink while in jail?\u201d\u201cYes. Because I allowed it.\u201dHe calmly retorted. She began to take small bites of her food while she threatened him.\u201cIf we don\u2019t drink together, I\u2019ll drink like an alcoholic. You won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d\u201cI can handle you. If you drink too much, it\u2019s your loss. You will only be wasting the time you have left.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have enough alcohol. This won\u2019t even fill my stomach.\u201d\u201cSay that again after you drink. It\u2019s piled up like a mountain over there.\u201dIan Kerner seemed to know everything about Rosen. It would have been less offensive if he had an open attitude, but his way of blocking her bluntly left her speechless.She thought he was acting a little withdrawn. She quickly became determined. She clenched her jaw and told a joke to disturb Ian\u2019s expressionless face.\u201cIs there no Maeria fruit wine? I want to drink it.\u201dUnsurprisingly, Ian\u2019s expression hardened immediately. It seemed to have reminded him of his emotions around the Maeria fruit incident. The fundamental reason for bringing her to the party.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou might find a bottle in the kitchen. It\u2019s a common drink.\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cI think there will be.\u201dRosen laughed, teasing him without much thought. He stared at her, closed his eyes, and replied in a repressed voice with unknown emotion.\u201cIts nowhere on this ship.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a drink that\u2019s often used for high-end parties. I\u2019m sure there is. Do you want to make a bet?\u201dRosen grumbled as she picked at her fish with a fork. He seemed really angry this time. His voice did not rise, but his forehead was wrinkled.\u201cIf you want to find it, you will have to swim to the bottom of the sea.\u201dAnd at Ian Kerner\u2019s words, Rosen almost dropped her fork.\u201cI threw it all into the sea. Wine, stewed fruit, raw fruit, everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhile you were unconscious.\u201dRosen wanted to scream. She started hiccuping because of the food she swallowed in a hurry.And she had to admit that she looked down on him too much.It was only then that she realized why Ian Kerner was assigned to be her guard. The government was not stupid. In order not to lose sight of a crazy prisoner, you have to assign a guard that\u2019s equally crazy.If you think about it, soldiers are innocent people doing crazy things. Ian Kerner wasn\u2019t any different.***Thanks to Hindley, Rosen had learned one thing. She was probably a good drinker. She had never drank with an ordinary person, so she added \u2018probably\u2019. When she escaped from prison, she drank with stupid guards, but those times, she drugged their glasses. But for sure, she always fell unconscious later than Hindley.Hindley was a drunkard. So, if she drank more than Hindley, was she not someone who could drink more than average?She picked up her glass and refilled it, glancing at Ian.\u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t drink?\u201dHe nodded his head firmly. In the end, she had no choice but to drink on her own. It would seem too suspicious to ask for alcohol and not drink it.\u201cYou don\u2019t normally drink, do you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHe had a knack for making any answer boring. To these types of questions you usually give a slightly richer answer, such as \u2018I don\u2019t like it very much\u2019, \u2018I drink sometimes\u2019, or \u2018I drink on special occasions\u2019.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you wouldn\u2019t drink at all. Soldiers drink like dogs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat, am I wrong?\u201dFeeling the hostility expressed in her words, Ian lifted his head and stared at Rosen quietly.\u2018I guess I provoked him again without realizing it.\u2019Actually, it wasn\u2019t something to be said to the face of a soldier.\u201cI am not insulting you or your colleagues. I\u2019ve never seen the Air Force. So, just other soldiers. The kids patrolling neighborhoods.\u201d\u201cAre you referring to the rear units of the army?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyway, they were wandering around Leoarton. Dogs and drunkards.\u201dAlthough Leoarton was not a battlefield, it was a military stronghold close to the Capital, Malona. As the war intensified, a military van, packed with young soldiers, entered the Leoarton military base. It became more common to see soldiers at the market and at the river where they did their laundry.The city had no separate facilities to accommodate soldiers. After a while, those who owned homes larger than a certain level were ordered to provide rooms for soldiers. Fortunately, Hindley was too sleazy to obey the order, and he was clever. He succeeded in bribing an administrative officer to remove their house from the list.It was one of the few useful things Hindley did. Emily and Rosen agreed on that. The soldiers who entered the city did not protect them like Ian Kerner said in the propaganda.They harassed village girls whenever they passed by, and they threw themselves into bars and drank day and night. When there was a fight, they would bring out pistols and threaten to massacre families.Every time Rosen saw it, she felt confident that they would lose the war.There was no way they could win.They were so messed up.Some might laugh. Even after seeing soldiers like that every day, Rosen believed that Ian Kerner would protect her. She needed to believe. Because her reality was too wretched.\u201cI thought we were going to lose after watching the little dogs running around in the streets.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut we won in the end, I know. Though I don\u2019t know how high-ranking people conduct themselves.\u201dThere was no God in this world, but miracles did happen sometimes. They achieved a victory no one expected. And in front of her sat the man who brought them that impossible victory.The only soldier she liked.\u201cDid you hate soldiers?\u201d\u201cI hate all soldiers except you. Even now.\u201d\u201c\u2026The enemy-\u201d\u201cNot just the enemy. I don\u2019t even like allies. I hate them all.\u201dAlly or enemy, it made no difference to Rosen. Ian Kerner said that soldiers fought to protect everyone, but she didn\u2019t think so.Neither of them lied. Ian and Rosen were just different.As your location changes, the scenery changes too.The soldiers she met never protected her.-Please don\u2019t send me back home. If I go back, I\u2019ll die! My husband-They never listened to her pleas.\u201cBut I\u2019ll take the Air Force out of it now. Your colleagues fought hard back then. I take your word for it.\u201dShe pushed away her memories and spoke to him as if she was being sympathetic.Ian, who was about to say something, bit his lip. He poured more wine into her glass. It was the fourth time. The alcohol made for Walpurgis Night was potent, but it was okay. Rosen was starting to feel a little excited, but she was in good spirits. She knew exactly how much she should drink. This was drunkenness that would get better with just 10 minutes of fresh air, even if she emptied the bottle.The problem was that the man sitting in front of her didn\u2019t care what kind of tricks she used to get drunk.But it was always worth trying. If she got it right, she could keep her mind intact. If she wasn\u2019t drunk, she had to pretend she was. If either one of them came to their senses, something would happen, either good or bad. Maybe he liked a drunk girl more than a sane one.\u2018What should I say?\u2019While she was contemplating, she was taken by surprise. He asked her in a low, quiet voice, as if reaching to the bottom of the sea.\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d\u201cAre you really asking that again?\u201d\u201c\u2026What was your decisive reason for killing Hindley Haworth?\u201d\u201cYou really are something. Aren\u2019t you tired of this?\u201d\u201cWas it accidental?\u201dRosen chuckled.She was stubborn wherever she went, but Ian Kerner was so stubborn that she admired him. Even in the midst of this, he asked \u2018Why did you kill him?\u2019 rather than \u2018Did you kill him?\u2019.\u201cWhy are you interrogating me? It\u2019s already over.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking even though it\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cD*mn it. What nonsense is that? I drank alcohol, but you\u2019re the one that\u2019s drunk. It\u2019s all over, so why do you ask?\u201d\u201cWhat you said was correct. Someone had to ask.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. So don\u2019t interrogate me anymore. Don\u2019t talk about it. I can\u2019t get used to your voice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you say something sweet in that interrogating voice, it sounds wrong. You know how to get me to talk.\u201d\u201cStop drinking.\u201dHe snatched the glass from her hand. He told her to drink as much as she wanted, but he suddenly changed his attitude. Rosen glared at him, grabbed the wine bottle, and drank from it.\u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI want an autograph. You\u2019ve signed a lot of them. The person who leads the fan club\u2026\u201dRosen had seen his signature. Some jailer had it. How prestigious it was to have one. Of course, she was jealous. She begged him to give it to her in exchange for a night together, but he turned her down coldly. Even if she received it, she wouldn\u2019t have a place to keep it.Surprisingly, his handwriting was free-spirited rather than neat. Pouty strokes and inconsistent pen pressure. Rosen thought it was very pilot-like writing.\u201c\u2026There is no paper.\u201d\u201cHah. That\u2019s a good excuse. Do it on my hand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know why you want it.\u201dShe liked him, but she knew she would have no confidence if she was criticized for overstepping her bounds. He really wasn\u2019t flexible.Why was the reason important?Rosen frowned and stuck out her right hand.\u201cBecause I love you.\u201dRosen spat out a raw word that wasn\u2019t refined. In fact, she could say it soberly, but she held it in because she thought he wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cI love you, Ian Kerner. So sign an autograph for me. If there\u2019s no paper, do it on my palm. Use a pen that won\u2019t erase easily. I\u2019ll die looking at it.\u201dIt seemed to surprise him enough. He had a quirky look on his face, similar to when she kissed him on the cheek. She noticed a pen in his front pocket beside his cigarette pack. She got up from her seat, pulled out the pen, and held it out to him.Ian hesitated for a moment and then slowly grabbed her hand. The pen tip began to move. The letters that made up his name were engraved on her palm one by one. She watched the famous war hero, serious about giving a prisoner an autograph.He likely wrote his name down countless times after the war.-You\u2019re a bit different from the broadcasts.-I wasn\u2019t cut out for that. It was hard.-Then why did you do it? Did they push you to?-I thought it was necessary.Rosen thought of the thousands of eyes that turned to him with envy, yearning, and anticipation. No matter how much she thought about it, he wasn\u2019t the type to accept the attention. It must have been burdensome and heavy. The war was too long to endure just by thinking it was \u2018necessary\u2019.Rosen was suddenly curious.\u2018We were comforted by seeing him, but what did he find comfort in?\u2019\u2018How did he endure it?\u2019He was also a human being.\u201c\u2026What did you do to endure the war?\u201dHis hand paused. Gray eyes examined her for a moment. But his tightly closed mouth didn\u2019t open. He didn\u2019t seem to want to answer. Rosen gave up asking questions. It was too difficult.\u201cYou must have needed something to motivate you. Ian Kerner must have needed an Ian Kerner. You can\u2019t even look in the mirror-\u201c\u201c\u2026I\u2019m done.\u201dThe pen fell from her palm as he let her hand go. Rosen frowned when she checked his handwriting.\u201cWhy are you making fun of me? This is not your name.\u201dShe showed her palm to him. Anger began to mount. This was cruel. She shouldn\u2019t be ridiculed in this way for not knowing how to write.He looked visibly perplexed.She didn\u2019t know how to write. She couldn\u2019t read a single book. But there was one word she could read. Only one. It wasn\u2019t something she learned, but a word that she had no choice but to recognize after seeing it over and over again.Ian Kerner.His name.\u201cThis is not your name! I can write your name. The only thing I can write is your name. How could you fool me like this?\u201dRosen gasped out of anger and snatched the pen from him. A tool that she had never held properly turned in her hand. But she didn\u2019t care. She pulled his hand to her and wrote his name. She was ashamed of the clumsy movement, but she saw it through until the end.She threw the pen at him when she was finished.Ian Kerner.\u201cDo you believe me now? I mean, I really like you. You just did something really cruel. Just because I\u2019m a prisoner, you-\u201c\u201c\u2026Your name.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRosen asked blankly. Ian answered slowly, making eye contact with her.\u201cYour name.\u201dThe anger that had soared within her subsided. She was dazed and a little embarrassed.\u201cWhy did you write my name?\u201dFor a long time, he didn\u2019t answer. He seemed unable to. She felt more and more strange. Only after an eternal silence did he come up with a reply.\u201c\u2026I just wanted to try it once.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201dHe sometimes acted like he didn\u2019t know how he felt. Maybe it was because she said she would look at his name while she died. Was it pitiful for a prisoner to die without knowing a single word? She looked at her palm silently.He wrote her name. The handwriting on her palm had an unfamiliar shape that she had never seen before.\u201cDid you write Rosen Haworth?\u201d\u201cRosen Walker.\u201d\u201cYou call me Haworth all the time. What a surprise.\u201dRosen realized that he had called her Walker for the first time. Of course, it was in text form. Still, it felt good to know that the writing on the palm of his hand was \u2018Walker\u2019, not \u2018Haworth\u2019.\u201cI thought you were making fun of me. You should have told me.\u201dIan wasn\u2019t looking at her when she looked up at him after reading it over and over again. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her clumsy handwriting.\u201cIs my handwriting weird? It\u2019s not like I wrote it, I drew it as I knew it. Would you like to erase it?\u201d\u201cLater.\u201dHe quickly cut her off. Rosen felt embarrassed by her sloppy print, so she picked up a tissue and approached him. She had no choice but to revise her plan to get back to him.The music that drifted across the deck ended. After the performers rested for a while, another piece began to play. This time, it was a song that she knew. \u2018The Witch\u2019s March\u2019.She emptied the bottle and got up from her seat. She couldn\u2019t sit still any longer. She had to move.Nothing changes if you stay still.Rosen tugged on Ian\u2019s sleeve.\u201cIan Kerner, dance with me.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter what crazy things you said, everyone accepted it. So, you could play around a little bit.\u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201dRosen reached out to Ian, listening to the music playing on the deck.She thought high-ranking people would only listen to noble music, but that was not the case. The Witch\u2019s March was an upbeat, fast, and mischievous folk song. Of course, dancing to it was not elegant. It was a polka dance, where you jumped around.Layla and Henry could be seen in the distance. The two were already laughing and fluttering around. The height difference was so great that it almost looked like Henry was holding Layla rather than dancing with her, but the scene seemed warm anyway.Rosen had always wanted someone to dance with like that. She used to be able to dance with Emily, but now she had no one by her side. Except for one person.He was her guard, but at this moment, he was the closest to her.But Ian Kerner didn\u2019t take her hand.\u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\u201cTo reject Lady\u2019s dance request, you\u2019re not a true gentleman. You\u2019re a scoundrel.\u201dShe imitated Alex Reville\u2019s tone and criticized him. Ian put on an absurd expression. He looked like he didn\u2019t know how to deal with this foreign creature. Rosen laughed out loud and gently grabbed the back of his neck so that he would face her. He spoke again.\u201cRosen Haworth, you\u2019re drunk.\u201dHe spat out more confidently, grabbing her hand subtly. It was an indication that she should return to the cabin.\u2018No, I can\u2019t be dragged away like this. I haven\u2019t looked around the deck yet.\u2019\u201cI can control my drunkenness. I\u2019m fine.\u201dThe corners of her mouth rose. Actually, she was a bit drunk. But she swore she wasn\u2019t crazy. That was because she was trying to calm herself down.\u201cIf I could, I\u2019d record what you\u2019re saying and let you hear it again tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s say I\u2019m drunk. I drink to get drunk. Come on! Let\u2019s dance!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t dance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the worst excuse I\u2019ve ever heard. If you told any other Lady that, you\u2019d be slapped.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m not a Lady, I\u2019m a rat, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019He shook his head with a puzzled expression.\u201cIt\u2019s really true. I can only dance to the waltz.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do with that face for so long?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for almost a decade. The academy only taught waltz.\u201d\u201cOh my God. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have a lover.\u201dHe was not good at lying, and it seemed like the truth. After all, he didn\u2019t seem to enjoy noisy places. He was the kind of person who\u2019d go home after a single dance with his partner, only keeping up formal etiquette.She raised her eyebrows and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t dance. You\u2019re just bad at it, right? So you wouldn\u2019t hate dancing with me?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t answer easily because she was so full of energy. Well, he didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t like it, so it didn\u2019t matter. She took a quick step before he came to his senses and flatly refused her offer.\u201cThen we can just wait for a waltz to play.\u201dHe was drawn to her quietly. His military uniform wrinkled as it pressed against her dress. All of a sudden, she grabbed Ian\u2019s arm and waded through the narrow tables into an open space. They were amidst a crowd of drunken people.She squinted and looked around. But Ian Kerner was irksomely thorough. He checked every inch of her sight. He seemed like he was trying to determine whether her gaze was staying in one place to the point of being suspicious.Thanks to that, she couldn\u2019t look for the lifeboat that Alex Reville told her about.\u2018D*mn it, I should\u2019ve gotten him drunk.\u2019\u201cWhat are you looking at? Are you looking at another woman?\u201dRosen reached out and grabbed Ian Kerner\u2019s face as he followed her gaze. He was no longer surprised. He seemed to have gotten used to her actions. He raised his eyebrows and answered her seriously.\u201cI only see you.\u201d\u201cLies.\u201d\u201c\u2026Who else would I look at but you? There is no one here more suspicious than you.\u201d\u201cSince you don\u2019t have an answer, say you\u2019re looking at me because I\u2019m the prettiest. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll get a girlfriend.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say things like that.\u201dWhat did he mean, please? She was doing Ian Kerner a favor. She burst into laughter, and to distract him, she turned to the band and pointed to a brown instrument that emitted a beautiful sound.\u201cI know that. It\u2019s an instrument called a cello, right?\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it before. The military band played in Leoarton Square.\u201dShe explained excitedly, although he didn\u2019t even ask how she, a low class person, knew the name of such an instrument.\u201cEmily taught me. In fact, almost everything I know was taught to me by Emily. To be honest, I didn\u2019t learn how to save Layla from Hindley.\u201dIt was nice to be able to talk to someone about Emily. It had been a long time since she could do this. Throughout the trial, she did not say a word about Emily. She was afraid that Emily would get caught up in the incident if she said anything.She spat out more gibberish. How they spent Walpurgis nights, baking cakes and making wishes. How precious that time was to her. And other trivial stories. No one cared, and it didn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re from Leoarton, too. Have you ever visited Leoarton Square on the night of Walpurgis?\u201d\u201cI went there every year. The military academy made us march.\u201d\u201cI went once. Just once.\u201dBefore marrying Hindley, she was in an orphanage. That year, a man who was particularly concerned with charity was elected mayor. The orphanage nanny woke them up early in the morning, washed them thoroughly, gave them clean clothes, and took them to Leoarton Square. She saw the festival for the first time then.Lights, happy people, and delicious food.The older kids screamed at the cadets in uniform, but as a child, she was so obsessed with the lights and the food that she didn\u2019t even look at them. She regretted it all over again. If she had come to her senses at that time and looked around properly, she might have seen a younger him, even if it was from a distance.\u201cSo you were there, too. If I asked you to dance with me, what would you have said? Would you have refused because I was a dirty orphan girl?\u201dIan Kerner and Rosen Haworth were both from the East. It was ironic, but maybe it was fate. Even when they didn\u2019t know each other, they spent their time in the same city, and when they were apart, they knew about each other through newspapers and propaganda.\u201cWe were in the same place that day. No, we\u2019ve often been in the same place. Before I went to jail.\u201dHe let her talk freely. She didn\u2019t know if he was listening, or if it was going in one ear and out the other, but she spat out the words that piled up in her heart anyway. She thought it would be nice if he listened, and it was okay if he let it go.\u201cThat person, Emily Haworth\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is the Emily you spoke of now?\u201d\u2018Oh, he listens to me much more than I thought.\u2019Come to think of it, it was like that from the beginning. But in the end, it turned out to be a dangerous question. He sat down and asked again.\u201cWhy were you left alone\u2026?\u201dHe trailed off. She knew how many questions that question raised. How did Emily, unlike her, disappear safely? Maybe they were accomplices. Maybe, just maybe\u2026 but she didn\u2019t blame Emily.Rosen just shook her head.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dIf he asked her if Emily killed Hindley, Rosen would say no. The same went for asking why she killed him.But to this question, she couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cThis is an important question. I don\u2019t understand why this never came up in court.\u201d\u201cEmily didn\u2019t kill Hindley, and I don\u2019t know anything about her whereabouts.\u201d\u201cThe outcome of the trial could have changed. Maybe even now-\u201dHe questioned with his eyes as if he knew there was something she didn\u2019t say.\u201cIt\u2019s over. Stop it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know anything about her. Don\u2019t question me. Don\u2019t even look into it. You can\u2019t squeeze out an answer from a person who doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201dShe cut off his words sharply. She didn\u2019t understand why Ian\u2019s expression hardened when she was the one who should be angry.\u2018If you feel bad for me, just listen to me. Why do you want to dig up a trial that\u2019s been decided?\u2019Just a few days ago, he said that it was all over with his own mouth.Rosen slightly regretted bringing up Emily. She was skeptical as to why Ian was suddenly interested in her.She didn\u2019t want him to believe her. She didn\u2019t even want him to figure out what was right and wrong. It didn\u2019t mean anything and it was just annoying. The only thing she wanted from him was pity. Pity for her. So he would show her where the key was.\u201cAnd don\u2019t get mad at me. I can\u2019t get used to your anger. Why do you keep getting mad at me? You said you don\u2019t mix emotions with your work.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been angry.\u201d\u201cNo, you get mad at me often.\u201dRosen scolded him like a child. He looked at her with an expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you.\u201dHe seemed hesitant, and then he asked.\u201c\u2026How do you want me to treat you?\u201dSuddenly, his expression softened. No matter how stupid she was, she could tell that it was an unusual question. Because that was never something a guard would say to a prisoner. She was certain that his heart had weakened. She saw a glimmer of hope.She grabbed Ian\u2019s hand and responded.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we met, but treat me like a friend from your hometown who said that they have a few days left to live. Since you and I are both from Leoarton.\u201dEven though her tongue twisted and her pronunciation was muffled, she smiled at him. He looked down at her with eyes filled with unknown emotion.The music stopped and the band turned over their sheet music. At that moment, the ship swayed in the waves. People screamed joyfully and embraced each other.Ian unconsciously caught her. Taking advantage of that moment, she hugged him by the waist. She felt his body stiffen. He didn\u2019t hug her genuinely, but he didn\u2019t push her away either.Yes, this was enough.She didn\u2019t expect anything more. She hugged him tighter, like a child seeking warmth. Words like sighs echoed in her ears.\u201cRosen, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d\u2018Boring idiot!\u2019\u2018Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m hopelessly drunk?\u2019She wanted to scream at him like Alex Reville. She lifted her head, which had been buried in his chest, and groaned.\u201cOh, yeah! I\u2019m drunk. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to die anyway. You give alcohol to soldiers and death row inmates, right? I never thought that if I were to die, I\u2019d die in such a good mood.\u201dA long time ago, in a war older than the one he had fought\u2026 The government said they gave dr*gs to soldiers so that they would not fear death. She wondered if they still did something so savage, so she asked him.\u201cHave you ever done dr*gs?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dOf course. He was someone who would throw it away even if the government gave it to him.\u201cThe military hospital prescribes dr*gs, right? Or something like that. Sleeping candles too. Do you have poison? Why do soldiers carry such things? Is it so you can\u2019t be captured and tortured by the enemy?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that again?\u201dShe thought the question might be too suspicious, so she grabbed his arm.\u201cI know you feel sorry for me right now. Can you give me what you have?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you-\u201dHis voice was about to rise again. She knew what he was thinking. And she knew what he was trying to say. So she cut off his words and muttered.\u201cI\u2019ll keep my promise. I won\u2019t kill myself on the boat, so give me what you have. When I get to Monte Island, I\u2019ll die there. Then there\u2019s no problem. You complete your mission, and I have a comfortable end. How about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you felt sorry for me. Do you want my last days to be painful?\u201dThat was a lie.She had no intention of dying at all. This was just a question to gnaw at his insides. She wanted to break that calm expression in some way and give her a chance. But she got a strange feeling. She thought it was because she was drunk.From the moment she first saw him, his gray eyes, whose temperature couldn\u2019t be gauged, captured her.\u2018Is that really all?\u2019\u2018These are all calculated lies, with none of my feelings mixed into them at all?\u2019\u201cDo you hate me that much? Do you really, truly hate me?\u201dShe realized it at once. Answering that he didn\u2019t hate her that much\u2026 she was hoping to hear it. She was asking for an answer that she knew she wouldn\u2019t get.She was afraid to see his expression, so she pretended to be drunk again. She hugged him and covered her eyes.Be careful.Cats didn\u2019t know it, but mice were never sincere.For a mouse, lack of vigilance was death.She closed her eyes for a moment and made up her mind.She clenched her teeth and drove away as much drunkenness as possible, then looked at him again with a cold heart.But at that moment, a hand touched her back. His hand gently embraced her and began to pat her clumsily. His voice tickled her ear.\u201cNo one will believe it, but\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI never hated you.\u201d\u2018But you never liked me.\u2019He was likely looking at her with indifferent eyes. She laughed quietly. Still, his voice sounded quite sweet, perhaps because of her drunkenness. So she decided to stay mistaken.It was a magical night, and all of this was momentary anyway.\u201cThank you for telling me that.\u201dHis hand gently stroked her back. She cherished the warmth and whispered to Ian Kerner, who had been her comfort for so long.\u201cIt\u2019s okay even if it\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s nice to hear that. Not many people have told me that.\u201dAlthough the waltz began, they didn\u2019t dance and just kept holding each other.***Hi guys, as you know we are a free to read website and we only survive on ads.

Ian pushed her hand away. Rosen gripped the hem of his robe with regret.It wasn\u2019t until she was separated from him that she realised it. Even though it was only for a short time, how great it felt that he gave his arms to her.Rosen felt really great about herself, even though it fell short of her grand plans.Ian hugged her. If Henry found this out, he\u2019d riot, right?Rosen looked at him triumphantly.\u201cYou\u2019re regretting it now, aren\u2019t you? Hugging me. You\u2019re such a boring person that you\u2019ve never been selfish. You\u2019ve never told a lie or done something you shouldn\u2019t do, right?\u201c\u2026 Do I look that way?\u201d\u201cYes. But don\u2019t worry too much. It\u2019s not like the world is going to fall apart. Your boring, painful, and long life must have at least one magical day. Think about it. Have you ever had a day like that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. Then think about today as such a day.\u201dAfter spitting it out, she felt ridiculous. To ridicule a war hero as a mere jail breaker\u2026A faint smile appeared on his sculptural face as if it was funny. Rosen raised the corners of her lips, mimicking him.\u2018A person of no merit made Ian Kerner laugh.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s more handsome when he smiles.\u2019She was willing to be a clown for that face. She could see why the generals selected him to advertise to the public. It was a face that shouldn\u2019t be hidden or hoarded. Whether it was during war or peace, it should be used as a poster and distributed across the country.As it turned out, people\u2019s sense of beauty was the same. Rosen soon realized they were in the spotlight. To be precise, \u2018Ian Kerner\u2019 was attracting attention.She looked around and whispered.\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble. Everyone\u2019s looking at us. Maybe it\u2019s because you hugged me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. They\u2019ll find something else to gawk at soon.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t they just looking at you?\u201dShe pointed to the ladies looking at him with eyes that seemed to want to eat him alive. Were their eyes coveting this beautiful jewel?He tended to be overly blunt about everything. If he wasn\u2019t tired of being savvy, he would have become the biggest playboy in the Empire.\u201cIt\u2019s such a waste. If it weren\u2019t for me, you could have had a hot night on this romantic day.\u201dShe said with a soft smile. It was a sentence with two meanings. One was making fun of him because he missed the great opportunity to enjoy Walpurgis Night because of her. The other was asking him to spend the night with her.But he just stared at her with puzzled eyes and didn\u2019t show any reaction. She got a strange feeling from the silence.She beckoned him closer. He coolly bent his waist to meet her eye level.Rosen asked in a serious voice.\u201cHave you ever slept with a woman? I heard you\u2019re 30 years old.\u201dHe blocked her question right away.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying.\u201dBut unfortunately, she came to realize the truth in that expression and tone of voice. Her guess became a certainty.\u201cNo, really? How\u2019s that possible? Are you lying?\u201d\u201cI said it was annoying.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. Really!\u201dWithout realizing it, her voice increased in volume. Ian quickly covered her mouth.Rosen didn\u2019t scream anymore, because it was clearly her mistake. Her voice, unlike her face, was unknown to the Empire, but even so, she was not allowed to act in a needlessly conspicuous manner.\u201cOkay. Sorry, I\u2019ll be quiet. Get your hands off me.\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t help it. It was so weird. To be honest, she was more surprised by his inexperience than the heroic story of how he shot down several enemy airships with incredible skill. She knew how mean and beastly men could be on the battlefield. From the moment they grew a few hairs on their chest, they were anxious to show their masculinity in any way possible.Of course, she didn\u2019t think Ian Kerner acted like the playboys who roamed Leoarton, but she didn\u2019t expect such a handsome man to have spent nearly a decade as a celibate.\u201cDo you have an STD?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDo you like men?\u201dThat shouldn\u2019t be the case.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOr are you a eunuch*? Maybe it doesn\u2019t stand up?[*E/N: In feudal times, eunuchs were castrated so they could serve in women\u2019s courts without the fear of assault or affairs]\u201c\u2026We\u2019re going back.\u201dPerhaps since he was accustomed to her rude words, he only grimaced and wasn\u2019t very angry. Rosen stopped being scared and just started talking. It was only then that she found out why Hindley often drank.It was a magical liquid. She didn\u2019t know because she had never drunk like this. That drunkenness created unfounded courage.It felt as if she had become a big, mighty giant. She felt like she could throw that big man down at once. She giggled and leaned forward, blocking his view.Rosen lost her balance and stumbled against a table. Glasses rattled. Had it not been for the wits of our proud war hero, she would have had another accident.\u201cBe careful-\u201d\u201cShall I take it off?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you meant by asking a woman to go to your cabin?\u201dA look of embarrassment formed on his face as he held her. Ian couldn\u2019t seem to grasp the words that came out of her mouth. She laughed at his reaction and grabbed her stomach.\u201cGive it a try. You\u2019re not even curious? You only live once, you never know when you will die\u2026 Live the way you want to right now. I heard it\u2019s really good if you do it. It\u2019s like flying in the sky.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s not necessary. You\u2019ve really flown in the sky. You\u2019re a pilot.\u201dShe sighed deeply.\u201cYou\u2019re completely gone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not drunk!\u201dIan didn\u2019t even pretend to listen. He grabbed her wrist, lifted her up, and led her towards the cabin. Rosen staggered helplessly, reduced to a marionette doll in his arms. It was a strange feeling. There was a time when Hindley swung her around like this, but now it felt completely different. Rather than being afraid or frightened, she kept laughing.It was like dancing with him. Instead of being dragged away, she bent her knees and sat on the floor. This stopped him.\u201cStand up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m not going. If you take me back now, I\u2019ll know it means you want to sleep with me.\u201dSomeone, who must have been out of their mind like her, sprinkled colored paper onto the deck from the second floor. Small pieces landed in her hair and got tangled. She quietly closed her eyes.She had already lost her sense of reality. She was sure she could have come to her senses a while ago, but not now.She was behaving recklessly. She always told herself she should remember that grey prison scenery and stay alert, but what filled her dark eyes was the scenery of the happiest day and brilliant colors of the festival.\u201cI want to see Emily.\u201dThe strength in his hand decreased as the words came out of her mouth.He paused for a long time with a face not knowing what to do, then he finally let go of her hand and squatted down next to her.\u201cIf you\u2019re drunk, let\u2019s go in quietly. Please. Don\u2019t make me regret doing you a favor.\u201dAlthough it was worded as a command, it was actually a plea, not an order. Rosen laughed because his face, not knowing what to do, was funny.\u201cDo you regret releasing me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m about to. Don\u2019t make it that way.\u201d\u201cOh, okay. I won\u2019t make fun of you. But you really can\u2019t take a joke.\u201d\u201cYou have a knack for making a joke not sound like one.\u201d\u201cI got this!\u201dRosen giggled, following his stern tone. She grabbed a glass from a passing waiter\u2019s tray and drank it all at once. Ian didn\u2019t try to stop her anymore. It seemed like he had already given up. Perhaps he realized that it would be more convenient to leave her like this, to make her lose her mind, and then toss her in the cabin.He supported her and made her sit on a soft chair on one side of the deck. Rosen struggled to maintain her focus.Since this was the head of the ship, turn right and walk five more steps to a lifeboat. Find the ladder and lower it.Rosen went over it again and again in her mind. How to escape Ian Kerner\u2019s cabin quietly like a shadow, and the fastest way to get here. Calmly turn the lever to lower the lifeboat\u2026Damn, her imagination stopped at the most important part. Because she didn\u2019t have the key to get the lifeboat\u2019s engine running. Should she even try to cross the sea full of beasts? She looked at his belt as she hugged him earlier, but the key to the lifeboat was nowhere to be found, let alone the key to her handcuffs.\u201cSir Kerner, I wish you were a little more stupid. Like the guards of Al Capez.\u201d\u201cSleep. I will watch over you.\u201d\u201cThen I would have been able to live.\u201dContrary to her head, which was still spinning, her mouth did not listen. He seemed to want her to sleep as quietly as last night, but there was no way she could let that happen.After two more nights passed, she would have no more chances.Whenever the cold sea breeze hit her face, drowsiness fled her like a leak. She was able to be as clear as she wanted before long. Unlike Ian and Rosen, who sat awkwardly and stiff in silence, other \u2018normal\u2019 partners were enjoying the festival.\u201cIt looks like fun. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t die before the war ended. I wanted to see the world again. A world without guns and air strikes.\u201dIn the midst of such an intense thought, she was fascinated by the scenery before her eyes. It was inevitable.She had never had such a peaceful moment in her life. It was not because she was a prisoner. Ian Kerner dedicated his twenties to the battlefield. They were both the so-called new generation of war\u2026 the spring of their lives was stained with blood and gunfire.\u201cSir Kerner, what do you think about this peaceful world? Are you happy? It\u2019s like you achieved it with your own hands.\u201dThe war ended while she was in prison. It was when she was imprisoned again after a second failed escape.Even now she remembered. The day the victory message reached even a solitary Al Capez cell. At the time, as directed by the prison warden, she was confined to a cell with only a toilet bowl, and the guards brought in a radio with meals daily.Rosen was on the verge of losing her mind wanting to hear a human voice. Even the barking of a dog would be okay. She wanted to feel something other than the four grey walls around her. So, she turned on the radio with trembling hands, ignoring her meal.[We won.]There was no need to change the frequency. His voice was broadcasted on all channels.[Fellow citizens of the Empire, we have won.]Does he know?Even her, who used to grind her teeth to destroy this d*mned country, cried a little after hearing the broadcast. It was even his voice, which she had missed, that delivered the victory message\u2026 And she, too, wanted to wave the flag like a loyal Imperial citizen that day.\u201cHow did you feel when you said we won?\u201d\u201cI was happy.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201dIt was a seemingly insincere answer. She glanced at him. But he did not notice and answered again.\u201cI was like that back then.\u201d\u201cNot now?\u201dHe looked at her in silence, neither affirming nor denying. He soon took a cigarette out of his pocket, put it in her mouth, and lit it for her. As expected, he was a man who knew how to make anyone \u2018stop and shut up\u2019 gracefully. She was a cigarette-addicted prisoner, so she gave up prying as he intended and inhaled smoke.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dIt was then.As her cigarette turned into a butt, and as Rosen began to stare greedily at his pack of cigarettes, a stranger approached them.***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads.

She almost fainted when the man reached out to her with a soft smile.\u201cLady, are you Sir Ian Kerner\u2019s partner?\u201d\u201cYes, Sir Gregory.\u201dIan intercepted the man and answered. He stood up and hid her behind his back, strangely tense. She let go of a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. Ian must know him.\u201cCan we be introduced, Sir Kerner?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s Henry Reville\u2019s acquaintance-\u201c\u201cHow many single girls are there in the Reville family? But this time, she seems to be close to Sir Kerner. Lady, this is rare. As you know, Sir Kerner has a dirtier personality than he appears, and he never treats his partner as friendly as he does you.\u201dSir Gregory grinned softly and spat out thorny words. Unless they were an idiot, anyone would have noticed his malice. Ian\u2019s expression also hardened. It certainly didn\u2019t look like they were close.Seeing that they called each other \u2018Sir\u2019, this person was also from the military, but it didn\u2019t seem like he was higher than Ian. They looked similar in age\u2026 Was he from the same military academy class?\u201cCan\u2019t you speak?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr maybe you are shy. If you\u2019re done dancing with Sir Kerner, why don\u2019t you dance with me?\u201dWhy was he picking a fight? What if she really couldn\u2019t speak? Rosen was bewildered and regained her reason. Her voice was not as known as her face, because no one wanted to hear the voice of a witch. She relaxed and tried to speak as naturally as possible.\u201cI don\u2019t dance with men unless they\u2019re better looking than Sir Kerner.\u201dIt was an outright denial, but Sir Gregory only laughed. He had a personality that Rosen really disliked.\u201cYou are a funny lady. If you\u2019re a Lady of the Revilles, I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about. What\u2019s your name?\u201dShe hurriedly threw Ian a desperate glance.What should she do? A cold sweat ran down her back. As her mind raced, Sir Gregory took the cigarette that was in her mouth, put it into his, and reached out to her.\u201cLet\u2019s get to know each other slowly by dancing. I don\u2019t think Sir Kerner is narrow-minded enough to chain his partner to his side at such a delightful festival.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t just keep dancing with one partner. Etiquette goes against it.\u201d\u2018What is he up to? Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s noticed who I am.\u2019Sir Gregory grabbed her by the arm, ignoring Ian, who stood in the way. He didn\u2019t look very big, but his grip was no joke. She was worried that he would leave a bruise on her arm.As soon as Sir Gregory\u2019s hand touched her body, Ian pushed him roughly.\u201cJoshua Gregory, don\u2019t pick a fight and go. Didn\u2019t you hear me say no?\u201dAs expected, he wanted to pick a fight.Ian immediately dropped all formalities, throwing away the possibility of politeness. It seemed that Joshua being rude was not uncommon. Ian looked more fed up than angry at his behavior.Ian gently pushed her back onto the sofa. Rosen sat quietly and watched their fight because she knew he would deal with it.\u201cYou drank too much alcohol, go back to your cabin and sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Look, I\u2019m the bully again. It was always like that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me upset, go.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re pretending to be a gentleman again. You\u2019re the only one who always succeeds, and you\u2019re the one who\u2019s always right. Stop staring at people with those contemptuous eyes. It\u2019s disgusting and annoying.\u201dIan Kerner was rather inhumane, but he wasn\u2019t unlucky. And those who were despised by him, she thought, had good reason to be. He was a good man. He wasn\u2019t a murderer, a traitor, or someone suspicious\u2026 just like her.So that seemed like an ugly and unnecessary statement of inferiority.\u201cYou\u2019ve done something like that.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do? Oh, I ran away? Is that still the story? Is there anyone who doesn\u2019t think that was a really wise choice?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of honor if you die? I made a wise choice. Now, look, all the boys in your squad who didn\u2019t run away are dead, and their remains have become fish food. You\u2019re a lonely hero.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when stealing the spotlight from the dead became a good thing. Enough to get drunk and shout out loud? Shame on you. You ran away, and the cadets younger than you\u2013\u201c\u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re so great. Look at the results. Who made the wise decision? All the children who didn\u2019t escape are dead, and Henry Reville, who barely survived, is half stupid!\u201dThe man who looked fine when he approached was actually quite intoxicated. As his sentences grew longer, his pronunciation began to slur. His eyes couldn\u2019t focus and were constantly moving around. The two started arguing, using terms she couldn\u2019t understand.She hoped Ian wouldn\u2019t get hurt. She knew from experience how sensitive Ian was about his dead colleagues. Sure enough, Ian wanted to grab him by the neck and slap him, but it was because of her that he was putting up with it.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIan, tired of dealing with Joshua, quietly tried to get Rosen up from her seat.\u201cWho the hell is that woman that you pamper so much?\u201dBut they must have been too careless. There was never any guarantee that Joshua would be paralyzed just because he was drunk. Joshua grabbed at her mask suddenly.\u201cLet\u2019s see your face.\u201dJust as her eyes were about to be revealed, Ian pulled her into his arms and punched Joshua. It was so instantaneous and reflexive that she didn\u2019t process what happened.\u2018Did he just punch Joshua and embrace me?\u2019When she woke up from her daze, she found herself in his arms, and noticed Joshua lying on the deck.And her mask was still safely attached to her face. She breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cShe is a Lady of the Revilles. Do not be rude.\u201d\u201c\u2026What did you do now? How could you-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over. If Alex or Henry Reville saw what you were doing, they would have put a bullet in your jaw, not a fist.\u201dEyes were on them in an instant, but those who were drunk only giggled at the sight of Joshua being beaten. In fact, even if he was not drunk, it was obvious who people would side with if they fought. Ian Kerner was a much-loved war hero, and this ship was the Reville\u2019s.Ian was right. If he wanted to fight, then he picked the wrong place. Even if Joshua was the Emperor of the Empire, it would not have been very wise to argue with Ian Kerner here.Ian picked Rosen up like a child and started to walk away while holding her.She knew what Ian was doing now was running away. It was just that his actions were so calm and relaxed that it didn\u2019t look like running away at all.He embraced her and was now running away from those oppressing gazes.Rosen muttered as she hugged him.\u201cThere are times when you act more unassuming than you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026I do it in consideration of others. There is no need to deal with such a low-class person.\u201d\u2018Anyway, if you hug me, it\u2019s good for me.\u2019She asked, resting her chin on his shoulder.\u201cBut who is that guy? Is he your friend?\u201d\u201cClassmate.\u201d\u201cIs he a pilot too?\u201d\u201cI wish he wasn\u2019t, but yes.\u201d\u201cCan you hit him like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cMaybe he found out who I am?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not that smart.\u201dShe really wanted to see the expression Joshua was making at this moment. She liked to see sloppy men showing their ignorance and being humiliated. But Ian Kerner never gave up. Every time she tried to lift her head slightly, he tightened his arms around her.\u201cYou\u2026 you are different.\u201dJoshua\u2019s voice echoed from behind. Ian\u2019s steps slowed to a stop.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you stole the spotlight from the dead? What\u2019s so special about you that you can look at me like that? You\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve held out so far, but you won\u2019t be able to hold your head high anymore. Who has the nerve to destroy their hometown and brazenly walk down the path of victory?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you\u2019re broken too. As bad as Henry Reville. Soon, everyone will understand. That Ian Kerner didn\u2019t really protect anything.\u201dAt that moment, Ian\u2019s body hardened. Contrary to what Ian had just said, \u2018There is no need to deal with such a low-class person\u2019, he seemed agitated by Joshua\u2019s words. He hugged her tighter.She felt weird. Ian seemed to have been hurt by Joshua\u2019s bullsh!t. He was holding her with as much force as she clung to him, as if she was the only treasure he had rescued from the ruins. Like he was afraid she would slip away.Ian Kerner did not dispute his childish accusations. It made sense, but she was frustrated. Rosen wanted to shout at Joshua over his bullsh!t on Ian\u2019s behalf. She was better than Ian in petty quarrels. And if she had been in a good position, she would have done so.She whispered into Ian\u2019s ear.\u201cYou care, do you? People like that think they\u2019re the most pitiful people in the world. That\u2019s why they go around blaming people when they drink.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven Hindley thought he was the most pitiful person in the world. I comforted him when he was drunk. Funny, right?As expected, she had no talent for comforting people. The words that came out of her mouth were probably hurtful for him to hear. He looked at her quietly, and began to walk again.Ian sometimes touched her so gently. It was a different feeling from being scoured with a sticky hand. He sometimes treated her like she was a girl of Layla\u2019s age.It wasn\u2019t very good for her. But at this moment, she thought it was fortunate. She didn\u2019t know if such a handsome person needed comfort, but she knew most people needed something to hug at times.Ian Kerner was a man without a lover, let alone a fianc\u00e9e, and had grown too big to hug his parents or play. She remembered her childhood days when she had nothing to hold and hugged a pillar. Even though she was a skinny, cold prisoner, she longed to be hugged by something, anything. She was a human after all. A person like him, with blood pumping through her veins and warmth.\u201cI heard he ran away earlier, is he a b*stard deserter?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the son of a general. He fled to Talas and returned after the war.\u201d\u201cHe is a cowardly traitor. But will the military leave him alone? Aren\u2019t they going to shoot him?\u201d\u201cI told you, he is the son of a general.\u201dRosen immediately understood his meaning.\u2018What a rotten world!\u2019\u201cWhy do you care about what he says?\u201dAfter a moment, an answer came back. His voice was hoarse.\u201cBecause he\u2019s not wrong.\u201dIt was only then that Rosen realized that he hadn\u2019t let Joshua\u2019s words slip from his mind. She was speechless for a moment and even forgot her plight of having to betray him. She knew it wasn\u2019t for her to say, but\u2026\u201cYou should have hit him more.\u201d\u201cIf you weren\u2019t there, I probably would have.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just jealousy. You are good-looking, have acquired a lot of renown, and have a high rank. You\u2019re not even a general\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s jealous, it\u2019s that he hates me.\u201d\u201cNo one deserves to hate you. At least not in this Empire. The whole Empire hates me, but you are a hero.\u201dThere are things in the world that are unavoidable. We always have to make a choice. That was a fact that she was well aware of as she never stepped across the threshold of a school and couldn\u2019t read a single character. There is no one who can keep everything and no one who can achieve everything. The same went for Ian Kerner.Because he was just a human. And he made the right choice. Henry was right.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t talk like that, Rosen Haworth.\u201dIt was a pity that their intellectual levels were so different that they sometimes couldn\u2019t understand each other, like now. What was he telling her not to say? Was he saying not to call him a hero? But he was a hero.Or was it that the whole Empire hated her? But that was an obvious fact.He added a few words rather hastily after she became quiet, as if he wanted to explain something.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that there are people who hate me, but I don\u2019t know why you believe so adamantly that everyone in the world hates you.\u201d\u2018Because I\u2019m not a fool.\u2019She was sensible enough to be able to distinguish between empty words and sincerity.\u201cWho in the Empire likes me?\u201d\u201cThere are people.\u201d\u201cHave you seen such a person?\u201d\u201cYeah, I saw it myself.\u201dShe asked, smirking and fiddling with his hair. She didn\u2019t know why their conversation had shifted to such an uninteresting topic. It was not that important at all. She asked bluntly.\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t hate me either. Then\u2026 do you like me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSee? You can\u2019t answer, can you?\u201dIan set her down as gently as he had lifted her up. They were back in the corner full of kegs. The ship was very noisy as the fireworks display was being prepared, the highlight of the Walpurgis Festival.Thanks to this, no one came to the corner of the deck, where kegs blocked the view. It was a good place to hide.\u201cLet\u2019s go back. You\u2019re very drunk, and we\u2019ve been out too long.\u201dShe was wondering when he would put his foot down. She grinned and pointed towards the direction they came.\u201cLet\u2019s just watch the fireworks. That\u2019s okay, right? There\u2019s no one here.\u201dTime was running out. Watching the fireworks gave her enough time to find another excuse. She already knew he would allow it. As Ian said, he had already done her too many favors. It was too late to act the way he did when they first met.Again, Ian nodded his head. This time he didn\u2019t even resist.She sat down on the cold deck. It was only after she sat down that she realized she was wearing an expensive dress.\u201cOh right. sorry. This must be expensive\u2026\u201d\u201cJust sit down.\u201dRosen glanced at him and tried to get up, but Ian took off his coat. He spread half of his coat on the floor like a blanket, and draped the rest around her shoulders. She felt like a princess, so she smiled excitedly.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cYou always look cold. So I gave it to you.\u201dThe sound of the music stopped for a moment, as if the fireworks were ready to be launched. There was a commotion on the second-floor deck, and the first firecrackers finally went up in the sky with the sound of a whistle breaking through the air. Shouts and cheers filled the ship.\u201cIt must be expensive, right? Rich people throw money into the sky unnecessarily.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still pretty.\u201dSpeaking nonsense, she suddenly felt his hand clasping hers. She turned and looked at Ian. And she stiffened.Fireworks exploded. A light flashed across Ian Kerner\u2019s face and then disappeared.His hands and lips trembled slightly whenever there was a bang. He raised his hands to cover his ears with stiff movements. His breathing became increasingly rough.\u2018Oh my god.\u2019\u201cSir Kerner.\u201dDesperately hiding his expression, he pushed her away, but it was already too late. She had already discovered his secret.He was out of breath. Fireballs cut through the air and spread in the sky.What did that beautiful flame look like to him now, that he couldn\u2019t even breathe?\u201cIan Kerner!\u201dHe revealed to her a secret that should not have been revealed to anyone. Least of all to her. She remembered what Henry once said.\u2013 Does it make sense that Ian Kerner is sick? If so, what\u2019s left of the Empire? There was no point in winning.And she realized once more. At this moment, how cruel the belief that was being forced on Ian Kerner, who was neither a pilot nor a hero.\u201cIan!\u201dShe didn\u2019t know what to do and called out his name. At this moment, no one was with him.Only a humble prisoner who couldn\u2019t do anything for him.******Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It twists people in one way or another. There aren\u2019t many people who can survive the chaos.Just as no one could cross a sea full of beasts, there was no one who could escape from under the roaring sky.\u2018Why did I believe he would be okay?\u2019Those brutal beliefs gathered and piled up on his shoulders, pushing him to this point.\u201cI\u2019ll call Henry.\u201dIan grabbed Rosen as she was about to shout Henry\u2019s name. She couldn\u2019t move because of how strong his hands were. He clenched his teeth and spoke with difficulty.\u201cHenry shouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll call the doctor. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dRosen tried to push him away and get up from her seat. His eyes, which had been wandering around aimlessly, hardened in an instant. Ian sat her back down and shook his head resolutely.\u201cHe serves the Reville family!\u201dAll in all, it wasn\u2019t meant to hold her back. He was short of breath and unable to speak, but he was worried about others and not himself. He was afraid that the Reville doctors would tell Henry and Alex about his condition, so he didn\u2019t even go to the doctor.\u201cThis is not the time to be stubborn!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. No one should know.\u201d\u201cWhy?! What would Henry do if he found out?\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s his job! Are you crazy? Didn\u2019t you have to find a doctor to get to this point? Why did you pretend to be okay if you were going to collapse at the sound of fireworks?\u201d\u201cNo one should know!\u201d\u201cOkay?! Now I know! What are you going to do now?\u201dHe shouted, and she shouted louder. They could barely hear each other anyway because of the sound of firecrackers.The people around them were smiling brightly. It was a wonderful sight. But the person they looked up to was a mess, hiding in a corner where no one could see and trembling like a child.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this to happen. Stay with me for a second. Then\u2026 it\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t there doctors other than the Reville\u2019s doctor? There are many doctors, but you didn\u2019t even think about finding another?\u201d\u201cWhen one finds out, it spreads in an instant. And I\u2019ve endured all this time. It\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not okay, you idiot! Is this okay? You can\u2019t even get up!\u201dRosen shot back at him. Pointing to his trembling hands, his bloodless blue face, his sweaty neck\u2026\u201cWhat? If a war hero is scared to death by the sound of fireworks, it\u2019ll be on the front page of the newspaper?\u201dIan was staring at her. But he didn\u2019t look into her eyes for a long time. He soon leaned against a keg to catch his breath, clenching his teeth and grabbing his chest. Even if he was out of breath like this, he never seemed to ask anyone for help.\u2018I want to cry, yet he is the one who should cry now, not me.\u2019-You\u2019re a hero.Rosen sighed. She said without hesitation that she depended on him. She believed he would not fall. Knowing that he was also human, she arbitrarily assumed that fear would not exist within him. By doing so, she confiscated his feelings from him.With no flexibility, he carried the expectations of the Empire on his back. Without a single moan or complaint, with a normal face.\u201cAren\u2019t you taking medicine? It can be prescribed without a doctor\u2019s knowledge.\u201dShe was sure he had something. Whether it was drugs or sleep candles. There was no medicine that was not available at a military hospital. The same was true even if not formally prescribed. He did not answer.\u201cWhere is it? I will bring it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t escape anywhere anyway. The fireworks will last for a few hours, and you\u2019re stuck here. It\u2019s a sea infested with beasts, I don\u2019t even have the lifeboat key, and you threw all the Maeria fruits into the sea!\u201dRosen did not mention the other possibilities. The possibility of stealing cutlery from the party deck and stabbing herself or taking someone hostage. Even the possibility of jumping into the sea to die.The possibility of another accident where his eyes could not reach.\u201cI won\u2019t force you to believe me. Because that\u2019s too much of an unreasonable request. But if you don\u2019t want Henry to find out, and you don\u2019t want anyone to know\u2026 You can get caught by me. It\u2019s all right. Even if I wanted to spread the secret, no one would believe me anyway.\u201dNo matter how she thought about it, wasn\u2019t it funny? The only person who could offer him help at this moment was a woman the whole Empire called a liar.\u201cBecause I really am nothing.\u201dNo one would believe her, but she really wanted to help him. She didn\u2019t want to watch him suffer.\u201c\u2026Are you disappointed?\u201dHe worried endlessly until this moment. Rosen was almost on the verge of tears. If that was the question he was seriously asking now, he didn\u2019t deserve to be called an idiot. Because Ian Kerner was truly the best man in the world.\u201cIs that important now? You\u2019re out of breath.\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t want you to find out.\u201dFor the first time, she heard his real voice. A raw voice that lacked confidence and even the indifference that he had been wearing like armor.\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t want to get caught by you the most.\u201d\u201cWhy are you ashamed that I caught you? What are you so ashamed of? I thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t it weird that he\u2019s fine after all that fuss?\u2019 You should be ashamed of yourself, you stupid coward!\u201dRosen knew that she wasn\u2019t the one he wanted to protect. He was looking at Leoarton through her. Of course, it wasn\u2019t her that he wanted to save, it was the good people who had a speck of conscience\u2026\u2018What can I do? Life isn\u2019t always fair. Those who deserved to survive died and I was lucky to survive. The whole Empire hates me for that, especially Leoarton. I understand it. They don\u2019t know me, and I don\u2019t know them either.\u2019[I will protect you. You can rest assured.]\u201cI wanted to protect you. So I got on a plane. I did my best. It wasn\u2019t a lie. It wasn\u2019t\u2026\u201dBut it was not fair that Ian was so distressed. It was inevitable. It was ridiculous that everything he said was treated like a lie.\u201cSorry. In the end, it turned out to be a lie.\u201dHe spat out an apology without knowing who it was for. Then he opened his eyes and stared at the sky where the flames were rising and exploding. As if that was the punishment he deserved.\u2018What are you looking at now?\u2019\u2018The last view of Leoarton he remembers?\u2019\u2018People who believed in his broadcast and went into their basements?\u2019Rosen clenched her teeth and shook her head.\u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize. I wasn\u2019t deceived, I pretended to be deceived. Everyone knew. We pretended not to know because we needed you. It was an impossible promise.\u201dRosen covered Ian\u2019s ears. She grabbed his face so his eyes were on her and not the sky. His grey eyes looked at her, unable to move.\u201cIan Kerner, you know? Just because you couldn\u2019t keep it\u2026 Not all of your promises were lies. You were always sincere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI do not resent you. I have never been disappointed.\u201d\u2018No matter how hard you try, I would never be.\u2019\u201cSo let me help you. Just once. You don\u2019t want to admit it, but I\u2019m one of the people you saved.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t something she believed. She was just saying it. She couldn\u2019t stand the fact that he had to suffer for the rest of his life.That was the moment.He reached out and wrapped his arms around her waist. He forced her to sit down and held her in his arms. Startled, Rosen reflexively pushed him away, but he didn\u2019t care and hugged her tighter. Rosen held her breath, trapped between his long legs.\u201cStay like this for a moment.\u201dIan buried his face in her shoulder. Rosen unconsciously laid her hand on his back. Reality was hard to believe. He hugged her so tightly that she couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cUntil the flames burn out.\u201d\u2018Did the sound of the fireworks explode my eardrums?\u2019At that moment, all sounds except his voice disappeared.Time seemed to have stopped.Her heartbeat fluttered like a fish out of the water while being held by Ian Kerner.Ian clung to Rosen like a beast seeking warmth, his breaths hot. His heavy breathing had subsided, and his chest, which had been rising and falling steeply, became calm. It was only then that Rosen understood how embarrassed he must have been.Obviously, she was trying to calm him down, but the moment he hugged her\u2026 her heart started beating like a child caught doing something bad.For a moment, she was overcome with a strange fear and tried to get away. But he didn\u2019t let go. Rather, he whispered in her ear threateningly. It wasn\u2019t a very scary threat.\u201cStay still. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cI-\u201c\u201cI said I was fine. You chose to help me. Since you made that decision, take responsibility until the end.\u201dHis hand gripping her waist used more strength. She was forced to hug him countless times. Ian Kerner was surely out of his mind. Fear paralyzed her reason. Even now, she was short of breath, but as if hugging her wasn\u2019t enough, he started stroking her hair.Fireworks still lit the sky. His body trembled every time he heard the pounding sound, but his breathing was definitely more stable than before. Rosen asked in a confident voice.\u201cDid I help you?\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer. It seemed like he wasn\u2019t even listening to her. He began to mumble to himself as if possessed.\u201cYou saved me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAs long as you, the only one I saved, survive, I can keep going\u2026\u201dHer heart ached. In those few words, Rosen realized.She was a comfort to him.\u2018There are people in the world who worry about breaking twigs. A person should not feel guilty about breaking a branch. Ian Kerner did that. He was a man who only saw the forest.\u2019\u2018And we believed that because he was such a person, he endured a hellish war, survived, and returned unscathed.\u2019Rosen was wrong.They were all wrong. Had he really been that kind of person, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten on a plane in the first place. He would have abandoned his weak homeland that could not do anything and moved to Talas to eat and live well.He was a man who felt responsible for even a rat that had escaped from his ruined hometown. So he was just using her for comfort. The hometown he couldn\u2019t protect was so heartbreaking\u2026 Even a prisoner who should be thrown into a cell without a key was embraced so preciously.It was sad to know that Rosen, who was nothing, was a comfort to him. It was heartbreaking to know that the only thing that supported him was a rat like her.\u201cSecond drawer in the cabin.\u201dHow much time had passed?Ian Kerner whispered again in a very low voice. He relaxed the arms that were holding her and looked straight into her eyes.\u201cIt is unlocked. It\u2019s a brown medicine bag.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBring it to me.\u201dHe gently pushed her away.Rosen suddenly came to her senses.She jumped out of her seat and started running across the deck.***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads.

Rosen closed the door and stood in the dark for a moment. Ian Kerner\u2019s voice rang in her ears.-Bring it to me.\u2018What the hell was he thinking when he sent me to the cabin alone?\u2019It was confusing, but she didn\u2019t have the luxury of worrying about such useless things.She had no time to waste. She turned on the small gas lamp and walked over to the desk. As Ian said, the second drawer was unlocked. It didn\u2019t take long to rummage through the well-organized drawer. Inside a brown bag were well-folded brown pockets.She unwrapped one of them. A small amount of white powder flew into the air.She put her finger in the powder and brought it to her nose. It was a well-refined powder of dried grass, divided into proper doses. It was a dr*g that was easy to abuse\u2026But it wouldn\u2019t do anything with this amount. She needed more of this powder for her plans. And she was sure Ian Kerner had more than this. It was somewhere in this cabin, so all she had to do was find it. Then she would have a chance.Rosen fumbled through the open drawer again. Just in case, she lifted up every paper stack and opened the boxes one by one.-So let me help you. Just once. You don\u2019t want to admit it, but I\u2019m one of the people you saved.As she wandered through the darkness, she realized how two faced she was. She tried not to think about it too deeply, but she couldn\u2019t help it.The strength that embraced her and the feeling of his hand pushing her away lingered on her skin. He hugged her willingly. She wanted to cry. She liked him.Nevertheless, as soon as he turned around, she ran to his cabin. Leaving him on the deck after he collapsed in front of her.Ian Kerner made a mistake. He must be deeply regretting it by now. Anyway, one thing was certain. He trusted her in that moment, and now she was in the midst of betraying his faith.After catching her breath, she began to open the drawers one after the other, starting from the bottom. All of the drawers except the second were locked.Rosen finally reached for the top drawer. Ah, finally. It was unlocked like the second drawer. It did not open even when she tried to pull it with force, but it was not locked because the handle was rattling.She groaned and pulled the drawer. It was hard work to use all her strength without making a sound.Soon the stuck object came unlodged and the entire drawer came out. Her knees hurt, but she forcibly swallowed a moan and got up from the floor. And placed the gas lamp on the empty drawer.\u2018Sh!t.\u2019Swear words were about to pop out. The first drawer was empty. All that there was was a little clutter, nothing that seemed useful. She didn\u2019t see anything like a key.She picked up the rolled-up piece of paper that was stuck in a drawer to appease her broken heart.She could not read the letters, but it demanded her full attention in an instant. The shape was peculiar. It didn\u2019t seem like an ordinary book. It wasn\u2019t an officially published book, but a tattered notebook with newspaper articles pasted in it.Was it made by Ian Kerner? Looking at it, she held her breath.Her face was on page after page. Even if she rubbed her eyes to see if she had seen it wrong, it remained unchanged. Her face was printed on newspaper clippings that had turned yellow due to fading.She turned the pages as if possessed.Each clipping had turned yellow due to fading and had letters with familiar shapes. Even if she tried to turn her attention away, they were painted over with countless colored lines, and the letters she did recognize caught her attention.[Rosen Walker, Rosen Walker, Rosen Walker\u2026][T/N: In case you have forgotten, Ian had written Rosen\u2019s name on her palm when she asked for his autograph.]It was something she just learned. She turned the pages over and over again. A map was attached to the back cover. A line was drawn on it with a red pen. She knew it as soon as she saw it. It was her escape route.There was someone\u2019s handwriting in every blank space.Among the unrecognizable words, a familiar word repeated. She opened her fist, which had been clenched, to check his writing. It was a little smudged from sweat, but it was enough to tell the shape.[Rosen Walker.]It was the same letters. The font was the same.Rosen stood there blankly.The owner of this scrapbook was Ian Kerner. At that moment, it was too much for her to bear.-You saved me.-As long as you, the only one I saved, survive, I can keep going\u2026-No one will believe me, but I\u2019ve never hated you.-We have some similarities.-But I\u2019m sure you know more than you think. I meant it that way.\u2018He didn\u2019t lie to me. He didn\u2019t just say things I wanted to hear.\u2019Ian Kerner was more sincere than she thought. He was deeply guilty towards her. Guilt became sympathy, and he was too nice to ignore it, so he\u2026His actions, which she could not understand, fit together like a puzzle in her head.She hurriedly dropped the notebook as if it was on fire. The paper crumbled at her feet. Her heart was beating so loud it hurt her ears.For the first time, she was grateful that she couldn\u2019t read. If she could read his notes, it would have been really hard.Because the moment she found out his secret, and found the scrapbook in his deep drawer, she was thinking about something else deep in her heart.\u2018Maybe I could use this.\u2019\u2018I think I can fool him and win the fight.\u2019\u2018And I\u2019ll do it.\u2019The hope that had dried up swelled. She bit her lip. It took her longer than expected to regain her composure. She put the scrapbook back in its original place.Her hands moved faster when there was hope. She put her hand back into the drawer and continued her search.Soon she found what she was looking for. Under the light of the gas lamp, a thick envelope of sleeping powder was revealed.\u2018Ian Kerner shouldn\u2019t have trusted me. Never, not for a moment, should he have trusted me.\u2019-Including people like you who are mean, cowardly, and only how to run away\u2026 who are crazy about their own comfort.\u2018Ian Kerner, you should have been more careful.\u2019He was as crazy as she was, but he was too kind to be her guard.\u2018He\u2019s right. I\u2019m mean and cowardly. I am a person who lives only for myself. I am a prisoner who deceived the whole Empire. If it wasn\u2019t for that man, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it this far.\u2019\u2018Though, it wasn\u2019t a lie when I said I like him. It was heartbreaking to find out that he was broken, and I really want to help him.\u2019If he still had sincerity, he\u2019d be one of the few people in this d*mned world who could win her heart.But her heart had been terribly broken, and she had already figured it out.The mind was of no use to anything. Truly loving someone only made you weak. It\u2019s stupid to take out your heart and give it to someone else. That kind of behavior made you lose fights that you could win.Even if she didn\u2019t have anything, she had been doing those stupid things all her childhood.Wasn\u2019t it time to stop now?A single dose of sleep powder was 50 milligrams. That was enough for a person with insomnia to manage to sleep for six hours. If she used 1.5 times the amount, he would fall into a deep sleep for 8 hours.The military supplied things in ignorantly large capacities. Anyway, they were not cautious.When the entire second drawer of Ian\u2019s desk was searched, 250 grams of sleeping powder was gathered. He hadn\u2019t shown the lifeboat key to her since the first day, but he must have never thought that she would steal the powder.If he had, he wouldn\u2019t have sent her to his cabin alone, no matter how messed up he was.Indeed, since the powder itself was unfamiliar to the general public, they wouldn\u2019t think to be wary of it. Most people knew that sleeping herbs were grass that burned when you couldn\u2019t fall asleep, but they didn\u2019t know that if you refined it into powder, it could be as powerful as a sedative.\u2018But I am not. I am Emily\u2019s pupil.\u2019A dr*g that was only used for panicked patients or insomniacs, and was so easy to abuse that it was difficult to obtain even in private sectors.She was convinced from the moment she found out that Ian Kerner had insomnia. That he\u2019d have enough powder to put this whole ship to sleep.Sleeping powder was colorless and odorless when mixed with liquid.A handful would do.What if she used it on the public drinking supply?***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads.

She struggled to comfort herself.\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not gonna hurt him.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not the only one for Ian Kerner. He didn\u2019t just save me. He saved so many important and innocent people. They\u2019ll stay by Ian\u2019s side. When his interest fades with time, he will be freed from the shackles of being a hero and will find people who truly love him.\u2019\u2018Then he will be fine. Everything will get better. The cruel war is over. He will be assigned a stable position and move forward, marrying a suitable woman and having a baby\u2026 He will be able to lead a normal and happy life.\u2019\u2018That will heal him. He will remember the witch of Al Capez, not Rosen Walker.\u2019We each have to do what we have to do, as we have always done. She still didn\u2019t know who would win in the end, but she had no intention of losing to him. She had to win.-I love you, Ian Kerner.Of course, that confession was not a lie. Really, she liked him. She loved him even though she knew it was useless. But to put it the other way around, that was all she really meant.In other words, that was her sincerity.She didn\u2019t have to choose him because she liked him.Just like Ian Kerner didn\u2019t need to release her just because he pitied her.The sleeping powder Ian Kerner had was now safely stored inside her dress.Rosen walked out of the cabin and stared out over the dark blue sea. She would likely die in that sea. But that did not matter. She would leave this ship tomorrow night. She would either succeed or fail.Because her engine hadn\u2019t stopped chugging yet.\u2018I won\u2019t lose.\u2019***Rosen Walker ran, and the hem of her blue dress fluttered.Rosen\u2019s statement that she wasn\u2019t drunk may have been true. She ran without faltering as soon as she was told to go. Ian Kerner stared at the receding figure as it ran away from him.Soon after, his cabin door opened and closed again.Only then did he realize what he had done. He had just done something he shouldn\u2019t have explicitly. He sent an escaped prisoner alone into his cabin. It wasn\u2019t common sense. It was an act that could not be excused if someone found out.Of course, Rosen couldn\u2019t escape even if she found the lifeboat key. The Black Sea was infested with demons, and some of the sailors had guns. And the ship was full of passengers. He wasn\u2019t the only one who could monitor Rosen.Even if she succeeded in stealing the lifeboat, she would not be able to go far and would be caught. Either by the beasts or before then.But in that moment, Ian wanted to do something meaningless. He had watched Rosen\u2019s running figure and was relieved. So, as soon as he received the order to transport Rosen Walker, he lost his temper and rushed into the minister\u2019s office.-It\u2019s something you have to do personally.-\u2026-Leoarton only blames Ian Kerner. Whether it was unavoidable or not, we must take responsibility for their hearts.He then raised his head for the first time and asked the minister who was giving him orders.-Do you mean putting the blame on innocent people for what I did?-Is Rosen Walker innocent?-\u2026She has nothing to do with this.-It\u2019s what the public wants. They need you to be flawless, and they want revenge on the witch. Their wounds should be properly healed. If you show the world that you\u2019re transporting prisoners to Monte Island, both will happen at the same time.-\u2026-It was your job throughout the war to sacrifice a few for the many. That\u2019s the nature of the war. You\u2019ve never made a bad choice because you\u2019ve been overwhelmed by emotion. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re dissatisfied now.Ian did not respond. He followed inhumane orders from the Empire throughout the war. As he carried out reckless operations, he threw a squadron of young students into the sea and shot down numerous enemy aircraft. Even though he knew more deeply than anyone else that humans with blood and tears were in the enemy planes.He did it because he needed to. He chose it because he believed it was right. It was better for four hundred to die than four thousand.The minister\u2019s argument was plausible. The state was an organization that was good at calculating profit and loss. If the death of Rosen would benefit all of Leoarton, the government would sacrifice Rosen, even by creating false charges.He was an accessory to such a state throughout the war, and he was already accustomed to their ways. Then why was he hesitating? After all, the Empire was a country that was protected by sacrificing innocent people. Why was he pretending to be an innocent hero who ended the war without a single sacrifice?Ian Kerner shook his head. Fireworks were still exploding in the sky, but he no longer trembled. Rosen\u2019s voice rang in his ears, obscuring the sound of firecrackers. Reaching out in the air in search of the warmth that had already disappeared, he thought of the prisoner who gently embraced him.She was a prisoner whom everyone called a liar. But the Rosen Walker he met in person was overly candid.-Ian Kerner, you know? Just because you couldn\u2019t keep it\u2026 Not all of your promises were lies. You were always sincere.\u2018What kind of prisoner comforts a prison guard? Why don\u2019t you hide your inner feelings? Without fear\u2026\u2019In fact, he knew why Rosen was clinging to him. She thought it was meaningless, so she was going to show off to her heart\u2019s content. Because Rosen firmly believed her words wouldn\u2019t affect him in any way.It would have been better if they were comfortable with each other.He thought of Rosen, who had collapsed and vomited blood. Rosen\u2019s eyes were sparkling with joy even as she struggled in pain. Even though Rosen said she wouldn\u2019t die, there was only one conclusion he reached. Su*cide on board was Rosen\u2019s last plan.In a way, it might be a wise choice. No one in the world could touch a dead man.-So just let me help you. Just once. You don\u2019t want to admit it, but I\u2019m one of the people you saved.Ian clenched his teeth.She did something rash. If she wanted to kill herself and rebel against the Empire for the last time, she shouldn\u2019t have helped him. She should have yelled and slapped him when he hugged her. She kept touching him and trying to hug him, but\u2026 It would have been more helpful to her plan if she didn\u2019t. Contrary to what she thought.\u2018The more I do that, the harder it becomes to let you die. No, I haven\u2019t been able to look at you coldly for a long time now.\u2019\u2018If I could turn back time, I would have refused the order to transport you at any cost.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ve made too many choices in the meantime. I thought it would be nice if you could stay and comfort me. Really, I didn\u2019t want to drag you into this.\u2019Ian got up and stared out over the Black Sea.\u2018If you get on a lifeboat safely, what are your chances of crossing this sea? Can you get to land safely?\u2019It was impossible.He was astonished at himself trying to estimate the odds in his head as if he had escaped from prison. But it was already too late. It was no use pretending to repent now.To determine where things went wrong, he had to go back to the distant past.If he traced back his memory, he could easily find the moment when he first met Rosen Walker. The day he came to see the ruins of Leoarton in person after shaking off the people who tried to stop him.When he looked up after banging his head on the viewing platform\u2019s railing, the first thing that caught his eye was Rosen Walker\u2019s face. Someone had pasted a newspaper on a ruin wall.[The escaped prisoner who crawled out of the ruins, the witch who escaped from Perrinne!]The Imperial newspaper had Rosen\u2019s face plastered on the front page in order to draw in readers. It must have been meant for spitting and throwing stones.But Ian Kerner failed to do so. He reached out like he was possessed and gently stroked Rosen Walker\u2019s face, who was nothing more than a printed figure. There was only one thought that came to mind at the moment.\u2018You survived.\u2019Everyone said that Rosen was a witch. A murderer, a prisoner, and a woman who angered the entire Empire. He knew it too.However, even though he thought it was nonsense, he lived with a picture of Rosen in his arms ever since. He secretly took it out every time he suffered, until the edges of the newspaper were ragged. He even put it in a pendant because he was afraid it would wear out.Like Rosen Walker was his family or his lover.[T/N: My heart-]***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads.

    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne Blood, One Wish, One Magic (4)******One Blood, One Wish, One Magic (4)***There were times when he felt guilty about what he was doing, but he couldn\u2019t get rid of that little piece of paper. Henry always carried pictures of his older sister and Layla, and the other pilots fought with their precious people near to their hearts.He had no one. The hometown he longed for was destroyed by a sea of fire by his own choice.But he needed something to hold on to, too. Someone who would turn him into a human, not a soldier.The pendant fell into the sea and was lost when his life was saved. But he never stopped acting stupid. After the war was over, he started collecting Rosen\u2019s articles in earnest. And\u2026Ian returned to reality and buried his face in his hands. As he raised his head, in the distance, a blue dress caught his eye. He didn\u2019t know for a moment whether it was a hallucination or reality.It was reality. Some time had passed, and Rosen was running back to him.The sound of the waves around him gave no room for fantasy. It finally awakened him to the cruel situation.-No poison? Why do soldiers carry such things? So they can\u2019t be caught by the enemy and tortured?-I know you think I\u2019m very pitiful right now. So, if you have something, can\u2019t you give it to me?When he thought about it over and over again, the conclusion he came to was the same. Rosen couldn\u2019t escape, and the moment she went to the island of Monte, she would die painfully. It was already too late to change the outcome. And Rosen knew it. That\u2019s why she appealed to him to die comfortably.He touched the pistol on his waist. The biggest consideration he could give Rosen now was to give her a neat ending. It was miserable, but it was for the best. Shooting was the most humane method of execution he knew. If he aimed at her head, she would die instantly without feeling any pain.The government and the military would be offended, and he would be disciplined, but it was not something they would not let go if he made up a proper excuse. Accidents frequently occurred during the transport of prisoners, and summary dispositions were frequently made.It might be better to kill her with his own hands. Ian knew all too well what went on on the island. Abuse, violence, r*pe, torture. Things that made life worse than death.His feelings didn\u2019t matter. If he really cared about Rosen, he had to think about what would really help Rosen.\u2018Let\u2019s think rationally, rationally\u2026\u2019He watched as Rosen drew closer, and released his pistol from his belt. But at that moment, Rosen Walker\u2019s innocent confession echoed in his ears again.-I love you, Ian Kerner.In the end, Ian couldn\u2019t even hold his pistol properly and dropped it on his floor. He suddenly hardened as he leaned over to correct a mistake he hadn\u2019t made since he was ten.Suddenly, a small hand was pulling the hem of his coat. He stood upright again, staring at Rosen, who had returned. The sea breeze fluttered her pale hair around her ears.Rosen was waiting for him like a child who had done an errand and wanted praise. She was completely unaware of the fact that he had been aiming at her with a pistol moments before.\u201cHere, I brought it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, take it, Ian.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry. Put out your hand and I will pour it out.\u201dRosen unwrapped the paper and poured the powder into his hands. He stretched out his hands and stared blankly at the white powder falling like grains of sand. Then the witch who killed her husband looked at him with worried eyes.A pale, breathing Rosen Walker stood before him. The person who seemed to be forever trapped in a black-and-white photo.Suddenly, a question he had never thought of before filled his mind. It was unfamiliar, but it was a question that seemed to have been somewhere in his heart for a long time.\u2018Was there ever a time when it mattered to me whether Rosen Walker was a murderer or not?\u2019\u2018If I were to go back, would I really refuse to transport?\u2019The excuse that he would have made a different choice if he turned back time was void.He thought he knew now. Why did everything get messed up?He stared at Rosen for too long. Regardless of politics, he would have met Rosen like this in the end.If someone else had taken Rosen, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand it. With any excuse, he would have taken that mission and ended up on the same boat. He soon realized.All of this was his choice. Even knowing what was in the drawer, he sent Rosen into the cabin. He didn\u2019t want her to die. To let her know that he was shaken. He thought that if she had hope, at least she wouldn\u2019t kill herself on this ship.He didn\u2019t send her because he believed in her. He sent her because he didn\u2019t. He knew she would look through the drawers in the cabin. Meaningless resistance. That\u2019s who Rosen Walker was.Rosen asked if his gaze felt strange.\u201cAre you afraid that I might run away? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not strange. I was always watching you.\u201d\u201cWere you spying?\u201d\u201cYes, you didn\u2019t know.\u201dWithout a word, he stretched out his arms and hugged Rosen gently. Rosen felt suffocated and pushed him away slightly. But he didn\u2019t want to let Rosen go.In retrospect, he always wanted to touch Rosen, even as he watched her back as she escaped. He felt like hugging her wasn\u2019t enough. He wondered if there was any way to reach deeper. He knew it was a crazy idea, but\u2026-In your boring, painful, and long life, you must have at least one magical day. Think. Have you ever had a day like that?Ian Kerner hesitated for a moment, then swallowed Rosen\u2019s lips with the words he couldn\u2019t bear to say.He wasn\u2019t pushed to do it. At least this job, from start to finish, was his choice.He chose Rosen Walker.Maybe a long time ago.From the very beginning.Author\u2019s note:\u2013 It took me a very long time to upload this episode because I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t be interesting \u315c\u315c I\u2019ll upload it anyway. My goal is to try to upload once a week!There are a lot of questions, so if you don\u2019t like FAQs, please skip this!***(T/L Note: This is a Q&amp;A session.)Q&amp;A:Q. Spoiler for the endingIf you want it, please watch the author\u2019s review of chapter 24!Q.Share the BGM.The BGM that I listen to are game OSTs\u2026 It\u2019s like this\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll write well. When I write, I listen to a song again and again. I like the BGM you\u2019re leaving in the comments. Please share it with me. Billie Eilish \u2013 Lovely, I\u2019m listening to it.Q. Ian Kerner is 30 years old and handsome, and I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s a v*rgin. Is there a special reason? Has he ever had a lover?I don\u2019t think the specific reason will be mentioned in the main story, so I\u2019ll just answer it now.He\u2019s never had a lover. A desolate life without a crush or one-sided love.Because he like guys \u2013 (X)Because he grew up fast \u2013 (X)Because he is a perfectionist \u2013 (X)There are a lot of complex reasons. He\u2019s very straightforward and arrogant. He has a habit of solving everything by himself, so he didn\u2019t feel much desire for a relationship. He doesn\u2019t have many friends.He entered the military academy at the age of 10. (The military academy rules prohibit dating. Everyone does it, but Ian Kerner, who follows the rules, can\u2019t do that right?) At the age of 20, the war started, and since then, pilots have been driven to death for 10 years.As an orphan and a fighter pilot who sacrificed his life for his job, people around him reacted like, \u2018He was a very good pilot, but I don\u2019t want him to be my son-in-law.\u2019 He participated in the war when he was a student and predicted that everyone around him would die. He\u2019s so handsome but no woman approached him\u2026There was so much weight on his shoulders that he couldn\u2019t afford to be soft. Plus, as I mentioned, he didn\u2019t think he should have a lover/family because he didn\u2019t know when he would die as he had a dangerous job.In addition, all of the squadrons led by Ian Kerner in the early days were women, so the opinions around him were not good. There were many people who looked down on them just because they were female pilots\u2026 (I\u2019m going to elaborate on this part a little more if I write a side story.) Many women were careful not to get caught up in s*xual gossip because of their actions.Harassing pilots was no joke. At the time, there were even rumors that Ian liked men, but Ian himself thought it would be better to let them think that way.He has had mental breakdowns since the raid on Leoarton 6 years ago. The war was intense\u2026 When people of high ranks started to introduce their daughters to him to get married after the war ended, he was obsessively collecting articles. And\u2026 well, that\u2019s what happened.To sum up, the environment did not allow youth + his personality.Q. How old is Henry?He\u2019s the same age as Rosen. (25 years old)***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads. However, ads are not able to help us much longer and we are on the verge of disbanding.

As soon as he felt her harden, he pulled away, as if he was embarrassed by his impulsive action.\u201cSir Kerner. Are we going to do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t consider Ian a pervert. People want to hold on to someone when they are weak, but the expression usually appeared in a s*xual form. He kissed her unannounced. So\u2026 she was naturally shaken for a moment.It wasn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t like it, it was because she was embarrassed, but it made no sense. Rosen came to her senses late and grabbed him, but he had already grabbed her by the wrist and was heading for the cabin.Rosen wanted to hit herself, who had missed a golden opportunity. Why did she freeze like an idiot? She should have grabbed him right away. No matter who Ian Kerner was, he was still a man.Once erected, they did not think with their heads. There was not a single exception that she had encountered. Neither a gentleman, an old man, nor a timid man.All men were like that\u2026 Ian Kerner was no different. Of course, he was not going to be as stupid as the rest of them.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use your tongue? You don\u2019t know how to use it? Do you want me to teach you?\u201d\u201cEven if you say\u2026 \u201dShe finally managed to stop him. His voice raised again, perhaps because he was angry or embarrassed by his actions. She realized once again what her talent was. Getting under people\u2019s skin. Come to think of it, Hindley said the same thing.\u201c\u2026No. I made a mistake.\u201dHe sighed and bent down so his face met her eye level.\u2018What do you mean?\u2019As she was looking at him, not knowing what to say, he opened his mouth.\u201cHit me. No, hit me twice.\u201dHe would have been slapped if he did that to a beautiful lady, but she was a prisoner. There was no one to blame for how guards treated their prisoners. After all, Ian Kerner was a human being who became anxious over things no one else cared about.Rosen pretended to clench her fist and kissed him again. This time, not on the cheek, but on the lips, as he did.\u201cNow we\u2019re even, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s go in. You\u2019re drunk.\u201dIan Kerner looked at her with a strange smile as if it was ridiculous. Soon he grabbed her shoulder and started to push her toward his cabin. After talking a little more, she thought that they would do the deed for sure, so she allowed herself to be meekly dragged along.She was brimming with hope. To be honest, she had doubts until recently that Ian Kerner wasn\u2019t really a eunuch, but now it was clear. He also had a desire to touch a woman.\u2018Let\u2019s think. If I were a man, would I have kissed me, no matter how crazy I was?\u2019After that, that\u2019s the part she was good at. Once the line was crossed, she had the power to push until one\u2019s limits broke.He was a man who never drank alcohol on duty, never went near a drinking fountain, and only drank water brought directly from the Captain\u2019s office. That meant Ian Kerner would be awake even if the whole ship was asleep.To get through to this prison guard, she needed one more trick.And she was sure this would be it.As expected, everyone was the same. She could win. They pretend not to be, but once they slept with her, they were generous as if she was their property. She\u2019d weaken his heart a little bit. Besides, if they slept together today, he would surely ask for the same tomorrow.As soon as she entered the cabin, she intended to cling to him. It didn\u2019t matter if she would get hit.\u2018What are you going to do if I take off my clothes? Hit me? I\u2019ve had worse.\u2019She was more concerned with the medicine hidden in her underwear. She could hide it under the bed, but she needed a proper opening.She was firmly determined. So when he turned on the gas lamp and tried to put her on the bed, she did not let go, but hugged his neck and kissed him again. He was startled and tried to separate them, but she clung to him recklessly.\u201cYou smell good.\u201dShe hugged him tightly. His scent tickled the tip of her nose. He smelled like the sky. Cool and refreshing. He didn\u2019t wear cologne, so why did he have such a strong fragrance? Maybe it was because he was a man who lived in the sky and not on the earth?\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do it, hug me first. I like it.\u201d\u201cRosen, please be still.\u201dAs she was about to take her clothes off, he wrapped her in a blanket. It was hard to get out, but as soon as she did she was buried in another. The clumsy fight continued for a long time. Eventually, Rosen lost her strength and was overpowered by him.He sank into a chair beside the bed with tired expression.\u201cGet a hold of yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. What the heck is your problem? You\u2019re a guard, and I\u2019m a prisoner who will die after tomorrow night anyway. No one will say anything if you do it with me! Don\u2019t you know what I\u2019m asking you to do?\u201d\u201cI know. But I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAll my other guards have except you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be like that.\u201dHe was too savvy. Men were not afraid to extort something from women they did not love. Whether it was love, attention, money, or s*x. Hindley did the same. After all, women were not people to them, and even if they lived like that, no one would say anything.But Ian Kerner, who she was hanging on to, wouldn\u2019t do that. She was going crazy. How on earth did he grow up to be such a man?\u201cThen why did you kiss me? Of course, I knew what that meant.\u201dRosen finally managed to render him speechless. He didn\u2019t answer, but the gesture of putting a blanket over her was resolute.\u201cPlease sleep. Before I cuff you again.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that! You promised me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not keeping your promise to stay calm either.\u201d\u201cIs it because I am dirty? Do you hate me?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why she said such a stupid thing. But just in case, she said it with the most pitiful look on her face. It was an obvious lie, but she wanted to see if it had any effect.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t keep using your body like a tool. You are a person, not a tool.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything other than this, so what should I do? You may have wealth, fame, and power, but I do not. And now what? I\u2019m at the end of the line.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you know what my intentions are for doing this? I just want to sleep with you\u2026\u201dHer conscience ached. This man was too quick. She had a strong feeling that she was doomed. She thought of him hugging her, and finally found his sore spot.\u201cTell me the truth. You actually like hugging me, don\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, even if it\u2019s not me\u2026You seem to like hugging people. You\u2019ve been struggling because there\u2019s no one to hug, right?\u201dThe medicine he swallowed must have worked too well. She regretted that she ever gave it to him. Where did the man who was trembling and clinging on to her desperately go? Now he was just staring at her blankly, regardless of what she was talking about.She had developed willpower. She had even become a little desperate. She suggested, as a last resort, pointing to his pants.\u201cIf you feel uncomfortable, there is a way to satisfy only you. What do you think?\u201dIan Kerner\u2019s expression hardened in an instant. He seemed angry. On this ship she made him quite angry, but this was the first time she had seen such a look on his face. She realized that she had offended him, and she bowed her head in shame. She instinctively realized\u2026That she just crossed the \u2018line\u2019 he had set.\u201cI take back what I just said.\u201dShe thought she was going to be thrown out the door any moment. If she was unlucky, she would be chained again.She heard him walking. She reflexively closed her eyes and cowered. She covered her head with her arms. It wasn\u2019t because she believed he was going to beat her, but rather it was a habit imprinted into her body. A habit that popped up before she even thought about it.The memories of the violence that Hindley Haworth, the soldiers who roamed Leoarton, and countless guards were engraved in her mind.\u201cRosen.\u201dHis voice surrounded her. It was a friendly voice that he seldom used.Rosen opened her eyes. A long sigh followed. Realizing she was acting like an idiot, she removed the arm that was covering her head.Ian carefully sat her upright and put her on the bed. He sat down next to her. She turned to face him, crouching awkwardly in the dim light. He paused for quite some time, just looking at her.\u201cCome here.\u201dHe called her again in a choked voice. He stretched out his arms and beckoned to her. As soon as she got permission, she quickly approached him and sat down on his lap.She didn\u2019t forget to hug his neck and smile softly to make up for the gloomy atmosphere.He embraced her tightly.***Hi guys, as you know we are a free-to-read website and we only survive on ads.

I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not scared. I understand.\u201dIt really didn\u2019t matter. Rosen didn\u2019t need Ian\u2019s apology. She was just trying to make him feel a little guilty.\u201cHold me, Ian Kerner. I will die soon. And I helped you earlier. I\u2019m going to die soon, but I\u2019m scared to sleep alone. I think I\u2019m going to have a nightmare.\u201dRosen made excuses shamelessly. However, he had been asking such straightforward questions that she was beginning to think he really had the ability to read minds.\u201cYou want to do it with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to do\u00a0it\u00a0with me?\u201dWhen he asked outright, Rosen was rather confused. Thanks to him, she faced a question she had never thought about before.\u201cYou\u2019re the most handsome person I\u2019ve ever seen, and you\u2019re in good shape. Anyway, I\u2019m going to die soon, and I want to sleep with a man like you one last time\u2026\u201dRosen frowned as she gave a vague reason.\u2018Why the hell is he asking why?\u2019\u2018He gets too obsessed with useless things.\u2019\u201cDamn, what\u2019s the point in asking? I\u2019m scared of sleeping! If we just take off our clothes and hug each other, I can do everything on my own. You haven\u2019t tried it, so you don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s so good that it makes you faint.\u201d\u201cDid you do that, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cWas it ever good enough to make you faint?\u201dThe vulgar words that came out of his mouth were so unfamiliar that it took Rosen a while to process. She must\u2019ve been a bad influence on him.She shrugged. That was a very difficult question. It was true that she did it voluntarily, but she didn\u2019t do it because she liked it\u2026She wanted more food, a spoon, or his autograph.There was always a reason.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The men did it all.\u201d\u201cDid you do it because you liked it?\u201dEverything she did was purposeful and still was, but she couldn\u2019t answer him honestly.\u201cI want to sleep with you because I really like you.\u201dWhen Rosen saw Ian\u2019s expression after hearing that, she realized that her plan had completely failed. He looked depressed rather than excited, and seemed to be angry at something unknown. She licked her lips nervously.He was a very difficult person to understand, like a complex puzzle with no hints.Why?Was it because she was serious with him?Was it because he was a complicated person?Or maybe he was thinking too much\u2026After he openly refused, the road ahead became bleak. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the strength to pin him down. If he pushed her away, she would have to step back. She sighed as he sat her down on his lap and stroked her hair.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did you go through a lot of hardship and become an old woman, or did you stop growing at 17 because you were in prison?\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cYou need someone to hold you, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a man.\u201d\u201cThen it can be you. All I need is someone to hold me. It doesn\u2019t matter who. So what if that person is a man? What\u2019s wrong with that if we just sleep?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re right. What does it matter now? You said you felt sorry for me. Can\u2019t you just do what I want? I mean\u2026 Unless you don\u2019t like me very much. But we even kissed\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. Maybe if we met normally, we could have spent Walpurgis Night together.\u201dRosen couldn\u2019t believe her ears. It wasn\u2019t because he was too na\u00efve to say no. It was because he was treating her like a normal person. She was a prisoner, something he could trample on at will like a rat.Ian quietly rolled up Rosen\u2019s sleeves. Numerous scars were exposed before his eyes. He gently grabbed her wrist and continued.\u201cBut you\u2019re too thin. You have so many wounds. I could cruelly chain you, and you wouldn\u2019t even mind. You\u2019re used to people treating you carelessly. It\u2019s just my greed, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou-\u201c\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want to be that kind of person to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause you said you like me.\u201d\u201cOh, My God. You really loved Leoarton.\u201dAt that moment, that was all Rosen could say. Otherwise, the way he looked at her couldn\u2019t be explained. Unless he was looking at his hometown through her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hug her so tightly.\u2018If we met normally\u2026\u2019\u2018Did he just say that?\u2019Rosen thought about it without realizing it.Young Rosen and Ian Kerner, running into each other in a busy square. A scruffy orphan and a cadet in a crisp uniform.It was not a good combination, but he danced with her. He was a good person, so he wouldn\u2019t let a little child enamored by him cry.\u2018If I had met him like that, if he had just passed by, at least I wouldn\u2019t have had to deceive him.\u2019Ian took something out of a drawer under the bed.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cCake.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI remember it meant something to you.\u201dHe calmly stuck a candle into the cake and held it out to her. It flickered in the darkness. It hurt her heart to see it.Was it because of guilt? Or was it that her last thread of innocence, which did not want to deceive Ian Kerner, pierced her heart?Rosen raised her head and looked at Ian.If she had been a little younger, she would have cried and hugged him at that moment.\u2013 What was the first spell that Emily succeeded in casting after becoming a witch?-\u2026I made a cake.She was wrong. The government and military seemed to have no eyes for people. He was too good a person to watch a prisoner like her. He genuinely listened to her.Just because she was from Leoarton.Just for that reason\u2026\u201cWould you like to make a wish?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dShe kneeled next to the bed. He didn\u2019t stop her. He just stared at her with eyes that didn\u2019t know how to treat her.In the past, she would have begged him to love her. Unless she borrowed the power of Walpurg, there was no way that a person who shone like him could truly love her.But she was different now. She knew that love didn\u2019t mean anything. She knew how weak one had to be to be obsessed with being loved.\u201cI\u2026\u201dRosen stared at the candles for a long time and made a wish, different from before.\u2018Walpurg, give me strength. I don\u2019t need love anymore. Give me the strength to face all my troubles, the courage to forsake comfort, and the will to stand alone in this harsh world. I want to be unbreakable.\u2019\u201cWhat did you wish for?\u201d\u201c\u2026A peaceful death.\u201dRosen lied and pushed the cake toward him.\u201cCome on, Sir Kerner. You too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use. Walpurg only grants girl\u2019s wishes.\u201d\u201cMake a wish. Do you know for sure that\u2019s how she is?\u201dCurious, Rosen waited for words to fall from his mouth. But he only looked at the cake and blew out the candles. The only light left in the cabin was the gas lamp. She tried to get away, but he didn\u2019t let her go and lay in bed holding her.\u201cTell me your story.\u201d\u201cI did last night.\u201d\u201cTell me more.\u201d\u201cI have nothing left to say\u201d\u201cIf you think, there will be more.\u201d\u2018This is useless.\u2019\u2018No matter what we talk about now, nothing will change.\u2019Rosen nevertheless opened her mouth. It was because he was staring at her with his deep gray eyes, speaking with her favorite broadcast voice. Those eyes seemed warm now. She grabbed his hand and smiled mischievously.\u201cAre you going to listen to what I have to say?\u201d\u201cYes. So don\u2019t lie.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a day Hindley was out. Emily woke Rosen up at dawn and quietly took her to the backyard. Emily looked at her and the chicks alternately with an expectant expression.\u201cWhat do you think, Rosen? Aren\u2019t they cute?\u201cYes, they\u2019re cute. I wish they would grow up soon, though. It\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t eat eggs, but I will grow well and eat them. I\u2019ll make you chicken stew.\u201d\u201c\u2026Rosen, you\u2019re too obsessed with food. Look how cute they are.\u201dEmily whispered again, looking at the hatched chicks with a softened expression. Rosen\u2019s reaction was apparently not what Emily wanted. She tried to concentrate on the cuteness of the chicks. Rosen didn\u2019t know how to feel, except that they were wet, small, and loud.However, it was sad to see them trying to break out of their shells with their small beaks.\u2018You have to struggle like this from birth.\u2019\u2018Can\u2019t you be more comfortable? It\u2019s going to be harder if you come out anyway.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not good at breaking the shell.\u201dAmong the chicks, there was one that was particularly late. The others had already come out of their eggs and dried their feathers, but it hadn\u2019t even made a hole in its shell yet. It was clear that it had no strength.Rosen inadvertently reached out and tried to break the shell herself. She felt like it would die in the egg if she left it alone.\u201cNo, Rosen! Leave it alone!\u201dEmily grabbed Rosen\u2019s hand.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I do it?\u201dRosen had always been moved by being late and lacking. If she bought a flower, she picked out the most withered one and got scolded by Emily.She thought anyone would buy the superior ones, but no one would take care of the ugly ones unless it were her or Emily.If you took good care of them with affection, they could bloom as beautifully as others.\u201cIt\u2019s something it has to do alone. No one should help with that. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be able to get out alone\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can do it if you wait. It\u2019s just a little later than others.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to die!\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure this chick can do it. It will grow stronger than anyone else. Speed doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dEmily looked at Rosen with her deep green eyes and shook her head resolutely. She seemed to believe very firmly that the chick could do it on its own. After all, Emily was a witch.\u2018You must be more insightful than I am.\u2019Maybe she could see the future that others couldn\u2019t. There was no end to what a witch could do. Emily herself didn\u2019t seem to know the limit. If it wasn\u2019t for that restraint hanging around her neck, she could do more.Rosen became lost in thought as she glared at the restraint hanging around Emily\u2019s neck, and then watched the last chick with a pitiful eye.Still, the little thing didn\u2019t give up. Little by little, the hole got bigger. How long had it been? The last chick finally broke its shell. It stumbled, but it stood right back up and peeped like everyone else.Even for her, who was not very sentimental, the sight was overwhelming. Tears welled up in her eyes. Emily wrapped her arm around Rosen\u2019s shoulder and smiled.\u201cDid you see, Rosen?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThis chick could always do it. It\u2019s small, but inside, it had the power to break out of the shell from the beginning.\u201dRosen looked at the chick admiringly. She hoped someday she could become an adult, big and strong enough to break out of this prison and stand on solid ground.She wanted to stand against Hindley, who hit her. Throw divorce papers in his face, and leave with Emily.If that didn\u2019t work, she would run away at night\u2026\u2018We could go to a place where no one knows us, build a treatment center, help people\u2026Wouldn\u2019t it be nice for us to live together until we become old and grey?\u2019No matter how hard she thought about it, continuing to live in Hindley Haworth\u2019s house was not the answer. The bruises on her body increased day by day. Emily\u2019s body had a lot more. The idea that it might be better to be outside in a warzone than in a house ruled by Hindley was starting to grow stronger.\u2018A chaotic world is better than a peaceful world for witches and orphans to hide.\u2019Rosen leaned her head on Emily\u2019s shoulder and whispered softly.\u201cEmily. Let\u2019s go to Malona.\u201d\u201cRosen!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t live like this.\u201dEmily began to shake. She was beaten by a drunken Hindley the night before. Even if Emily were na\u00efve and had resigned herself to the recurring violence, she would have been shaken at the moment.What Emily lacked was recklessness. And all Rosen had was recklessness. Rosen thought she could give her that much.\u201cTo Malona?\u201d\u201cYes, of course. It\u2019s the capital. It\u2019s not far from here. There are many people there because of evacuations, but there are still some quiet places. Even if the war continues, the capital will be fine until the end. I\u2019ve started hiding money little by little, small enough that he wouldn\u2019t notice. Soon enough, there will be enough that the two of us can leave.\u201d\u201cRosen, you\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you live in an orphanage for a long time, you will only improve your dexterity. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m only stealing enough not to be caught.\u201dEmily did not answer. She just smiled sadly.Looking back, Rosen realized that Emily knew that there was not much hope in her plan. She was young and na\u00efve compared to Emily, so she didn\u2019t lose hope. She still believed in the world.Where in the world could a young orphan girl with nothing and a witch with a restraint around her neck be safe?But then Emily nodded.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s run away when we have enough money. Let\u2019s live together. Happily.\u201d\u201c\u2026This winter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be ready by the winter.\u201d***Rosen measured her height from time to time on a door in the house. As her nutrition improved, she began to grow again. She drew the line with leftover burnt coal. It rose slowly but steadily.She didn\u2019t know until she smiled proudly while looking at the lines. That growth wasn\u2019t a strength for everyone. In this filthy world, a girl became an adult, growing up\u2026 What did it mean?Boys grew taller and stronger as they grew older. Growing enough to look down on their father, they were able to escape the yoke of violence. A day would come for them to laugh at their shrunken father, wondering if they were ever afraid of such a person.But Rosen couldn\u2019t do that. She couldn\u2019t beat Hindley no matter how much she grew. She always shuddered and shook as soon as his arm went up. Growing up was just another shackle for her.\u2018I didn\u2019t know then that a young body was superior.\u2019\u2018I really didn\u2019t know.\u2019***Emily loved children. When children entered the treatment center, she stayed up all night to treat them. When she saw a young child on the street, she couldn\u2019t help but give him candy.But if Rosen had to pinpoint it, she was a little annoyed with children.She didn\u2019t know if it was because she was not good at taking care of them or because she was not mature enough.There were women in the village who already birthed two or three children even though they were her age, but Rosen didn\u2019t think much of it. The presence of a child seemed to have nothing to do with her.Besides, because she had been undernourished for a long time. It was the same until the spring of her sixteenth year. Emily examined Rosen with worry, but there was always nothing wrong. Then Rosen would say, \u2018No news is good news\u2019, and while she was giggling, Emily pinched her sweetly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

More importantly, the imaginary child would never be Hindley Haworth\u2019s. She would run away before that.Emily, on the other hand, desperately wanted a child of her own. It was her desperate wish. Emily said she didn\u2019t even care if it was a child of Hindley\u2019s blood.\u201cWon\u2019t you hate it if the baby is the same as Hindley?\u201d\u201cIf I give birth to a baby, it will be mine. I will raise him. And if Hindley has a child, he might change.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s raise them together. Then Hindley\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t believe it, but Hindley wasn\u2019t originally a bad guy. I told you, we were old lovers. He changed after I miscarried many times.\u201dEmily was acting as if if she had a baby, everything would be fine. But a baby would never be the answer.What if she couldn\u2019t have another living baby?What if the child was a daughter?Would Hindley sit still?Nothing would change. It would be even more terrible. The number of people who got hit would increase from two to three.Every time Emily said that, Rosen asked, feeling frustrated.\u201cIs it Emily\u2019s fault? All of this?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s going to change after having a child?\u201d\u201cHe might\u2026\u201dWhere did her momentum that swung fists go from when Emily first saw Rosen?Rosen cringed when the topic of a \u2018child\u2019 came up. Emily couldn\u2019t even respond to what she said. Her heart ached.Hindley had tamed Emily with fear. Rosen had been here for months, but Emily had been here for years. And she knew how helpless the beatings were. It was the most effective means of control, even in orphanages, by the principals and teachers.If you got hit, even if you realized that it was unfair, you couldn\u2019t resist. Just watching them approach made her heart race with fear.\u201cJust promise me one thing. When winter comes, run away with me. Don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dRosen held Emily\u2019s hand with watery eyes. For this situation to end peacefully without running away, either they or Hindley had to die. However, Hindley was fine even though she prayed every night that he would drop dead while drinking.[Fellow citizens of the Empire, I\u2019m Ian Kerner, the commander of the Leoarton Squadron. This is a formal notice that an air strike alert is being issued. Talas\u2019 squadron is currently flying towards Leoarton. Close your doors and take your valuables\u2026]And the war continued.No one believed it would be over soon.The sirens rang more and more frequently, and they quickly got used to Ian Kerner\u2019s voice.Hindley didn\u2019t use the basement cellar as a shelter. The facility was too unreliable to protect his precious life. Every time an air raid alarm went off, he fled, alone, to a large shelter in town where his friends were.It didn\u2019t matter to Rosen, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel twisted when she saw him running away. She spat, throwing up her middle finger at his back when she was sure he was too far away to hear her.\u201cCoward. Get hit by a bomb on the way home!\u201dEmily usually laughed until she was out of breath when Rosen said things like that. It had always been that way. Hindley occupying a large part of her life didn\u2019t stop her from cursing him. She believed that Emily loved her more than Hindley.But something was wrong that day. Emily just dragged Rosen down to the basement without laughing.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, Rosen.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dRosen felt unusual and asked. Emily did not answer. They held hands as they walked down the narrow stairs. Neither of them could say anything. After a while, when the gas light went out, and darkness enveloped them, Emily crouched down and opened her mouth with difficulty.\u201cWhen you run away\u2026 Go alone.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go.\u201dShe had an ominous feeling as Emily wrapped her arms around her belly and bowed her head. Without covering her ears to avoid the siren. Rosen stared at Emily\u2019s flat stomach.\u201cI\u2019m with child.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know my body. This is my last chance. If I lose this child, I\u2019ll never have one. I\u2019ve lost so many children\u2026\u201dRosen didn\u2019t understand. Emily\u2019s voice trembled. It was difficult to drag a pregnant woman and run away. No, it was almost impossible. But Emily had said she would go anyway.\u2018Let\u2019s go and give birth to your baby wherever we go. I\u2019m not leaving alone. Of course, I will go with Emily.\u2019\u201cYou promised.\u201d\u201cRosen, I-\u201c\u201cYou promised!\u201dRosen wasn\u2019t upset about the fact that Emily was with child. What made her angry was the deep resignation on Emily\u2019s face at that moment. Then, Rosen realized. Being with child was just an excuse. Emily had no intention of leaving Hindley from the start. Emily lied to her.She had already given up everything but pretended not to.\u201cIs it that important to prioritize a child who is not even formed yet? Hindley\u2019s child? More important than Emily herself? You promised me! We were going to run away! We won\u2019t live like this!\u201d\u201cDo you think I can run away? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be caught again!\u201d\u201cHow do you know without even trying? You\u2019ve never done it before!\u201d\u201cAnd what if I ran away? Do you think I\u2019d have a place to go? This is the safest place for me!\u201dEmily jumped up and shouted at Rosen.\u201cYou, you don\u2019t know\u2026 What it\u2019s like for me outside. If I get caught again, I\u2019m really done. Really\u2026\u201dEmily cried and pointed to the necklace around her neck. Rosen stared blankly at the d*mn thing that had constantly been strangling Emily from the moment she first saw it. The shackles kept Emily in custody and, at the same time, saved her life.Rosen knew. There was nothing she could do about it. Nothing. It was too big and too much for one person alone.\u201cIf you were going to stay anyway, then why did you promise you would run away?\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t live like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cUnlike me, you are still young, lively, and brave. Don\u2019t give up and live like me\u2026\u201dAt that moment, the anger that had gripped her whole body subsided. Rosen dropped her shaking shoulders.No more tears came out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRosen didn\u2019t fight Emily anymore. She just continued to hide the money she had saved in a space under the floorboards.\u2018Yeah, let\u2019s think about it again after the baby is born. Let\u2019s delay our escape a little and convince Emily. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019Maybe a son would come out this time, because Emily said it felt like a boy. After Emily gave birth to the son Hindley had longed for, no matter how much of a dog he was, it would be quiet for a few months.Then in the meantime, Rosen would talk Emily out of staying.\u2018Are you going to raise a precious baby under Hindley? Escape will be much easier if Hindley becomes a little more demure.\u2019To be honest, she wanted to leave the child behind, but she would never be able to convince Emily if she did.They could take turns holding the child. Couldn\u2019t they transport a baby the size of a cat to Malona? If they held a child, people would pity them and help them more.***Spring passed, summer passed, and autumn had come. Emily\u2019s stomach grew steadily. Emily breathed and walked carefully.By then, her convictions grew stronger. As Emily had long wished, this time, it seemed that a living baby would be born. According to Hindley, Emily usually had a miscarriage within five months, but this time the baby survived seven months.Seven months was almost the same as raising it, the neighbors said. Also, the attitude of Hindley, who snorted at her, saying she would have to carry another dead baby, changed. He cut down on alcohol and even picked flowers from the mountains for Emily.\u201cRosen, don\u2019t be jealous. She\u2019s pregnant, right? I have to be nice to her.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dIn the early stages of Emily\u2019s difficult pregnancy, the man who used to drink excessively was showing off.But Emily seemed content. She shyly told Rosen that Hindley seemed to have changed. Rosen could have told her his attitude would not last, but she just nodded. Emily was pregnant. She didn\u2019t want to ruin her excitement.Babies grow well when the mother is happy.If the sky and the earth were turned upside down and Hindley really changed\u2026 Then she\u2019d just have to leave this house. If that really happened, Emily and Hindley could live happily together for a long time. Of course, that wouldn\u2019t be the case.All day long, Rosen tended to the fireplace in Emily\u2019s room so that she wouldn\u2019t be cold, and secretly caught a chicken in the yard \u2013 no longer a cute chick \u2013 and made a stew. When Emily asked about the source of the meat, she said she bought it from the market.When Hindley asked where the chicken had gone, Rosen shrugged and replied that the cat had killed it. Hindley hit her, but she accepted it. She wasn\u2019t about to let the ignorant man know that the mother needed protein rather than an ugly wildflower.\u201cRosen, do you want to touch my belly? The baby is moving.\u201dRosen put her hand on Emily\u2019s round stomach. She felt its movement. It felt strange to see the creature called a baby wriggle under her fingertips.That she\u2019d have something to take care of soon.\u201cThe baby will like you, too.\u201dRosen became more and more attached to Emily. Emily\u2019s affection was like a deep color of paint, and whoever she touched was dyed as well. Rosen was now more inclined to take the baby than to leave it alone. It would be annoying, but it would be impossible to keep the child away from Emily.She thought it would be a little annoying if there were a kid who looked like Hindley, but she also thought it wouldn\u2019t matter if Emily was happy. She was not going to beat up Emily\u2019s baby. What else could she do?Even the child of Hindley Haworth needed Emily. She didn\u2019t really want to judge whether it was Emily\u2019s real wish or the result of years of brainwashing to have a baby. The baby was already forming, and it was innocent.\u201cWhat should we name it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Not yet. I\u2019ll decide when it\u2019s born.\u201d\u201cAre you still anxious? Seeing the momentum of the baby kicking, it will cry loudly even if you take it out of your stomach right now.\u201dRosen laughed as she sewed the baby\u2019s clothes.Emily smiled faintly.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve carried a baby safely for so long. I don\u2019t think I should get excited\u2026 It\u2019s not easy to be as happy as others. Everything is going well, so I\u2019m rather anxious. Do you know what it feels like to be insecure because you\u2019re so happy? Hindley has been nice to me lately.\u201dEmily grabbed Rosen\u2019s free hand and spoke again. Emily rolled up her sleeve and gently stroked her arm, which was covered in bruises from beatings. It wasn\u2019t made by Emily, but she cried as if she had done it herself. After she got pregnant, Emily rode the ups and downs of her emotions.\u201cRosen. I\u2019m sorry I hit you when I first met you. I was so angry at that moment that I was out of my mind. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny. Now I can\u2019t imagine what I would have done without you.\u201dRosen laughed. She hated Hindley, but she didn\u2019t regret marrying him. Because she met Emily.Emily was the only one she could call a friend, and the only one who truly loved her throughout her life.Thinking of how she met Emily through Hindley, she could always tell the disgusting lie of \u2018I love you, Hindley\u2019 without blinking.\u201cMe, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMe, too, Emily.\u201dRosen loved Emily. Looking back, it was the first and last pure love she had for someone. It was a clear and transparent affection with no point of selfishness.That was why she just couldn\u2019t leave Emily next to Hindley. Even if Emily loved Hindley more than she did, even if she said she didn\u2019t want to leave his side, Hindley would definitely beat Emily to death one day.Someone said that true love makes the other person live the way they want, but\u2026At least her love wasn\u2019t that kind of thing. Emily looked calmer than ever, but she didn\u2019t intend to leave her alone. Rosen didn\u2019t want to wait for the day she gave up and died.She always thought when she looked at Emily\u2019s belly. She wanted the baby to come out soon. If possible, a quiet baby that resembled Emily a lot.***Rosen started her first period that fall. She wiped the evidence away with a cloth, alone. She didn\u2019t want to upset Emily, who was about to give birth. Emily was the first wife, and she was the second, though it was nominal.Moreover, after she started her period, she had only had s*x with Hindley once.She didn\u2019t know if it was difficult for a pregnant first wife to stay in the same house and eat with the second wife or if it was just because of her age and her lack of energy. She thought the latter was likely. Anyway, Hindley hardly touched Rosen after Emily was pregnant.Rosen never used contraception. She didn\u2019t even know how to. Emily didn\u2019t teach her either. Maybe it was because she didn\u2019t bleed when she was supposed to and her body looked so immature.Rosen also knew that if she had s*x after she started her first period, she could have a child. But it was really just once. A very brief relationship that didn\u2019t last more than three minutes, in which Hindley penetrated her while she was sleeping, pressed it in with force, and then withdrew.Ignorance sometimes brings tragedy. One might call ignorance a sin, too. But she didn\u2019t want to. It could be frustrating and suffocating, but it couldn\u2019t be a sin.There were unavoidable things in the world. Rosen didn\u2019t even want to think that it was her fault. Even if the whole world criticized her\u2026 she didn\u2019t want to do that. She did nothing wrong.Because no one taught her. Because she didn\u2019t know what she needed to.***In the winter, when she was sixteen, Emily gave birth after sixteen hours of labor. The child was a boy, as Hindley had hoped, but his heart had stopped by the time he came out. Hindley couldn\u2019t change his nature, so he had gone to the racetrack that day, drank alcohol, and stayed out. He must have been the last in the neighborhood to know that the child had died.Emily cried for a very long time, and didn\u2019t let Rosen into her room, so she sat in front of her door and wept together.Hindley returned late at night and swung his belt. He smashed furniture, shouted, and cursed them as \u2018useless b*tches\u2019. Rosen was hit terribly that day. It was to stop Hindley, who tried to break Emily\u2019s closed door with a hammer.She couldn\u2019t help it. She couldn\u2019t let a mother who had lost her baby less than a day ago be beaten mercilessly.Rosen grabbed Hindley\u2019s leg and screamed.\u201cAre you human? Are you still a human being, you son of a b*tch? Even a beast knows that a female who gave birth is precious!\u201d\u201cSo she had the baby?\u201d\u201cD*mn, then you give birth! You give birth to the son you want so much!\u201d\u201cThis b*tch pretends to be meek and finally reveals her true nature? I\u2019ll kill you!

Rosen rebelled against him for the first time. The hammer wielded by Hindley left a blue bruise on her shin* and she gnawed her teeth, but Rosen still defended Emily\u2019s room. Only when the doorknob broke, she stopped resisting and fell to her knees, begging him to let Emily go.[*T/N: Shin \u2013 the front of the leg below the knee.]\u201cYou guys were always useless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hindley, stop. Please don\u2019t hit Emily. She just gave birth! Hit me instead. I won\u2019t rebel anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy are you covering for her? You are my wife, not her friend! Know who you are!\u201d\u201c\u2026Please!\u201d\u201cGet a grip and act like a wife! A wife!\u201dHindley really didn\u2019t seem to understand what Rosen was doing. Rosen rather couldn\u2019t understand Hindley. How could he possibly think that she would be on his side? Just because she was his second wife and Emily was his first?That was no reason for Rosen to like Hindley and dislike Emily.Who fed her when she was hungry?Who had listened to her and taught her about the world since she came to this house?Who really understood and loved her?Was that Hindley?\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve done wrong. So don\u2019t waste your energy on her and go to the horse race that you like. Money, you came home because you didn\u2019t have enough money. I\u2019ll help you out. I have some money left, an emergency fund. I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201dBut she did what Hindley wanted. As long as the hammer-wielding Hindley could be removed from Emily\u2019s face, it didn\u2019t matter. Rosen lifted a floorboard, took out all the money, and put it in Hindley\u2019s hand.\u201cYou can get a son from me later, not from an old b*tch like Emily. Me and Hindley are still young. So please\u2026 I\u2019m so scared. Hang out somewhere else today.\u201d**Just a week later, her period was cut off. Rosen stared blankly down at her underwear, went straight to her closet, and pulled out a hanger*. She walked into the bathroom, the bathtub with water, and sat down.[*E/N: When women have unwanted pregnancies and don\u2019t have access to safe ways to terminate the baby, a hanger is sometimes used. However, this method can seriously injure or even kill the mother.]She never imagined it. She couldn\u2019t even understand. How could a baby, which Emily tried so long, earnestly, and with all her efforts for, so easily entangle in her own body, which had never wanted one? Who designed life to be so unfair?Rosen didn\u2019t know how much she cried.It was only when someone lifted her swollen face that she came to her senses. The bathroom door was open. A skinny Emily was looking at her with a worried expression.\u201cHow did you get in here? I locked the door\u2026\u201dEmily pointed to her necklace without saying a word. The brown gem had turned a sickly green. It was then that Rosen realized that she had really worried Emily. Emily never used magic unless there were dire circumstances.\u201cRosen, get up. Let\u2019s go to the bedroom and talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStop being silly.\u201dEmily snatched the hanger from Rosen\u2019s hand. Rosen rebelled, clenching her teeth and holding on to the hanger.\u201cI don\u2019t want to have this baby. I\u2019d rather die than give birth. I\u2019m gonna jump into the coal furnace and die. At least let me hang myself\u2026\u201dRosen knew that it was not something to say in front of Emily, who lost her child many times. But she couldn\u2019t stand it. Rosen thought Emily would get mad at her.But Emily didn\u2019t get angry. She didn\u2019t even hit Rosen like she did on the first day. Just hugged her tightly.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRosen, I am a witch. I deal with medicinal herbs. Why are you doing this, alone? I can get rid of a fetus. It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s all right.\u201dEmily clenched her teeth and pulled the hanger out of Rosen\u2019s hands. The necklace once again shone green, and the hanger was turned into ash and scattered.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Emily. By saying this\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be sorry about. Why are you sorry to me? I should have taught you how to use contraception earlier. I think- I\u2019m sorry, Rosen.\u201dRosen burst into tears that she had held back. She wept and laughed. It was because she remembered a conversation she had with Emily just a few months ago. They were in opposite positions. Only then did she understand Emily\u2019s helplessness.\u201cRosen, let\u2019s run away. I won\u2019t hesitate this time.\u201d\u201cI lost all my money.\u201d\u201cYou can collect it again.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t get caught by Hindley.\u201d\u201cI know. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll never get caught.\u201dWas there any other irresponsible and comfortable word than \u2018never\u2019? But she wanted to hold onto Emily\u2019s \u2018never.\u2019\u201cLast time, you helped me. It\u2019s my turn, Rosen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou were right. I was a coward who gave up without even trying. Now let\u2019s do as you say. If I fall on the way, you\u2019ll help me up, and if you get tired, I\u2019ll carry you on my back.\u201d\u201cEmily\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to Malona. Let\u2019s go far away and live really happily. We won\u2019t be alone.\u201dEmily took something out of her apron pocket and held it out, wiping away the tears that had pooled in Rosen\u2019s eyes. Rosen stared blankly at the shape and asked.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI bought it to make you feel better.\u201dRosen took it and burst into laughter. Emily smiled brightly. It was Ian Kerner propaganda. It was a new one, or one that she hadn\u2019t seen. Unlike his typical propaganda, the letters were big and his face was small.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what it says? I asked the people I bought it from, do you want me to teach you?\u201d\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201dEven though Rosen had heard it often, the words that came out of Emily\u2019s mouth at that moment felt very special.Rosen copied her words quietly.\u201c\u2026We will win.\u201d\u201cYes, Rosen. We will win.\u201dEmily hugged her again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she came back from the market a little late, he grabbed hold of her and asked where she had been.It was around that time that he began to think that Rosen was having an affair.Things were not looking good. She couldn\u2019t afford to take things slow anymore.She stole quite a bit of money from Hindley\u2019s coat pocket on three occasions. It was risky, but not difficult. Much easier than stealing food from the orphanage. All Rosen had to do was put a drink in the cupboard and wait for Hindley to get drunk.Emily packed their clothes and food.They decided to disguise themselves as a traveling couple. Rosen found Hindley\u2019s old ID card deep in a drawer.To get to Malona from Leoarton, you had to go through the small town of Saint Vinnes\u00e9e.The problem was that they could walk from Saint Vinnes\u00e9e to Malona, but they had to take a train or wagon from Leoarton to Saint Vinnes\u00e9e. The Tobe Mountains, the only road connecting Leoarton and Saint Vinnes\u00e9e, was infested with beasts.Walking would make them a snack for beasts.\u201cShall we ride a carriage?\u201d\u201cThe train is fine. There are a lot of people there, so the checkpoints will be weak.\u201dAfter much deliberation, they chose the train. It seemed safer to hide in the crowd. To rent a wagon, you had to present your personal ID, which was too risky.Rosen had no choice but to put her hopes on the negligence of the train ticket office. The ticket office had already been taken over by soldiers. They took advantage of the desperate refugees to sell tickets for illegal profit.A train ticket to Malona was already three times the regular price. In other words, if you gave them enough money, you could get through without due process.By that time, Rosen was taller than Emily. On the day of their escape, she cut her hair short. She put on a hat and a fake beard. Emily wore a red scarf to cover her necklace.They left home in the middle of the night, after dr*gging Hindley.***The train station was full of refugees. Every time a steam locomotive pulled up to the platform with a roaring hiss, people rushed into it like grains of sand. It was so bad that Rosen wondered if the residents of Leoarton, who had led an easygoing daily life, were actually fools deceived by the government.There were far more people than expected, so they panicked. Just three days ago, the train station was not this packed. It was so crowded that it was impossible to see the ticket office. Emily grabbed a middle-aged woman who seemed the least interested in her surroundings and asked.\u201cWhy are there so many people?\u201d\u201cAre you asking because you don\u2019t know? Another raid happened in the South a few days ago! Two cities were completely destroyed. The people who were going to stay home changed their minds, and all packed up!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear that on the radio.\u201d\u201cAre you stupid? It\u2019s been a long time since the government started controlling radio broadcasts.\u201d\u201cI did not know. We\u2019re from Leoarton\u2026\u201d\u201cJust stay at home. Getting tickets to Malona is like plucking a star from the sky! Don\u2019t you know how many people are anxious to settle down in Leoarton?\u201dThe woman was annoyed. As the woman\u2019s voice rose, the children hanging from her skirt burst into tears. The woman seemed to have lost all her composure, yelling at her children not to cry.\u201cNo, we have to go. How long do I have to wait to buy a ticket?\u201d\u201cLook over there! They are all lining up!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have been waiting for six hours, even though I paid five times the regular price. If you\u2019re going to buy it at full price, there\u2019s really no guarantee.\u201dThey were frozen. The lines overlapping and tangling in several layers were already beyond recognition. Rosen calculated how much medicine she had put into Hindley\u2019s glass and how much time there would be until he woke up and realized that they were gone.The conclusion was simple.They had to hurry.\u201cSix hours\u2026\u201d\u201cEmily, how much money do you have left?\u201d\u201cI was originally going to buy it for three times as much. If you want to buy it for five times\u2026 Even if we do that, it\u2019s six hours, so\u2026\u201dMoney could be stolen again. Rosen never thought the day would come when her pickpocket skills would be helpful. If they took the train, they could at least escape Hindley.\u201c\u2026We will go to Saint Vinnes\u00e9e and think. We need to get out of Leoarton as soon as possible.\u201dThey told her that she had to pay just to get to the ticket office. She grabbed a soldier wearing a khaki uniform. She lowered her voice as much as possible and gave strength to her stomach. She couldn\u2019t look suspicious or feminine. There were so many hardships to overcome.\u201cI need a train ticket to Malona.\u201dBut as soon as the soldier looked down at her, Rosen\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but start pounding with fear. It had been a long time since she had been in a place with a lot of people, and it had been a long time since she had talked to anyone other than Hindley or Emily.\u201cI beg your pardon. I can\u2019t hear anything.\u201dThe soldier stuck a finger into his ear. Rosen thought her voice was small. She didn\u2019t know how much of a coward the bloody Hindley had made her. Rosen squeezed Emily\u2019s hand as hard as she could and spoke again.\u201cTwo train tickets to Malona!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026There is money.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201dRosen took a bill out of her pocket and showed it to the soldier. He glanced at it and he blinked without saying a word.\u201cFollow me.\u201dSoon a group of soldiers surrounded them and took their money. The train ticket to Malona suddenly became available for six times the regular price. Rosen doubted whether these b*stards were scammers or soldiers.After the men emptied their wallets, Rosen and Emily were led to a line that looked the shortest. But it was equally terrifying. The soldier sitting at the ticket office was the size of a thumb. Still, the waiting time continued to increase due to the clash of clamoring refugees and soldiers trying to negotiate prices higher.Three hours?Four?It was overwhelming.What if Hindley woke up early?A second felt like a year. The line had shrunk sensibly. Emily looked at Rosen, who was biting her nails, and whispered softly with a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, honey.\u201dWithout realizing it, Rosen let out a small laugh.Honey.It was a name she had never used for Hindley. Emily rummaged through her bag and put a piece of her candy in her mouth.It was cinnamon, Rosen\u2019s favorite.\u201cDid you really pack these little things?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what you like. A must for train travel. Is this your first time riding a train?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never been out of Leoarton.\u201d\u201cIt will be fun. Everything will be fine\u2026 \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You look more suspicious if you are nervous. Just like if you want to steal something expensive, you must be brazen. In Rosen\u2019s experience, trembling or being scared didn\u2019t help much. While chewing on the candy, she tricked herself into believing this was a journey to happiness.How many times had she repeatedly nodded while looking at the line and tmoving forward?It was around the time when bluish dawn rose over the platform that the long line began to come to an end.Five people.Four people.Three people.They were finally able to stand in front of the ticket office. The soldier sitting in the booth was the one who guided them to the line earlier. The rest seemed to be tired of collecting money, so they sat, playing cards.Rosen uttered quietly, hoping he wouldn\u2019t remember her at all.\u201cTwo tickets to Malona\u2026\u201d\u201cGive me your ID.\u201dRosen took the fake ID out of her bag and held it out as he instructed. But things didn\u2019t go smoothly. The soldier in front of her looked at the ID card Rosen gave him and stared intently at it.\u201cHe looks just like that sissy earlier.\u201d\u201cOh, that sweet little wretch and his wife?\u201d\u201cIs he finally here?\u201dThe soldiers who were playing cards turned their heads in unison with interested expressions. Rosen kept her mouth shut, not knowing what was wrong.Was she caught forging her ID?A cold sweat ran down her back. Emily was also fidgety and gripped the straps of their bag.Suddenly they grabbed Emily\u2019s wrist, throwing her ID card away, causing her to scream. Rosen was startled and shouted at them, forgetting for a moment that she shouldn\u2019t make a fuss.\u201cPay seven times.\u201d\u201cWhat?! It was six times earlier\u2026 \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, let me bed your wife once.\u201d\u201cDogs!\u201d\u201cEight times for your arrogance. Or you can give me your b*tt instead because you look pretty.\u201dThey giggled.\u201cI knew it would be like that.\u201dRosen realized. It had nothing to do with forging her ID or not paying enough money. They were doing this for fun. Just like the soldiers who walked around Leoarton, teasing married women and threatening maidens\u2026She looked weak \u2018like a girl\u2019 and Emily was a woman.Rosen jumped in and tried to get Emily away from them. But she didn\u2019t have enough strength. Screams and laughter intertwined in the air.\u201cLet me go. I\u2019ll pay eight times. I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201dRosen finally begged. That was always the only thing she could do. But they didn\u2019t seem to want to let go of the toy they had caught.She thought of Hindley Haworth woefully at that moment.If it was Hindley standing here, would Emily be safe?Yeah, Hindley wouldn\u2019t have looked easy because he was big. At least he wasn\u2019t helpless like her.\u201cI\u2019ll give you what you want!\u201dThere was no place they could go. Maybe he was right\u2026As soon her despair and misery peaked, Rosen noticed a handgun lying on the table. She stared at the pistol. It was calling her.\u2018Get him, Rosen. Just kill him.\u2019\u2018There\u2019s no other way. Just kill them all, and you, too.\u2019She soon realized the identity of the emotion. It was a murderous impulse. When you reach the bottom of your despair, the idea of giving up is expressed destructively.It was when she started reaching for the gun, possessed.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201cAt that moment, someone shouted and burst into the ticket office. The disturbance stopped at once. While she shouted until there was blood in her throat, the b*stards who acted as if their ears were blocked let go of Emily and lined up in perfect order.\u201cCaptain!\u201dIt was a man who looked quite old. There were a lot of unknown badges and symbols stuck to his chest. He must\u2019ve been a man of high rank. Rosen looked up at him with a ray of hope, leaving misery behind.His eyes met hers.\u2018Oh, he has gray eyes.\u2019Unconsciously, Rosen thought of Ian Kerner.Of course, Ian Kerner was completely different in appearance, age, and atmosphere, but they were similar in color.Driven by an irrational impulse, she opened her mouth to tell him how wrong she had been treated. Maybe he would listen. Because he\u2019s tall, he might be different from these fucking b*stards.Like Ian Kerner\u2026[I\u2019ll protect you.][I\u2019m from Leoarton\u2026]But before she could say anything, he reached out and ripped the fake beard off her face. Rosen came to her senses as if she had been drenched in cold water. Her mind went blank.And someone came into the ticket office.It was Hindley Haworth with a mean smile.\u201cHere you are my wives. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful, Captain.\u201dThey murmured about something. Then they smiled at each other, exchanged words of blessing, and shook hands. Rosen didn\u2019t understand the situation at all.How was it so easy?How did Hindley Haworth do it so easily?It was so hard for her to buy a train ticket\u2026When Rosen came to her senses, she was being dragged by the hair. The captain handcuffed Emily and carried her to the carriage brought by Hindley.Rosen hung on like a madman.\u201cPlease don\u2019t send us home. We are going to die if we go back. He\u2019s right. He\u2019s right, but\u2026 he hit me!\u201dShe rolled up her sleeves and raised her skirt. Showing her scars, Rosen shouted.\u201cWe did run away! But he hit me! I\u2019m going to die!\u201dBut no one listened. They didn\u2019t even look at her. No one helped her.\u201cYou said you\u2019d protect me\u2026\u201dRosen realized that asking for help was stupid. The world wasn\u2019t on her side.It wasn\u2019t her they were protecting. It was Hindley.[I\u2019ll protect you.]But even after she realized it, she shouted to the end. She felt like she had to shout.She didn\u2019t want to give up.It was so unfair.\u201cYou said you\u2019d protect me! You dogs! You said you\u2019d protect us!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reason why I said I didn\u2019t like soldiers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it really too much? Thinking back on it, I should have shot them all.\u201dThere was moisture on the duvet. Ian\u2019s hand touched her cheek. Only then did Rosen realize that she was crying.She was grabbing Ian Kerner by the shirt and hitting him in the chest, in place of that unknown captain who sentenced her to certain death.Why was that d*mn soldier\u2019s eyes the same color as Ian Kerner\u2019s? If they weren\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t have felt betrayed by the innocent Ian, who wasn\u2019t even there.\u201cBad guys. D*mn them b*stards.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure they were all killed during the raid, right? Good. I escaped from prison and survived. Go to hell, they should all go to hell!\u201dIt was strange.Tears that didn\u2019t come when she was talking about being beaten by Hindley suddenly started falling. Crying in front of a soldier, complaining that she didn\u2019t like them. She didn\u2019t want to do such a stupid thing.It seemed that her tears were stimulated by anger and resentment rather than sadness.\u201cSorry. I will apologize instead. Even though it\u2019s too late\u2026 \u201d\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d\u201cBecause I am a soldier.\u201dHe could have stopped her, but Ian\u00a0 let her hit him. It was so sad that tears began to flow again.\u201cYou are so strong. Only my fist hurts.\u201d\u201cIt looks like it hurts.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t cry, Rosen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there then. Please don\u2019t cry.\u201dHe kept on wiping the tears from her eyes, and Rosen just stared at him, realizing it was no use. She remembered the first time she met him. He said the same thing to her.How could \u2018don\u2019t cry\u2019 sound so different?He seemed to realize that these were her real tears. Surprisingly, he was a person who was weakened by sincerity.\u201cWould things have been different if you were there?\u201d\u201c\u2026If they were my lieutenants, I would have shot them myself.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t just say you would have killed them, did you?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cWould you have been okay?\u201d\u201cYes. Because I\u2019m a higher rank.\u201d\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t abuse your rank like that. Sir Kerner, do you know how harsh you are on your own men? Like Henry. It\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t lose to Talas.\u201d\u201cThey used their power to take advantage of citizens who were supposed to be protected by them, and ended up killing them. They deserve to be shot.\u201dIan\u2019s tone was so serious that Rosen had to laugh, even with tears in her eyes.\u201cI hate guns. It\u2019s too convenient. I don\u2019t like letting people die that easily.\u201d\u201cThen how do you like it?\u201dRosen burst out laughing again. It just didn\u2019t make sense. Maybe it was because of the gas lamp that was filling the bedroom with hazy light, but somehow all of this felt like it was a dream.Rosen was burdening him with things that were gone, she couldn\u2019t relive, and weren\u2019t even his fault. But Ian Kerner was taking it all. After the war was over, they met as a prisoner and a jailer. Now she was holding his hand and lying side by side.\u201cYou have to die in pain. That\u2019s fair. Like a knife. Have you ever stabbed a person with a knife?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dRosen suddenly realized that Ian Kerner was a pilot. Knights with swords lost their usefulness and were trapped in fairy tales, but the sword was still an important weapon in close combat.Even after ten years of war, he had never stabbed a person. When she remembered that he was in the Air Force and only flew fighters, she suddenly felt uneasy. She frowned as he smiled strangely.\u201cBut the Air Force receives that level of training.\u201dIt was an uncharacteristically childish answer. Rosen giggled and wiped her tear-soaked face on the hem of his uniform. He didn\u2019t stop her. It occurred to her that it had been a while since he had let her have her own way to this extent.\u201cYou don\u2019t like killing people. Would you have done that for me?\u201d\u201cI already have a lot of blood on my hands. A few more men wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Especially if they deserved to die.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay. I have blood on me, too. At least that\u2019s what people say. Then it\u2019s no different, is it? If I could go back, I would\u2019ve killed them all.\u201dThere was a moment of silence. He opened his mouth quietly, trying to determine if what she said was true.\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, did I?\u201dRosen laughed triumphantly. He stared at her with a stiff expression.\u201cActually, whenever I lost strength while escaping from prison, I thought about that moment. To be honest, prisoners are cooler than abused wives, and escapees are cooler than prisoners. As a result, I became very famous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDid I talk too much? I\u2019m proud of being an escaped prisoner. I shouldn\u2019t have said that to you. But you told me not to lie. I guess this is what I really mean.\u201dHe hugged her so tightly that she couldn\u2019t talk any more. The sleeping powder envelope rustled under her dress.\u201cYou know, this is just a question, but would you have killed Hindley Haworth as well? If you were a soldier patrolling Leoarton.\u201dWas there anything more empty than a \u2018what if\u2019 question?But she asked anyway. Meaninglessness could sometimes be comforting.\u2018If I could turn back the clock.\u2019\u2018If you were by my side back then.\u2019\u2018If I made a different choice\u2026\u2019He stared at her and was silent for a while.She giggled and added.\u201cJust lie. You know the answer I want to hear.\u201d\u201cKill\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI would\u2019ve stabbed him with a knife, as you said.\u201dRosen stopped laughing.She was just joking, but his voice was too deep when he responded. He sounded a lot more sincere than when he said he would have shot those men if he was their lieutenant.An answer that was too heavy for a light question.No, looking back\u2026 In fact, she may have been the only one who was joking from the beginning.Maybe, from the beginning\u2026There was a deep silence where even the sound of breathing could be heard. She got up from the bed as the gas light flickered out. The moment the room was enveloped in darkness, an answer came back once more.\u201c\u2026I would have really killed him.\u201d\u201cOh my gosh. Then you would have gone to jail instead of me.\u201dAt that moment, she was overcome with a strange feeling. Her heartbeat grew louder, almost unbearable. She slowly turned away from him.\u201cRosen. Go to sleep. It\u2019s late.\u201d\u201cAre you going to chain me up again when I fall asleep?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think about that. I\u2019ll be watching you until dawn.\u201dDifficult problems were solved like that in an instant.It was funny, but true.Answers always come at an unexpected moment. Not when she was going over written formulas and holding her head, but when she was staring blankly at a candle\u2019s flames. The scattered pieces were put together, and she came to realize what the answer was.Gravity lost its balance.Victory leaned towards her.Because he-\u2018Oh, let\u2019s not think about it. Don\u2019t even say it out loud. Let\u2019s not express it in words.\u2019The moment a vague sense became a concrete language and resonated within her, she would not be able to handle it.There was no need to ask. It was a momentary delusion created by the environment of a prison ship, compassion, atonement, a desperate search for relief, or merely an expression of desire or conquest.But it didn\u2019t matter.It didn\u2019t matter at all.The important thing was that she had lost her cool.Ian Kerner started to believe her. He drank the poisoned chalice she gave him. She didn\u2019t want to know if that was his choice or if it was forced.\u2018How is he looking at me now?\u2019She suddenly remembered the sleeping powder envelope in her dress. That was the only thing that meant anything to her at this moment.\u2018Okay.\u2019\u2018I will not be shaken.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s started to believe in me, but I can never trust him.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIan Kerner was lost in thought. Thinking was one of the things he did best. He liked it, too. Having to empty his mind was what bothered him the most during the war.War was an unanswered problem. The more you think about it, the more complicated and worse it gets. Maybe that was why he was broken from within. Thoughts that were supposed to be dealt with later came rushing in all at once as soon as he sat in the cockpit.The thoughts that haunted him were more guilt than regret. He always knew the weight of his choices behind that steering wheel. And from moment to moment, he made the best choices. So he never thought \u2018maybe\u2019, \u2018if I did that\u2019 and \u2018what if\u2019.So\u2026 he didn\u2019t regret it.Because there was no other way.Choosing the Air Force, following unreasonable orders, broadcasting propaganda, gaining unwanted honor and becoming a hero.But the moment he stood in front of Rosen Walker, he began to feel meaningless regret. Like standing in front of a tangled thread, not knowing where to start. Come to think of it, he felt like that from the beginning. It was annoying and awkward. Unwilling to admit that to himself, he turned to Rosen with anger, as if she were an old foe.If he hadn\u2019t chosen the Air Force, he would have been on the ground instead of in the sky. If that were the case, would he have met her in Leoarton earlier? When he met her at the ticket office, he would have been able to protect her.No, actually, that was just an excuse. He had many other opportunities.When Rosen first broke out, he should have visited the jail when he saw Rosen\u2019s face in that newspaper article, using curiosity and compassion as an excuse. At the very least, he should have looked Rosen in the eyes and listened to her story.He should have gone to the courtroom instead of cheering for her secretly. He should have been on Rosen Walker\u2019s side, who loudly proclaimed her innocence, and he should have sat down and judged his own guilt.But he just stared. He shouldn\u2019t have left Rosen to handle everything alone.If he had, would something have changed? Would he feel alive again?[I will protect you.]Rosen had always believed in him. The distant words which were sincere but had no grounds to support them.And now the end was coming. As soon as the ship arrived at Monte Island, his mission would end. But Ian Kerner could no longer complete this mission on his own. He rose from his seat and opened the sea chart, knowing that there was no answer.\u2018I can\u2019t let you cross the sea. You\u2019ll die in pain. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can kill you. I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u2018You are the only one I saved.\u2019\u2018You must not die in front of me. You shouldn\u2019t go to such a prison for a crime you didn\u2019t commit. You\u2026.\u2019He looked at the chart for a long time and then touched his forehead. There was no way out. Like that time six years ago, he finally had to put his head down on his desk without finding an answer.There were more things that he couldn\u2019t do on his own.-Come on, Sir Kerner. You too.So Ian Kerner made a wish on a cake for the first time in his life. Walpurg only loved girls, and his prayers would not reach the ears of the great witch. But there were moments when he needed magic, too.One drop of blood, one wish, and some magic.If Rosen were a real witch, it would have been nice if the price was blood. He had it, too. He had innocent blood on his hands, and the little blood flowing through his body would not be enough to repay it\u2026***As the sun began to rise, a knock was heard. Ian didn\u2019t bother waking Rosen from his sleep. He waited quietly until Henry Reville unlocked the door with his key.Henry stared alternately at Rosen, who was asleep without handcuffs, and him, who was standing in front of the desk with a tired face, and sat down, clutching his head.\u201cIt happened. I knew it.\u201dHenry was already convinced of what he saw.\u201cYou like her, right? D*mn it! Why is my gut instinct always right?! I saw her kissing Sir on the deck yesterday.\u201d\u201cYou are noisy.\u201d\u201cLook in the mirror now. Look! Look at yourself and deny it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t deny it.\u201dIn response, Henry grabbed his head. His boss was a man of infinite rationality in public affairs, but terrible with personal affairs.\u201cI told you not to deny it, you aren\u2019t anymore\u2026 she really lives up to her name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn fact, this ship wasn\u2019t the first time you met her, was it?\u201d\u201cTell me what happened this morning. If it weren\u2019t urgent, you wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d\u201cIs there anything more important than this right now?\u201dHenry wrinkled his eyebrows and started to cry. Ian stood tall and looked down at the youngest soldier in his squadron and the only lieutenant left by his side. The child, who had once only reached his chest, grew up and now came to his nose, proudly facing him and nagging.\u201cWhy do you make your life so hard? Why are cold-hearted people so foolish about personal matters? You always do crazy things when it\u2019s critical. You left the army and navy that were barely hanging on, and refused to reverse your choice!\u201d\u201cAlso the Air Force.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that now!\u201d\u201c\u2026Henry.\u201d\u201cWhy would you ruin a life that you\u2019re comfortable with? I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s why I risked my life for ten years and fought a war. I said that after the end of the war, you could live comfortably, but now you\u2019re in love with a woman who will die soon? A prisoner hated by the whole Empire?\u201d\u201c\u2026I asked you to tell me what you wanted.\u201dHenry ignored him and walked to the bed. Henry sullenly pulled his pistol from his belt.\u201cSir, can you really kill her? I mean, do you mind if I shoot her instead? It\u2019s better than going to the island.\u201dHenry was holding the gun as if he was about to pull the trigger. Henry\u2019s anger was fully conveyed even through his level voice. But Ian was arguably more angry than Henry. He struck Henry\u2019s elbow to take his pistol, then threw him to the floor.\u201cLook, you can\u2019t kill her\u2026\u201dHenry didn\u2019t react at Ian as expected. He just stared at him sadly, with eyes weeping like a puppy.\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir Kerner. I really don\u2019t know about this\u2026 \u201d\u201cJust tell me why you came and what happened.\u201dIan picked up the pistol from the floor and handed it back to Henry. Henry barely stuttered out an answer.\u201c\u2026You have to go to the Captain\u2019s office. The ship won\u2019t move at all. A group of beasts surrounded the ship.\u201d\u201cYou said it was okay.\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know. This is why I hate the sea. This is the first time in my father\u2019s life that this has happened. Worse than that, there was a commotion on the deck.\u201dHenry\u2019s eyes turned to the sleeping Rosen. An ominous feeling enveloped Ian. He put on his robe and beckoned to Henry. It was the signal to come with him to the Captain\u2019s office. But Henry shook his head and stopped him.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to put Walker back in a holding cell. People are looking for her.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dAs he asked, Ian Kerner realized the reason. He didn\u2019t need to hear the answer. People never looked for Rosen after good things. They found Rosen only when they needed someone to throw a stone at.\u201c\u2026The witch stopped the boat with magic. Everyone is crazy. Like a bunch of monkeys\u2014\u201d\u201cWake her up and take her. I\u2019ll go to the Captain\u2019s room.\u201dHe interrupted Henry and ordered. Ian Kerner watched Henry wake up the half-asleep Rosen, throw her a cloak, and drag her out. The door slammed closed. On the floor, there was a red scarf that Rosen had taken last night. He sighed and picked it up, wrapping it around his neck.When people needed a witch, a hero had to appear. He had to go outside to pull gazes away from her. Now it was time for him to return to being the fighter pilot in a red scarf.-Do you think the world wants to know the truth? No one is curious about that. Pretend not to, but you need witches as much as heroes.But it was time to move on again. An object stood out in the corner of his vision. He paused for a moment and turned his head. Something inside the glass bottle on the desk was glistening gold in the dark of the bluish dawn.It was the lucky coin that Rosen gave to Layla.No, it was a fairytale.-Why did you give Layla the coin?-Coin?-Rosen didn\u2019t lie. It really is a lucky coin. I thought I was going to die, but I\u2019m alive!Now it could no longer be called a fairytale.It really turned into gold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Ian Kerner arrived at the Captain\u2019s room, he realized that the situation was worse than he thought. The entire radar was covered with red dots. It was a detector made by the Marine Beast Corporation.\u201cKerner, can you see that? The red dots here are all marine beasts. It\u2019s a big group. At this rate, the ship can\u2019t move until they retreat on their own.\u201d\u201cBecause of the nature of this species, they are low-aggression individuals. For some reason\u2026\u201dThe marine biologist on board was also staring at the instrument panel with a serious face. The vice-captain exclaimed impatiently at the crew.\u201cD*mn, there is a degree to being stupid. Are you stalling because you don\u2019t know why? It\u2019s a question with a clear answer. A witch is on the ship!\u201dOstensibly he was speaking to his crewman, but in reality, his words were directed at Alex Reville. The vice-captain\u2019s eyes turned to Alex. It was clearly a look of resentment. The vice-captain mumbled something to himself, nervously pacing back and forth before shouting.\u201cYou have to throw the witch into the sea! Then it\u2019ll be quiet!\u201dAlex, who had been quietly watching the fuss with his arms crossed, exploded at those words.\u201cCan you shut up?\u201d\u201cCaptain, did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cShut your mouth! How about I throw you into the sea!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re covering for the prisoner who saved your granddaughter! But has a ship ever been in a situation like this? I\u2019m sure this is the first case in more than 40 years. Then what\u2019s the cause? Think about it!\u201d\u201cLook at this guy!\u201d\u201cThe sea is angry at the witch on board. The beasts are demanding the witch as a sacrifice!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. Do you think anything will change by throwing a person overboard based on old superstitions?\u201d\u201cWhether Rosen Walker is a witch or not, we have nothing to lose by throwing her into the sea. Passengers always come first! Did the witch deceive the Captain with magic? Have you forgotten basic principles?\u201d\u201cWe are also in charge of transporting prisoners. As long as I am on this ship, a prisoner is also a passenger!\u201d\u201cSay something that makes sense! Looks like we\u2019re all going to die now! If even a single demonic beast sinks their teeth into the hull and makes a hole\u2026\u201d\u201cMy ship won\u2019t sink from such a thing! As long as I am on this ship\u2026!\u201dAlex grabbed the vice-captain by the neck, and Ian, who was standing off to the side, pulled out his pistol and put it to the vice-captain\u2019s head. The vice-captain\u2019s face turned pale. The atmosphere in the Captain\u2019s room soured in an instant.Ian pushed the gun closer to the vice-captain\u2019s face. With his finger on the trigger, he calmly listed out the facts, trying not to get emotional.\u201cIt\u2019s something the Captain doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyone who defies the Captain\u2019s order on the ship is subject to summary judgment. Even the vice-captain can be disposed of if necessary. I know you know.\u201d\u201cEven the little blue boy\u2026 \u201d\u201cI have been ordered by the government and military to safely escort prisoner 24601 of Al Capez to Monte Island. And that order takes precedence over the Captain\u2019s will, at least until the end of the mission. If anyone interferes with the mission, I can dispose of not only the Captain but the vice-captain.\u201dIan Kerner\u2019s stark choice of words and gun pointed at his head caused the vice-captain\u2019s face to turn blue and red. Looking between Ian and Alex alternately, he burst into laughter, amazed. Ian continued.\u201cRosen Haworth has already passed the Magic Test three times before boarding the ship. The fact that she is not a witch has already been proven.\u201d\u201cYou really think so, Sir Kerner? Then you are an idiot. What a wicked, manipulative race witches are. There\u2019s a reason why they are persecuted. I\u2019m sure this was her intention when she got on board. I thought she was up to something from the start! She\u2019s trying to get back at us!\u201d\u201cIf you blame people with groundless superstitions, there will be a greater need for me to dispose of the vice-captain.\u201d\u201cI thought the witch possessed only the Captain, but our good war hero was also possessed.\u201dThe vice-captain glared at him as he slowly raised his hands. Ian did not reply. He simply put away his pistol and looked at Alex. Alex was still watching the instrument panel full of red dots with a blank face.At that moment, there was a loud noise. Layla burst in, leaving the Captain\u2019s door wide open.\u201cGrandpa! People\u2026 Rosen! Rosen\u2026\u201dAs soon as he caught the word \u2018Rosen\u2019, Alex felt a chill and ordered Ian.\u201cGo out on deck, Ian.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSomething must have happened to Miss Walker.\u201dAlex didn\u2019t have to say more. Ian Kerner had already begun to act and grabbed Layla, storming out of the Captain\u2019s door.***As they left the cabin, the cold winter wind hit her face as if it were going to tear her apart. Her consciousness, which had been clouded by fatigue a moment ago, became clear. Ian Kerner\u2019s voice came to mind when she was half asleep.[Wake her up and take her with you. I will go to the Captain\u2019s room and the deck.]Rosen asked Henry with a grimace.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\u2019re gonna lock me up again? You promised you\u2019d let me stay free until we got to the island.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain. Come on, we have to get you back to a cell. When people come\u2026 No, maybe it\u2019s safer there.\u201d\u201cDid I get caught? That I was in Sir Kerner\u2019s office the whole time?\u201d\u201cNo, but I think that would have been better. This is\u2026\u201dShe could tell that something unusual had happened.It was a time when no one was awake except for the crew. But even though it was early in the morning, people were gathering on the deck, murmuring with hardened faces. In addition, the waves that had been calm since last night were now causing the boat to sway, enough to cause her to stumble if she stayed still.\u201cBeasts have surrounded the ship.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. I recently joined the Navy. I was in the Air Force. But I know one thing for sure. If you go out in front of the people now, they will throw you into the sea.\u201d\u201c\u2026They believe that I cast magic, and that\u2019s why the beasts want me.\u201dHe seemed to know without listening to her explanation. She wasn\u2019t surprised because it was a familiar outcome.\u201cYes, everyone thinks you\u2019re a witch. The general opinion is that the sea is angry and demands you as a sacrifice, and that the ship will not be able to move until you are thrown into the sea. There was a sense of urgency on the deck.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone is crazy. Once you\u2019re inside a cell I will be guarding it.\u201dRosen followed him without further questions. Henry covered her face with his coat and took her to the stern.As she descended the twisted rusty steel stairs, she recognized the humor of her situation. She had to go back to prison to protect herself. Even further, it was her guard who said he would protect her from the angry mob.Henry, who was ahead, groaned as if he had hit his knee on something. She burst out laughing. He spat out swear words and turned on the gas lamp.\u201cD*mn, why\u2019s it so dark here? Walker, is this how prisons are?\u201d\u201cShould a prison be bright and warm?\u201d\u201cHow did you live here?\u201d\u201cYou get used to it. In time, you\u2019ll be able to beat a rat with your bare hands.\u201dRosen answered so, but she was also surprised by the darkness that felt thicker than she remembered. It hadn\u2019t been long since she left here, but her eyes had already gotten used to the shining world.The prison was dark, even during the day. Naturally, it was almost pitch-black at dawn. Until the first time she came out of here, this dark was not unfamiliar. Enough to find her way without having to feel the wall with her hands.But now\u2026She didn\u2019t know. The heart is fragile, so it quickly gets used to warmth and adapts to hardship with difficulty. Even though she thought it was a dream, she lost her vigilance by the temporary freedom and warmth she was given.Even though she was so determined to be wary of happiness.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t act like a complete idiot. She wasn\u2019t distracted by the favor Ian Kerner showed. She touched the sleeping powder packet that was shoved in her undergarments. It was not as thick as before because half of it was poured into the drinking fountain and a wine container.\u201cWalker, why do you keep laughing? Is this the time to laugh? I\u2019m scared that you\u2019re really out of your mind.\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 it\u2019s funny. This whole situation.\u201dRosen smirked in response to Henry\u2019s words.It was a good move to put sleeping powder in the drinking fountain. You should always be thoroughly prepared for any contingency. It was unlikely that people would drink wine in this atmosphere.\u2018No, if you succeed in throwing me into the sea, will you drink then?\u2019But it would all be useless if she fell into the sea.But no matter how dire the situation was, they\u2019d drink water, and eventually be affected by the sleeping powder\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it was a race against time. With a little bit of luck, Rosen could win.She had to endure, at least until everyone on this ship was asleep. So, without rebelling, she followed Henry into the prison, quietly took off her dress, and changed into the prison uniform that had been thrown at her.The moment the iron door opened and closed again, someone spoke. It was a familiar voice.\u201cRosen?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m back.\u201dIt was Maria. Rosen smiled bitterly and shrugged. The other prisoners also stared at her as she entered. Maria looked between her neat appearance and Henry in contemplation and asked with a chuckle.\u201cDid you end up sleeping with that kid? Why are you back? Did you get caught? Or did it not go well?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m attracted to someone higher than him.\u201d\u201cWho else but him? Maybe Ian Kerner?\u201d\u201cYes. I was thrilled, really.\u201dHenry sighed, wiping his face with his hand. Maria gave Rosen an exclamation of approval and smacked her on the shoulder.\u201cGood job, Rosen. I knew you\u2019d be able to do it. I told you. But why did you come back? I told you to cling to the noble war hero and beg him to get you back on trial.\u201d\u201c\u2026Things in this world are not that easy. Now people are looking for me. I have to stay where I belong.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dRosen briefly explained her situation. Maria was stunned.\u201cSeriously? They don\u2019t believe a single test\u00a0they\u2019ve\u00a0done? Is that why Ian Kerner put you back here? Tsk. A man of no loyalty.\u201dHenry didn\u2019t think it was worth responding to Maria\u2019s words, so he sat down outside the cage and bit his lip. Knowing what Maria was expecting, Rosen grinned. But that was completely separate from Ian Kerner\u2019s affection for her.\u201cThat only happens in fairy tales. Ian Kerner is a war hero, not a prince.\u201dWhatever form of affection he had for her, Ian Kerner wouldn\u2019t let that one feeling control any part of his life. Even if he were broken, he would repeat the same actions as before, like a machine. That\u2019s how he\u2019s lived.Rosen was able to knock him off guard by weakening his mind. But she didn\u2019t expect for a second that he would be able to release her himself.\u201cSo what are you going to do? Are you going to stay here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Until the people get a little quieter.\u201d\u2018Until they fall asleep.\u2019Henry was listening, so she couldn\u2019t give Maria a specific answer. But she had really done everything she could. Now she had no choice but to pray, hoping everything would go according to plan.\u201cWhat if they come all the way here?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re locked up, what are they going to do? The only key to the prison is with him, Ian Kerner, and the Captain. The three will never open the prison door, even if people beg for it. It\u2019s important for Ian Kerner to bring me safely to the island.\u201d\u201c\u2026That kid is protecting you now?\u201d\u201cYes. Though he\u2019s not a kid. His name is Henry Reville. He\u2019ll be guarding the prison.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very reliable\u2026\u201dMaria didn\u2019t like the way Rosen was leaning against the prison wall as if she had given up, so she pulled out a cigarette and leaned towards Henry.\u201cSoldier boy. Lend me a light.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a lighter\u2026 Hey! How the hell did you get that thing while you were locked up?\u201d\u201cOh no, no. Answer me. Kid, can you keep Rosen safe?\u201d\u201cI have a gun. No matter who comes, it won\u2019t matter.\u201dMaria\u2019s face crumpled with anxiety and she asked Henry again.\u201cIf she falls into the sea, will she die?\u201dHenry laughed bitterly as if he had just heard the stupidest question in the world.\u201cWalker, can you swim?\u201dRosen shook her head. She had never left Leoarton until she was imprisoned. The biggest body of water she had seen before getting on this ship was a stream for washing clothes.\u201cMy father has been on ships for 40 years and is a dolphin in terms of swimming skills, but if she falls in without equipment, she will die within minutes. Not to mention the waves, and even if she\u2019s not eaten by a marine beast, she will die due to hypothermia\u2026\u201dHenry couldn\u2019t continue.It was because the inside of the prison, which had been engulfed in darkness, was filled with a light so bright that it burned their eyes. It was much brighter than Henry\u2019s gas lamp.When she closed her eyes tightly and opened them, all she saw was the silhouette of Henry with his hands raised. A pistol was held against his head.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with the pistol, Henry Reville.\u201dThe face of a man with a mean smile was slowly revealed in the light. The man wouldn\u2019t recognize her, but she knew the man\u2019s face clearly. Because he was the j*rk who left a deep impression on her last night.Joshua Gregory.\u201cI can\u2019t give you the prison key.\u201dHenry gritted his teeth and shouted. Henry had to take back what he said before that he was less brave than Lyla. Very few people could say that with a gun pointed at their head.\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m going to break the lock. I thought that this\u00a0cage\u00a0needed a new lock anyway.\u201dMen with crowbars stepped forward.She was dragged out as quickly as the breeze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Henry and Rosen struggled as best they could, but they couldn\u2019t stand against the power of many. She didn\u2019t know if it was the crew or the passengers who were holding her right now. The only people she could recognize were Henry, with his bright blonde hair, and Joshua Gregory, who was smirking down at her.Rosen yelled at Gregory, who looked the most excited.\u201cAre you stupid? Did you forget already? I passed the magic test in front of you! If you have any doubts that I\u2019m a witch, try again!\u201d\u201cThe stone is not on this ship. We don\u2019t even need it in the first place. If we throw you, we\u2019ll know. It is a very traditional method of identification. If you sink, you\u2019re not a witch, and if you float, you\u2019re a witch.\u201d\u201cHow many centuries ago are you living in? You still believe that? Do you think that makes sense? And if I were a real witch, would I have been waiting for you in prison like an idiot? I would have already run away!\u201d\u201c\u2026We have to try it to know whether it works. If you sacrifice yourself and all the beasts disappear, you\u2019re a witch, and if you are eaten, you aren\u2019t. Neither harms us.\u201d\u201cYou sick b*stard. Either way, I\u2019m going to die!\u201dNo matter how many times she had been surrounded by an angry mob, it was always useless. But no matter what happened, she was able to stand more calmly than an ordinary person. Henry, who was captured along with her, was frozen in fear.Rosen leaned against the railing, her hands bound, and looked at the crowd. She wanted to see what the atmosphere was like. But sadly, there seemed to be no hope of turning the situation around.She saw horror in their eyes.Of course, not everyone standing on deck wanted to drown her in the sea. But there were people like Joshua Gregory who were eager to turn her into a witch\u2026 She had to remind herself that not everyone in the world was that bad.There must be crew members who sympathized with her\u2026 tossing her into the sea was overkill.But she also knew how easily conscience and goodwill were broken in the face of fear.\u201cEveryone!\u201dGregory screamed as he stepped forward.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t know Alex Reville? He\u2019s led fleets for decades, securing numerous victories in wars, and even after his retirement, he became the Captain of a passenger ship and now carries passengers safely ashore. That very Alex Reville\u2019s ship has stopped. Is this possible?\u201d\u201cThe Captain is against this.\u201dSomeone carefully refuted his words.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t he covering for the witch? But think about it. Why is he suddenly doing this as someone who values his passengers more than anyone else? Isn\u2019t it strange?\u201dGregory grinned and pointed at Rosen with an exaggerated gesture.\u201cIf it\u2019s not a witch\u2019s curse, it can\u2019t be explained!\u201dHundreds of eyes stared at Rosen at once. She remembered this feeling. When she was first tried. When she failed her first and second jailbreaks and stood in court.[I hereby declare Rosen Howarth as the murderer.][Prisoner number 24601, Rosen Haworth, is faced with additional charges for breaking out of prison!]\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet, but throwing a person into the sea recklessly\u2026\u201dAnother mumbled, but that voice was suppressed again by Gregory\u2019s words.\u201cThen are you just going to wait like this? What if the beasts drill a hole in the bottom of the ship? Are you going to put your friends, family, and children at risk because of one b*tch?\u201dRosen had to carry on. She couldn\u2019t die from being thrown into the sea. Victory was imminent.How hard was it for her to get here?When Rosen opened her mouth to say something, she looked into people\u2019s eyes. People hid their children behind them to protect them, and others desperately avoided her gaze. At that moment, she lost all her strength.Seventeen to twenty-five years old. No, maybe all her life she had been screaming for help, hopelessly.\u201cI am not a witch!\u201dYes, they knew.It didn\u2019t work then. It didn\u2019t work now.It was nothing short of shouting at a brick wall.If she were going to be treated like a witch anyway, it would have been better if she were a real witch. Then she could have run away from here.Feeling driven to the edge of a cliff, she desperately looked around.The deck was jammed with people; sailors on both sides were binding her with inhuman power, and the black sea churned behind her.Their own witch trial seemed to have already been completed.Over the past few years, she had countless moments where she wondered if this was the end. But then, there was at least some time to spare. A glimmer of hope shone in front of her.Holding on to that hope, she climbed down a cliff with her bloody hands, and walked barefoot through a forest infested with beasts. Luck had ironically followed her, and she had come this far, surprising people.But it seemed that all her strange luck had been used up. Finally, she made a mistake. She, too, underestimated the malice of people towards her. She didn\u2019t know they would break the prison lock and throw her into the sea.Rather than squatting quietly in prison, she should have been hiding like a mouse. Even Ian, Henry, and Alex were at a loss.[The only keys to the prison are with him, Ian Kerner, and the Captain. Those three will never open the prison door even if people beg for it.]Rosen suddenly realized. The real weak-hearted fool was her. She subconsciously believed that they would protect her, so her judgment was paralyzed for a while. Weakened by their sincerity, she didn\u2019t want to cause trouble, so she acted kindly.She falsely began to believe that everyone in the world would be like them.That momentary weakness was what killed her.\u2018D*mn.\u2019Sadly, this seemed to be her last chance. She stood up and bit the sailor\u2019s arm that was holding her.The sailor screamed.\u2018Emily, I\u2019m sorry. We promised to meet again\u2026\u2019A gust of sea breeze swept down her spine. She was now hanging onto the railing with both arms. Still, she tried her best not to fall. Her mind was aware that it was time to give up, but her body moved on its own.This was a habit of those who had lived as prison breakers for a long time. Struggling even though you knew it didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201cRosen!\u201dThen, she noticed a familiar face amongst the crowd. Ian Kerner, wearing a red scarf with a deathly pale face, was calling out her name. It was a look she had never seen before. A look like his world was falling apart.He ran to her desperately through the packed crowd. The gazes that had been directed at her quickly changed direction. She thought the scene was a vision. Because there was no way Ian Kerner would run to her through a crowd.Did it make sense for him to call her \u2018Rosen\u2019 when everyone was listening? That was a very friendly name. She had many other names.\u2018Rosen Haworth.\u2019\u2018The Witch of Al Capez.\u2019\u201824601\u2026\u2019Anyway, people were always watching Ian Kerner. And he could never hold her hand under those gazes.\u2018Ian Kerner can\u2019t save me.\u2019A hero shouldn\u2019t be on the witch\u2019s side. It was cruel, but he couldn\u2019t turn his back on the whole Empire because of her alone.\u201cRosen Walker!\u201dIn the meantime, she was concerned about the way people looked at him. She was a little afraid that people would look at him suspiciously just because he called her name. He must have really liked her.Regardless of her worries, he came closer and closer. People grabbed at him, but Ian Kerner desperately climbed onto the railing with his arms outstretched. His red scarf fluttered in the wind. His large hands reached out to her.At that moment, someone stepped on her hand, hard. Just like that, she slipped.She crashed into the sea.Ian Kerner was leaning over the railing and screaming like a madman. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have a knack for reading lips.\u2018Well, what\u2019s the use of all this now?\u2019The wind whipped at her cheeks. It must have been very quick, but the moment when she fell from the boat to the surface of the water felt like an eternity.Belatedly, she thought that she should have learned to swim.\u2018How would I have learned to swim after living in Leoarton all my life?\u2019So, this was unavoidable.\u2018I did my best.\u2019\u2018Emily, I really wanted to win\u2026\u2019\u2018But, I tried for a very long time.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not a win, but it\u2019s close, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u2018Because I\u2019ve troubled those who have been tormenting us for so long\u2026\u2019After that, everything was blurry.As she fell unprepared, the current hit her entire body and a strong pain spread.Her body sank into the deep water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By that, I mean not just suffocate and die\u2026\u2019In an instant, water rushed into her nose and mouth.\u2018What did Emily say to do when you fall in the water? Didn\u2019t she say to relax your body?\u2019\u2018D*mn it, how would that happen in this situation?\u2019Rosen couldn\u2019t breathe. She struggled, lost strength, and curled up. She was so out of breath that she couldn\u2019t keep calm.She sank endlessly.She inhaled so much water that her chest felt like it was going to explode. Soon her head went hazy. Its said that right before you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes, and you feel at peace\u2026It didn\u2019t feel comfortable or peaceful, but for a short time, a number of thoughts came to mind.They weren\u2019t very fun, though.Two jailbreaks.Two arrests.The perilous moments while she climbed down the cliff. The day she walked down the mountain range, feet swollen and bleeding. The physical fatigue enough to break anyone\u2019s will. But if she had a place to step, she kept moving forward.When she died like this, her body would be found, her name would be in the newspapers, the whole empire would applaud. Some of the dogs would laugh, of course.\u2018If I were going to face such an end anyway, why did I have to suffer like that?\u2019\u2018If I had lived quietly in prison, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019But Rosen didn\u2019t regret anything. Now she knew for sure. Her escape was not just a journey to meet Emily. If Emily wasn\u2019t in this world, if she never said they\u2019d meet again, she would have dug out of her cell with a spoon regardless.She wanted to live.She wanted to keep shouting to the world while she was alive. Even if no one heard her\u2026-Defendant Rosen Haworth! Speak!It\u2019s funny, but her arrest wasn\u2019t really that bad.In fact, she had known it for a long time. No matter how far she ran, as long as the Empire could find her, she would be caught again. There was nowhere in the world where she could live happily ever after.But each time she was arrested, she was able to stand in court again. That was the only way for her to speak. They were words that no one really listened to, but she wanted the whole world to hear.When she screamed, it felt like something in her heart loosened a little.-I am not guilty!Her chest was so tight that it was hard to continue thinking. It was painful. That was the moment she knew she was going to die like this.Something touched the tip of her trembling toe. The sea wasn\u2019t shallow enough that she had already sunk to the bottom. She slowly lowered her head and looked down.It was in the water, so her vision was blurry, and she couldn\u2019t see it in detail, but it looked like a big fish.A whale?Shark?Anyway, she was stepping on the tip of the nose of a large marine creature. It was undoubtedly a magical beast that opened its mouth full of teeth wide, emitting bright blue light in the dark.It caught her.It was not enough that she drowned quietly, but she became a beast\u2019s meal. She ended up dying just as Ian Kerner had foretold.\u201c\u2026?\u201dBut something was strange. No matter how long she waited, the pain did not come. She soon realized that what the beast was biting was not her feet, but her chains.Her body that had sank soared. She rose toward the light. The beast was dragging her up towards the surface of the water.Then, something touched her back. Another beast appeared and helped by pushing her back towards the surface.\u2018Are you trying to lift me up?\u2019It couldn\u2019t be.This was not a fairy tale.\u2018So, you all eat at the water\u2019s surface, not under the sea?\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t want to show the b*stards on the boat what it\u2019s like to be eaten.\u2019But there was no other option.Rosen was too deep in a state of drowsiness to ponder the situation deeply or to think calmly. It was hard to tell if this was a fantasy or reality.Even if you are torn to death, you must first breathe.Only the instinct to live dominated her.She squeezed all her remaining strength and pushed off the beast supporting her back. They swam up after her.And the halo visible above the surface of the water grew bigger and bigger.\u2018A little more.\u2019Soon, a shadow was cast in the water where the light of dawn leaked in. It looked like Henry hastily tossed a life preserver.He threw a tube through an angry crowd. He also possessed a brave side. It was at that moment when she promised that if she were to survive, she would definitely praise Henry.A man jumped into the water.The two beasts hurriedly swam back into the deep sea. And he came to her. Even in the water, his khaki uniform was recognizable. She soon recognized who the person was, and was startled.\u2018Am I alive?\u2019Even if it was a fantasy, it couldn\u2019t be like this.This wasn\u2019t an illusion, it was a delusion.Black hair scattered in the water, gray eyes.Ian Kerner\u2026He must be the angel she saw before she died. The moment he approached her, she felt like she would be unable to move in his warm arms. Like a sailor drowned by a singing siren.Without realizing it, Rosen pushed him away. She was afraid that she would sink into the depths of the sea, soaked in a dreamlike illusion, and never be able to open her eyes.She had to live. It was a lie when she told Ian Kerner that she wanted to die in peace.\u2018Actually I\u2026 I wanted a painful life rather than a comfortable death. So I couldn\u2019t stop doing stupid things all the time.\u2019However, the resistance of a drowning person who had exhausted their physical strength was weak. She hardly pushed him away. Just like in real life.Soon a pair of strong arms grabbed her. But contrary to her expectations, he didn\u2019t drag her deeper into the sea. Rather, he began to rise to the surface. A ray of light scattered between the black currents.\u2018Ah, I think I\u2019m almost there\u2026\u2019\u2018Just a little longer\u2026\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t too late, though?\u2019Finally, the pain was over, and she lost consciousness. It felt like the breath she had saved until the very end was gone. As her rational thoughts ceased, the strength she held with her remaining will disappeared.She drooped.At that moment, he grabbed her face and turned her towards him. He forced her mouth open with his fingers and poured his breath in.It was like a miracle.As her vision brightened, a cold wind blew over her face.She lost consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Salty water kept pouring out of her mouth.\u201cBreathe.\u201dIan Kerner\u2019s voice was heard. Even in the midst of everything, his tone was commanding, like a soldier.It was as if he was not going to let her go like this.If she had been in better shape, she would have been sarcastic, but she was not very well\u2026Above all, she had no idea what was happening. She couldn\u2019t figure it out. Her body was panting like she was trying to breathe all the breath she had been deprived.Good intentions slammed her back without mercy once more. She finally cried and vomited up all the water she swallowed.\u201cDo not lose your mind and breathe, Rosen.\u201dWater got in her ears, and she felt claustrophobic. It seemed like they were back on the ship, but people\u2019s conversations sounded as if she was still underwater.\u201cHenry, bring a blanket. Move her to the cabin.\u201d\u201cIan Kerner! You- are you crazy now? Now people\u2026 \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to bet on who dies first like you did in military school, you\u2019d better shut up and stay still, Gregory.\u201dSomeone was arguing next to her. It was difficult to know who was speaking and responding. Everything sounded like a hum.Her consciousness faded again.***This time, she woke up buried in a duvet. It didn\u2019t seem like much time had passed. The first thing she saw was Henry, who was weeping by her side. As soon as their eyes met, Henry sniffled, grabbed her face, and made a fuss.\u201cWalker, are you out of your mind? Are you breathing? Hot water, would you like some water?\u201d\u201cWhat time is it now? Is it night?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s day. But does that matter? Drink. You fell into the winter sea and almost died. Now your body is like a corpse. It\u2019s a block of ice!\u201d\u2018If I drink it and fall asleep, I won\u2019t live.\u2019Rosen tried to comprehend the situation by groping through her fragmented memories. The beasts that saved her from drowning\u2026 And Ian Kerner.Was that also a dream?Even though she had vomited up all the salty water earlier, a cough plagued her endlessly. She barely asked aloud. Her throat was raw.\u201cSir Kerner?\u201dHenry sighed and turned his head, gesturing with his chin. Ian was sitting in his desk chair, still wearing his military uniform. He looked so good that it was hard to believe that he had plunged into the winter sea.Just as she convinced herself it was a dream, she noticed that the tips of Ian Kerner\u2019s hair were still a little wet.She wondered if really\u2026 Just in case, she looked at Henry and asked. Her lips trembled, but she tried to get her pronunciation as good as possible.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dBut in the end, the words that came out of her mouth were distorted by her teeth chattering. Fortunately, Henry figured it out.\u201cDon\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t even know anymore. Drink some water, okay? You\u2019re really going to die! Are you going to make the sacrifice of my superior, who jumped to the sea to rescue you, in vain?\u201d\u2018Oh my God.\u2019It wasn\u2019t until Rosen heard Henry\u2019s answer that she knew for sure. That what she saw in the waters wasn\u2019t a dream. Henry put the glass of water to her mouth again. She shook her head resolutely and buried herself in the blanket.She couldn\u2019t believe it, but she was still alive.Whether Ian Kerner rescued her or the devil rejected her\u2026However, drowning in the winter sea had consequences. It was still cold even though she was wrapped in a blanket.Her head was fuzzy, and her bones were frozen. Her mind wandered, and she tried to move her body, but nothing listened to her instructions. She didn\u2019t feel good.She shouldn\u2019t be sick. She survived in the water. She barely lived. She was almost there now.\u2018I have to get out of here\u2026\u2019\u201cGive me the medicine! The medicine that\u2019ll make me feel better!\u201d\u201cHey! Drink some water first. Drink it!\u201d\u201cNot water, just medicine!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re out of your mind because you nearly drowned, but drink hot water first! If you really want medicine, you can take some later!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t drink! I\u2019ll die on the island anyway. Who cares!\u201dHenry didn\u2019t give up, grabbing her face and trying to pour warm water into her mouth forcefully, but Rosen resisted desperately.If she drank that water, she would fall asleep.Then it would be all over.Their quarrel continued for a long time.Henry\u2019s skin, which was lightly touching hers, felt like a ball of fire. Rosen realized that her condition was more serious than she thought. She was like a living ice cube. Her body was so cold that it was strange that all the blood in her body hadn\u2019t frozen.\u201cD*mn it, it\u2019s really cold\u2026 I think I\u2019m going to die\u2026 \u201dWithout realizing it, she grabbed Henry\u2019s arm. As his skin touched hers, it seemed to melt a little. Henry gave her a blank look.\u201cThis is really crazy, Walker! Drink water first!\u201d\u201cHenry Reville, get out.\u201dAt that moment, Ian Kerner, who was sitting still like a stone statue, interrupted Henry\u2019s words and got up. He slowly approached the bed where Rosen was sitting. He ordered again.\u201cLeave and take your time. Hang in there at any cost. If they send her back to prison in this state, she will die.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you going to do?\u201d\u201cClose the door and leave.\u201dHenry hesitated for a moment, then handed the glass over to Ian and left. Only Ian and Rosen were left in the cabin.Rosen forcefully opened her eyes which were about to close and repeated. She shouldn\u2019t be sick. She had to calm down. She was lucky once again, but she couldn\u2019t stay shivering because of the cold.\u2018Grasp the situation, then do what I have to do as planned\u2026\u2019But she also had to say something to Ian.\u201cYou must be crazy. Jumping into the sea to save me? You could have died. No matter how much you\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn front of everyone. What will people think?\u201d\u201cLet me worry about myself.\u201dA vague answer returned. She knew it would change her impression of Ian Kerner. He was more impulsive than she thought. He was definitely a little out of his mind.\u201cI want to scold you properly, but I\u2019m not in the mood for that. Anyway, you\u2019re crazy, Ian Kerner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are crazy.\u201dHe was staring at her. Nervous, she held onto the blanket.He took the kettle Henry had left behind and poured more water into the glass, handing it to her.\u201cDrink.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t drink.\u201dRosen knocked the glass out of his hands. The water soaked her hands and spilt onto the floor. She thought he\u2019d be angry. But he was not.He looked at her intently, then grabbed her cheeks and asked again.\u201cThen answer me properly this time, Rosen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to live?\u201dRosen didn\u2019t answer. She felt like he saw right through her. Silence filled the room. There was strength in his hands, and she couldn\u2019t help but face him.\u201cAnswer me. Do you want to live?\u201dRosen thought desperately.\u2018What would be the best answer in this situation?\u2019She wracked her brain that didn\u2019t work well.His expression as he looked at her, his tone that became softer as time passed, and his reply that he would\u2019ve killed Hindley\u2026She finally found the best answer.\u201cAre you an idiot? Come to think of it, how do you not know? I\u2019m an escapee. If it\u2019s not because I want to live\u2026 I never wanted to die, even for a moment.\u201dRosen smiled bitterly.Ironically, the answer was no lie.He slowly opened his mouth.\u201cThen take off your clothes.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRosen stared at his expressionless face and asked. It was because she doubted whether the words coming out of his mouth were correct. There was no way to gauge the meaning of those words. He unbuttoned his shirt and threw off his top.\u201cTake it off if you want to live.\u201dAs Rosen froze in a daze, he climbed onto the bed, hugged her, and took off her prison scrubs. Belatedly, the sleeping powder she had hidden in her underwear came to mind, and she pushed him away, but fortunately, it was lost when she fell into the sea.Her underwear fell under the bed. It was not until his skin touched her body that she realized the meaning of what he said. The places where their bare skin touched began to heat up.The cold was gone.Nothing compared.She clung to him instinctively, like a young beast on the verge of freezing to death. She rubbed her cheeks against his chest. He held her and stroked her without saying a word, and his gentle touch didn\u2019t seem to have any other intentions.She tried to fill her head with only one thought.\u2018I should not fall sick.\u2019\u2018Never.\u2019\u2018Tonight is God\u2019s last chance for me, when everyone is asleep.\u2019\u2018Come to your senses\u2019But the moment her body melted in the warmth, reality and delusions mixed.Once again, she fell into a sea of dark memories and lost her mind.-How dare you?The moment Hindley\u2019s voice echoed in her head, she realized.That the memories that came to her this time were not a nightmare.The memories of the day that compelled her to come this far overwhelmed her\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He tormented Rosen just like that.Rosen quickly began to drink the herbal water that Emily made her at a set time each morning. The dr*g kept Hindley\u2019s seed from settling in her stomach. Of course, it was only a temporary measure.Rosen couldn\u2019t stop the flow of time. She was tall and gained weight. The gaze of people had changed. The soldiers who treated her like a child began to whistle whenever she passed. She wanted to rip off their snouts.Anyway, the day Hindley began to doubt why Rosen couldn\u2019t have children, Emily and Rosen were doomed. Because Hindley was becoming more open-minded.Hindley asked Rosen as she was preparing breakfast with a bruised eye.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cWell, I was 14 years old, then I would be 16 now\u2026\u201d\u201cYou idiot. You don\u2019t you even know your age?\u201d\u201cWhy do you need to know? It doesn\u2019t matter if I cook well.\u201dRosen was definitely more gifted than Emily at telling lies. She tried to change the subject, but Hindley was particularly persistent that day.\u201cLet\u2019s see. Since you were 15 when I brought you here, you will be 17 this spring. They said that there must be a problem with not having children at this age.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u201cEveryone does.\u201d\u201cAre they doctors? Hindley knows better. Because we are working hard, it will happen soon.\u201dIgnoring Hindley, who scanned her suspiciously, she brazenly lied. He grabbed her angrily and slapped her meaninglessly. Rosen was beaten because it was familiar. She had accepted that the more she resisted, the more she was beaten.\u201cShould I sell you and buy someone else?\u201d\u2018Sure.\u2019\u2018If you bring in a child according to your taste, it will take about two years to feed, dress, and raise them before you can bed them.\u2019Rosen placed soup in front of Hindley. He pounded his chest and stared at her.\u201cBe careful what you do. It wouldn\u2019t be good if you gave birth to someone else\u2019s child. If that happens, I will strangle you and the child.\u201dRosen nodded her head resolutely. She knew why Hindley was panicking. Two years after the war began and soldiers wandered around the neighborhood, drama took place every day.Soldiers and wives were found secretly meeting in forests or empty huts, taking off their clothes and getting entangled. There were times when it was a misunderstanding and times when it was real. Either way, the development was similar. The soldier fled and the wife was beaten to death by her husband. Two unlucky souls were killed.Some were framed, and others, like Charlie\u2019s wife next door, had real affairs. People scolded and cursed her, saying that people who cheated deserved to die, but she felt sorry for his wife.There were many young wives in the neighborhood. Charlie\u2019s wife was also one of those poor girls who had been sold to give birth to a son. She was beaten every day because she didn\u2019t get pregnant.Every time Rosen saw Charlie\u2019s bald head and age spots, she was convinced that the problem must be with Charlie, not her. To be honest, she wondered if his\u00a0thing\u00a0could stand at that age.A young soldier appeared in the neighborhood without knowing she was married and whispered that he loved the woman\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be strange not to be deceived?The child was found dead at dawn. The soldier was a coward, so he left and transferred to another unit. Charlie was brought to trial. At the first, he was sentenced to eight years, but at his re-trial, he was released due to \u2018insufficient evidence\u2019 and returned to town. He soon bought another wife.Hindley didn\u2019t have to worry about Rosen, at least in that regard. After their escape attempt, she was detained by the military. Just thinking about their shameless giggling made her want to vomit.There was only one exception. A name that was engraved in her mind before she woke up to cruel reality. The person she fell in love with when she was younger and more innocent.Ian Kerner.He was still in her sky.As the war intensified, his voice appeared more frequently on the radio, and more flyers were produced.She still picked them up and collected them.But it wasn\u2019t the same as before.She squatted in the kitchen without Hindley knowing, examining his flyers and listening to his broadcast, but\u2026Instead of imagining of him somewhere in the sky, she clenched her jaw and murmured in melancholy.[This is the Leoarton Squadron. Can you hear me?]\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d[My name is Ian Kerner. Our squadron is always protecting you.]\u201cNo. You\u2019re too far away. You\u2019re in the sky.\u201dEvery time she looked at his face, she remembered the eyes of the captain who sent her back. If she met Ian Kerner in person, would he have the same expression?Probably.It wasn\u2019t him who said he would protect her either. He lived in the sky, and she was just a rat in the slums of Leoarton.She knew him and she liked him, whom she had never seen face to face.\u2018I am nothing to him.\u2019She sometimes had nightmares.She was recklessly dragged away by Hindley at the ticket office again. And there stood Ian Kerner, instead of the unknown captain. Even though she shouted for help, he coldly turned away from her.She knew it was a delusion. Ian Kerner did nothing wrong. He was everyone\u2019s hero, but he wasn\u2019t a God. He couldn\u2019t be everywhere, and he really couldn\u2019t protect everyone.[I will protect you, wherever you are\u2026]That was the lie he told them all.But nevertheless, she felt betrayed.She didn\u2019t want to accept the cruel truth.He was the only thing she could hold on to in this d*mn town\u2026***Her seventeenth winter.A plague swept through Leoarton. Due to the endless war, food was scarce. The whole city was weak. Even strong people who would not have contracted a fever in the past fell ill. Every morning, when she woke up and opened the window, she could see the people who had died the night before lining the city square.The treatment center was overflowing with people. Emily and Rosen had to work day and night. Even so, a deep depression loomed over the chaotic city. The only person who smiled was Hindley, who sat and counted the money that rolled in.Emily told Rosen to avoid contact with patients\u2019 bodily fluids as much as possible. But no matter how careful she was, it was impossible to keep up after dealing with many patients who vomited and fell sick.She was the first one to fall. Fortunately, she recovered before she became a corpse, but now Emily was sick in bed. She took care of Emily with tears in her eyes every night. She felt like her body was going to break because she was working all day, but fatigue lost strength in the face of the fear that Emily might die.Emily\u2019s fever never went down.\u201c\u2026You know, Rosen. No matter what happens in the future, you must live well, okay?\u201dEmily reached out and laboriously stroked Rosen\u2019s hair. A hoarse voice escaped from between her chapped lips.\u201cEmily. Don\u2019t say anything ominous. A healthy person like you will never die like this. Okay? You are going to get well soon. I\u2019m going to die if you die. How can I live without Emily? \u201d\u2018How can I survive in this hellish place without Emily?\u2019\u2018Emily is the only person I have had since I was born, and the only one I have loved and been loved by.\u2019Rosen finally burst into tears and buried her face in Emily\u2019s lap.\u201cNo. You have to live well. Promise me. You will live a good life no matter what.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m saying it because I\u2019m sick. You can do it. You are a brave girl.\u201dEmily tried to get up, reciting the phrase over and over again.\u201cPlease stay still.\u201dRosen forced Emily to lie down again.But Emily was stubborn.She wasn\u2019t going to stop until she heard Rosen\u2019s answer.Rosen nodded her head as hard as she could.There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to make Emily feel relieved.\u201cMy throat hurts.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s even more frustrating because the necklace is squeezing your neck when you cough. I wish I could remove it\u2026 \u201d\u201cI know, Rosen. But we can\u2019t.\u201dRosen stared at Emily\u2019s neck.She always hated that necklace.It was an unrealistic notion, but the restraint that was \u2018protecting\u2019 Emily seemed to make her even more sick.If that necklace glowed green, or if they ripped it off and Emily regained her original power\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rosen asked in a desperate voice.\u201cCan\u2019t magic cure a disease?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t right now.\u201d\u201cYou mean you can?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cRosen, stop it. You are overworked. You will fall sick again.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t listen to Emily. Rosen looked after Emily all night, then collapsed in bed and took a short nap. In the morning, she had to work again. There were many patients. Hindley said he wouldn\u2019t let them live if she neglected to make money to look after Emily.The next morning, Rosen opened the warehouse door and realized that an essential herb had run out. Originally that was Emily\u2019s job. When she told Hindley about it, he uttered a simple order.\u201cYou gather herbs from the mountains.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cWho else but you? Emily is sick.\u201d\u201cBut you said you would kill me if I left the house needlessly.\u201d\u201cI said you can leave. Should there be no flexibility?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that nonsense. If you run away again, I\u2019ll really sell you this time. You know that it\u2019s no use running away, right?\u201dHindley didn\u2019t have to worry. She completely stopped thinking about escaping after their failed escape. Resignation and helplessness took hold of her. Even as she climbed the mountain away from the center of town, she did not think about an escape route like before.Rosen just thought she had to go home quickly. She was reluctant to leave Hindley and Emily alone. Hindley no longer cared about whether Emily was dead or not. He regarded Emily as inferior to dirt after her miscarriage.It must have been because Rosen was somewhat familiar with the work of the treatment center that Emily thought Rosen could do what she did.When she got home late that night, she threw the herb basket on the table and headed straight to Emily\u2019s room. But Emily, who should have been lying on the bed, was nowhere to be found.\u201cWhere did Emily go?\u201dInstead, the pest Hindley was lying there. He didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know why, but he was staring at her terribly. She urged him.\u201cWhere is Emily?\u201dAnd at that moment, pain spread across her cheek. Then the other cheek caught fire. Rosen fell to the floor. Then the kicks began. She thought for a moment about what was wrong and then stopped herself.After all, Hindley was going to spit out abusive language and tell her what happened. What did she did wrong, and what annoyed him. Most of it was nonsense, so she didn\u2019t even bother wondering anymore.\u201cTwo b*tches cheated on me!\u201dHindley couldn\u2019t contain his anger and threw around the furniture in the room. He soon rummaged through a drawer and grabbed something. Rosen went white as she noticed what Hindley had discovered. It was the contraceptive herb.What she feared the most happened.They got caught.\u201cI knew this would happen. Where and what have you been doing to eat this? Dirty wh*re! You weren\u2019t a virgin when I bought you, were you? I saw you with the butcher\u2019s son, Tom! You did it secretly, right? Did you like it that much?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNo, then what is it? Say it. Or was it that you didn\u2019t want to carry my child? F*ck, since when you have been doing this? I thought it was weird. Emily, did that b*tch give you this?\u201d\u201cNo, I did it myself! Emily is not involved! She doesn\u2019t know anything!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! You two always whispered and deceived me, I knew from the beginning. You two made it, didn\u2019t you? Tricking me!\u201dHindley\u2019s familiar nonsense flowed in. Rosen instinctively looked around. Emily\u2019s hair was scattered on the floor. Her blood cooled and lips and fingertips trembled.Did Hindley kill Emily?Rosen sobbed.\u201cWhere is Emily? What did you do to Emily?\u201d\u201cWhy, are you curious about her? You\u2019ve gone too far. I\u2019ve locked her up in the warehouse. What did you expect me to do? She didn\u2019t tell me anything the whole time. She wasn\u2019t always that, so she must have been corrupted by you. I won\u2019t let you go until you confess. It\u2019s even better if you keel over and die.\u201d\u201cGet me out of here. Emily is sick! She is going to die!\u201dOf course, Hindley didn\u2019t even pretend to listen.Rosen struggled and wrestled, but in the end, she was grabbed by hair and dragged helplessly to the bed.After it was all over, Hindley suddenly became friendly. He whispered as he nursed her wounds.\u201cRosen, don\u2019t do this. We can live well. Of course, you\u2019re still young\u2026 I think you must have been afraid to have children. I will forgive you this time.\u201d\u201cWhat about Emily?\u201d\u201cStop talking about Emily! I\u2019m going to get rid of her and focus on you. Emily can no longer function as a woman anyway. Let me look at you. Let\u2019s start anew together. Hm? With a clean slate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can work at the treatment center together now.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t answer. He took a deep breath, then laid back and fell asleep.After Hindley fell asleep, Rosen got up quietly from the bed and stopped in front of the chest of drawers he had smashed. Ian Kerner\u2019s propaganda, which had been secretly collected, poured all over the floor. She looked at them for a long time, flipping through each one.\u201cNow I know. You can\u2019t protect me.\u201dSitting by the window, Rosen folded the flyers into the shape of an airplane and threw them. She muttered as she stared at the countless paper airplanes flying into the night sky.\u201cYou said you\u2019d protect me! You punks! You said you\u2019d protect us!\u201dOnly then did Rosen finally admit it.\u201c\u2026No one will protect me.\u201dThis was war.A war that wouldn\u2019t end until either they died or Hindley did.A war more cruel and wretched than the war against Talas.At least for her it was. Nothing improved by holding their breath and staying still or enduring until the end.And the war would never be over until one side won.Rosen returned to bed and stared intently at Hindley\u2019s sleeping face.Hindley would eventually kill them.Hindley had to die if they were to live.She couldn\u2019t believe she just now realized it.Hindley said \u2018let\u2019s start with a clean slate\u2019, so she thought she\u2019d give it a try too.There were unavoidable things in the world.Hindley Haworth had to die.Don\u2019t you think so?Hindley Haworth really deserved death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Transporting Rosen Haworth to Monte Island is an important task, but above all, the safety of passengers comes first\u2026 Wait until sunset. The captain is holding out, but\u2026 In the end, I think you will do as I command.\u201dIt only took a moment for Ian Kerner to respond.\u201cI will transport the prisoner safely to Monte Island.\u201dThe military quickly rescinded the order. Looking at it logically, it was not a bad story that the witch who controlled beasts and tried to get revenge on the passengers was thrown into the sea.\u201cThe reason I first got on a plane was because I was na\u00efve and stupid. I wanted to protect people. But now that I look back, it seems that all the good people died in the war, and only the bad remain.\u201d\u201c\u2026Henry.\u201d\u201cIncluding me. This is how much I\u2026I didn\u2019t know it would be this bad. I thought it would be okay to hate her. I was cruel.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter all, I am the person who brought Rosen Walker to this point.\u201dHenry broke down into tears as he stopped speaking. Ian remembered his malice towards Rosen, who was pinned to the deck. It was horribly vicious for one person to handle.He was used to the pressure people put on him. But he was wrong. The pressure he received and the pressure Rosen received were vastly different.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Henry. It won\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHenry crouched down in front of the bed, wiped his tears, and carefully placed his hand on Rosen\u2019s forehead. But as soon as he felt that Rosen\u2019s body was like a ball of fire, Henry cried again. Ian sighed and asked.\u201c\u2026How are people reacting?\u201d\u201cWe have to return her to prison. The people are waiting. They will likely arrest you as well. They don\u2019t trust you anymore. You\u2019re possessed by a witch\u2026 It\u2019s only going to get worse if we keep her here.\u201d\u201cWait a little longer. Just until her temperature goes down a little. Rosen is still very sick.\u201d\u201cI will try.\u201dHenry, his eyes puffy, shut the cabin door.Iqn took off his shirt and climbed back into bed. Rosen, who was lying as still as a corpse, clung to him again. Rosen\u2019s expression looked calmer than when she was awake. It was heartbreaking.Rosen was so sick that she couldn\u2019t control her body. He managed to thaw her icy body, but then it began to boil. Ian held her desperately, ignoring the fuss going on outside. He intended to endure as long as the captain, Alex, endured.But he knew that Alex couldn\u2019t win this fight. Despite the support of a few sailors, he could not overcome the overwhelming pressure of the public. He couldn\u2019t even if he was the Emperor. Wasn\u2019t that why a revolution took place in the Empire as well? The Imperial Family, which seemed impenetrable, collapsed.How much worse would it be if the Emperor led a single ship? If passengers demanded\u2026Rosen collapsed, feverishly rambling nonsense. She alternately called for Emily and Hindley. Sometimes his name came up. He answered every time. Rosen didn\u2019t understand most of it, but occasionally their conversation continued.\u201cIan Kerner. Are you there? Are you the one I can feel now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening. Speak.\u201d\u201cWow, your body is really killing me. I really want to sleep with you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t spew nonsense.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense. And you\u2019re really weird. How can you stay still like a statue when I\u2019ve taken off all my clothes and clung to you?\u201d\u201cI do not know. Is that abnormal?\u201d\u201cIf there were people like you at Al Capez, I might have been a model prisoner. It\u2019s not because of me that tax money is being wasted. It\u2019s all the lax and stupid guards who made me an escaped prisoner. They were so stupid, how could I not dream of jailbreaking? Their eyes went wide when I took off my clothes\u2026 \u201d\u201cI might have reacted the same way if you weren\u2019t sick.\u201d\u201cReally? Am I attractive in your eyes? Haven\u2019t you seen a lot of beautiful people?\u201d\u201c\u2026If we hadn\u2019t met like this, I would have chased you.\u201dIan replied. Rosen\u2019s giggles devolved into hoarse coughing.\u201cReally? Are you joking to make me feel better?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dAs soon as he came out of the captain\u2019s cabin, he saw Rosen hanging precariously from the railing. He couldn\u2019t think of anything at that moment. His vision turned white. Calling Rosen\u2019s name, he rushed over and reached out his hand.Falls frightened him. When he looked around in the pilot\u2019s seat, there was always a plane crashing helplessly into the sea. He missed so many people. He couldn\u2019t help them. He always had places to go and things to protect.\u201cYou know how to swim?\u201d\u201cPilots should know how to swim. If your plane crashes, you must swim out of the wreckage.\u201d\u201cThe military academy wouldn\u2019t have taught you how to swim if they knew you would use it to save witches.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026People are waiting for you outside.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll think it\u2019s weird. I\u2019m disappointed in you.\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about, but you don\u2019t have to be. I\u2019ve done something, and it\u2019s already too late to turn back.\u201d\u201cD*mn it. Are you telling me not to worry? I lived thanks to you but\u2026Why did you do that?\u201dHe remembered the moment of choice, where choosing one meant losing the other. It was similar this time. The moment he called Rosen\u2019s name, hundreds of eyes turned to him at once. He had been conscious of those eyes for a very long time.So, for a very short time, he froze.And in the meantime, Rosen crashed into the cold sea. He lost someone even after the war ended. That made him miserable.\u201cIt would be cruel to say that you should have a good appearance because everyone is watching you, right? I don\u2019t want to say that. But what you did at that time was really crazy.\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve never wanted to be a hero. I don\u2019t deserve it, and I haven\u2019t made any achievements. I was just a bullet. There\u2019s always someone else pointing the gun. The bullet doesn\u2019t think.\u2019Of course, Ian was well aware that that wasn\u2019t an excuse. He struggled to open his mouth.\u201cI never wanted to, but if needed, I would\u2019ve lived as a hero for the rest of my life. I thought it was atonement. For the blood on my hands\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut now, for the first time, I regret it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead of pitying myself, asking if we were in the same situation.\u2019\u2018After all, I was no different from the cruel people on the deck.\u2019Rosen smiled and shook her head.\u201cSome stupid b*stard stepped on my hand and I fell.\u201d\u201cI was able to catch you.\u201d\u201cSince you keep insisting like that, fine.

Even if everyone in the world was on my side, you could never be.\u201dAs if on the border between dreams and reality, Rosen muttered in a hazy tone. He tried to pass her water, but Rosen shook her head and grabbed his hand. He touched Rosen\u2019s forehead.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be sick\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will be fine soon.\u201d\u201cSir Kerner, you didn\u2019t know I wanted to live, did you? Don\u2019t be fooled.

Nothing else matters.\u201d\u201cSir Kerner is finally back\u2026\u201dRosen laughed weakly, and then started talking nonsense again in a sing-songy melody. Ian stroked Rosen\u2019s scattered hair and struggled to open his mouth.\u201cYou will never know how I felt the moment you said you wanted to live.\u201dIn fact, he couldn\u2019t seem to express himself exactly. He thought he was happy, but on second thought, he felt more miserable than when he heard she wanted to die.Rosen did not answer, her eyes still closed. It was also difficult to know exactly whether he had lost his mind or pretended to have lost his mind to run away from her confession. But Ian thought it didn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201c\u2026 I carried a picture of you from the newspaper.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI denied it at the time. I didn\u2019t have anyone, but you were famous, and I could see you, so I held onto you\u2026 I thought I was just broken and crazy. But now I know. It wasn\u2019t that complicated. I\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI just wanted to meet you.\u201dRosen coughed.\u2018I guess I haven\u2019t lost my mind.\u2019Ian offered her another drink of water but Rosen firmly shook her head. He didn\u2019t force it.\u201cIs there anything you want?\u201d\u201cA cigarette. It feels like my insides are frozen.\u201d\u201cNo. Your cough will get worse.\u201d\u201cThen let me hear your voice.\u201d\u201c\u2026What voice?\u201d\u201cYour broadcasting voice. Just like the show you did back then. I know you don\u2019t like that kind of thing, but I\u2019m so sick right now that I think it will cheer me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, your voice was a great comfort. You wouldn\u2019t know. We\u2026 How much I loved it during that long war.\u201dRosen burrowed into his arms and mumbled incoherently. At this moment, it felt like he was the one who needed to be comforted, not her.\u201cIt will be fine. You did your best. The war is over. Everything will be fine now, and you will live well. So, don\u2019t feel guilty about Leoarton or me. Understand?\u201dIan Kerner recalled the day he first stood in front of the microphone. He had been dragged into it. He was twenty years old. In retrospect, the child, who thought he had grown to some extent but did not understand anything about the world, read the contents as instructed.-Introduce yourself to them\u2026And say you\u2019ll protect them.-\u2026-They need it. The people.It was only when he was older that he truly realized why such lies were needed. He acknowledged the need. So he followed orders.The 30-year-old started the same broadcast again, hugging the witch of Al Capez, who had escaped the city he had destroyed.In a place where only one person could hear.\u201cThis is the Leoarton squadron. My name is Ian Kerner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI will protect you.\u201dHis voice trembled.It was a broadcast that he did countless times. But now, it was difficult to say those words casually.\u201c\u2026You will be safe. I will protect you.\u201d\u201cIt was your job throughout the war to sacrifice the few for the many. In fact, that\u2019s the nature of war. You\u2019ve never made a wrong decision because you were overwhelmed by emotions. I don\u2019t understand why you feel guilty now.\u201dHe told an old lie, which he had repeated countless times, and finally admitted it.\u2018Is that right?\u2019\u2018Was that right?\u2019No, that wasn\u2019t right. It was a necessary and inevitable choice, but it was definitely not the right thing to do. Even if there was no other way\u2026 He couldn\u2019t change that fact. He had to do it, but that didn\u2019t mean it was the right thing to do.\u201c\u2026I will protect you.\u201dRosen\u2019s hand touched his eyes. Tears dripped down. It was only when he felt the unfamiliar sensation that Ian Kerner realized that he was crying.Just like the day he visited Leoarton, which was in ruins. When he first met Rosen Walker, who was trapped in a black-and-white photograph.***In the afternoon, the cabin door opened.\u201cSir, it\u2019s time. Even my father broke. He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026 Rosen should go to prison.\u201d\u201cTake her, Henry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBring the blanket. I think her fever has gone down, but\u2026 It\u2019s cold in there.\u201dIan Kerner rose from his seat.He took a gold coin out of his pocket that he had hidden out of fear of being seen.And he began to think as he watched the black sea through his cabin window.Thinking was what he did best.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now it had been longer since she parted ways with Emily than the time she spent with her. So as soon as Rosen saw Emily, she knew it was a dream. She ran and buried her face in Emily\u2019s arms.\u201cEmily, why don\u2019t you visit my dreams anymore? I really missed you.\u201d\u201cRosen, wake up.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s too cold. Let me stay a little longer. I\u2019m sick right now.\u201dBut it was weird. Emily, who always hugged her silently, pushed her away firmly.Rosen was immediately in tears. All she relied on in the long escape process was the warmth Emily gave her in her dreams.Was that not allowed now?Emily shook her head.\u201cYou have to wake up to see me. You are almost there. What if you run out of energy before the end?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m almost there? Where?\u201d\u201cWalpurgis Island is near Monte Island. Don\u2019t you understand what that means? You and I are getting closer. Now you are really right in front of me. That\u2019s why I can visit you in your dreams.\u201d\u201cEmily is there? Are you doing well? Are you alive?\u201d\u201cRosen, did you think I was dead? I\u2019m disappointed.\u201dRosen quickly grabbed Emily\u2019s hand. Tears began to roll down her cheeks.\u2018Emily\u2019s alive? Emily and I are close? Really?\u2019Rosen promised Emily she\u2019d see her again. She had come all the way here holding on to that promise. But she was too old to believe in that unlikely reality anymore. She had experienced too much cruelty. Reuniting with Emily was not a belief but a distant dream.The moment Emily approached, Rosen knew that she would disappear like mist, but she kept following her.It was so beautiful that she couldn\u2019t give it up even if it broke her heart.In fact, from some point on, her escape was not to meet Emily, but to be arrested as extravagantly as possible. She couldn\u2019t believe Emily was still alive. Rosen couldn\u2019t believe they could meet again. If this was just an illusion, when she woke up, she really wanted to die.Rosen glared at Emily resentfully.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you pick me up earlier?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was your job to come here. It\u2019s like how you shouldn\u2019t help a chick breaking out of their egg. Even if it takes a lot of time\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything. No one knows the coordinates of Walpurgis Island. There\u2019s a lot of gossip, no one can come in, only witches can\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. But you can come, too. We\u2019re really close, Rosen. You\u2019ve had a hard time getting here. Hang in there a little longer. I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201dEmily wiped away Rosen\u2019s tears and stepped away. Rosen moved to chase after Emily.\u2018Don\u2019t go, Emily. You said you\u2019d pick me up so why are you moving away? You have to show me how to get there. How can you say everything so vaguely? Are all witches like this? I can\u2019t figure out how the hell that spell is going to work either\u2026\u2019Rosen had always admired Emily. She had always wanted to be a real witch. She wanted to have powers if she was going to be treated as a witch anyway. No, she wanted to be more like Emily.Where would Emily have headed if she were alive? Rosen had to be a real witch to go to Walpurgis Island.So she always murmured whenever she wanted to give up.One drop of blood, one wish, and some magic.She didn\u2019t even know what that meant.***\u201cWalker.\u201dWhen Rosen woke up, she found herself in prison. She sat up in a cold sweat. She could see Maria in the cell across from her through a blurred vision.\u201cRosen Walker, get up. People drank the water. Is that why you\u2019re sleeping?\u201d\u201c\u2026Water?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask me with a stupid face. I know you did it.\u201dRosen was puzzled. She felt like she had a very long dream. Her body, soaked in sweat, cooled in the sharp wind. Her head was still dizzy. She couldn\u2019t tell fantasy and reality apart.She traced her broken memories.She fell into the winter sea.Ian Kerner jumped into the water and saved her.She saw Emily in her dream.And again, Ian\u2026-Ian Kerner. Are you there? Are you the one I can feel now?-I am listening. Speak.There was something hanging over her shoulder. It was a blanket. It was so soft and fluffy that it would have never been provided to a prisoner normally. There were only a few people on this ship who would give her this.It was only then that she could admit that the unrealistic delusions that came to mind were reality. A war hero patted her head, hugged her, and warmed her up.\u201cBy the way, what did you put in the water?\u201d\u201cThe water fountain on the boat is filtered every morning, so it would not have worked. But the timing was good. Most people don\u2019t wake up early. I don\u2019t think anyone has noticed so far.\u201dMaria looked at Rosen skeptically.\u201cThose drunkards who have been drinking since the afternoon have already fallen asleep. The guys on the deck will all be asleep soon.\u201dRosen looked around. The soldiers guarding the prison, and the prisoners, except Maria, were asleep. There was a heavy smell of wine in the air. She was rather anxious because everything went as she planned. There was a barrel of white wine lying on the floor of the prison.\u201cAnyway, this is your chance.\u201d\u201c\u2026Maria, did you know what was in there? Is that why you didn\u2019t drink?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t I know you? There\u2019s no way you wouldn\u2019t have done anything when you\u2019ve been to Ian Kerner\u2019s cabin.\u201dMaria. She was like a shadow who swallowed the whole prison. She knew Rosen frighteningly well.\u201cAre you sure they are done drinking? Every single one of them?\u201d\u201cNot all of them drank it.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. All the people on the deck, really? How?\u201dRosen couldn\u2019t believe that she had succeeded, so she kept asking like a fool. Maria was annoyed but answered nonetheless.\u201cDon\u2019t you hear how quiet the boat is? They must have been afraid to sacrifice you. Isn\u2019t it uncomfortable to throw a person into the sea?\u201dMaria pointed to a corner of the prison.\u201cAnd he\u2019s looking for you?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dRosen stared in the direction Maria pointed. A creature the size of a cat stared at her and crawled through the bars.It was a black amphibian that looked like a fish. It had a strange appearance that she had never seen before. Its body was scaled like a fish, but it had four legs.It was a marine beast. It had something in its mouth, familiar to her eyes. The necklace she wore last night. When she took off her dress and changed into her prison uniform, she forgot to take it off. She thought she lost it when she fell into the sea.\u201cIs that mine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you pick it up for me?\u201dEven knowing that there would be no answer, Rosen still asked. But at that moment, unbelievably, the beast nodded.She looked at the strange blue light emitted by the beast and reached out. It was the same blue light emitted when Emily cast her magic.The beast gently spat out the necklace into her palm like a domesticated beast. Its sharp teeth were threatening, but she looked closer, as if possessed.She stroked its scales. It didn\u2019t bite or bark at her. Rather, it leaned against her hand as if it wanted to be pet more.-Huge sharks, krakens, and other unknown marine predators that have not been recorded by academia.-Everyone is hungry because it\u2019s breeding season these days. If you want to be a monster\u2019s snack, you can go on an adventure in a lifeboat.\u2018Ian Kerner, this time you\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s usually the case. But not for me.\u2019As soon as she fell into the sea, two marine beasts pulled and raised her to the surface. It wasn\u2019t an illusion or a dream. They certainly helped her.Another beast dived to retrieve her necklace that sank to the bottom of the sea. She remembered Emily\u2019s words that she heard in her dream.-You know that. You can come, too. And now we\u2019re really close, Rosen. You\u2019ve had a really hard time getting here. Hang in there a little longer. I\u2019ll pick you up.A laugh burst out of her mouth.She muttered like a madman, stroking the beast the size of a cat.\u201cOh, my God. They were never threats to me from the beginning\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018These beasts are under the influence of magic. They won\u2019t eat me, because they are on the side of witches. From the beginning, this sea was not a threat to me. Rather, they helped me because I\u2026\u2019Rosen stretched out her hand and murmured a spell she had known for a long time.\u201cOne blood.\u201d\u2018The blood of Hindley Haworth.\u2019\u201cOne wish.\u201d\u2018The wish I made in front of the cake Ian Kerner gave me.\u2019-Give me strength, Walpurg.\u201cSome magic\u2026 \u201d\u2018I have satisfied both conditions. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever used magic, but anyway, I\u2019ve already become a witch. That\u2019s why this beast followed me.\u2019\u2018I can escape.\u2019\u2018I can meet Emily.\u2019\u2018I can go to Walpurgis Island.\u2019Hope welled up. She didn\u2019t know where it had been hiding all this time.Rosen was on the verge of tears.She pulled tight the chains that bound her hands. She thought of Emily, who seemed weak but always helped her at decisive moments.-What was the first spell that Emily cast after becoming a witch?-\u2026I made a cake.-That\u2019s really boring.-Rosen, the first spell is always boring.Even an escaped prisoner needs trivial magic.She didn\u2019t need anything fancy. Simply unlocking chains and prison doors was fine. She murmured, staring at her hands, which were still cold and damp.\u201cPlease let me do something good, even if it\u2019s small. I don\u2019t want to give up like this. Somehow I\u2026 \u201dRosen clenched her fists and murmured, as if praying. She didn\u2019t know if it was for Walpurg or for herself.\u201cPlease.\u201dThe chains vibrated. Surprised, her eyes burst open. The marine beast growled beside her as if encouraging her. She gritted her teeth and tried to focus on breaking the chains. She didn\u2019t know exactly how to use magic, but she could do better than this if the chain could be moved just because she desperately wanted it.She was confident that she would not lose to anyone in desperation.\u201cPlease.\u201dAt that moment, the chain broke with a thud.Her hands were free.Rosen froze for a moment, unable to believe what she had accomplished, but then she started bouncing in excitement. Her hands didn\u2019t glow blue like Emily\u2019s, and it wasn\u2019t a monumental spell, but it was definitely magic.It was magic she cast.She unchained herself.She was a witch.\u201cMaria, did you see that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I saw.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a witch! A witch! You\u2019ve been saying that I am a witch all this time! I was actually a real witch! I can use magic!\u201dRosen thought she knew why witches danced and celebrated on Walpurgis Night. Being able to use magic was such a wonderful thing. She kicked the chain that fell to the floor and jumped up from her seat.She grabbed the beast and held it in her arms. She figured out who had sent this ugly beast to her. The dream in which Emily appeared was not meaningless. Emily was really alive.Emily, who arrived safely on Walpurgis Island, came to save her after 8 years.\u2018To take me to Walpurgis Island.\u2019\u201cEmily sent it. Now I\u2019m going to the witches\u2019 island! I can really run away!\u201dThe beast in her arms made a squeak and jumped through the bars, winking as if directing her. She courageously wiped away the tears from her face and reached for the prison lock.She paused. Maria was looking at her. She thought that she should release Maria\u2019s chains and leave together, but Maria shook her head as if she had read Rosen\u2019s thoughts.\u201cWalker, don\u2019t waste your energy.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go alone. Let me break your chains and open the door.\u201d\u201cNo. You go alone.\u201d\u201cIf you get caught like this and go to Monte Island, you\u2019ll die. I will-\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that she was pretending to be nice. She could not have escaped Al Capez without Maria\u2019s help. This was the bare minimum of loyalty and courtesy of one human to another. But Maria adamantly refused.\u201cI\u2019m going to Monte Island.\u201d\u201cMaria, are you crazy? Everyone dies there. No one can survive\u2026 \u201d\u201cThen I must be the first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been in prison all my life. I ruled and lived as a king. You want me to get out now? That\u2019s funny.\u201dMaria laughed heartily. In the face of that maddening noise, Rosen realized that the honor of being the witch of Al Capez was too much for her. No matter how she thought about it, it was the title Maria should have. Maria grinned in the dark, and she spoke again.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think, but I liked you quite a bit, Walker. Do you know why?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Because I am a prisoner?\u201d\u201cNo, because you\u2019re a f*cking liar like me and a really mean b!tch.\u201d\u201cIs that a curse or a compliment?\u201d\u201cRosen Walker. Listen carefully. When I become a good b!tch, I will go to heaven. But I won\u2019t. Bad b!tches like me\u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to go to heaven after you die?\u201d\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t look back. Stunning from behind and running away is your speciality. Go where you want to go.\u201dIt was only then that she realized what Maria was trying to say and smiled mischievously. She was right.They had thrown away their ticket to Heaven and jumped into the fires of Hell. That\u2019s why they were here.She took a deep breath and reached for the lock again.The iron door opened with a rattling sound. A tall shadow entered the solitary cell. The beast hid in the shadows like a frightened cat. She held her breath.***\u201cRosen Walker, come out.\u201dHenry was standing in front of her. Rosen hurriedly hid her unchained hands behind her back, but Henry seemed too distracted to notice. He breathed heavily as if he had been running, and was constantly looking around.Rosen stared blankly at him as he removed a key from his belt and unlocked the prison door.\u201cWalker, follow me quickly.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why are you releasing me all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYou need to see Sir Kerner.\u201dHenry didn\u2019t explain further. He grabbed her hand and pulled her.\u201cWhere are we going? His cabin?\u201d\u201cI told you. To our proud Commander who fell in love with you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either! Don\u2019t ask! No time! Let\u2019s hurry.\u201dHenry turned away and pulled her. The marine beast crept out and followed them, watching Henry. Rosen didn\u2019t know why, but she followed where he led her and asked again.\u201cAre you proud of this?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be an honorable thing? People kept me locked up the whole time, saying I must be possessed by a witch too. I barely managed to open the door and get you.\u201dHe laughed and whispered. Rosen squeezed his hand and climbed the stairs, lowering her head to walk through the still-steamy engine room door. The sound of the spinning gears drowned out all the other sounds around them, and when they reached a place where they could barely hear their own thoughts, Henry spoke normally.\u201cWalker. Go through that door, and you\u2019ll find the engine room. The heart of a ship is its engine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where Sir Kerner is. Meet and kiss one last time or talk, whatever you want. He wants to see you.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t have to ask Henry why he got her out of prison. She could have gotten out without his help.\u201cWhy did you do this\u2026?\u201dBut she did ask. It was because Henry was crying while looking at her. Henry didn\u2019t answer, but hung his head low with his hands in his pockets.\u201cWalker, you are a famous prison escapee.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cIf I let you go like this, can you run away from here too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Will you run away? Do you want me to let you go?\u201dRosen laughed. It was funny to see a large man with a weak voice looking at her with tears in his eyes.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cYou saved Layla. I have to pay for her life with yours.\u201d\u201cDid you get permission from Ian Kerner? Letting go is second, at least taking me to Sir Kerner.\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou really think Ian Kerner will let me do this? Is your boss the kind of person who will abandon his mission because of personal feelings?\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s just been shaken for a moment. Still\u2026 \u201dHenry knew Ian better than Rosen did. He muttered to himself, then shook his head. He asked.\u201c\u2026Walker. Does everyone really die when they go to the island?\u201d\u201cPerhaps. Unless you\u2019re a prisoner as strong as Maria.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a prisoner, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit different.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For some reason, Henry meekly lowered his head and moved into her arm\u2019s reach. She gently stroked Henry\u2019s hair, the same color as Layla\u2019s.\u201cYou make a good case, but I know you can\u2019t do that. Thank you, though.\u201d\u201cWhy are you stroking my hair?\u201dHenry knew. He could never let her go.He was a soldier who could not betray his superiors, and no matter how much affection he gave her, Ian Kerner would always be above him. He couldn\u2019t stand the situation.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty nice, unlike my first impression.\u201d\u201cD*mn, you\u2019re a piece of sh!t.\u201dHis voice was weepy.Rosen suddenly felt sorry for Henry. She was not in a position to sympathize with anyone. She should be worrying about herself now.\u201cCome to think of it, it wasn\u2019t just because of Layla. I hated seeing you die like this. I didn\u2019t know, but it seems like you\u2019ve always been hated. And I was one of those people\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t force me to kill you. I won\u2019t.\u201dBut when she saw him shedding tears like that, and hearing him say that he mustered up the courage to set her free, she wondered if it was okay to forgive Henry, even if he didn\u2019t know everything about the world that tormented her.It seemed that her mind had become a little more relaxed because she had the power of magic. To the point where she could now look down at him, who had been glaring at her all along. Henry no longer seemed like her jailer, but rather a poor child who was forced to board a fighter jet.It was a bit of a metaphor, but it felt like the first time Rosen bested Hindley Haworth. The moment when an opponent who seemed impossible to beat became infinitely smaller.\u201cRosen, the Sir Kerner I know would never act like this\u2026 But just once, throw away all your strange tricks to meet him and cling to him with all your heart. Sir Kerner seems a little crazy. In my opinion\u2026 I think he likes you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I right?\u201d\u201cHenry, what time is it?\u201dRosen interrupted Henry and asked. The faint smell of alcohol had been emanating from him. Henry might have gotten used to her behavior, since this time he didn\u2019t criticize her for saying something that spoiled the mood. Without saying a word, he rummaged through his pockets to find a watch.\u201cHave you been drinking? You smell like alcohol.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Why?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing to do while on duty. Did everyone else on deck drink too?\u201d\u201cEveryone has drank unless they\u2019re homicidal maniacs. No matter who you are, how can you drown a woman in the sea sober?\u201dIt was disgusting.However, Henry decided to admit that he drank. A sick child, a weak-hearted child. How did he manage when he saw so much blood during the war and became frozen at the sight of death?\u201cDid Sir Kerner drink?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He has been imprisoned. He is not the kind of person to be like that, but since they threw you into the sea, he might have drank it.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201d\u2018Can magic make people sleep?\u2019Rosen tried muttering \u2018go to sleep\u2019 about ten times while watching Henry, but the magic was too difficult, so it didn\u2019t work.She would be fine if he fell asleep.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to worry about what kind of magic to use on Henry.\u201cBut why\u2026?\u201dHenry took a few more steps and collapsed to the floor before he could finish his sentence. The effect of sleeping powder had finally manifested. Rosen caught him so he didn\u2019t hit his head on the hard floor.The marine beast jumped out of the shadows and licked Henry\u2019s cheek. Soon it crawled to his belt and bit off his gun and watch.\u2018Poor guy.\u2019After she successfully escaped, he would be in trouble along with Ian Kerner. Maybe even demoted. But since he was from a prestigious family, he\u2019d live well regardless. What she was worried about was the trauma he suffered from\u2026Rosen whispered in Henry\u2019s ear.He couldn\u2019t hear it, but she wanted to tell him.\u201cYou are not responsible. Do not suffer. You were young then. It was unavoidable. Of course, you did wrong to me\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re even.\u201dRosen stroked Henry\u2019s head once. It was embarrassing and creepy, but she kissed him on the forehead. There was a saying that whoever was kissed by a witch would not drown in the sea. Maybe she survived the winter sea because she was kissed by Emily.Henry used to be a pilot, and now that his affiliation had changed, he was a Navy man who could easily fall into the sea. If the story was true, Rosen felt like this would help.\u201cBut now that I\u2019m old, I want you to grow up.\u201dWalpurg only loved girls, so she was not sure the blessing would work. There was a high possibility that it was one of many foundless rumors about witches\u2026But she still hoped Henry would be okay.In the meantime, the marine beast urged Rosen to go quickly. Rosen took Henry\u2019s pistol and watch. Ian had a pistol, so she might as well have one. If Henry\u2019s words were true, he was locked up in the engine room, but there could always be another nasty surprise waiting for her.Rosen moved toward the stairs leading to the deck.As expected, people were strewn about the deck. The ship was eerily quiet. She did not avoid the broken glass, but stepped forward onto it. She was carelessly hopeful.Maybe Ian Kerner had been drinking in the meantime and was asleep in the engine room.[Rosen Walker!She was, in fact, a real witch!After the ship was stopped by magic and everyone was asleep, she escaped again!War hero Ian Kerner was also helpless to the sudden magic\u2026]It seemed like a good article.What a perfect story.It would be a perfect excuse for Ian Kerner; that he didn\u2019t know she was a witch and was tricked.Of course, high-ranking people have no flexibility, and even if they had no choice, Ian was her prison guard, so it would be difficult to avoid being reprimanded. But unless the government and the military went crazy, they wouldn\u2019t shoot Ian just because they lost her. They would have to spend the next ten years spreading propaganda.Then Ian Kerner would be fine.Continuing her thoughts, Rosen suddenly remembered an important fact.\u2018Sh!t!\u2019Come to think of it, he already made a mistake. He jumped into the sea in front of everyone and rescued her.Still, would they blame him for risking his life on a mission? People loved him as much as they hated her. That much could easily be forgiven.How much did Ian sacrifice for the Empire?The beast who had been walking ahead turned around and stared at her. It was certain that it had intelligence as well. Its grape-like eyes glared at her as if it had noticed her mind strife with worries about him.\u201cWhat, why?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI will run away! I\u2019m not a fool. Why would I hold back because of my feelings? How else would I have gotten to this point unless I was a little crazy?\u201dShe had no idea, but it seemed like the beast was getting angry. Rosen held out the pistol that was tightly gripped in her hand.\u201cI would shoot Ian Kerner to death if he got in the way of my escape. But still, the aftermath is a little worrying. He\u2019s weaker than he looked, and I\u2019m worried about Henry too.\u201dRosen sighed as she touched the cold pistol in her hand. She had to admit it.She liked Ian Kerner.Of course, that didn\u2019t stop her, but at least she hoped the worst wouldn\u2019t come if she had to point a gun at him.She didn\u2019t want to kill him with her own hands, let alone the fact that if they got into a gunfight, she\u2019d have no chance against him.Shaking her head, she cleared her thoughts. In her experience, thinking for a long time didn\u2019t do her much good.The more thoughts you have, the slower your steps, and then you lose courage.Rosen wasn\u2019t like that.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dShe turned to the place where the lifeboat she had seen before was located. The beast, who had been running ahead, started following her.Opening the door on the deck floor, she saw another huge space below. It was a dock. A dusty boat was waiting for her there. She didn\u2019t have the key, but now she had magic. She didn\u2019t know how to steer a boat at all, but she decided she would worry about that after getting the boat free.Whatever she decided, she had to do it quickly. This prisoner had no time to hesitate.All she had to do was throw it into the sea. Emily said she would lead her. Rosen grabbed the iron ladder and slowly descended.\u2018Now, how do you launch a boat?\u2019Her guess was that there was an opening on the surface below, and she would just have to push the boat to get there\u2026The structure of the steamboat was too complicated for her to understand. There were countless levers and gears on the wall.\u2018Which of those levers will open the entrance?\u2019Unfortunately, Alex only taught her what to do after she got into the lifeboat, not how to get it out.It must have been common sense to him.Ordinary people didn\u2019t know those kinds of things.\u201c\u2026Do you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you do this by magic?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I was a fool to ask a beast.\u201dRosen decided to start by pushing the boat to the wall. The lifeboat was bigger than she had thought, and it was well-maintained, but it was in close contact with the floor because it had not been used for a long time. She didn\u2019t know if she could do it on her own. She swallowed her fear and put both hands on the lifeboat, and raised it as hard as she could. It seemed impossible to push it alone.\u201c\u2026Hey, help me.\u201dThe beast nodded and stuck its head under the boat. The sound of the lifeboat dragging on the floor was as loud as thunder. She hesitated at first, fearing that the sound would wake people, but she soon remembered that they took sleeping powder, and continued moving. If it had to be done anyway, it was better to finish it quickly.At that moment, she felt someone\u2019s presence behind her.The sound of heels hitting the dock floor was approaching.Rosen felt ominous. It wasn\u2019t the light, sharp sound of a lady\u2019s shoes, nor the flat shoes that men normally wore.It was the dull sound of military boots.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The beast growled as they both looked in the direction the muzzle was pointing.The darkness finally spat out its uninvited guest. Rosen checked the face exposed under the light of the gas lamp and let out a laugh. That f*cking handsome face.Ian Kerner stood there, staring at her.Her fever still hadn\u2019t completely subsided, so her whole body was hot, and her mind was blank.She was truly out of luck.How was he standing there, awake, when everyone else drank?Why did he keep threatening her?And he was locked up in the engine room, so how did he get here?She gritted her teeth and screamed.\u201cRaise your hands!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHands up, Ian Kerner. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m holding a gun?\u201dFortunately, she was the first to pick up a gun. He wasn\u2019t pointing a gun at her.The beast stepped forward and threatened him, revealing its teeth.Without a word, Ian obediently raised his hands as she instructed. But he showed no signs of fear. Neither the pistol she was holding nor the oddly-shaped monster seemed to frighten him.He walked toward her without hesitation. To the distance where the light reached, and her face was visible to him. She didn\u2019t know if he was not afraid because he was a soldier, or if her threats were clumsy. She screamed again.\u201cRaise your hands properly! Don\u2019t come any closer!\u201dHe still had his hands up, but he didn\u2019t seem to pay much attention to what Rosen was saying. He glanced at her pistol and opened his mouth.\u201cIs it Henry\u2019s?\u201d\u201cWhy does that matter?!\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not loaded.\u201dRosen\u2019s eyes went wide. The strength in her grip was about to fail. She braced herself, gripping the pistol tightly again, and put her finger on the trigger. Just as she was about to argue about how he knew if it was Henry\u2019s gun or not, Ian\u2019s hand lowered and released the pistol from his belt.It was obvious who would win if Ian and Rosen had a gunfight. A pilot who spent 10 years in the war against her, who had never held a gun before today. Driven to the edge of a cliff, Rosen pulled the trigger.Bang- Bang-A gunshot cut through the air.\u201cD*mn it!\u201dRosen realized that Ian was right. The sound was gunpowder exploding. Nothing was fired from the gun. Ian stepped closer to Rosen.She hesitated and stepped back. But there was no place to escape.All she could feel behind her was the cold wall.Reflexively, Rosen covered her head with her arms and closed her eyes. She forgot for a second that she was able to use magic as she crouched down like an idiot until he took a few steps forward, only to belatedly reach out his hand.But nothing happened.The world was silent.She opened her eyes slowly.The engine stopped for a moment, the boat was still floating on the water, and Ian Kerner came right up to her and crouched down in front of her, staring at her\u2026\u201cThis has live bullets.\u201dHe was handing her another pistol. To be precise, the pistol that hung at his waist.\u201cIt\u2019s my gun.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s loaded, so it\u2019s simple. Pull the trigger, and it\u2019ll fire.\u201dIan calmly handed the pistol to Rosen as she stared blankly at him. He pulled her arm forward and put the gun in her grip. The cold metal of the pistol wrapped around her fingertips. Suddenly, she could decide the course of his life with one movement.\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou can shoot whenever you feel anxious.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cI want to talk.\u201dRosen\u2019s lips trembled. The beast ran up to him belatedly, clung to his arm, and rammed its teeth into him, but Ian didn\u2019t blink an eye, removed the beast, and spoke again.\u201cDoes this make you feel safe?\u201d\u201cI have nothing to talk about.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t want to know why he was here, what he wanted to talk to her about, or why he didn\u2019t shoot her.Those things\u2026It didn\u2019t matter anymore.It just made her steps heavier.He shook his head, pulled something out of his pocket, and held it out.It was a gold coin.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThis is the coin you gave to Layla.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026It was a bronze coin.\u201dRosen listened to him and realized\u2026The last condition, \u2018some magic\u2019? Ian Kerner found out that Rosen was a witch.Rosen stared into his gray eyes.He was waiting for words to exit from her mouth, not even moving away from the muzzle of the gun.\u201cI heard people locked you in the engine room.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201d\u201cHenry,\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t locked up. I ended up agreeing to throw you into the sea.\u201d\u201cThen why are you doing this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026My God, you lied to the people.\u201dRealizing the unbelievable fact, Rosen burst out laughing. She soon realized why her plan had been executed so easily.Why people drank in this situation, and why he was the only one left awake on this ship\u2026\u201cYou fed them wine.\u201dIan didn\u2019t answer.No, it was closer to not being able to answer.\u201cBecause I believe you are innocent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I believed your story, and I believed that you weren\u2019t a witch\u2026\u201dIan Kerner believed Rosen. He believed her story and fooled everyone on this ship. He mixed up her exaggerations and betrayed the Empire because of her alone.But what could she do? After all, she really was a witch\u2026\u201cYou are wrong. I am a witch.\u201d\u201cYeah, seeing how it\u2019s followed you, it seems that way.\u201dWith his chin, he pointed at the marine beast, who was circling around them. His expression was uncharacteristically calm. Looking at that emotionless face, where Rosen couldn\u2019t find any betrayal or anger, she was rather helpless.\u201c\u2026What do you want from me? What are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cIf you want, I can try to get you on trial again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go back and get them to let you face trial again.\u201dRosen was dumbfounded. Maria\u2019s words crossed her mind. Rosen thought it was ridiculous at the time\u2026 In fact, Ian was crazier than Maria expected. He trusted her even though he didn\u2019t sleep with her, and he was talking nonsense about letting her go back on trial for nothing in return.\u201cHow are you-\u201d\u201cI am acquainted with the Emperor. I\u2019m from the military academy. And the Emperor has the right to ask the court for a special trial.\u201d\u201cOh, that scarecrow Emperor?\u201dRosen chuckled. She didn\u2019t know much about politics, but she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fall for that. The Emperor no longer had any power.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that could be, but let\u2019s say there\u2019s another trial. Do you think that would make a difference?\u201dHe didn\u2019t deny what she said. In fact, even Ian knew it. Even if the trial was repeated a hundred times, the result would not change. No one in the Empire could save her. Even if there was such a person, it wasn\u2019t him.But anyway, he was saying he would do for her what no one else in the world would. He was a man who didn\u2019t know how to joke, so it was safe to assume that he was serious about all of this.\u201cIan Kerner, what\u2019s wrong? Why the hell are you doing this to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201dRosen challenged him by asking a question she already knew the answer to.But in fact, she knew. She was just in denial because she was afraid to admit it. She knew everything and tried to ignore it.She just didn\u2019t know why.What did everything he had done for her mean?Preparing a cake for her, jumping into the sea to rescue her, secretly taking a prisoner out of her cage and calling her to his cabin, anxiously caring for her in case she died, and finally betraying all the people who believed in him because of her\u2026Whether it was because he was mad and broken, or because he watched her for so long that she had fooled him\u2026Ian Kerner believed her wholeheartedly.No one else in the world did.This was a fight she had no choice but to lose from the beginning, but victory was already in her hands. She was aiming at him with the pistol he handed her. He gave her his lifeline without hesitation.So she decided not to deceive him until the end.Rosen asked, looking into his gray eyes.\u201cDo you want the truth?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you believe anything I say?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t care.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter.Why the heck did it matter?He already trusted her.She knew how dangerous faith was.The deeper the trust, the moment it is overturned, the deeper the wound and the greater the hatred.\u201cSo tell me, Rosen.\u201dDidn\u2019t she say it didn\u2019t matter? Then she\u2019d tell him the truth.He was a man who had the right to know the cruel truth, not the beautiful lie.\u201cThe people are right. I\u2019m a d*mn liar and a witch\u2026\u201dThe people were right.She was a liar.She told so many lies that she had come to the point where she was confused about what was true and what was not.But there was still one truth that she reminded herself of often.It was a sin that plunged her life into the abyss, and at the same time, her pride.She was the real culprit in the murder of Hindley Haworth.It wasn\u2019t a robbery, nor did she take the blame for what Emily had done.She did it alone.She killed Hindley Haworth deliberately, calmly, and maliciously at the age of seventeen. She brutally murdered him by stabbing him thirty-six times with a knife. Even so, she shamelessly maintained her innocence over the years and threw the Empire into chaos by escaping twice.For the first time, she admitted what she hadn\u2019t told anyone.\u201cI am a murderer. I killed Hindley Haworth.\u201dBecause that was the only truth she could tell him at this moment.\u201cIan, I tricked you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEmily was a herbalist and the real doctor of the clinic. Rosen learned a lot from Emily and helped her often. It was safe to say that selecting and storing herbs was her job. Emily taught Rosen that some herbs could save sick people, while others could harm healthy people, so she had to be careful.For example, the leaves of the Maeria tree look similar to the leaves of Lyria that grow in bushes. Maeria leaves have pointed tips, while Lyria leaves do not. It was a difference you could only see by looking closely. However, the effects of the two herbs were completely different.Maeria leaves are harmless except for special cases and are widely used in various medicines, but Lyria leaves are poisonous. If you eat a little, your limbs will be paralyzed, and if you eat more, you will die.The night after Hindley locked Emily away, Rosen made soup and set it in front of Hindley. He came in very late because he was gambling that day too. He opened his mouth wide with a gruff face, put the soup in his mouth and swallowed it.Unlike usual, when Rosen sneaked out of the kitchen as soon as he started eating, she pulled out the chair across from Hindley and sat down. She asked, staring at Hindley with her chin resting on her palm.\u201cYou know, Hindley. Haven\u2019t you had weird thoughts while running the clinic?\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI think people die really easily.\u201d\u201cI said that I hate noisy kids. I told you not to talk nonsense with me.\u201dHe slumped his head over the bowl of soup and replied dryly. Rosen watched him eat the soup with a spoon.\u201cWell, stabbing will kill you, and even being hit with a blunt weapon will kill you, but\u2026 You don\u2019t necessarily have to die with that kind of physical force.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you get sick, you die, and if you eat poison, don\u2019t you die?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dHe frowned and looked at her.Rosen continued talking with an expressionless face.\u201cHindley used to say that I\u2019m a good kid unlike Emily, so I\u2019m not in danger.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying something strange. You can\u2019t kill me. What, are you going to use magic to secretly kill me?\u201d\u201cEmily is a witch, and I am not.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut if you chose me over Emily for that reason alone, then Hindley was mistaken.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t know what criteria Hindley used to choose her as his bride out of the many orphanage girls. Since he was an infinitely shallow human being, he probably liked her appearance or that she was small, like a child. Anyway, she could bet on the fact that he hadn\u2019t looked at her orphanage records.If he had seen those, he wouldn\u2019t have said she was a good kid. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t have chosen her.Well, she forgot about it for a long time after she came to this house.Rosen wasn\u2019t a good kid. It had never been like that.She was a child who always gave back what she received.\u201cHindley Haworth, you chose the wrong wife.\u201d\u201cYou are crazy\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Hindley put his spoon down with a hardened face. His complexion turned pale. He immediately grabbed his neck. He seemed to notice something was wrong, so he stuck his finger down his throat and tried to spit up the food. Rosen laughed. Unfortunately, it was already too late.The muscles in Hindley\u2019s face twisted grotesquely. He could no longer move his limbs. It was probably because the Lyria leaves had paralyzed his muscles, but it was probably also because of the burning pain in his intestines. The soup bowl hit the floor and shattered. He screamed and fell stiff as a block of wood from his chair.Rosen had pondered in front of the soup bowl that evening. It was not about whether or not to put Lyria leaves, but the amount.Should she put less?Should she put more?If she put too much, Hindley would die quickly and easily, and if she added too little, it would be painful, but he wouldn\u2019t die right away.She thought a quick and easy death was too much of a luxury for him.He had to be in pain.Even so, it wouldn\u2019t even touch the amount of pain both Emily and she had suffered, but she wanted to give him the most pain she could.So, it was fair.It was right.Rosen got up from her seat.\u201cI don\u2019t need magic, Hindley.\u201dHindley stiffened, looking up at her with bloodshot eyes.She picked up a cleaver from the counter. It was sufficient. Rosen stood in the huge shadow she cast. At that moment, she felt completely unafraid of the tyrant who always controlled their life. He was very frail, and smaller than she thought.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything that great to kill you.\u201d\u201cRo- Rosen.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me by my name. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s not a name you have any right to call.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you say? What magic were you talking about? If I want to kill, I can kill. Why didn\u2019t I know this until now?\u201dRosen stared at him with a twisted smile as Hindley\u2019s body twisted in pain. She carefully watched him tremble as he looked at her without saying anything.He was afraid of her now.\u201cSa-save me.\u201d\u201cYou are not in danger.\u201dWeird, why didn\u2019t she think of that?It was such a simple thing. It was enough to take this knife she had held every day and rip open his mouth for screaming at Emily, take a hammer and crush his leg for kicking her, and get a rope from the shed and choke Hindley while he was sleeping.Then he would have been so ugly, like a b*stard, lying under her feet and begging her to save him.-Please save me\u2026Just like she did.He soon knelt down in front of her and began muttering something in a low-pitched voice. He seemed to be admitting his mistakes.But it was already too late. Rosen wasn\u2019t a compassionate person like Emily. The belated apology didn\u2019t work on her.She approached him, climbed on top of him as he rolled across the floor and spat out vomit, and whispered as she thrust the knife into his carotid artery.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want this to happen, you should have killed me first. Did you really think I couldn\u2019t kill you? You screamed that you would kill us every day.\u201d\u201cSa-save me\u2026\u201d\u201cBut look, you are a coward after all. You are a despicable person who doesn\u2019t have the courage to kill anyone. After all, we are the only ones who serve calmly under you. Screaming that you would kill us every day, that was bullsh!t. You needed us, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you broke Emily. Not letting her run away or die. You pulled out her teeth and ripped out her nails. But I\u2019m different. I\u2019m not broken yet. I don\u2019t need you. Besides, I\u2019m desperate. I want to kill you desperately. In exchange for my whole life, if I can send you to hell, I\u2019m willing to fall into a more terrible hell.\u201d\u201cMe\u2026 If you kill- me\u2026 \u201d\u2018D*mn.\u2019Hindley threatened her until his last breath. But she already knew what was to come after that.If so, did she really need to hear it through Hindley\u2019s mouth?No, not at all.He had been talking too much during that time. Now she must shut his mouth.Rosen swung a chair at him, who was motionless and spewing foam. There was the sound of something breaking. Either his leg bone or his arm bone must have broken. Well, it wasn\u2019t her business. If he couldn\u2019t move at all, that was enough.Better if it hurt like hell.She raised the knife high and plunged it into his neck. It didn\u2019t go in as well as she thought. Bone and muscle blocked the blade. The blade pushed back and cut her hand. She gave more strength to her arms regardless. She squeezed his throat one last time, which was gasping for breath. The blood from his arteries mixed with the blood on her hands.\u201cYou, you will be tried\u2026 For killing me\u2026 y- going to hell. You will be burned at stake.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Because you will die first.\u201dRosen continued to brandish the knife expressionlessly. Hindley could not speak anymore.\u2018I won\u2019t die.\u2019\u201cWhy would I die if you were the one who did something wrong?\u2019\u2018It was a fight that wouldn\u2019t end until either of us died.\u2019\u2018Then I\u2019ll win.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t like losing.\u2019\u2018And maybe you\u2019re right.\u2019\u2018If I kill you, I\u2019ll go to jail.\u2019\u2018I might be framed as a witch and burned in the square or hanged in the gallows. No, I\u2019ll be thrown into battle before I even stand in court.\u2019\u2018You said I would live a life worse than death there and be miserably trampled on.\u2019\u2018You covered my mouth, tied my hands, and cut off my feet.\u2019\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I\u2019m not afraid. Because you won\u2019t be there. I\u2019d rather choose hell without you than heaven with you.\u2019\u2018I would rather defeat you and fall into hell than become a good girl and go to heaven.\u2019\u2018Hindley, I won.\u2019\u2018I beat you.\u2019It didn\u2019t take long. The blade ended up avoiding muscles and ligaments and puncturing blood vessels. Blood gushed out like a fountain and soaked her whole body.The life in Hindley\u2019s eyes disappeared.One day, a soldier walking around town gathered people together and talked about how it felt when he killed a person for the first time. Rosen thought he would brag, like other soldiers, about how many noses and ears he had cut off on the battlefield.But he said it was a very scary and miserable feeling.-Do you know how terrible it feels to stop being human?But she found out when she tried it herself.It was all lies.Neither guilt nor fear had a hold on her.Murder was thrilling.At least, that was the case with killing Hindley Haworth.If this was giving up being human, she could do it.She laughed out loud, covered in blood.Sitting in the blood-soaked living room, staring at Hindley, who no longer breathed, Rosen crouched down and thought of one thing.Not breathing, he was just a huge lump of flesh.\u2018Just what were you?\u2019\u2018Why was I afraid of you for so long?\u2019\u2018You were this small, after all.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rosen took the key and a pocket knife from his mangled corpse. She opened the cupboard doors, grabbed the things she needed, and put them in her bag. Food, clothes, maps and some money. And even herbs for Emily.Rosen was very calm. To the point where she wiped the blood off her face with a towel, fearing that Emily would be surprised if she found Rosen covered in blood.She grabbed a gas lamp and opened the warehouse door. She shook Emily\u2019s shoulder, collapsed from exhaustion. Fortunately, Emily was still breathing.\u201cEmily, wake up.\u201dEmily opened her heavy eyes and lifted her head. Rosen touched Emily\u2019s forehead and poured water over her parched lips. A fever ravaged Emily\u2019s body, but that wouldn\u2019t be hard to control. It was a relief.\u201c\u2026 Rosen?\u201dEmily was horrified at the sight of her. Rosen had wiped the blood that spattered on her face, but the blood that drenched her body and the sharp stench was not hidden. She didn\u2019t want to scare Emily.\u201cWhat the hell is going on\u2026?\u201dEmily struggled to get up and cupped Rosen\u2019s cheeks. Emily hadn\u2019t seemed to grasp the situation quite yet. She asked urgently in a hoarse voice.\u201cAre you okay? How many times did Hindley hit you? Look!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not hurt at all.\u201dEmily\u2019s expression turned white as she ran her hands down Rosen\u2019s body. Emily stared in dismay at the blood that soaked her clothes and stained her hands. It was then that she seemed to realize what Rosen had done.\u201cI killed Hindley. It\u2019s all over now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. We don\u2019t have time, so listen to me and do as I say. We have to move separately from now on. You had a fight with Hindley a few days ago and left the house. You have been imprisoned the whole time, so luckily no one knows that Emily is a witch yet-\u201d\u201cRosen!\u201d\u201cListen carefully! Don\u2019t say anything! Take the night train before dawn. Night trains have poor security. You\u2019ll be able to ride it without any problems. This time, no one will come after you. Because I\u2019ve killed that person!\u201dRosen forced Emily up from her seat, pushing a bundle into her arms. Emily rejected her offer.\u201cYou want me to go alone? Rosen, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Where\u2019s the body? Let\u2019s get rid of it first. There\u2019s got to be something we can do. Let\u2019s clean up together\u2026\u201d\u201cHe visited racetracks and gambling tables every day. How can we hide it when he doesn\u2019t visit debtors in the morning? How long do you think it will last?\u201d\u201cAt least let me use magic!\u201dEmily shouted, clutching the necklace around her neck. At that moment, the mineral on the restraint glowed green, but it quickly turned brown again. Emily, who was otherwise exhausted, was about to fall over, unable to cope with the momentary force she had used. Rosen caught Emily.\u201cWhat are you going to do with that weak body? Don\u2019t waste your energy, Emily. Save it and run away. You said you were scared of witch hunters, right? Go to Walpurgis Island. I\u2019m not a witch, but Emily is, so you\u2019ll find it easily. They say all witches are accepted there. And they can release the restraint\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t killed Hindley today, he would have killed you, right? Did I do well?\u201d\u201c\u2026Rosen, you-\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll let Emily go first, and I\u2019ll leave before the sun rises. It\u2019ll be easier to catch us if we move together. We\u2019ve failed before, right? You said you\u2019d never make that mistake again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr shall we meet in Saint-Vinnesier in a few days? Would you wait there? I\u2019ll take the first car at dawn. If Emily takes the night train\u2026 \u201dRosen uttered whatever came to her mind. Inconsistent words poured out. But they all had one purpose. Getting Emily out of the house, now.\u2018Leave me here and run far, far away.\u2019\u201cHow can I leave without you?\u201d\u201cOtherwise, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPeople will come when the sun rises. If you\u2019re with me, you\u2019ll get caught. If Emily is found to be a witch, we\u2019ll both be considered witches and shot without mercy. But if I\u2019m caught alone, I can go to trial in the worst-case scenario. Emily, are you going to kill me, too?\u201dRosen shouted, shaking Emily\u2019s shoulder, who couldn\u2019t answer.\u201cAnswer me. Will you kill me too? Or will we meet again somehow?\u201dEmily was not a fool. She knew that it was unrealistic to say that they could both be safe. Emily began to cry, pulling on the necklace that choked her neck.\u201cIt\u2019s because of this. It\u2019s all because of me. If I had found a way to break this long ago, and if I hadn\u2019t been afraid\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t have gone this far if I were a witch who could use her powers. We could have run away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have always protected me, but now I am only a hindrance to you. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It was always you who protected me\u2026\u201dEmily always feared that the restraint might accidentally break. She always wore a handkerchief around her neck, in case it cracked. Rosen shook her head. Funnily enough, she was happy at the moment. Because Emily wanted to solve it first.And she was the one who protected Emily? Rosen laughed.\u201cI am not dying. I will never die. I promise you, Emily.\u201dRosen stared at the restraints which Emily was still pulling on. But it was something that had been strangling Emily for a long time. It couldn\u2019t be released that easily.Rosen whispered, wiping away Emily\u2019s tears.\u201cEmily can do it. I\u2019ve known you for a long time. Everything Hindley used to say was crap. Emily is a wonderful, great person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEmily could always do it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cGo. Before the people come. I\u2019ll follow you. We\u2019ll definitely meet again someday.\u201dRosen pushed Emily hard. Only then did Emily decide to stop crying and step forward. She murmured as she wrapped her arm around Rosen\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou will forever be my sister. So I will wait for you. Let\u2019s go somewhere where the two of us can live happily ever after.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t worry. I will run.\u201d\u201cYou take the train too. Let\u2019s meet in Saint-Vinnesier in three days. I will wait.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAnd remember, Rosen. One drop of blood, one wish, some magic.\u201dEmily ran into the dark night.\u2018Let\u2019s meet again someday.\u2019Rosen hoped that the vagueness of the word \u2018someday\u2019 would help Emily.She was fine. Meeting Emily was enough magic for Rosen. It was the greatest magic of her life. No more was needed.But\u2026Rosen lied.She didn\u2019t run away. She didn\u2019t even try.She just crouched in front of Hindley\u2019s corpse and waited for dawn, when they found Hindley Haworth\u2019s body and dragged her out of the house. Until the soldiers handcuffed her hands and walked through the town square.\u2018Emily has to run far, far away while all eyes are on me. Emily is a real witch, and I am not. So I can pass the stone test and be put on trial instead of being shot straight away.\u2019\u2018After all, it was I who killed Hindley, not Emily.\u2019The next day the sky was clear. In the blue skies floated trails that must have been left behind by a rookie pilot.Arguably, that was the most wonderful day of her life. For the first time, she felt proud of herself. She walked through the square with her head held high, undeterred by the pouring filth and swear words.It was such a wonderful thing to protect someone\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would I give the judge one more reason for me to kill Hindley?\u201d***Actually, Rosen had a similar thought. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. In her first trial, which was not public, she confessed everything.She knew. The chances of her being completely acquitted were slim. The evidence was too obvious, and there was no escape. Everything pointed to her.The first thing she did after confessing was to tear off her clothes and show her body to the soldiers. After seeing her wounds, she thought everyone would know why she killed Hindley. She thought people would understand\u2026\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhere did he hit you?\u201d\u201cMy whole body. Can\u2019t you see?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think was the reason?\u201d\u201cD*mn it, how would I know that? He was the kind of person who hit me when he was busy, annoyed, and bored. When it rained, he hit me because it rained.\u201d\u201cDid you really get hit by your husband?\u201d\u201cWho else would beat me but Hindley Haworth?\u201d\u201cHow can you prove that?\u201d\u201cLook at Leoarton! It\u2019s rare for a woman not to be hit by her husband!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you do something wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThere were rumors that you had an affair\u2026 If so, then he did the right thing.\u201dRosen didn\u2019t answer. It didn\u2019t feel worth answering. That was when she first got the feeling. The frustration and helplessness she felt when she first tried to run away.\u201cWas there any other way? Not involving killing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you really think there was?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s assume you\u2019re right. Still, killing is too demonic. It was something that could be resolved through talking.\u201d\u2018Through talking?\u2019\u2018Was there no other way than to kill him?\u2019\u2018How nice it would\u2019ve been if there were such a thing.\u2019\u2018If someone had put Hindley in jail, things wouldn\u2019t have gone this far.\u2019Rosen was dumbfounded.Talk?How was she supposed to talk?For the past two years, everything she tried was conversation.\u201cDon\u2019t hit me.\u201d\u201cHelp me.\u201dShe never got an answer.She also asked soldiers for help. Of course, they didn\u2019t help her.\u201cIt\u2019s useless to regret now.\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t regret it.\u2019\u2018Because I couldn\u2019t help it.\u2019\u2018I would have regretted it more if I hadn\u2019t killed him.\u2019\u2018It was a war.\u2019\u2018A war that wouldn\u2019t have ended until Hindley or one of us had died.\u2019\u201cHave you ever killed anyone? No, you\u2019re a soldier, so of course you have. Why aren\u2019t you wearing handcuffs?\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the same. What\u2019s the difference between you and me?\u201d\u2018Because there was no one to save me and Emily.\u2019\u2018Because you guys didn\u2019t protect me even though we were law-abiding citizens.\u2019\u2018So I handled it myself.\u2019Rosen didn\u2019t want to die.\u2018Why don\u2019t you understand that?\u2019\u2018Why are people who say they have experienced worse than me so clueless?\u2019What followed was a repetition of the same questions and boring answers. In the process, Rosen realized more clearly. Words didn\u2019t work. They didn\u2019t want to listen to her.The world was not on her side.This time she wasn\u2019t surprised and didn\u2019t even cry. Because she already knew that nothing would change.Yelling at a wall would only hurt her own ears.Prior to her trial, she learned quite a bit from her cellmates. The senior officer declared her sentence as soon as he saw her.\u201cMurder is 8 to 50 years. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get about 40.\u201d\u201cWhat? Even serial killers don\u2019t get that much.\u201d\u201cIn my experience, that\u2019s the norm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen a man who beat his wife to death get eight years and then be released due to insufficient evidence. It won\u2019t be 40 years.\u201d\u201cYou killed your husband.\u201d\u201cBut-\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s different between killing a wife and killing a husband. It\u2019s all too common for a husband to beat his wife to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so, so common. In a fit of anger, in a fit of drunkenness, accidentally\u2026 But you are different. You\u2019re a freak. The women who come all the way here\u2026 It\u2019s disgusting. Usually they die before they get here.\u201dRosen soon realized that his words were true. In prison, there were many women like her who had killed their husbands. Their sentences were typically the maximum possible.30 years.40 years.50 years\u2026\u201cIs it because I am ignorant that I do not understand? Or is this normal? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cYou are so naive.\u201d\u201cIf you call me naive one more time, you\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cNo, you truly are naive. That\u2019s why you still have the belief that the world will be fair to you.\u201dRosen thought about it. She didn\u2019t like thinking very much, but sometimes she had to, mostly when she had to choose. In life, choices are usually made not between good and bad but between bad and worse.\u201cJust pray that you did everything right. That\u2019s for the best. If you emphasize that you confessed, you may be released in three or four years.\u201dThe second trial was open to the media.Before the second trial, she had to put her hand on the Magic Discrimination Stone once more to prove once again that she was not a witch. At that time, the investigator in charge of the identification stone test was a woman, which was rare. She looked at her silently and whispered softly.\u201cLet me give you some advice, Ms. Haworth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat you are about to do will not help you at all. They will wonder whether you killed Hindley Haworth or not, but it doesn\u2019t matter at this point. The second trial will be open to the media. I trust you know what that means.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m going to do?\u201d\u201c\u2026I heard that your plea was changed from the first trial. No. Acknowledge your sins and accept them unconditionally. That\u2019s what\u2019s best for a wife. The press will eat you alive.\u201dRosen took her hand off the Magic Discrimination Stone.The purple stone did not respond to her at all.She spat out, looking at the investigator.\u201cTell them to try.\u201dShe waited for her turn in the darkness. After a while, the courthouse door opened.Light poured in, and she walked into it.\u2018What should I do to stand out among the countless trials?\u2019\u2018How do I get people to notice me?\u2019It was a question that could be answered with just a moment\u2019s thought.When she looked up, she saw the judge of her case, a tired and grumpy looking old man.\u201cDo you swear to God that you will only tell the truth in front of this court?\u201d\u201cI swear.\u201d\u201c24601, Rosen Haworth. Then tell the truth in front of this court! Guilty as confessed in the first trial\u2026\u201dRosen laughed, glared at the judge, and proudly spat on the courtroom floor. A startled exclamation erupted from the audience. She raised the corners of her mouth and laughed as hard as she could.\u2018If they want the truth, I won\u2019t tell the truth.\u2019Words that no one had ever heard before this point.\u201cI am not a murderer.\u201d\u2018If I hadn\u2019t killed Hindley, Hindley would have killed us.\u2019\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u2018He brought it on himself. I just wanted to save Emily and I, but he was getting in the way.\u2019\u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d\u2018I didn\u2019t cheat. I was sold at a young age. He hit me.\u2019\u2018Please save me, please save me\u2026 No matter how many times I told him, he didn\u2019t listen.\u2019\u2018What did you do while he shaped my thoughts, manipulated me, and trampled me to pieces?\u2019\u2018I screamed endlessly for you to save me.\u2019\u2018No, actually, you wouldn\u2019t have listened. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m a human being, I\u2019m livestock and a slave. An accessory to Hindley Haworth.\u2019\u2018Because I wasn\u2019t the one you guys were protecting.\u2019Reporters who were dozing off noticed Rosen. She started hearing the sound of cameras clicking from all sides. Their murmurs grew and soon turned into accusations directed at her.Her plan had worked.\u2018They will now chastise me, mock me, hate me.\u2019\u2018But you won\u2019t be able to quietly plunge me into a dark prison.\u2019\u2018I\u2019ll never let you do that.\u2019The judge slammed the table with a look of bewilderment.\u201cRosen Haworth! You\u2019re about to throw away the last mercy of the Empire! Can you prove it?\u201d\u201c\u2026My name is Rosen Walker.\u201d\u2018I won\u2019t prove anything, I won\u2019t tell you the truth.\u2019\u201cYou swore to tell the truth!\u201d\u201cI am innocent! That\u2019s the truth!\u201dHer voice resounded in the courtroom. There was silence for a moment. Only the reporters\u2019 cameras clicked. The audience, the judge, and the jury all stared at her with astonished eyes. It didn\u2019t take long for her sentence to be decided.\u201c\u2026We will announce the outcome of the trial. We sentence Rosen Haworth to 50 years in prison.\u201dRosen burst out laughing. The courtroom was quiet. She didn\u2019t force herself to laugh to get attention. She genuinely found the situation really funny. She laughed like a witch in a fairytale until she ran out of breath.\u201cWitch!\u201d\u201cMurderer!\u201dRosen didn\u2019t cry.Because she knew they feared her smile the most.She was truly happy at that moment.As she was being dragged out, she screamed.\u201cI am Rosen Walker! I\u2019m innocent! And this is not the end! I will definitely stand in this court again!\u201dRather than remain as Hindley Haworth\u2019s wife and quietly spend 50 years reflecting on her sins\u2026 Rosen Walker would be an escaped prisoner.\u2018I would rather be shot dead standing still and stiff than bend my head and survive.\u2019\u2018Emily, I promised you I would never die. I also promised to see you again. Sorry. I\u2019m really sorry, but I don\u2019t think I can.\u2019\u2018Bow down to them? I won\u2019t survive the way I want.\u2019Then what should she do?What would become of those years they spent together?If she accepted it as it was, adapted to it, and reflected on it\u2026 If she was lucky, she might be able to safely reunite with Emily after becoming an old grandma.But Rosen didn\u2019t want to.She was not guilty. It was like that from the beginning. Hindley Haworth really deserved to die.\u2018If I do that, we\u2019ll just be idiots. I won\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019ll never make Emily and me like that.\u2019\u201cMurderer!\u201d\u2018People are right. I\u2019m a killer. The witch of Al Capez, who stabbed Hindley 36 times with a knife and succeeded in escaping two times by repeatedly lying and shamelessly deceiving the Empire.\u2019\u2018If that\u2019s the truth, as the world says\u2026\u2019\u2018Then I will be a liar to the end. After all, to them, all women are witches, and all witches are liars.\u2019\u201cI am innocent!\u201d\u2018If nothing changes no matter what I say, then I should only say what I want to say.\u2019\u2018Even if it\u2019s a lie.\u2019\u2018Even if it\u2019s the truth that the world doesn\u2019t want to hear.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She prayed that this would sound true to him. That she lied to him.And it was just her greed, but she wanted him to know that she didn\u2019t lie until the end.What was he thinking?\u201cHow do you feel about being tricked?

She didn\u2019t want to fool him. All she wanted was to run away. Ian Kerner belatedly noticed her prison break plans and prevented them, but she soon forgot about her plan and wanted a nice ending.Rosen thought he would be mad this time.Nevertheless, the reason she told him the truth was that he put a loaded gun in her hand without hesitation\u2026And because she loved him.It\u2019s love that keeps you looking back even though you know you shouldn\u2019t. Even though she knew that it wouldn\u2019t happen, every time the sirens blared in Leoarton, she worried that the man living in the sky would fall\u2026\u2018If he can forgive me I\u2019ll dare to give that feeling the name of love. I\u2019ll never be able to say it openly.\u2019\u201cI do not care.\u201dA voice returned, drowning and sinking, like scratching at the bottom of the sea.It was then that she realized something was wrong. Ian tilted his head and kissed Rosen.In an instant, her mind turned white. This wasn\u2019t it. He should be angry now.In this way\u2026 she couldn\u2019t.But he kept saying the same thing regardless of her confused expression.\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter from the beginning. I told you.\u201d\u201cAre you stupid? Do you not understand? I killed him! All the evidence points to me. You know that. You\u2019re ignoring it now. Did you know from the start? Why are you fooled by a lie that doesn\u2019t make sense?!\u201dHe just stared at her silently. Then he pointed to the beast that was clinging to her and glaring at him.\u201cIt\u2019s good that this is on your side. It eases my worries. Now the things in the sea will be on your side.\u201dHe moved ahead of her and started busily doing something. As he turned levers, and pushed buttons, the lifeboat began to move.\u201cDon\u2019t you believe that I killed him? How do I prove it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNot to me, not to anyone\u2026 don\u2019t prove anything. You don\u2019t have to.\u201dRosen ended up dropping the handgun he handed her to the floor.\u201cYou did well. You came all the way here alone\u2026 That\u2019s a lot of trouble. And I\u2019m sorry. That is all I can say.\u201dIan Kerner was crying.He was crying in front of her.He must have never cried in front of anyone since he was weaned. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be making sounds like that, and there was no way he could endlessly shed tears that he couldn\u2019t bear to hide without a single whimper. Like he had forgotten how to cry.\u201c8 to 50 years for murder under Imperial law.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSeventeen to twenty-five. Eight years,\u201dHe whispered, hugging her. His calloused hands brushed the nape of her neck.Eight years.Come to think of it, it had been 8 years. That much time had passed since killing Hindley Haworth.Buried in his arms, Rosen remembered the past eight years.What she told him was only a very small part of her life. And yet, the moment Ian hugged her, she felt like he knew everything about her.When she couldn\u2019t say anything, he firmly placed the gun in her hand that had fallen to the floor.\u201cYou are not guilty. And your sentence is already over, Rosen. You have no reason to be punished more than that\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo please be free.\u201dThe mechanism moved, and the lifeboat slowly moved up onto the deck. The beast clung to her back. Ian took her hand and started climbing the stairs. The entrance to the deck was narrow, and when she looked up, all she could see was the night sky.Rosen came out on the deck feeling dazed, as if in a dream.He moved quicker than her.Rosen watched him load water, food, and maps into the lifeboat.No matter how she looked at it, it seemed to be all prepared in advance.Otherwise, there would be no way he could load everything so quickly.\u2018So to free me, he\u2026\u2019From his belt came the keys Rosen so desperately wanted. Only then did she come to her senses and hurriedly push him away. He was acting crazy. Perhaps committing the most reckless, immoral, and irrational thing of his life.\u201cYou are a soldier. You\u2019re a prison guard\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cA war hero.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know what will happen if you release me? Is this the honor you gave your life for!? Is it worth it? You\u2019re going to throw it away like this in an instant?\u201dRosen was thinking of betraying Ian Kerner. Apart from liking him, she wanted to escape. So, no matter how she planned to betray him, it wasn\u2019t like this. This wasn\u2019t her plan.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cDo you know?\u201dIt was clear he was insane.Would he come to his senses if she slapped his cheek?Then, like someone waking up from a dream, would he shudder and withdraw from her?Would he stop doing all this crazy sh!t and go back to being the rational person he was when he first met her?Rosen had never thought for a moment that he would move according to her will. Instead, he was acting more like an idiot than ever. This was definitely something to be excited about\u2026Rosen wanted to shout.\u2018Why are you like this? Believing me even knowing that everything I said was a lie.\u2019He stared at her quietly. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t crying anymore. It was truly fortunate. If she had kept watching Ian cry, she would have started crying too. At this point where she needed to be calm more than anything, she couldn\u2019t be like that\u2026\u201cWhy do you think I unchained you in the first place?\u201d\u201cYou are\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201dInstead of an obvious answer, a question came back. He hugged her again and kissed the nape of her neck. The moment his lips, chapped from jumping into the sea to rescue her, touched her skin, Rosen had no choice but to admit it.That she already knew the answer.His dreamy voice rang in her ears.\u201cI just wanted to meet you.\u201dHe shoved her into the lifeboat and put his hand on the lever. The rusty chains for lowering the lifeboats hung over the deck. Rosen couldn\u2019t bear to look at him any longer and tried to look away.What he was trying to give her was too much.At that moment, Ian grabbed her face so she couldn\u2019t turn her head. She was forced to meet his gray eyes. When she first met him, she thought that color with unknown temperature was unpleasant.\u201cDo not worry. I\u2019ve been crazy for a lot longer than you think. Now that I\u2019ve heard your full story, I\u2019ll be able to stay sane.\u201d\u201cI-\u201c\u201cYou asked how it felt to be lied to by you. I think you wouldn\u2019t believe me if I said it felt good\u2026 I just said it didn\u2019t matter.\u201dBut now she felt that his gray eyes were a very warm color. Like ashes that were still burning.He put her hand on the lifeboat\u2019s engine. At that moment, a blue light radiated from her fingertips. The engine vibrated. She was amazed at its strength, but Ian only raised the corner of his mouth, not at all surprised.Strange words were whispered in her ear.\u201cMay your lies last forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope you can fool everyone, not just me. I hope it will eventually become the truth, I hope you will always be okay.\u201dRosen tried to say something, but nothing came to mind. He looked at her with eyes that seemed to be missing something, then quickly untied the red muffler from his neck.A symbol of victory flying in the sky throughout the long war.\u201cYou won. You had to win from the start.\u201dHe wrapped his muffler around her neck. It was a gesture that seemed to protect them both from the cold wind. He hugged her one last time and grabbed the lifeboat lever.The lifeboat was slowly lowered to the surface.He spoke loudly, shouting over the whir and clank of the chains.\u201cI love you, Rosen Walker.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhether you believe it or not\u2026 It is not a lie.\u201dThe corners of Ian\u2019s mouth went up. The gloom that always hung over his face was blown away by the wind. He looked relieved.Then he smiled brightly.Unlike the propaganda material that contained him frozen in time, he, who was looking down at her, came to life in front of her eyes. And she could hear his laugh.She could tell it was his real laugh. It was less solemn than everyone knew and slightly more mischievous, with a boyish smile. A smile resembling the blue sky.And she watched his smile, as if bewitched.\u2018In my younger days, what did I think when I saw a plane flying in the sky?\u2019\u2018There were days when shells rained down and the lights in the village went out. Inside and outside the prison\u2026 I always crouched down and stared at the sky. Fear swallowed us whole, and despair covered the world. The abyss-like scenery made even me, who was always imprisoned with or without bars, depressed.\u2019\u2018Just then, I raised my head and looked at him as I am now. As the planes flew through the sky, he fell from the sky with a confident smile. Oddly enough, seeing that smile made me feel like everything would be fine.\u2019\u2018What makes life go on is, after all, someone\u2019s lies. Because it is not always the cruel reality that lifts a person stuck in the mud but a beautiful lie as distant as a rainbow. When taking pictures for propaganda, he must have known that. That\u2019s why he got on his plane with the corners of his mouth raised, his eyes curled, with an uncharacteristically bright smile.\u2019\u2018But it wasn\u2019t always a sincere smile.\u2019\u2018\u2026I like the fact that he finally laughed for real.\u2019\u2018Looking at me, because of me.\u2019Rosen shouted aimlessly, not knowing whether he could hear her or not.\u201cIf we meet again\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t lie. Then I\u2019ll really have something to say to you, Ian!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get caught this time.\u201dHis answer came right away.Rosen smiled.\u2018Oh, he must have heard it.\u201d\u201cWe will definitely meet again!\u201dThe lifeboat touched the surface. Dozens of monsters swarmed around her. They were stingrays. Each was emitting a blue color, like starlight. They jumped across the sea, as if flying, to light her path. The beast sitting on her shoulder also jumped into the water.There were no stars in the dark, overcast night sky. However, the expanse of the sea in front of them was no longer black.The fog that floated over the sea cleared, and a group of lights formed a path. She could tell right away which way it was going.Walpurgis Island.Rosen was about to put her hand on the engine again to speed things up, but then she stopped and looked back. Maria told her never to look back, but she really couldn\u2019t help it. She had always been one who stepped out to watch a rainbow.Ian Kerner stood on the deck of the steamboat that floated silent like a ghost ship.It was far enough away that she could no longer hear him, but she was sure he was still smiling.From a distance, his red muffler that she was wearing would blow in the wind, making it look like a red flag symbolizing victory.She hoped she could be a victory for him at this moment. Just like he did for her throughout the long war.-May your lies last forever.If a lie is forever, it can become the truth.If you hold on, will you finally meet the truth at the end?-I hope you can fool everyone, not just me. I hope it will eventually become the truth, I hope you are always okay.Rosen puffed out her chest and turned towards the black waves.\u201cOne man\u2019s blood, one wish, some magic.\u201d\u2018Walburg, give me strength. The power I always had but was always taken away. The very power that has been dormant within me.\u2019Blue heat whirled in her hands.Light poured from her cold hands. The dazzling blue light looked like fireworks and starlight in the night sky. The vortex she created was sucked into the empty engine. Against the wind, the boat began to move vigorously.Her eyes burned hot. Water droplets ran down her cheeks.\u2018Is this sadness?\u2019\u2018No, my heart is beating too fast. So, this is not sadness, but liberation.\u2019\u2018As always, I am moving forward.\u2019\u2018Once again, I will overcome everything that tries to defeat me and disappear beyond the horizon to survive.\u2019\u2018Hold on until my lies finally become the truth.\u2019Rosen cast a blue light into the gray air in the face of the blowing wind.And laughed.\u2018For my lies that will continue into the future.\u2019\u2018For my eternal victory.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only for show, but the Emperor always attended military academy ceremonies. It had been a long tradition in the Empire for the heir to the throne to become a knight. The same duty was imposed on the Princess, the last direct lineage of the almost extinct Imperial family.They weren\u2019t very close, but they weren\u2019t too distant to be awkward either. The Emperor was proud of him, treating him like a competent subject. There were times when he felt a strange pity for the Emperor, a lonely trace of a dying era.It was all in the past now.\u201cTake everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease take my title first. It is not good for me to continue to have it in this situation.\u201dIt was a world without knights, but the Empire still enshrined those who acted valiantly in the new world. Because there were people who wanted the old-fashioned, bare-shelled honor. Ian Kerner became \u2018Sir Kerner\u2019 after the war. But now he had to go back to just Ian.***It was the first time he had failed a mission. Generals took turns summoning him. He was tossed about as he was told. Some expressed disapproval, some were angry, and some pressed him on what happened.\u201cDo you know what kind of situation you are in right now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes? Is that all you have to say!? Is that all? Huh? If I were your immediate superior, I would have shot you! Look at what the media is talking about right now!\u201dEvery time he gave a dog-like answer like a loyal military officer, several generals shook their heads.\u201cIt was due to my negligence. I overlooked the prisoner due to my lack of ability. I\u2019ll take any punishment.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s how I feel! I\u2019ll shoot the war hero you\u2019ve been pretending to be! That makes sense! We don\u2019t have much face*!\u201d[E/N: \u2018losing face\u2019 means to lose reputation. This general is saying they don\u2019t have a good reputation in the first place, and this incident will only make public opinion worse.]\u201cYou can do that if you need to.\u201d\u201cAre you being sarcastic now?\u201d\u201cNot at all. I am sincere.\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan on shooting me in the near future, I\u2019m going to discuss a treatment plan with my doctor.\u201dThe Army general laughed at his answer, stared at the Air Force general sitting next to him, and shouted.\u201cYou airmen are crazy.\u201dIn response, the Air Force general overturned his desk.\u201cWe\u2019ve used our ace as much as we could, and we\u2019ve only failed one mission.\u201dA Naval general threw an ashtray at the two who were grabbing each other by the collar.Ian Kerner stood there like a stone statue, waiting for the shouting to stop.Waiting patiently was one of the things he was good at.***His military trial was being delayed day by day. The court-martial was at a loss as to what to punish him with. The military wanted to deal with him quietly from within due to his negligence during the mission, but they failed to subdue the press. Rumors had already swept across the Empire.\u201cIan Kerner is possessed by a witch. Ian Kerner loves the witch. Ian Kerner went mad fighting the war. He\u2019s broken\u2026 \u201dThe Emperor stood in front of him and read the Imperial newspaper in her hand clearly. The front page was decorated with his and Rosen Walker\u2019s names side by side. Since there were so many decent newspapers, it was hard not to peek at what would be written in the low-level papers.\u201cWhat do you think of these?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think much.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t say anything frustrating. I\u2019m asking if this is real.\u201dIan stared at the newspaper in the Emperor\u2019s hand. He still hadn\u2019t abandoned the habit of reading the newspaper. Because of the press that pursued him like prey, he had to confine himself to his mansion just as the war ended. All he could do was read the newspaper.He was used to being in the spotlight, but this was the first time he was receiving attention in the gossip column, and it was a very different feeling. He also found it interesting to see Rosen\u2019s name written next to his\u2026 He honestly found it satisfying at times.\u201cYou might as well tell me what happened. I don\u2019t have much power anyway. Besides, I\u2019m your friend\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the motive of the military academy?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, how would you know that a powerless Emperor might be of help to you? All I have left is a fa\u00e7ade, but sometimes a fa\u00e7ade is necessary.\u201d\u201c\u2026I have nothing to say. Rosen Walker managed to break out once again, and I mistakenly overlooked it.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cSurveillance was negligent. It is purely due to my negligence.\u201d\u201cThe newspapers say all sorts of things about you and the escaped prisoner. Look, they\u2019ve written almost a century of romance novels.\u201dThe Emperor displayed the gossip column as if showing off. Ian bowed his head in understanding. The Emperor stared at him, then rested her chin on her hand and muttered.\u201cMaybe you should go to the island. It\u2019s becoming a romance novel premise in that way.\u201d\u201cYou mean jail?\u201d\u201cSay something that makes sense. We\u2019ve got a reputation to maintain. How can we put you in a prison uniform? I will send you to a small island away from the mainland under the pretext that you have a slight health problem and need a vacation. It\u2019s not bad since you have been on the battlefield for ten years. For two or three years, resting in a place with good air\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t sugar coat it. It\u2019s actually an exile. I think it\u2019s too much. A great disgrace to a hero. Even if it\u2019s for a few years, you don\u2019t know how the political landscape will change in the meantime, so there\u2019s a high possibility that you\u2019ll be blocked from reentering the service.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cOld people seem to be worried, but I think differently. It\u2019s something that\u2019ll be forgotten. No one thinks that your contribution will be buried like this. It\u2019s going to be noisy for a while, but there\u2019s no need to quell this gossip. If something more interesting happens, people will forget\u2026\u201dThe Emperor trailed off, narrowing her eyes when she saw his expression.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cCan I be honest with you?\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI was thinking that two or three years is too short. Maybe ten years or so.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to quit. In a few years, as Your Majesty said, I will be forgotten. Around that time, I plan to apply for early retirement.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you thinking of not flying again?\u201dHe glanced at the model airplane on the Emperor\u2019s desk and answered.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of flying a small plane on the island.\u201d\u201cDo you know that you are talking like an old man who has lived his life? It\u2019s a waste of talent.\u201d\u201cEveryone has a different rate at which they burn the fuel they have\u2026 I used it up earlier than others. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cWhat? I thought you looked happier than you used to. Your expression has improved a lot.\u201dIan flinched. It was because that was not the first time he had heard it. Henry Reville, Alex Reville, Layla, and even Joshua Gregory, though sarcastically, had said the same.Seeing him harden, the Emperor laughed. She then retrieved Imperial Charts from a drawer and spread them on her desk.\u201cNow, as I said, even a fa\u00e7ade of an Emperor can help her old friend in small matters. Take a peek. Choose an island where you can enjoy your exiled life. I personally recommend Isante Island. It\u2019s southern, so it\u2019s warm even in winter, and the sea is pure blue. It\u2019s a total resort.\u201dIan Kerner let the names of the islands the Emperor listed in one ear and out the other. As soon as she finished speaking, he pointed to a corner of the map.\u201cYou act like you\u2019re thinking, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI like this area.\u201d\u201cPrimrose Island? It\u2019s inconvenient to live there. It\u2019s sparsely populated and so far from the mainland that transport comes only once a month. Unless you like torturing yourself with boredom\u2026 \u201d\u201c\u2026I like it there.\u201dEven the Emperor knew from experience that once he started, no one could stop him. Ian Kerner had always been a stalwart soldier, but in his personal affairs, there were times when he made choices that surprised those around him. The Emperor sighed deeply.\u201cYou want to leave a warm resort and go to an island in the middle of the black sea infested with marine beasts?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to go to an island in the sea where there is a rumor that Walpurgis Island is nearby\u2026 just because of your unique taste? Is that right?\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s eyes narrowed. Ian lowered his head again. The Emperor opened the Imperial Newspaper and gestured for him to leave.\u201cOkay, don\u2019t fly over the sea on a small plane and defect to Talas. Then it\u2019ll be really troublesome.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dIan saluted. But he had to stop before exiting the office because the Emperor asked a sensitive question.\u201cDid anything happen with her?\u201dIan replied calmly.\u201cNothing happened.\u201dThe Emperor smiled again and read the front-page headline of the Imperial newspaper.[The Fall Of A Hero.]\u201cFall\u2026 this isn\u2019t a very good headline. I\u2019m looking at your expression right now. Their choice of words is poor.\u201dIan didn\u2019t understand the Emperor\u2019s intentions, so he just listened quietly.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crash. It\u2019s more of a landing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, and one more thing. I\u2019ve always thought you really can\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cJust be aware.\u201dThe Emperor let him go without asking any further questions.\u201cGo ahead, Ian Kerner.\u201dHe left the office and walked down the hall, coming upon a fountain. Compared to the old days, when the walls were made of gold and each chandelier was embedded with rubies and emeralds, the palace was still splendid.It was once a place where the Emperor personally met the people of the Empire and granted their requests.There was a legend that if you threw a coin into the fountain in this hall, your wish would come true.In the water, as if showing the passing of time, the currency of various eras and countries could be identified.Ian Kerner stared out the window at the blue sky, then took a gold coin from his chest pocket and threw it into the fountain.He had only one wish now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most of the residents farmed and generally did not have much interest in the affairs of the world. It was a place that gave the feeling of regression regardless of the flow of time. It was such a remote place that until fighter jets were invented and the sky became a battlefield, people here said they lived without knowing what war was.War was also avoided as much as possible on the island. To them, the war was just exciting news that was heard through gossip from the mainlanders. In fact, the islanders didn\u2019t even seem to think of themselves as the people of the Empire. They just called themselves \u2018Primrose people\u2019.Few households had radios, and the broadcasts from the mainland did not reach them. Ships loaded with supplies and men arrived once a month. That meant it took at least two months to make proper contact with the outside world.Retired officers often bought villas to stay in, so the residents were not surprised by the sudden appearance of a young officer.Still, a few people who recognized the name \u2018Ian Kerner\u2019 came to see him in the first few days. However, interest subsided within a few days. It was a reaction not much different from seeing an exotic animal.Ian liked the silence, peace, and indifference to strangers that surrounded the entire island. He rented a house. There was only one condition; it should have a good view of the sea. The landlord, an old lady, was pleased, but admitted that she did not understand his choice.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too shabby for an officer to live in?\u201d\u201cA soldier doesn\u2019t need a big mansion.\u201d\u201cThere must be a lot of repairs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I know how to fix things myself.\u201dImperial pilots, who were always suffering from budget cuts and cheap airframes had no choice but to become familiar with various tools even if they did not want to.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be bad to live alone. Not even with a wife and children\u2026 But are you really not married at all? Did you leave your wife on the mainland? What else could you have done with your handsome face?\u201d\u201c\u2026I have a lover.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t she come with you? The scenery here is beautiful all year round, so it is a good place for newlyweds to live. It\u2019s so remote that people don\u2019t know about it. It\u2019s a perfect island to get married and live on. Well, these days, young ladies prefer to live in a bustling city rather than a boring island like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like you broke up.\u201dThe old lady clicked her tongue and looked at him pitifully, perhaps thinking he had been dumped by a woman because he had been assigned to the island. Ian just smiled moderately. He was good at smiling. Originally, he didn\u2019t have much talent for that kind of thing, but he acquired it naturally by listening to the generals lecture him while filming propaganda materials.Henry visited him on the transport that came once a month. After three months of formal service in the Navy, he threw off his blue uniform, saying it was not in his temperament, and started rehabilitation training recommended by a doctor. He didn\u2019t want to go on a boat, regardless of whether he could get on a plane, for the rest of his life.He said that Alex Reville would tease him if he were doing nothing.The Reville family\u2019s doctor sent him regular reports.[The young master is much better. He looks great, too. His love for airplanes seems to still remain.Of course, it\u2019s impossible to be put on active duty, but I think he can serve as a flight instructor. Yesterday, he nagged a junior pilot and walked around the training course. As a doctor, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable.]Henry nagged Ian every time he came. Their dynamic had not changed much, except for nagging about how long he would be stuck on an island like this.\u201cDon\u2019t you miss planes?\u201d\u201cDoes the thing in the garden look like something other than an airplane to you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a light aircraft! Can that be considered an airplane?\u201d\u201cEverything that flies is an airplane. Are only fighter planes airplanes?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a paper airplane then? Have you tried that light plane?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201c\u2026Someone said they arranged a ride?Henry looked at him with a meaningful smile. Ian didn\u2019t feel the need to respond, so he ignored it. But it was a question he came to often. He didn\u2019t know when he would fly again, but he had someone he wanted to give a ride to.And Henry knew exactly who it was.\u201cThis is a picture of Layla.\u201dLayla was admitted to a junior military academy. It was unfamiliar to see her saluting in a small uniform. He thought she had grown up a lot in a short time.\u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell she looks like.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know who she looks like.\u201dHe replied, staring at Henry.Where would the bloodline of the Reville family go?In fact, Layla had sent him a letter asking for his opinion. Ian, of course, wrote a reply telling her to consider it carefully, but he never expected Layla to listen to him.\u201cAnyway.\u201dHenry pouted and glared at him after discussing the recent situation. Ian noticed something suspicious and urged Henry.\u201cIf you have something to say, say it.\u201d\u201cHey, Sir Kerner.\u201dAfter hesitating for a while, Henry took out a brown envelope from the bag he had been carrying and removed another photo from within.\u201cI thought a lot about whether I should give it to you or not\u2026\u201dIan frowned at his reluctant attitude and accepted the photo. As soon as he saw it, his heart sank. It was a picture of an island taken through the clouds. Instinctively he knew what the island was, shrouded in mist and blurry.\u201cDuring a test flight, a guy took the wrong course\u2026 He was lost for a while. This photo was taken by accident.\u201dIan glared at Henry again. He asked, taking the photo to the fireside.\u201cWho else knows?\u201d\u201cDo I look like an idiot? I secretly snatched it without telling anyone. The idiot flying a plane was in a state of panic, so he didn\u2019t even know I was holding a camera next to him.\u201d\u201cThe location of Walpurgis Island must not be discovered.\u201d\u201cAww, you\u2019re scared. If anyone knows the coordinates, I\u2019ll shoot them to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re not really going to do that, are you?\u201dWitches\u2019 refuge.The final paradise.No one knew where it was or what witches were doing there. All that was known for certain was that non-witches could not access it. Ian came to Primrose because he wanted to be as close as possible to the island, but he had no intention of trying to find its exact location.If it shouldn\u2019t be known to anyone, he shouldn\u2019t know either. Even if he had someone he wanted to see there.\u201cI don\u2019t know the coordinates either. It was scary there. As soon as I entered the area, my instrument panel acted strange. Witches are great.\u201d\u201cHow did you get out?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the gut feeling of a veteran pilot? With no commander, I am an ace now. Although I can\u2019t play an active role.\u201dHenry snatched the picture from his hand and grumbled. Ian stared blankly at the picture that slipped out of his hand in an instant.\u201cI knew this would happen. I didn\u2019t expect to hear thank you. What should I do? Should we really burn it like this? The original film was destroyed, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dHenry raised both hands with a tired expression, as if defeated, and approached the fireplace holding the photo. Ian quietly held out his hand. Henry laughed, and he handed him the picture.\u201cShe will live well, I believe. She\u2019s the best escaped prisoner in the Empire. Rosen Walker is by no means average.\u201d\u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing like pictures to soothe lovesickness, right?\u201dIan kicked a smirking Henry in the shin with a sly smile. Henry seemed to have amused himself by teasing him, and even when he was beaten, he had a retort every time.\u201c\u2026When you meet again, weep and cling to each other, telling each other not to go, and set up a honeymoon on this island. After all, people here are so behind the times that they don\u2019t think badly of witches.\u201dWas it because of its location, which was closer to Walpurgis Island than the mainland?Or was it because it was a remote place that deflected the flow of the times?The island still had a reverence for magic and witches. Ships sailing from Primrose always threw a coin into the sea before departing.The ritual was meant to protect them from the demons that infested the sea.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\u201cOh, did I say something wrong? How did she hide all this time? If Rosen Walker held a fan signing event to commemorate her escape from prison, you would be the first person in line.\u201d\u201cNoisy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun to watch because the person who didn\u2019t seem to be swayed by emotion is crazy about love.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll shut up, so don\u2019t take out your gun!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Your Eternal LiesCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay[T/N: This is the last chapter \u00a0If you don\u2019t like listening to music while reading, kindly skip this part. But those who like, please listen to \u2018Your Lie In April \u2013 Again\u2019 I felt like listening to this while translating this final chapter. Thanks for being here for so long, and huge thanks for the support you all have given!P.S. There are side stories after the Q&A.]***It was a moonlit winter night. As soon as he heard rustling in the grass, Ian got out of bed and opened the window. There was no creature more dangerous than a cat or chick on this small island, but he was easily awakened by the slightest sound.There was no one outside. Only a cold wind came pouring in. He thought about going outside to look around the garden, but then he decided he was overreacting and went back to bed.Still, once he awoke, he seldom went back to sleep until dawn. Regardless, he was much better than when he was in the Capital. The number of nightmares had decreased. He sometimes had good dreams. It was the kind of dream he didn\u2019t want to wake up from.The plot was the same every time. The moment he opened his eyes, wheat-colored hair tickled his face. He knew it was all a momentary illusion, but each time he reached out and hugged Rosen as she magically returned to his side.He had a lot to ask. Rosen, in his fantasy, just smiled and didn\u2019t speak. Even though he knew an answer would not come back, he asked questions after question, almost like an interrogation.\u2018Did you arrive safely on the island?\u2019\u2018Is it cold there?\u2019\u2018Are you living peacefully with Emily, whom you wanted to meet so much?\u2019\u2018Are you happy now\u2026?\u2019And with a childish mind, he asked a few selfish things.\u2018Did you forget me because you are happy?\u2019\u2018Do you want to see me, too?\u2019\u2018Do you think about me\u2026 sometimes?\u2019In fact, if it ended there, there wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. Because dreams were manifestations of unconsciousness, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak during his waking hours. The mind that contained it could not harm anyone.The problem was\u2026Knowing it was a dream, he became rather honest about his desire. He had no self-control.The moment Rosen Walker smiled at him as he bombarded her with questions, he hardened like an idiot. He hugged Rosen and lay down on the bed, feeling her body temperature, taking off their clothes and kissing Rosen\u2019s exposed skin. By the time his breath rose, and heat took hold of his body, he was invariably fully awake.And he fell into a sense of shame as if he had become an insane pervert. After the sense of shame subsided, bleak loneliness set in. Like being in a warm spring, then being thrown into an icy lake.***As the dreams that haunted him in a different way than nightmares repeated, he went to the only doctor on the island and asked for medicine.\u201cI need a sleeping herb prescription.\u201d\u201cOfficer, never again! Do not consume more than the amount of sleeping herb you are currently taking! I\u2019m really amazed that the officer hasn\u2019t become an addict. I don\u2019t know if you have great willpower or an overly strong body, but live your life thanking God. Are you crazy? How many years have you voluntarily used this poisonous powder without a doctor\u2019s prescription?\u201dThe doctor was adamant. Ian had always respected the opinions of experts in other fields, but he still had to give it another try.\u201cBecause it is necessary.\u201d\u201cHave your nightmares gotten worse?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not a bad dream\u2026 just a strange one.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s all right. What kind of dream is it?\u201dIan gave up seeking medical help. He would rather have his mouth sewn shut than tell the truth.\u201cIt is normal to have dreams, unless they are suffocating nightmares. All people are like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that proof that you\u2019re getting better?\u201d***There was another knock on the window. The sound woke him from his dirty thoughts. It became clear that the presence outside was not a cat.Before he went back to sleep, he grabbed his pistol from a drawer and went to the window. But when he opened the window, he hastily hid the pistol behind his back. A group of children carrying gas lamps, wrapped in mufflers, were staring at him.The people of Primrose had long since withdrawn their attention from him, but children were the exception. It wasn\u2019t exactly an interest in him, but an interest in the plane he had\u2026Ian frowned and scolded the children.\u201cWhy are you out at night? Go home quickly. Your parents are worried.\u201d\u201cWe are exploring the forest.\u201d\u201cDo it during the day.\u201d\u201cWhat fun is it doing it during the day?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing in front of my house?\u201dThe children clung to the window and hesitated. He made a scary face telling them to go home quickly, but the kids weren\u2019t even afraid of him in the first place. Ian soon realized the real purpose of the children gathering in front of his house.\u201cOfficer, can you give us a ride?\u201dIan sighed and tried to close the window, but the children showed no signs of backing down.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo way. Go back. There is no room for you.\u201d\u201cWe picked the order by drawing lots!\u201d\u201cI never said I would give you a ride.\u201dCries erupted, but Ian firmly shook his head. He knew how much the neighborhood kids would bother him the moment he gave the group a lift. He thought about it, but there should be no exceptions. He knew from experience how quickly principles lost their force the moment an exception was made.Then a sharp voice broke out from among the crowd of children.\u201cIf you don\u2019t give us a ride, we won\u2019t run your errands.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember asking you guys to run errands.\u201d\u201cSomeone other than the officer ordered it.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cThere.\u201dA girl pointed to the entrance to the garden along the gas-lit path.\u201cWho is it in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t tell you if you don\u2019t give us a ride.\u201d\u201cWhat is the order?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t take us on the plane, we won\u2019t say.\u201dNo one ever came to visit him in the middle of the night. Henry had just left on a boat to the mainland. No outsiders came unless it was on the monthly cargo ship or a noisy plane.\u201cIf you lie, I won\u2019t take you on the plane.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying! Two women are really looking for the officer!\u201dThe girl shouted in a fit of anger. Soon, other testimonies poured out here and there as if it was unfair to be falsely accused of lying.\u201cThey are both girls! They asked us where the officer\u2019s house was!\u201d\u201cHow did they look?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t remember very well! I think one was blonde\u2026 \u201d\u201cHey, you can\u2019t tell him everything!\u201dIan got up from his seat. Before he could even think, his body moved. He spilt the glass of water on his desk, but left it and hurriedly put on a coat. The children stopped him with a look of bewilderment at his violent reaction.\u201cI think they are a bit strange. She said she came to tell an eternal lie to the officer.\u201dIan opened the front door.He started running.\u201cAnyway, since we ran your errands, are you giving us a ride?\u201dThe children shouted loudly. Ian nodded roughly and ran into the moonlit garden. Leaves crunched under his feet, and bugs chirped in the grass. However, despite the children\u2019s words, the garden was quiet. Desperately, he searched the garden\u2019s shady nooks and crannies, but found no one.He had to return home after a few hours with a broken heart. The children that had gathered outside the window had already gone home.He hung up his coat, gazed out the window at the sea, and sat down at the desk. There was still plenty of time before dawn. In the end, he had to spend the night with an awake mind. He sighed and closed the curtains to avoid seeing the sea.A house overlooking the sea.On a clear day, you could see far beyond the horizon, and he imagined an island somewhere beyond that.\u2018Ah, I guess it was just the children\u2019s misunderstanding.\u2019\u2018Or is this moment also a dream?\u2019If it was a dream, it was worse than a nightmare.He was overly joyful, overly hopeful.He didn\u2019t think there had been many days when he desperately needed sleep as much as today. He sat on the bed and laid himself down to force himself into a sleep that would probably never come. He wanted to sleep peacefully, but today didn\u2019t seem to be the day.\u201cHi, Ian.\u201dThen someone jumped out of the blanket and hugged him tightly. He shuddered and withdrew, but the hand that gripped his waist wouldn\u2019t let go. Wheat-colored hair fell in front of his eyes. Soon, her hand hugged the nape of his neck, and warm lips touched his.It was Rosen Walker.\u201cLong time no see. How have you been?\u201dIan blinked, unable to believe the scenery in front of him, and slowly pushed Rosen away. He had many strange dreams. So he knew that the bigger the gap between fantasy and reality, the more painful it would be when he woke up again.Rosen was talking. This vision was even asking a question first. Many of the questions he wanted to ask were forgotten when the opportunity presented itself.This wasn\u2019t right.It was so vivid.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your expression? You didn\u2019t want to see me? I thought you would like it very much\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a dream, I\u2019d rather wake up now.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d\u201cI would feel so empty when I wake up. If it\u2019s a dream, please go.\u201dBut Rosen did not disappear. Rather, she stared at him with an expression that did not know how to handle this situation.\u201cWow, that\u2019s ridiculous. Do you know how much I struggled to qualify to leave Walpurgis Island? But what do you say as soon as you see me? Please go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow on earth can I prove that I am real? If I knew this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have come in through the window, but through the door normally. And knocked.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cShall I try again? Will you believe me then?\u201dRosen made a tearful face and showed off the muffler wrapped around her neck. It was the red muffler he had wrapped around her when they parted. As the feel of the wool touched his face, his sense of reality returned. It was then that Ian Kerner realized that he had been acting like an idiot.This wasn\u2019t a dream, the real Rosen Walker was in front of him.Rosen, whose blood circulated, breathed, and moved.His prisoner, the Empire\u2019s greatest liar and the escaped prisoner no one would ever catch.\u201cI love you. I can say it with confidence now. I\u2019m back to say that. We promised to meet again.\u201dIan didn\u2019t hesitate this time and hugged Rosen tightly. The window blew in cold air, but the house was warmer than ever. They hugged each other for a very long time.\u201cEmily is outside. Can I ask her to come in?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPour us a cup of tea, too. It was cold on our way here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes! Is there anything else you can say?\u201d\u201cI missed you. Thank you for coming back.\u201dIan Kerner laughed. Suddenly, the Emperor\u2019s words passed through his head.-\u2018The fall of a hero.\u2019 A fall\u2026 This doesn\u2019t sound like a very good headline. Because I\u2019m looking at your expression right now. Their choice of words is poor.To be honest, Ian didn\u2019t quite understand what that meant at the time. But now he knew.He remembered the moment when he was gliding slowly down a long sandy beach in a plane that had run out of fuel. It was the most thrilling moment on a plane. It was different from a fall. Because he knew that a safe landing was waiting for him at the end of the long runway.In fact, the most pleasant moment for a pilot was not the flight itself, but when he finally returned to Earth.To the land he loved and wanted to protect.This was definitely a landing, not a crash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In my imagination, Imperial planes have the appearance of the British military plane \u2018Spitfire\u2019 from the movie Dunkirk. I was surprised to find someone who correctly guessed it was used as inspiration here.2) Les Mis\u00e9rablesRosen\u2019s prisoner number is 24601. A habitual escapee. A prisoner who received a severe punishment compared to her crime. A jailer who understands the prisoner? I got a lot of inspiration from the relationship between Jean Valjean and Javert.3) Chicago (Musical, Movie)No explanation needed. He had it coming!4) Wicked (Musical)Defying gravity is Emily and Rosen\u2019s theme song, in my opinion.5) A Thousand Brilliant Suns/ Thelma and Louise/ Naomi and Gaoko etc\u2026I used motifs such as the solidarity between two women and the murder of a husband. A Thousand Brilliant Suns, in particular, is my favorite.\u3009 If you don\u2019t like tmi, please skip!!(T/N: tmi \u2013 too much information)Hello, this is the end of \u2018Your Eternal Lies\u2019. I never thought I would be able to complete this in 5 months. Thanks to all of you who supported us in the comments. If I had written it alone, I would never have finished it.PlanningIt was November 2018 when I finished my previous work, \u201cWe Call Peter Pan,\u201d and I was grinding my teeth to find material. A writer is basically an attention seeker\u2026 So I wanted more people to see my posts\u2026 So I created Princess X, who was sentenced to a deadline in \u201cLimited Time,\u201d and tried to write a romance with an escort, but gave up because I thought it would be too epic to handle. Before writing that, I wanted to write a shorter mid-length story, and among my notebooks filled with scenarios, I chose \u300aYour Eternal Lies\u300b.\u2018Judge, this is unfair!\u2019It was a story that started with a joke from a friend, but it became darker and more serious than I originally thought. I didn\u2019t want to do this\u2026To be honest, I was very surprised because I didn\u2019t know that you would love it this much because it\u2019s a short story. Even my friend, whom I am thankful for, who always reviews my writing first, said to me, \u201cAre you writing a short story again?\u201dI think it\u2019s thanks to many people sympathizing with Rosen Walker\u2019s story. I didn\u2019t write it with any enlightening or instructive intention\u2026 (Because I\u2019m not that smart) I just thought that everyone would have experienced being upset while watching the news, so I wrote this novel to feel sorry for and be comforted together.Questions about the workCan only women use magic in this world?Yes. There are only witches.Did Ian\u2019s unknown wish turn Rosen into a witch?No, as it says in the book, the great witch Walpurg never listens to a man\u2019s wish. Rosen\u2019s wish came true.What did Ian shout when Rosen fell from the boat?Leave it to your imagination!Happy Q&A time!!And thank you so much for reading all this time.Q&A* I may not answer questions about the part that I did not specifically set, or that I want to leave to the readers\u2019 imagination. Please forgive me!! I read every single comment. *\u3008Questions about publication/next work, etc.\u3009Q Are the same anecdotes included in the published e-book/paper book?Yeah! The same unpublished anecdotes are included in both the e-book and the paper book. The specific content and length has not been decided yet, but since there were many opinions that romance was lacking in the main story, I plan to focus more on romance. The main story is too heavy, so I will focus on happy side stories. Like the meeting between Ian, Emily, and Rosen\u2026Please post a notice on Joara when a paper book/e-book is published.We will notify you of all of Joara\u2019s work on my personal Twitter account (@jeonhoochi)!Do you continue to work under the pen name Jeo-chi?Yes, this is my real pen name and I plan to publish most of my works under the pen name Jeo-Chi. Of course, if I write a work with a distinctly different color (e.g. Hard 19 Gold, Moralis Blood, etc.), I won\u2019t use a different pen name to avoid shocking you.Will you continue to write?Writing is what I will do for the rest of my life. I really love writing novels. It\u2019s painful, but the sense of accomplishment is greater than that\u2026 I won\u2019t sign a contract with a specific publisher and write exclusively.I wonder if it is published in the same month on multiple platforms or selected on a specific platform.I am still not very familiar with it. It seems that specific schedules and plans will come out only after proofreading!If you are not active with Joara in the future, please let us know where you plan to be active.The platform Joara will continue to be used! There are actually no places with as many readers as there\u2026 However, no matter what work I write, I don\u2019t think I will finish it here in the future.Is there any possibility of publishing a paper book of your previous work, We Call Peter Pan?There is nothing planned at all. It will be published as an e-book when the exclusive period is over.Can I tag you with fan art on Twitter?It\u2019s always an honor. Thank you very much.\u3008Question about the content of the work\u3009Do you have any thoughts on Twitter from time to time?I\u2019m not sure yet. After finishing a piece, I\u2019m too tired to look at it again for a while\u2026 Maybe after some time?Is the Emperor who briefly appeared female?Yes! She is the last direct descendant of the Imperial family.How did Layla enter the military academy?She\u2019s young, so she\u2019s not a full cadet. She is a student in the officer\u2019s academy. There is also the fact that the Reville family bloodline funded the military academy. The main reason is that her puberty came early and made her want to rebel against her uncle and grandfather.Will Rosen and Ian live together?Rosen will travel between Walpurgis Island and Primrose. They don\u2019t live together completely, but it\u2019s pretty much the same!As for Rosen, will she live as she goes back and forth between Walpurgis Island and Primrose in the future? Ian won\u2019t be able to enter Walpurgis Island, right?Yes. Currently, Rosen is still learning from the witches, so she can only go out occasionally as if she were on vacation. This new witch is busy because all her seniors are mischievous. Ian will be upset for a while, but with a little more time, Rosen will be able to go out longer and more freely.And Ian will never be allowed into Walpurgis Island. Unless he dies and reincarnates as a woman in his next life\u2026One of the things Ian Kerner does best is to wait patiently, so don\u2019t worry too much. The two will get along well in the future.Regarding the Rosen that Ian dreamed of, was that really Rosen?Yes, lol. This will be solved further in a side story.Emily was portrayed as loving Hindley more than Rosen. How did Emily change after Hindley died?That may be how Rosen feels, but in fact, Emily has always loved Rosen more than Hindley. Even when Hindley died, she was worried about Rosen first. She wasn\u2019t too sad. It\u2019s just that Hindley gaslit her for so long that she didn\u2019t have the strength to escape from him.Whose blood did Emily use to become a witch at the age of 6? Did Emily kill someone too?We haven\u2019t talked about it in this story. It\u2019s not that you missed it. No one necessarily has to be killed to establish the condition of blood\u2026 It\u2019s established in a variety of ways. For your information, Emily\u2019s \u201cone man\u2019s blood\u201d is the blood of her biological father. I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination!How did Emily get the restraints off her neck?Emily\u2019s necklace was released after she reached Walpurgis Island with the help of the other witches.Is there any background to the lives of the witches living on Walpurgis Island? Are Emily and Rosen happy in there?The closer you get to the island, the greater the magical influence.For your information, the people of Primrose are in favor of witches because the area around Walpurgis is home to witches, the area with the strongest magical influence in the Empire.What\u2019s certain is that Emily and Rosen are happily doing well in there!What the hell is going on on Monte Island?It\u2019s the worst prison imaginable (like a prison camp) and an island of chaos and destruction where prisoners fight for their survival. But Maria is a far greater prisoner than she\u2019s shown in the story, so she\u2019ll probably rule the island in a few years.<Other>A list of songs I listened to while writingI listen to songs with lyrics or Korean songs while writing novels, so I\u2019m not sure if I can recommend them. I don\u2019t know much about pop songs. There are a lot of opinions that songs with lyrics or Korean songs don\u2019t go well with Western-style songs\u2026 However, I will try to list the ones I enjoy.Titanic OST \u2013 My Heart Will Go OnMandy Moore \u2013 Only HopeNaomi Scott \u2013 SpeechlessBillie Eilish \u2013 LovelyMate \u2013 Fly In The Sky(T/N: Not sure if this is translated right.
