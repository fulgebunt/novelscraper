    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: PrologueI used to think that I was a genius, but when I look back at it now, it\u2019s so embarrassing that I might just go crazy.\u00a0However, the fact remains, I truly believed that I was a genius.At the start, I did have enough talent to allow for such a misguided belief. During my childhood, I had no trouble when it came to learning new things, and I was able to improve my skills at a faster rate than others.However, things were only easy at the beginning. Although I improved faster than everyone else at first, when things really got going, I slowed down to match the others\u2019 pace.I didn\u2019t think much of it at first since I thought that these things could happen. After all, wasn\u2019t I still improving little by\u00a0little? I can still do it. Why? Because I\u2019m a genius.In the end, I was forced to accept the reality that I had tried so hard to reject.I wasn\u2019t a genius.It was all thanks to meeting a \u2018real\u2019 genius, one who I couldn\u2019t even compare to, that I was finally forced out of this ridiculous and childish delusion.The me who thought I was a genius was but a frog in a well. Inside the comfort of my little well, I had gotten drunk on a false sense of superiority. Meanwhile, the real geniuses were already flying through the wide-open sky.I hated that genius.I felt my killing intent rising whenever I heard him spout nonsense about how anyone could possibly be able to do what he had done if they really tried. Whether or not he really believed what he said, or he was just looking down on the efforts of someone less talented than himself, it still made me feel like shit.\u2018Are you jealous?\u2019Fuck jealousy. You're the one who started talking shit first. I just returned the favor, so how the fuck am I being jealous?\u2018I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d take it like that. I was just\u2026 feeling sorry for you.\u2019Feeling sorry? What?\u2018If you just tried a little harder\u2026.\u2019Just what do you know that makes you think you\u2019re qualified to preach about hard work?\u2018You could be a lot better than you are now.\u2019Hey, I\u2019m doing perfectly fine, thanks. Your standards are just too damn high. Do you really think that everyone can be like you? Since you\u2019re a genius, don\u2019t assume that everyone else is capable of doing what you do.Got that?I can\u2019t be as great as you.* * *\u201cFuck off.\u201dI could barely squeeze out these words. A gaping hole was running through my chest. To try and treat my wound, they were desperately casting magic and pouring out drops of the precious elixir, but it was pointless.\u201cNo, please no.\u201dShe\u2019s crying? I never expected a girl like her to make that sort of expression for me. Even though we argued about everything, and she always had a nasty look on her face whenever she talked to me, I guess she still got a little attached to our quarrels.\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 that\u2019s why I told you. Just go back. Why did you have to be so stubborn and keep following us\u2026?\u201d\u201cSienna. For now, just put that away.\u201dMy voice wasn\u2019t coming out the way I wanted it to. It was probably because of all the blood rising up my throat.\u201cI don\u2019t need the elixir. You don\u2019t have enough of them to be wasting one here. Don\u2019t be foolish.\u201d\u201cBut-!\u201d\u201cEnough. I\u2019m the one who knows my own body best. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll survive. I\u2019ll be dead soon.\u201dI was dying.I had resigned myself to this fact even before my chest had been pierced. In the first place, my body was so broken that it must have looked like I was embarking on a fool\u2019s errand. They\u2019d told me to turn back and wait for them, but I had ignored all their worries and their lectures to follow them up to this point.\u201c...I could have avoided it.\u201dHis voice was as cold as ever. This son of a bitch. It looks like he\u2019ll be a pain to deal with until the very end.\u201cSo there was no need for you to do this.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to fuck off already?\u201dEven though it\u2019s so hard to talk right now, why does he keep yapping at me like this?\u201cYou should have known that as well.\u201dHis expression showed that he just couldn\u2019t understand. There was a chance that he was correct. Even though it might have looked like a desperate crisis to the others, it probably hadn\u2019t seemed all that dangerous to him.Didn\u2019t I know that? Of course, I did. After all, we\u2019ve been traveling together for so long. So I knew just what kind of an unspeakable monster he was. And even among all those who called him a monster, I was especially familiar with his abilities.\u201c...There was no need for you to die like this.\u201dThen how else was I supposed to die?\u00a0He\u00a0should know it as well. How much of a miracle it was for me to have come this far. Without him, I would never have made it here.\u201c...At least like this, it\u2019s an honorable death.\u201d It was so hard to get my voice out, but I had to say this, \u201cI would become nothing but a burden if I went on with you, but I didn\u2019t want to turn back either.\u201dAnd I didn\u2019t want to try and live an ordinary life with this crippled body of mine.\u201cSince you\u2019re so talented, you really didn\u2019t need me to cover for you, right?\u201dEven though I knew this, I still threw my body\u00a0in the way. My body that was no longer able to move properly, just for a moment, moved exactly as I wanted it to. Thanks to that, I was able to push this detestable bastard out of the way, and I ended up with this huge hole in my chest.\u201c...I\u2019m tired now, so just get going already.\u201dSlowly, it was becoming even harder to speak. It felt like my own voice was coming to me from a distance and, from even farther away, I could hear the sound of weeping. My body was so heavy that I couldn\u2019t even move a finger. Everything in front of me was growing dark.\u201cThanks.\u201dIn my final moments, I heard his voice. Bastard, if you\u2019re going to say it, why didn\u2019t you say it sooner. Still, it made me feel good. After all, this was the first time I\u2019d ever heard him thank me.\u201cWaaahhhhh.\u201dWhat the fuck.FavoriteNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: The Stupid HamelDemon Slayer, God of War, Master-of-All \u2014 these were some of the many titles given to the Great Vermouth. But among all these titles, there was one that best described him, that of the Hero.[300 years ago, our Hero, the Great Vermouth, set out on an adventure along with his companions.]It was an old fairy tale that had been read to him ever since he could walk. It was about the adventures of the Great Vermouth, the Wise Sienna, the Faithful Anise, the Brave Molon, and the Stupid Hamel.\u2018All the others get called great, wise, faithful, or brave, so why am I the only one who gets called stupid?\u2019Whenever his nanny read him this tale as a bedtime story, a raging fire was stoked in Eugene Lionheart\u2019s chest. If only he could speak properly instead of babbling! Or if, at the very least, he could move his body properly!\u2018Even that blockhead Molon got packaged as the brave one. So why am I the stupid one? Did the two of us get switched at some point?\u2019No matter how much he racked his brain, he couldn\u2019t understand how they had come up with \u2018The Brave Molon.\u2019\u2018The Brave? They don\u2019t know jackshit about him. More like, \u201cThe Foolish Molon.\u201d\u2019[The Stupid Hamel was always jealous of Vermouth. Hamel called Vermouth, who was better than him at everything, his rival. Although no one else actually agreed with this.]\u201cThe bastard who wrote this must have been someone who I beat up in the past,\u201d Eugene spat out as he ground his teeth in anger.Actually, it wasn\u2019t that difficult to understand why the contents of the story were like this. These bedtime stories were aimed at children, so they needed to be easy to read as well as fun and educational.Hamel was constantly running ahead of Vermouth. He kept this up even when they reached the crossroad leading to the Demon King\u2019s castle. Although Vermouth said they needed to go right, Hamel was stubborn and insisted on going left.]\u201cBullshit.\u201d[Eventually, Vermouth agreed to listen to Hamel. However, along the path they took, a devilish trap was lying in wait for them\u2026 Stupid Hamel! He shouted boastfully that the Demon King had laid a trap for them because the Demon King was afraid of him. What an idiot!]The ten-year-old Eugene clenched his fist tightly. He might have already read this story hundreds of times, but each time he reached this point in the story, rage welled up within him.[Hamel was a troublemaker. He had a fiery personality, so he frequently ended up fighting with his companions.]\u201c...They got that part right.\u201d[After many adventures, Vermouth and his companions entered the Demon King\u2019s castle. Even after entering the Demon King\u2019s castle, stupid Hamel refused to listen to Vermouth. Hamel, who kept running ahead, couldn\u2019t avoid any of the traps, and thanks to that, Vermouth and his companions experienced many\u00a0crises.]\u201cLike this bastard even knows what it was like,\u201d scolded Eugene through gritted teeth.The traps in the hellish Demon King\u2019s castle weren\u2019t something one could avoid just because they wanted to, so even though they had known that traps laid ahead, they still had no choice but to break through forcefully.[...Hamel was always arguing with his companions. Stupid Hamel. Rude Hamel. However, Hamel loved his companions. Hamel, who was covered in scars, sacrificed himself for his companions instead of running away.]\u201c...\u201d[In his final moments, while cradled in the arms of his loving comrades, Hamel regretted that he had never been honest with them. Sienna, he said, I\u2019ve always liked you.]\u201cI didn\u2019t like her.\u201d[Anise, please pray for me.]\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d[Molon, you\u2019re the bravest warrior.]\u201cThat bastard was just a blockhead.\u201d[Vermouth, make sure to defeat the Demon King. Vermouth swore an oath on Hamel\u2019s tears that he would definitely defeat the Demon King. At these words, Hamel peacefully closed his eyes\u2026.]There was nothing more to see after this. With a furrowed brow, Eugene closed the book.\u2018So my character was sacrificed for the sake of a good bedtime story.\u2019Countless children had been taught a lesson about how even someone like Stupid Hamel could hide a righteous heart inside his chest. He had sacrificed himself for his comrades and he had even regretted being dishonest\u2026.\u201cFuck, did they really have to sell my good name for such a cheap lesson?\u201dEven though he had read it several times, he still got angry every time. Finally, venting his rage, he threw the book across the room. He secretly desired to find the person who had written the story and beat them to a pulp, but the author of this book, which had already been around for three hundred years, was anonymous.\u201cVermouth, Sienna, Anise, and Molon, you four are also to blame, you bastards. How could you allow a fairy tale like this to be written? Damn you, Sienna. Even though you cried like that when I snuffed it\u2026! Did none of you even consider protecting your dead colleague\u2019s honor?\u201dHe suspected that might actually be the case, or at least he did once he had recovered from his outburst and caught his breath. After all, it wasn\u2019t like they could have expected that Hamel would be reincarnated with a complete memory of his past life.Damn reincarnation!Eugene recalled all the time he had spent crying in his crib. In his opinion, his years of infancy were just as torturous as going through the Demon King\u2019s castle. On top of his thoughts being fuzzy, he couldn\u2019t even move or speak properly. So he was forced to spend every day of those long and terrible years chewing on a pacifier or staring up at the mobile hanging from the ceiling.There was a reason why, as a ten-year-old, he had such a foul look in his eyes. From a young age, he had been forced to kill time by just staring into the distance\u2026.Eugene released a heavy breath as he rubbed the bridge of his nose.\u2018... I\u2019m fine with reincarnation, but why\u2019d I have to get reborn as one of Vermouth\u2019s descendants?\u2019Vermouth\u2019s surname was Lionheart.\u2018If I\u2019m going to get reincarnated, aren\u2019t there a lot of places that I could have gone to? So why, of all things, did I get stuck with Vermouth\u2019s bloodline?\u2019Anyone else might have celebrated having such a powerful background, but there was no way that Eugene, who still had the memories of his previous life, could do that.All his life, he had wanted to outshine Vermouth. Although he hadn\u2019t yelled about being rivals as the story claimed he did, it was true that Hamel had tended to be conscious of the guy throughout their journey.In the end, he hadn\u2019t been able to escape Vermouth\u2019s shadow. No matter how hard he practiced and strived, he still couldn\u2019t shorten the distance between them.\u2018The Great Vermouth.\u2019Eugene raised his head and looked at the large portrait hanging on the wall. The Vermouth depicted within it looked exactly the same as his memories from his past life.\u2018The Stupid Hamel.\u2019He took a mirror out of his vest and looked at his reflection. The face of a ten-year-old child looked back, one who didn\u2019t resemble Vermouth in the slightest. However, since his last name was Lionheart, he really was a descendant of Vermouth.At first\u2026 he had thought that this was all just a long dream following his death. However,\u00a0he had long since come to accept that this was\u00a0his new reality.The Stupid Hamel had reincarnated as the descendant of the Great Vermouth.* * *During his lifetime, Vermouth had many concubines alongside his legal wife.\u2018He wasn\u2019t someone who seemed overly interested in women, but I guess he changed with age.\u2019The Vermouth from Eugene\u2019s memories wasn\u2019t just abstinent; he was practically ascetic. To think that such a man would end up with ten concubines and a whole host of descendants.\u2018In the end, he was still human after all, so I guess I get it.\u2019Only the descendants of the legal wife were recognized as the direct lineage of Vermouth. Although Eugene\u2019s family was also surnamed Lionheart, they were only of a collateral line.Even so, it wasn\u2019t like they were left destitute. Although it might not be much compared to the main estate in the capital, Eugene\u2019s family mansion was lavish enough to seem showy in its rural surroundings. So even though they were just collateral descendants, they were still being treated according to their station.Within this spacious mansion, the gigantic gymnasium especially showcased its majesty. Descendants who inherited the blood of the Great Vermouth \u2014 the Hero, the God of War, the Master-of-all \u2014- were not allowed to neglect their training. These words had been hammered into Eugene from a young age.\u201cNot again\u2026\u201dGerhard Lionheart looked down at his ten-year-old son with tired eyes. While he had also been diligent in training from a young age, his young son had already put all his past efforts to shame.Although he might also be a descendant of the great Vermouth, Gerhard actually had no talent for the martial arts.\u201c...it really did break.\u201dWhenever he saw his son, he couldn\u2019t help but feel mixed emotions. From Eugene\u2019s behavior which wasn\u2019t like a child\u2019s to his sharp eyes that didn\u2019t hold a shred of innocence, Gerhard felt there was always some distance between them. Even though Eugene had lost his mother when he was young, Gerhard had never once seen his son cry out for his dead wife.And that wasn\u2019t all. His son\u2019s talent\u2026 was great, so great that it was hard to believe that they shared the same blood.\u2018He\u2019s a monster.\u2019Although this wasn\u2019t an appropriate thought to have about his only son, Gerhard couldn\u2019t help but feel fear at times. He was only ten years old, a child who had yet to even dabble with mana, but his skill when wielding a wooden sword needed to be seen to be believed.\u201cI was just swinging it, and it broke.\u201dEugene lowered the sword with a click of his tongue. The wooden sword had been embedded with an iron core, making it too heavy to handle with just the strength of a child. Even so, Eugene had insisted on using a sword like this one ever since he was seven years old.At first, Gerhard had thought it was just childish stubbornness. He had even thought it would be cute to see Eugene try and wield it with tears in his eyes. However, it had already been three years since then. Now, Eugene could wield this sort of heavy wooden sword with ease and had even gone on to add sandbags when the initial weight proved insufficient.Gerhard gulped as he looked down at the floor, which was strewn with pieces of a broken wooden sword and a completely shattered practice dummy. How long had it been since the dummy was last replaced? Around three days? But this wasn\u2019t anything to be surprised about. Every single one of the practice dummies in the gymnasium had had to be replaced at some point.\u201cThe village blacksmith\u2019s skills are garbage,\u201d Eugene growled.Although these words were too harsh to come from a child\u2019s mouth, Gerhard didn\u2019t bother to point this out. That was just part of Eugene\u2019s innate character. Gerhard had struggled to correct his son\u2019s manners throughout his childhood, but Eugene\u2019s wild nature hadn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he feel ashamed to accept money in exchange for this crap? He should be summoned and given a thrashing, but father, you are just too merciful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Ahem\u2026 Don\u2019t waste your time thinking about that. Next time, we\u2019ll get something a little more durable.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother with the practice dummy, just get me a whole block of high-purity iron. It\u2019s just going to get smacked by a wooden sword, so there\u2019s no need to give it a shape.\u201dGerhard just stared at his son, unable to find the words. He noticed that his son now had such a hardened physique, it was hard to believe he was just ten. To be honest, if they fought barehanded, he suspected that he might even lose\u2026.\u2018I\u2019ve fathered a caveman\u2026.\u2019Gerhard was unable to feel pure joy regarding his son\u2019s talent. Was it because he felt that his son was a monster? No, that wasn\u2019t the reason. Among the many feelings that Gerhard had for his son, there was also a sense of pride. Unlike his father, Eugene had been born with brilliant talent, so how could he not feel pride?However, along with this pride came a sense of guilt. It was an indisputable fact that, as a father, he was lacking in influence. Just because the descendants of Vermouth were all Lionhearts, it didn\u2019t mean that the families were all treated the same. It had already been hundreds of years since Gerhard\u2019s branch of the family was forced out into the countryside, and they mostly went ignored even among the collateral branches.Should he tell his son about the reality of the situation? No, it would be better not to. After all,\u00a0wasn\u2019t\u00a0such a topic too difficult for a young child to understand?\u201cCan\u2019t I just use a real sword?\u201dWithout even considering it, Gerhard bitterly shook his head.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that yet.\u201d\u201cBecause of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If you take part in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony three years from now, you\u2019ll be allowed to wield a real sword.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine if we just keep it a secret between the two of us?\u201d\u201cSomething like that\u2026 is not allowed. Because I am a Lionheart, I can\u2019t just ignore family traditions.\u201dThe Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was a Lionheart family tradition that took place once every ten years. During the ceremony, all children from the ages of ten to fifteen who bore the name Lionheart, both direct and collateral descendants, were called to the main estate.The reason for this ceremony was simple. It was to decide who among them were best suited to carry the Lionheart name. After all, wasn\u2019t it an embarrassment to claim to be the descendants of the hero without first proving it? So until that day, they weren\u2019t allowed to wield a sharpened \u2018true\u2019 weapon until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over.\u2018What a stupid tradition.\u2019Eugene didn\u2019t allow his thoughts to slip out. However, whenever he heard anything about the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony or the family\u2019s traditions, he felt disgust and disbelief churn in the pit of his stomach.The only purpose that the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony served was to suppress the collateral descendants.The children of the collateral lines weren\u2019t allowed to wield real weapons until after the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. They also weren\u2019t allowed to train their mana. However, the children of the direct line residing in the capital estate were free to wield any weapon they wanted, regardless of their age, and they started learning how to use mana as soon as they could walk.\u2018That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. They want to beat it into them from a young age that the collateral descendants can never outdo the direct descendants.\u2019This act of bullying was so obvious that even a child could see it. Much less Eugene, who, although young in body, had the mind of an adult.Gerhard couldn\u2019t see what was going on inside his son\u2019s head. However, he got some idea of what Eugene was feeling from his sullen expression. Although he thought the sight of his frustrated son\u2019s face was quite cute, his guilt grew even heavier.\u2018If only he was born to the direct line\u2026.\u2019His son\u2019s talent was brilliant, but clear limitations were placed on the Lionheart family\u2019s collateral descendants. In the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony three years from now\u2026 although his son was so outstanding that it was hard to believe he was still a child, there was no way he could compete with the true inheritors who had grown up in the main household.Such a reality made Gerhard feel tormented. If only he had been born without talent like his father\u2026 then Eugene wouldn\u2019t have to feel the gap between his innate talent and the challenges posed by reality.\u201cWhy do you have that sort of look on your face, father?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u2018As if. You can clearly tell that he\u2019s blaming himself again for not being able to give me the best opportunities.\u2019Eugene clicked his tongue as he stared at Gerhard. Because of his clear memories from his previous life, it was difficult to regard Gerhard as his father. However, it was impossible to deny that he had been reborn as Gerhard\u2019s son.\u201cFather. It\u2019s been a long time, so why don\u2019t we do some play-fighting?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 What?!\u201d\u201cI said, play-fighting.\u201dEugene didn\u2019t mention the word spar. He was trying to be considerate of his father\u2019s feelings if his ten-year-old son were to challenge him to a spar. That\u2019s why he used the word \u2018play\u2019 instead, but Gerhard\u2019s expression still froze in horror.Gerhard first felt the weight of his gut dragging him down. Then he looked at his son\u2019s arm brandishing the iron-cored wooden sword like a toy.\u201cL-let\u2019s leave that for next time.\u201dIf his ten-year-old son were to accidentally use his full strength while playing\u2026 Gerhard quickly retreated while sweating buckets, just thinking about it.Eugene giggled as he watched his father make his escape.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: The Lionheart (1)In the legends and pictures from the fairytales, the image of Vermouth with \u2018the Holy Sword\u2019 was always in center place, but according to Eugene\u2019s memories, the Holy Sword wasn\u2019t as great of a weapon as the stories made it out to be.\u2018Though it did shine pretty brightly.\u2019It provided all sorts of help in the dimly lit Demon King\u2019s castle, but that was it really. In the first place, as the Holy Sword was more of a ceremonial sword with an emphasis on appearance rather than function, Vermouth didn\u2019t actually like to use it that much. It was to the extent where it was only taken out occasionally to deal with especially tough demons.Vermouth was a master of many different weapons, which had gained him the titles of God of War and Master-of-All.\u00a0That guy would pull all sorts of weapons out of his subspace whenever he needed to use something in particular.\u2018And on top of all that, he was also good at magic,\u2019\u00a0thought Eugene.Throughout his life, Hamel had never learned any magic.\u2018I\u2019d like to think that if I had devoted some time to cracking it, I\u2019d have been better than the average joe.\u2019But even if that were the case, at that time, he hadn\u2019t spared magic a single glance. Back when he was a child and still thought he was a genius\u2026 the idea of learning magic had never even crossed his mind.\u2018That would probably have continued to be the case even if I hadn\u2019t met Vermouth.\u2019Hamel had gone through a lot of changes after meeting Vermouth.In this world, there were people called geniuses who could excel at everything they tried. Young Hamel had believed himself to be such a genius, but an encounter with a true genius had shattered this childish delusion.He learned that he wasn\u2019t a genius.\u2018But now?\u2019With a click of his tongue, Eugene tilted his head.\u2018I have memories of my past life. If that was all I had, then I could easily become as strong as I was back then.\u2019He was certain of this. However, Eugene didn\u2019t want to be satisfied with reaching just that level of strength. Since he had even reincarnated like this\u2026 what meaning would there be in staying at the same level that he had reached in his previous life. After all, he had been reincarnated as a descendant of that Vermouth.\u2018Vermouth,\u2019\u00a0thought Eugene as he massaged his thick arms,\u00a0\u2018it looks like there really is something to your blood.\u2019Even if a child worked out, they weren\u2019t physically able to put on much muscle. However, Eugene had no choice but to admit that, apart from the size of the muscles, his new body was perfect.Although he might not have bulked up, his whole body was wiry and flexible, and it was hard to imagine that a child\u2019s body could have such dense musculature. His bones were equally sturdy. Even if he pushed his body to the breaking point, it didn\u2019t cause any\u00a0sequelae, and even serious injuries healed quickly.\u2018Although my previous body was already good enough to be mistaken for a genius, this is just\u2026 there\u2019s no comparison. It\u2019s enough to make me understand how you could have gotten so strong.\u2019From the start, the base specs of their bodies had been different. This fact brought feelings of both joy and bitterness to Eugene. If he had had a body like this in his previous life\u2026.\u2018...it\u2019s pointless to think about it.\u2019Shaking his head, Eugene rid himself of the idea. His past life belonged in the past. Since he had been reincarnated like this, why bother with the regrets of his previous life?With these thoughts in mind, Eugene attempted to shed his attachments to the past. However, he couldn\u2019t quite let go of his regrets. After all, wasn\u2019t the only thing that Hamel had left behind as his legacy was that fucking insulting nickname of \u2018The Stupid Hamel\u2019?And what about the others?After returning to his homeland in the Kiehl Empire, the Great Vermouth served as a duke before eventually returning the title. He was praised as a hero until the very end. The Kiehl Empire held a state funeral for Vermouth\u2019s death, and, even now, the anniversary of Vermouth\u2019s death was commemorated by the empire.As for the Wise Sienna, that uncute girl was invited to the Magic Kingdom of Aroth, where she became the youngest person in history to rise to the position of a Magic Tower\u2019s Head Wizard. Although there were only five Magic Towers in Aroth, two of them currently had one of Sienna\u2019s direct disciples serving as their heads.The Faithful Anise, that rotten woman, had actually ended up being canonized as a Saint by the Holy Empire of Yuras. Her teachings were so respected that they were even being passed down as a separate volume of scripture.And Eugene just couldn\u2019t believe what the Brave Molon was said to have done. It was claimed that Molon, that blockhead, had actually founded a kingdom! Did he really manage to gather all the refugees from the lands that had been ravaged by the Demon Kings\u2019 forces and establish a kingdom in his own name?\u2018And here\u2019s the part that I\u2019m finding the most difficult to understand.\u2019Eugene furrowed his brow. Whenever his thoughts turned to this matter, it was always at this point that he felt a familiar surge of rage.\u2018It seems like everyone was doing just fine until they died, so why are the demons still around?\u2019In his past life as Hamel, he and his companions had ventured into the Devildom of Helmuth. While leading the subjugation forces sent from every country, they had killed three of the five Demon Kings.Stupid Hamel then died at the Fourth Demon King\u2019s castle.He clearly remembered that, at the moment of his death, he had believed that Vermouth and his other companions would definitely slay the remaining Demon Kings.However, how were things in reality? The world was at peace, of course. The Demon Kings no longer held any ambitions of conquering the world, and it was all due to the \u2018Oath\u2019 that the Great Vermouth had made with the Demon Kings.\u2018Why did he end up making an oath like that? Weren\u2019t we supposed to wipe them all out?\u2019He didn\u2019t know the reasons behind it. But in any case, the war with the Demon Kings was over, and the world was at peace. A peace that had lasted for over three hundred years and continued to the present day.\u201c...Perchance, are you feeling a bit nervous?\u201dEugene lifted his head as he heard a voice speaking to him. He was currently riding inside of a luxurious carriage. A middle-aged man with a stiff face was sitting in the seat across from him.\u201c...It\u2019s because this is my first time in the capital,\u201d Eugene muttered as he looked out of the window.He had left behind his mansion in the countryside and arrived at the nearest city after a day\u2019s travel in a horse-drawn carriage. Then, after going through several warp gates, he had finally stepped foot in the capital.\u201cI understand how you feel,\u201d the man sympathized with Eugene.The man\u2019s name was Gordon. He was a knight who had sworn allegiance to the main house of Lionheart, and he was currently serving as Eugene\u2019s escort.\u201cMaster Eugene, would you mind if I give you a piece of advice?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re already feeling nervous, then every day spent at the main estate will feel extremely tortuous.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t a single sign of amusement on Gordon\u2019s face. And even though these words had been offered as advice, there wasn\u2019t a trace of concern either. Sensing this, Eugene grinned.\u201cThank you for your advice, Sir Gordon.\u201dEugene was well aware of his current plight. As they weren\u2019t part of the direct bloodline, the reality was that the collateral descendants were forced to treat even the knights who had been assigned to escort them with wary respect. Much less Eugene\u2019s household, who were beneath the notice of even the other collateral branches.\u2018Even so, I\u2019m still a Lionheart. They only sent a single knight to escort me\u2026 and my father wasn\u2019t allowed to accompany me either.\u2019Without dropping his smile, Eugene turned back to stare out the window.\u2018Although they aren\u2019t being too obvious about it, they\u2019re really trying to put us in our place. I guess they\u2019re getting a head start by crushing our spirits? Bastards. Vermouth, this is all because you went and sowed your seeds all over the place.\u2019Eugene imagined how things might unfold in the near future. Seeing as how they were already trying to crush his spirit, he would probably be subjected to even more blatant oppression the moment he arrived at the main house.\u2018Maybe they\u2019ll gather all their knights to welcome us and then loudly announce exactly who is arriving and how humble their background is?\u2019No, they would save that sort of thing for those who were actually being treated as competition. Seeing how they had only sent one knight to escort him, they probably wouldn\u2019t even bother to arrange a welcoming ceremony for him.\u201c...How many people are participating in this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony?\u201d\u201cIncluding Master Eugene, there are six people from the collateral lines. In addition, three heirs from the main house will also be participating.\u201d\u201cThree from the main house?\u201dAlthough Eugene had pitched his voice in an attempt to feign surprise, he had already known in advance who was attending this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. This was all thanks to Gerhard taking special precautions.Of the three people from the direct bloodline, one was the first wife\u2019s son, and the other two were twins born from the second wife.Within the five from the other collateral bloodlines, the only ones who needed to be paid any attention were the two from families who had gained quite the prestige despite being collateral bloodlines.\u2018I think the oldest was only fifteen, and there are those even younger than me\u2026.\u2019Eugene was thirteen years old. Upon recalling his current age, he couldn\u2019t hold back a sigh.\u00a0All because of this tradition, was he really being asked to compete with ten-year-olds?~--Eugene. Whatever you do, don\u2019t try to compete with the children of the main house. No matter how excellent you are, you won\u2019t be an opponent for the children of the direct bloodline. That\u2019s why you should\u2026.~Eugene recalled the gloomy expression that Gerhard had held at that time. His father couldn\u2019t hide his fear that his son might fall into despair once he encountered the children of the main household.\u2018...still, I can\u2019t help but feel excited to see how talented Vermouth\u2019s descendants are.\u2019Eugene tore his eyes away from the window. They had already passed by all the splendid scenery the capital had to offer, and now the carriage was leaving the city behind and entering a forest.\u201cFrom this point on, we have entered the Lionheart estate.\u201dThe forest was surrounded by tall walls.\u201cAh, but there\u2019s no need to be in a hurry to get your things ready. We still have a long way to go from here.\u201dEven though he hadn\u2019t been getting ready to leave the carriage at all, Gordon still smiled as he gave this teasing advice.\u2018I get it, you bastard. Must\u00a0be nice to have such a large estate. It\u2019s not even your land, so why are you acting so smug?\u2019\u201cWhoa, so this whole forest is the private property of the main house?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s this large, isn\u2019t it inconvenient getting around?\u201d\u201cThere are warp gates installed everywhere.\u201d\u2018Is that so? Then why am I currently riding in a carriage? That\u2019s because we couldn\u2019t even be bothered to give\u00a0Master\u00a0Eugene permission to use the warp gates.\u2019While holding this back-and-forth conversation inside his head, Eugene continued to stare outside the window.~Just as Gordon had said, the carriage finally came to a stop after driving on for quite some time. After opening the door on his side and getting down from the carriage, Gordon walked over to open the door for Eugene.\u201cWelcome to the Lionheart family\u2019s main estate,\u201d Gordon said politely, with a bow of his head.The mansion was visible through the wide-open gates. Just as expected, not a single person had come out to welcome him.\u2018The Lionheart.\u2019Eugene slowly raised his gaze. White flags lined the path leading up from the main gate entrance, and a brave lion was embroidered in the center of each flag. This was the personal sigil of the main house.\u2018Vermouth\u2019s Lionheart.\u2019Eugene looked down at his own chest. His clothes were bare of any decoration. Only Vermouth Lionheart\u2019s direct descendants were allowed to have the lion sigil sewn onto their left chest.\u2018If only I had also left descendants.\u2019In his previous life, Hamel had neither married anyone nor had any children.\u2018No. It\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t have any. If that were the case, I would have been left with some pointless regrets.\u2019Still, seeing the family\u2019s flags lined up like this, he couldn\u2019t help but feel regret for his past life.\u201cHave any of my other relatives arrived yet?\u201d\u201cMaster Eugene is the first to arrive.\u201d\u2018Hurray,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with a nod of his head.* * *The place where Eugene was led to was an annex built off of the main hall.On the way there, he hadn\u2019t even caught a glimpse of a single relative who bore the lion on their chest that showed they belonged to the main family. Why were they being so aloof? Shouldn\u2019t they at least feel some curiosity and come to take a look at the arrival of their thirteen-year-old relative?But at least he wasn\u2019t being received with complete rudeness. Upon arriving at the annex, he found that a single personal attendant had been attached to him.The female servant greeted him, \u201cPlease call me Nina.\u201dThough from the looks of it, she was a young girl who wasn\u2019t much older than Eugene, Eugene couldn\u2019t muster up much dissatisfaction for this.\u201cIf there is anything you need, please ring this bell,\u201d Nina said as she bowed her head and handed Eugene a small bell.She was probably in her late teens, at the very most.\u201cDo you mind if I speak comfortably?\u201d\u201cOf course, please do so.\u201d\u201cAm I the only one using this entire annex?\u201d Eugene asked as he looked around the spacious annex.He was only asking for the sake of confirmation. Eugene knew that this couldn\u2019t really be the case. For one thing, Nina was far too young to oversee an entire annex by herself.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that is not the case, but there shouldn\u2019t be any discomfort during your stay.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m going to be living with some other relatives,\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo you know when they\u2019ll be arriving?\u201d\u201cThey all should arrive within four days at the very latest.\u201dEugene snorted at this reply. Because this just meant that he would be stuck here for four days.\u201cIs there a gymnasium around the back?\u201d\u201c...Huh? Um, yes\u2026\u201d\u201cDo I need permission from the main house to practice my swings with a wooden sword?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause that\u2019s just what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Eugene declared with a smile as he headed straight to the gym.With a helpless look on her face, Nina trailed behind Eugene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: The Lionheart (2)\u201cWho was Gerhard again?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s that guy, the one who lives in a corner of the Gidol province.\u201d\u201cAnd where exactly is the Gidol province?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s at the westernmost part of the empire\u2026 ah, what\u2019s the point? It isn\u2019t like we\u2019ll ever need to go to such a rural area.\u201dTwo children giggled mockingly as they gossiped about the new arrival. These two were Cyan and Ciel, fraternal twins born to the second wife of the main house.Though their mother was the second wife, it was no secret that the Patriarch favored her over the official first wife. Such circumstances made these two thirteen-year-old children prideful enough to hold their noses so high in the air that they pointed straight at the sky.\u201cThat bastard\u2019s name is\u2026?\u201d Cyan trailed off.\u201cI heard it\u2019s Eugene and that he\u2019s the same age as us,\u201d Ciel said.\u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to be friends just because our ages are similar,\u201d Cyan declared arrogantly while giggling.Looking at the annex in the distance, he continued speaking, \u201cI heard that this is his first time in the capital. Gordon told me earlier that he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the window the whole time he was in the\u00a0carriage. Well, it\u2019s understandable. He comes from a nowhere location like the Gidol province, after all. Does that place have anything to see other than forests and fields?\u201d Cyan asked his sister.\u201cHow should I know, I\u2019ve never been there before either, but that\u2019s probably the case since it\u2019s out in the country. Did you hear if he got motion sickness from the\u00a0warp gate?\u201d Ciel asked in return.\u201cI heard that he had a nauseous expression on his face.\u201d\u201cSo it looks like he didn\u2019t end up vomiting. Ah, how disappointing. If he had ended up vomiting, I was thinking of making him clean the carriage,\u201d Ciel said with a mischievous smile.At this prankish reply from his sister, who was younger than him by a few seconds, Cyan clicked his tongue and shook his finger at her.\u201cIdiot. If you want to order him to clean the carriage, he doesn\u2019t need to have thrown up.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cSince that brat came here from the countryside, then his body must reek of cow dung. In my opinion, he\u2019s probably lifted more pitchforks in his entire life than wooden swords,\u201d said Cyan scornfully.\u201cAha!\u201d Ciel exclaimed in enlightenment.\u201cSince he rode in the carriage for a few days, the smell of cow dung clinging to his body must have rubbed off onto the carriage as well,\u201d Cyan elaborated.\u201cUgh, how nasty,\u201d Ciel said, her face twisting into a disgusted expression as she stuck out her tongue.However, her disgust was isolated to her expression, as her eyes were instead filled with mischievous playfulness.\u201cThe carriage he rode in is our family\u2019s property. No matter what our relationship, if the carriage was dirtied because of him, then he should be held accountable, right?\u201d Cyan asked.\u201cYep, that\u2019s right,\u201d Ciel agreed.\u201cI just so happened to hear that as soon as that brat arrived at the annex, he went straight to the gym and started swinging a wooden sword,\u201d Cyan said.\u201cWhat a show-off,\u201d Ciel burst into laughter.The twins, who had been born on the same day, had always gotten along well.\u201cWell, it is his first time in the capital, and he\u2019s also arrived at the main estate. That\u2019s probably why he's putting on such a pretense,\u201d Cyan sneered.\u201cPutting on a pretense? Just say it like it is,\u00a0brother. He\u2019s trying to show off.\u201dCiel kept on laughing as she slapped her brother\u2019s arm in amusement. However, in contrast, Cyan put on a stern look and straightened his back.\u201cSpeaking of this stupid relative of ours, it seems that he must have come to the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony with high expectations of himself. It looks like he wasn\u2019t properly educated by his father.\u201d\u201cYep, yep,\u201d Ciel agreed with her brother.\u201cFirst, he ruins the carriage by getting his smell everywhere, and now he\u2019s trying to show off to the adults by pretending to be training, how cheeky of him,\u201d Cyan said.\u201cLooks like he needs to be punished,\u201d said Ciel.\u201cHey now, punishment is going a bit too far. Why don\u2019t we just remind him about\u00a0things he should and shouldn\u2019t do? It\u2019s for his own good. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want him to get scolded by the grown-ups later.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too nice, brother.\u201d Ciel gave her full agreement with a grin despite knowing her brother\u2019s true intentions. These young twins had long since learned that sneaky pranks like this were much more fun than outright bullying.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Cyan led the way with a forceful cry.Ciel skipped along behind him before turning her head as she felt a gaze observing her from afar. The twins had been practicing mana since their childhood and could sense even intangible things like gazes.Within the majestic and splendid mansion, a young man stood in a window on the third floor. After exchanging looks with Ciel, he leaned back and pulled the curtains shut. Ciel smiled bashfully at this sight and stuck out her tongue.* * *Until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, children of collateral lines weren\u2019t allowed to wield sharpened weapons.While Eugene had absolutely no respect for such a ridiculous tradition, his father Gerhard would never dare to ignore a Lionheart family tradition. There were too many eyes in their mansion to keep it a secret from the main family.\u2018It\u2019s too light.\u2019Eugene\u2019s brow furrowed as he looked down at the wooden sword. He had wielded a wooden sword with an iron core ever since he was seven, and at the age of twelve, he had begun practicing his swings with an iron bar that barely resembled a wooden sword. It might be covered with a thin layer of wood, but the \u2018wooden sword\u2019 that Eugene had been wielding for over a year now was heavy enough to crush bones with a casual swing.However, it wasn\u2019t a sharpened weapon, so that was alright. Even if a greater amount of iron had been added to increase the weight, and it had grown to a size that few could even lift, it was still just a wooden sword.To perfectly control his body, Eugene had been training every single day, not wasting even a day lying around.Since he\u2019d gotten a second chance through reincarnation, he had to make the most of his new life. But funnily, it wasn\u2019t his reason for working this hard.Eugene had been like this from the very beginning. Even when he\u2019d been traveling with Vermouth and his other companions, he never missed a chance to train unless it was unavoidable.\u2018Despite that, that fucker still had the nerve to say that I wasn\u2019t working hard enough.\u2019Vermouth, that disgusting bastard; Eugene ground his teeth as he recalled that guy\u2019s dreary gaze.Eugene had come to realize that he was pushing his body far harder than he had in his previous life. Each time he pushed himself physically, it felt like his body was breaking through its previously imagined limits.He still couldn\u2019t be sure whether the body he had been born with as Vermouth\u2019s descendant was superior to Vermouth\u2019s own. However, it was clear that this body was far superior to that of \u2018Stupid Hamel\u2019s.\u2019 He hadn\u2019t even begun to dabble with mana. So, as a thirteen-year-old with a body that still wasn\u2019t fully grown, did it really make sense that he was able to wield such a heavy piece of iron?\u201cDon\u2019t you have any wooden swords that are heavier than this? It would be good if they were a bit bigger as well,\u201d Eugene asked.It felt like he had already swung it hundreds of times, but he was barely sweating. Eugene frowned and turned his head towards Nina.\u201cAlso, I told you to stay in the shade over there. Why are you standing out here in the sunlight?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m fine,\u201d Nina replied.\u201cAs if you can be fine when you\u2019re sweating like that. Stop being so stubborn and go sit in the shade. No, hold on. Before that, do you have any other wooden swords?\u201dEven as Nina was sweating profusely, she had a perplexed look on her face. The person in front of her was a thirteen-year-old child from a collateral line. Still, as a junior servant of the main family, he wasn\u2019t someone that she could disregard. Although it might only be temporary, she had been assigned as his personal attendant, so it was impossible for her to rest in the shade while her master was training.\u201cThe wooden swords are\u2026 the gymnasium's storeroom should have all the ones available. Any other wooden swords would probably be in the main gymnasium\u2026.\u201d\u201cCan you get some here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t be the judge of that. If you wish, I could go and ask, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to go.\u201dEugene shook his head without any reluctance. He had heard from her earlier that Nina was only sixteen. She had only just gotten her apprenticeship qualifications, so he didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for her by making unreasonable demands.\u2018This is just too blatant.\u2019Eugene suppressed a grin as he put down the wooden sword. Why did they assign him a maid who was fresh out of her apprenticeship? Wasn\u2019t it obvious? If he were to take his frustrations out on her when the clumsy attendant made a mistake or caused disrespect, he\u2019d be setting himself up to be punished instead.\u2018I don\u2019t know whose idea this was, but they sure are underhanded.\u2019If he were to keep swinging this wooden sword, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to warm up. Casually swinging his arms, Eugene headed over to the storeroom. This caused Nina to immediately try and catch up to him.\u201cMaster Eugene, if there\u2019s anything you need, please instruct me instead.\u201d\u201cIf it were anything else, then maybe, but if I\u2019m going to use it to train, then I need to pick it myself. What would be the point if I told you to fetch something, but it didn\u2019t suit me? Should I just waste both our time by sending you over repeatedly until you get something I can use? Instead, if I fetch it myself, then it\u2019ll be over in a snap.\u201dThe warehouse showed that it hadn\u2019t seen regular use in a while because everything was covered in dust. Nina felt a cold sweat break out on her back as she saw the dust billowing in the wind. In fact, she had wanted to clean up this place for a few days now, but the maid in charge of the annex had rebuked her, saying it wasn\u2019t necessary, so it had been left like this.\u201cM-my apologies,\u201d Nina said.\u201cWhat for?\u201d Eugene didn\u2019t pay any attention to Nina bowing her head in apology behind him. He wandered through the dust until he found what he had been looking for \u2014 sandbags that could be worn on the body. He also found something useful on a shelf.It was a chainmail vest that hadn\u2019t been properly greased and left covered in dust. Although it was much bigger than Eugene\u2019s torso, he liked the hefty weight he felt when he tried it on. After that, Eugene pulled out a large spear longer than his height.\u201c...Um\u2026Is there anything I can help you with\u2026?\u201d Nina asked.\u201cTry stepping on this,\u201d Eugene said as he gestured at the spear that he had just pulled out and placed on the floor.Following his order, Nina stepped onto the spear. This kept it from rolling around, allowing Eugene to tie sandbags onto the spear.Nina watched on with an overwhelmed look in her eyes. Eugene was currently wearing a large chainmail vest several sizes too big and sandbags hanging from each arm. But on top of that, even more sandbags were being hung onto the spear.\u2018There\u2019s no way.\u2019Just from the looks of it, the spear alone had to be double Eugene\u2019s own weight. However, Eugene waved her off with a satisfied expression.\u201cYou can move now.\u201d\u201cY-Yes.Eugene bent his knees and lifted the spear with both hands. Although he clenched his teeth for a moment at its dizzying weight, the way his muscles tensed and bones trembled filled him with joy.\u201cGet back\u2026 No, even further\u2026 Just keep going until you reach the shade!\u201d Eugene instructed.\u201cY-yes!\u201d Startled, Nina stepped backward.After checking that Nina wasn\u2019t in the way, Eugene swung the spear in a wide arc.Whoosh!The spear was heavier than him, but because he had placed even more weight on himself, he didn\u2019t get dragged around by it. This was the secondary purpose of putting on the vest and hanging sandbags onto himself.While taking heavy steps, Eugene kept swinging the spear fiercely. Each time he swung, it felt like his arms were going to be pulled out of their sockets, and his waist, which controlled the rotation, screamed in pain. At this sight, Nina covered her mouth with a gasp. She felt that this exercise might cause a catastrophe beyond the means of recovery for such a young body.However, even as it seemed like Eugene would collapse at any moment, he stayed standing. Whenever his body seemed like it would falter, he instead swung the spear even faster. Then Eugene would force himself to arrest the increased momentum of the swing and immediately transition into a stabbing motion.Pop!He felt the calluses on both hands tear apart. This pain! He couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful that he wasn\u2019t wearing any gloves, as otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to feel this\u00a0pain.Eugene continued to swing the spear, giggling from pure joy. He compensated for his blood-soaked hands slipping on the spear shaft by holding on with even greater force. His eyes had turned red and bloodshot, and he was breathing rapidly from exerting too much strength.\u201cHey.\u201dAs Nina looked at this scene in awe, she was startled by a voice coming from beside her.\u201cWhat is that bastard doing?\u201dIt was Cyan and Ciel. The evil twins had caused countless maids to soak their pillowcases with tears. The two had crept right next to her, and their eyes were twinkling with curiosity.\u201cY-young master, young lady, what brings you here\u2026?\u201d\u201cI asked you what that bastard was doing,\u201d Cyan spat out with furrowed brows.He was displeased by the fact that this nameless servant hadn\u2019t immediately answered his question. Under the usual circumstances, he would have torn into her so thoroughly that she would never dare make that mistake again. But currently, he was far more curious about what the villager was doing.\u201cCan\u2019t you tell just by looking?\u201dThis reply didn\u2019t come from Nina. Taking a deep breath, Eugene stopped and lowered the spear onto the ground.\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Eugene asked as he kicked the spear.What was this bastard thinking? Cyan didn\u2019t answer immediately and instead narrowed his eyes, but Ciel, standing beside him, grinned and answered.\u201cYou idiot, it\u2019s a spear, of course. Don\u2019t you even know that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s a spear,\u201d Eugene said.\u201cSo what?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cSince you know it\u2019s a spear, don\u2019t you know what swinging a spear is?\u201d said Eugene.\u201cI do know!\u201d\u201cThen why were you asking her what I was doing?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who asked that. It was my brother who asked.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you try and explain to that stupid brother of yours. Tell him, \u2018that bastard is swinging a spear,\u2019\u201d Eugene said.Ciel\u2019s eyes widened into circles at this insult.In contrast, Cyan\u2019s eyes became even thinner.\u201cStupid? Me?\u201d\u201cSeeing as how you didn\u2019t know what was going on when you were looking right at it, you don\u2019t seem all that smart.\u201d\u201cBrother, that bumpkin is calling you an idiot.\u201dCiel giggled and poked Cyan in the side. Rather than being enraged like her brother, she instinctively knew that she could make the situation more interesting by arousing her brother\u2019s anger in this way.This weak goading from his younger-by-few-seconds sibling was enough to make Cyan cry out, \u201cYou dare!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: The Lionheart (3)Cyan wasn\u2019t a fool. Of course, he knew that Eugene had been holding a spear and swinging it as a training exercise.However, this was his first time seeing such an unscientific method of training. Wearing a chainmail vest several sizes too big, tying sandbags onto both arms, and swinging a spear that was also laden with sandbags; could you really call that training?At least in Cyan\u2019s view, such a training method made no sense. It was far too barbaric and extreme. He was just recklessly swinging and stabbing a spear, without any semblance of style or technique, and he had so little control of his body that he was staggering here and there; how could something like that be called training?\u2018This country bumpkin. He\u2019s really working his ass off just for a little attention.\u2019While the chainmail vest might be large, seeing the state that it was in, it definitely had to have been made from the cheapest scrap iron. This meant that it couldn\u2019t be as heavy as it appeared.As for those sandbags, while they might seem hefty, looking at how they bounced as he moved, you could tell that, despite their thick leather casings, they were mostly empty.\u2018Even if he\u2019s hungry for attention, there should be a limit to his foolishness. Where does he get the nerve, coming here and playing this sort of trick\u2026?\u2019Actually, he could understand it. This guy was a bumpkin from a place out in the countryside that no one had ever heard of, and even among the collateral lines, Eugene was the lowest of the low. He had probably decided to pull off something like this on the first day after receiving some encouragement from his parents.Without performing a petty trick like this, there was no way he would be worthy of any attention. Though, the fact that his attempt was so transparently fake made it kind of funny.However, unfortunately for him, this bumpkin daring to call Cyan an idiot wasn\u2019t at all amusing, and in fact, it was enraging. Calming himself with a deep breath, Cyan pointed a finger at Eugene.\u201cApologize.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d asked Eugen.\u201cYou dare pretend ignorance? Apologize for insulting my intelligence!\u201d\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Eugene replied immediately.However, Cyan wasn\u2019t satisfied with this apology. He narrowed his eyes and raised his chin proudly.\u201cLower your head and apologize more respectfully!\u201d Cyan demanded.\u201cAren\u2019t we the same age?\u201d Eugene asked without moving his head an inch. \u201cYou\u2019re thirteen. I\u2019m also thirteen. That means we\u2019re pals of the same age, so why ask me to lower my head?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that you and I can be friends!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not friends? Then why have you been speaking to me so casually ever since you arrived?\u201dEugene concealed the embarrassment he was feeling inside with a click of his tongue. He felt the urge to ask himself,\u00a0\u2018Just what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019Adding on the years from his previous life to his current age, he was well over fifty years old. With that much of an age difference, wasn\u2019t it just sad that he was getting into a fight with a thirteen-year-old brat, especially when that brat was one of his old rival\u2019s descendants?\u2018Well, so what? My past life is my\u00a0past\u00a0life. Right now, I\u2019m also thirteen.\u2019When Cyan didn\u2019t respond, Eugene pressed him, \u201cAs I said, what\u2019s with the way you\u2019ve been talking to me? So you aren\u2019t just clueless about spears, but etiquette as well?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Cyan\u2019s eyes widened as words failed him.As someone who had been constantly indulged ever since he was young, he grew up spoiled and wasn\u2019t familiar with this kind of childish quarrel.\u201cThis\u2026. This cheeky\u2026.\u201dThe biggest advantage of being a child was that you could act on your emotions without any restraint whenever you wished. So although he wasn\u2019t familiar with this type of quarrel, Cyan relied on something that he was accustomed to \u2014 venting his emotions onto others. With large strides, he moved forwards until he was standing nose-to-nose with Eugene.\u201cYou really don\u2019t know your place\u2026! Just because your last name is Lionheart, do you really think you\u2019re one of the same Lionhearts as us?\u201d\u201cNo. I have a pretty good idea of the difference. I\u2019m from a collateral line, and you\u2019re from the direct line.\u201d Eugene lifted his finger and pointed towards the main family\u2019s mansion. \u201cThat\u2019s your house over there. My house is\u2026 which direction was it in again? In any case, it\u2019s far away from here.\u201d\u201cEven knowing all that, you still dare to posture in front of me?\u201d Cyan accused.\u201cI haven\u2019t been posturing at all. I just informed you of a few facts that you seem to have missed. First, you asked what I was doing while looking at me, so I answered. Then you told me to apologize, so I did.\u201d\u201cYou really are impudent,\u201d Cyan spat out as he held his nose. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s a stench coming from your body. It\u2019s the smell of the cow dung from the countryside mixed in with your sweat! It really, really stinks.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never gotten close to cow dung in my entire life, so who are you saying smells of cow dung?\u201d Eugene asked curiously.\u201cIf so, that just means it\u2019s the smell of your own shit\u2026! In any case, you just plain stink.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wash up in a bit.\u201d\u201cNo, go wash up now. Once you\u2019re done, go and clean the carriage that you rode in as well!\u201d\u201cThe carriage?\u201d\u201cBecause the smell of shit from your body definitely must have rubbed off onto the seat! So I\u2019m telling you to go clean it!\u201d\u201cAnd why should I do that?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re the one who got your smell all over the carriage!\u201d Cyan raised his voice and shouted shrilly.Because of the close distance between the two, Cyan would send spit flying at Eugene with each shout. Eugene frowned and took a step back. Although Eugene had only withdrawn because he didn\u2019t want to get spit on, Cyan still looked down on him with a smile of superiority for forcing Eugene to back off.\u201cFurthermore, you need to bow your head and apologize to me. I still haven\u2019t accepted your apologies for calling me an idiot, saying that I didn\u2019t know any etiquette, and for daring to place yourself at my level despite just being a collateral descendant. These all need\u2014\u201dWithout waiting for Cyan to finish, Eugene turned to Nina and said, \u201cNina.\u201d\u201cY-yes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my personal attendant, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Although I am undeserving of this role, I have temporarily been assigned as Master Eugene\u2019s personal attendant.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then instead of standing there, melting in the sunlight, go and clean the carriage that I rode in on.\u201d\u201c...Yes?\u201dNina had already decided that if Cyan and Ciel were to get bored and leave, then she would of course go ahead and clean the carriage herself. So she didn\u2019t think that Eugene was giving her an unreasonable order, as it was only a matter of doing the task now rather than later.However, Nina couldn\u2019t understand why Eugene would give her such an order under the current circumstances. Didn\u2019t he realize that one of the devilish twins was standing right in front of him? Eugene\u2019s behavior showed an open disregard to Cyan\u2019s orders.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Cyan burst out.\u201cI\u2019m just getting the carriage cleaned,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cI told you to do it yourself!\u201d\u201cWhy should I when there\u2019s someone who\u2019ll do it for me?\u201d\u201cI was ordering you to clean the carriage!\u201d\u201cAnd who are you to give me orders?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I am Cyan Lionheart.\u201d\u201cOkay, and I\u2019m Eugene Lionheart. Nice to meet you,\u201d with a bored look on his face, Eugene waved his hand.Reacting to this, Ciel\u2019s hands rose to cover a broad grin as she giggled in amusement even as Cyan\u2019s jaw dropped open foolishly.\u201cAnd I\u2019m Ciel Lionheart,\u201d Ciel introduced herself, still giggling.After glancing briefly at his cheeky little sister, Cyan took a deep breath.\u201cYou\u2026 there is no way that I can get along with you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite the disappointment,\u201d Eugene commented with a disinterested look.Ignoring Eugene, Cyan continued, \u201cBecause you keep ignoring my orders.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not in a position that requires me to listen to your orders.\u201d\u201cAnd furthermore\u2026 you have also insulted me for the last time,\u201d Cyan finally finished.\u201cWowzers,\u201d was Eugene\u2019s latest witty reply.With each word out of Eugene\u2019s mouth, a rage was stoked in Cyan\u2019s chest.Why was he standing here talking to this bastard? This wasn\u2019t why they had come out here and approached this country bumpkin.As the young master of the main family, once he gave an order, the other person was supposed to follow his command without a protest. Cyan\u2019s head was about to burst from offended stubbornness and pride.\u2018So, brother, are you just going to let that slide?\u2019\u00a0Ciel leaned against him and fluttered her eyelashes in anticipation.\u201cA duel,\u201d Cyan answered her unvoiced question.This wasn\u2019t an attempt to live up to his sister\u2019s expectations for him, but because Cyan couldn\u2019t bear to be looked down on any longer. Having received such disrespect from this country bumpkin, if he didn\u2019t do anything in return, he just knew that he was in for several days of teasing at his sister\u2019s hands.\u201cYou have looked down on me and insulted me. As such, we must duel,\u201d Cyan declared.\u201cWhat amazing logic,\u201d Eugene said as he laughed at how ridiculous Cyan\u2019s thought processes were.He had never thought that something like a duel challenge would come from the mouth of this thirteen-year-old kid.\u201cHey pal, something like a challenge to a duel isn\u2019t something you should do so casually,\u201d Eugene advised him.\u201cWho\u2019s your pal?\u201d Cyan retorted angrily.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be friends, then fine. In any case, don\u2019t say anything that you\u2019ll regret and just go. Stop bothering me already.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re scared, right?\u201d Cyan said, proudly raising his chin at Eugene as if he had known that Eugene would react like that.Although it was an obvious provocation, Eugene glared at Cyan through squinted eyes as he repeated, \u201cScared?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re scared. If you\u2019re too afraid to duel me, then just quickly apologize.\u201d\u201cAnd what should I do if I\u2019m not afraid, but I don\u2019t want to fight, and I don\u2019t want to apologize?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you even know what honor is?\u201d\u201cI do know that it isn\u2019t a word that you should utter so lightly.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re insulting me again?\u201dFor some reason, Cyan felt deeply insulted every time Eugene spoke. Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Cyan lifted a hand to a pocket on his chest.\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Eugene said with a frown. \u201cA duel isn\u2019t something you recklessly jump into.\u201d\u2018That son of a bitch. Who does he think he is to keep telling me what to do?\u2019\u00a0Cyan thought as he scowled at Eugene and pulled out his handkerchief.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, then just admit it! Don\u2019t try to run away from our duel by spouting all these denials! Haven\u2019t your parents taught you what honor means?!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Eugene said, tilting his head in response to these accusatory words.While Eugen looked at him like he was stupid, Cyan rejoiced at the thought that Eugene had finally fallen for his provocation. So he held out the handkerchief and spread it wide open, inviting Eugene to take a close look.\u201cThis is really the last time I\u2019ll say this. Beg me for forgiveness, and then\u2014\u201d\u201cThrow it,\u201d Eugene said as he untied the sandbags hanging off his body. \u201cYou wanted to duel, so just throw it already.\u201d\u201c...huh?\u201d Cyan responded dumbly.\u201cI said, throw it.\u201dBang!First, the sandbags on his left arm fell to the ground. Cyan\u2019s expression froze and then stiffened as the impact sent a shockwave of dust rising into the air.\u201c...You\u2026\u201d\u201cThe handkerchief, are you going to throw it or not?\u201d Eugene prompted.Bang!Then the sandbags on his right arm also fell. Lastly, Eugene pulled off his chainmail vest and threw it behind him. The vest flew quite a ways before falling to the ground with a heavy racket. Cyan\u2019s jaw dropped open at this scene.\u201cUwah,\u201d Ciel had been enjoying the show as if she was just a bystander, but now, she also let out an exclamation at this sight.Eugene bent down and started taking off the sandbags tied to his legs.\u201c...You\u2026 You must have trained your mana\u2026!\u201d Cyan who, until this point, had been frozen with his mouth hanging yelped in outrage.Children of the collateral lines weren\u2019t allowed to train their mana until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. This was a long-standing Lionheart family tradition. Only the children of the main house could train their mana and wield real weapons from an early age.This tradition was now being trampled right in front of his eyes. This was no longer something that he could respond to with simple irritation and a tantrum.\u201cI haven\u2019t trained it though?\u201d Eugene replied with a confused expression.He wasn\u2019t lying. He could have started training his mana once he reached the crawling stage of infancy, but he hadn\u2019t.It was because he didn\u2019t want to land his father, Gerhard, in trouble for no reason; and also, since he had been reincarnated as a descendant of Vermouth, he wanted to use Vermouth\u2019s own training method.\u201cThat\u2019s obviously a lie\u2026! Without training your mana, how could you possibly be able to handle such weight?!\u201cIt\u2019s the result of the training I\u2019ve done since I turned seven.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve tried it out for yourself, so why keep accusing me of lying. If you\u2019re still suspicious of me, you can check it during our duel.\u201dEugen sat down and began untying the sandbags from the spear. Cyan was watching this happen with wide eyes when he felt his sister\u2019s eager gaze rest on him. He also felt a terrified gaze coming from Nina, who didn\u2019t seem to know what to do. The annex\u2019s other servants were also showing interest in the commotion from the gymnasium and had gathered around the windows into the room.Cyan was the first to bring up the duel. He was also the one who pulled out a handkerchief, pestered Eugene despite his protests, and finally questioned Eugene\u2019s honor. Considering all this, he couldn\u2019t back down after coming this far. On top of that, he needed to confirm the sin of a collateral descendant training their mana before the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.If it was confirmed that Eugene had trained his mana, then he was in for punishment. But if Cyan were to keep his mouth shut and back down at this point, then it was clear that his sister would make fun of him not just for a few days but for eternity. So before doing anything else, Cyan picked up a wooden sword that had fallen nearby. It was the wooden sword that Eugene had been swinging earlier.\u201c...I challenge you to a duel!\u201d Cyan cried out as he threw the handkerchief at Eugene.The fluttering handkerchief fell onto Eugene\u2019s shoulder. This happened just as Eugene was untying the last sandbag hanging from the spear.\u201cI accept,\u201d Eugene said, with a nod, as he rose to his feet.Cyan felt thrilled going into the first duel of his life. The moment he had thrown out his handkerchief, Cyan\u2019s heart had begun pounding with excitement. This arrogant fool was a sinner who had ignored family tradition. How should Cyan go about punishing him? In what manner should he teach this fool a lesson so that his younger sister could also admire his magnificence?His thoughts came to a screeching halt right at this point.Just as Eugene got to his feet, he thrust out his spear.Conscious of the fact that he was only holding a wooden sword in his right hand, Cyan had taken a few steps back to get some distance, but he still wasn\u2019t able to properly react to the movement of the spear.Bam!The tip of the spear slammed into Cyan\u2019s stomach.\u201cKuargh!\u201dAlong with this scream, Cyan was sent rolling across the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: The Lionheart (4)It was just a training spear, a wooden staff that didn\u2019t even have a spearhead attached. However, its tip had still been sharpened into a point, so once it was thrust correctly\u2026. Even if it couldn\u2019t pierce flesh, it would definitely hurt like a bitch.And if it was thrust cleanly into an unguarded abdomen?\u201cUwaagh!\u201dThis was how it would turn out. While rolling across the ground, Cyan sprayed vomit all over the place. The dumbstruck Ciel let out a scream and ran over to Cyan, while Nina just covered her mouth in shock.\u201cI\u2019ve won,\u201d Eugene said in a bored tone as he lowered his spear.Had it been an actual spear, Cyan would have died from the attack just now. Of course, this wasn\u2019t a real spear; but even so, since Cyan had been struck in a vital point and sent rolling across the ground, it was clearly Eugene\u2019s victory.\u201cNina, go get someone to drag this bastard away.\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026!\u201dEven as tears and snot were pouring down his face, Cyan couldn\u2019t stop retching. Ciel had approached him out of concern, but couldn\u2019t get any closer to her brother upon seeing his disgusting appearance. So instead, she turned and raised her head to glare at Eugene.\u201cCoward!\u201d Ciel accused Eugene.\u201cWho\u2019s a coward? From the moment that the handkerchief was thrown, the duel had already started,\u201d said Eugen.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. You\u2019re right, but\u2026! Even so, it was still a cowardly act.\u201d\u201cDoes everything seem like a beautiful and peaceful flower garden when seen through that head of yours? Since the duel had already started, there\u2019s nothing cowardly about what I did. And didn\u2019t your foolish brother end up like this because he just stood around trying to look cool after he threw the handkerchief?\u201dCiel was struck speechless by this fierce rebuttal. Part of it was because she didn\u2019t know what to say, but she was also confused by what he had said and thought he might have compared her to a beautiful and peaceful flower garden.\u201c...Did you just call me pretty?\u201d Ciel asked\u201cHas the heat gotten to her head?\u201d Eugene muttered to himself.\u201cIn any case, it was obviously a cowardly move. You didn\u2019t fight honorably in this duel,\u201d Ciel recalled her indignation.\u201cHah, it must be because you\u2019re twins, but you really resemble each other in the amazing way you twist logic to benefit yourselves,\u201d Eugene scoffed.\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0resemble my brother.\u201d\u201cReally, but I think your brains\u00a0are\u00a0similar? So what do you think an honorable duel should actually be like? Throw the handkerchief, count to three, and then we fight?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dChewing on her bottom lip, Ciel glanced at Cyan as she tried to think of a response. Having managed to cover his own body with his vomit while rolling across the ground, Cyan was busy sobbing. While she felt sorry for her brother\u2019s miserable appearance, dirty things were still dirty, so she refused to get any closer to him.\u201c...You could have lightened your blow a bit,\u201d Ciel mumbled.\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s already as light a blow as I can manage,\u201d Eugene replied.\u201cHave you really not trained your mana?\u201d Ciel suddenly asked with shining eyes.Eugene, who had started clearing up the sandbags littering the floor, glanced back up at Ciel with an annoyed expression on his face.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you leaving already?\u201d\u201cI asked you if you really haven\u2019t trained your mana.\u201d\u201cAnd I already told you that I haven\u2019t!\u201d\u201cLiar. How could you move while carrying such heavy weights if you haven\u2019t trained your mana? And then there\u2019s your attack. Even if my brother had let his guard down, it was still so fast that he couldn\u2019t react properly,\u201d as she said all this, her eyes that had been shining with curiosity narrowed in suspicion.At these words, Eugene froze while still in the midst of sorting out the sandbags.\u201cYou were actually able to see it?\u201d\u201cJust the littlest bit.\u201d\u201cEven so, it seems like your eyes aren\u2019t just for decoration.\u201d\u201cYou really do have a nasty mouth on you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s far from my first time hearing that.\u201dEveryone, except for Vermouth, had said something similar to him at one point or another.While Eugene was piling up the sandbags in one location, Ciel stared absentmindedly at Eugene\u2019s back. Although she couldn\u2019t clearly see the movement of his muscles, concealed as they were by his clothes, it did seem like he wasn\u2019t using any mana, only physical effort.As such, Ciel was finding him even harder to understand. Both Ciel and Cyan had also undergone physical training since they were young.\u2018But hasn\u2019t he only been training since he was seven?\u2019\u00a0Ciel thought deeply as she recalled what Eugene had said earlier.Meanwhile, Eugene was thinking,\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s quite strong for a thirteen-year-old kid.\u2019He had felt some resistance from the tip of his spear at the moment of impact. This was evidence that Cyan\u2019s body had been trained to an unbelievable extent for his age. On top of that, considering the force with which Cyan had flown backward, his mana had already been trained to the extent that it was instinctively able to respond during a crisis by redirecting some of the force away from the blow.And Cyan hadn\u2019t just stood there and received the strike. Instead, the moment the attack landed, Cyan had instinctively tried to jump backward. This meant that he, a kid with no practical fighting experience, had instinctively responded to escape imminent danger.\u2018That\u2019s great for a kid, but as a descendant of Vermouth, it\u2019s still garbage,\u2019\u00a0Eugene criticized harshly.Of course, Eugene didn\u2019t know how strong Vermouth was when he was thirteen. Hamel and Vermouth had already been in their twenties when the two had met for the first time. Still, he could at least make a rough guess.Cyan Lionheart, a brat who had received the teachings of the main family all throughout his childhood, was lacking in so many ways that it was hard to believe he really was Vermouth\u2019s descendant.\u2018Still, there is some potential.\u2019This must be because of the standard set by Vermouth\u2019s blood. If you looked at what he might become in the future, Cyan had still shown some pretty good potential. And Ciel as well. Although they hadn\u2019t faced each other personally, she seemed to have pretty keen eyes.\u201cYou\u2026. You dare\u2026. To me\u2026!\u201d Cyan had finally recovered enough to speak.While taking deep breaths, Cyan raised his head and looked up at Eugene. His eyes were still spinning, and it hurt whenever he moved, as if his abdomen really had been pierced right through. There was also a fishy and rotten taste in his mouth.\u201cHow\u2026. How cowardly\u2026!\u201d Cyan gasped.\u201cIt might be because you\u2019re twins, but you two really do end up saying the same things,\u201d Eugene snickered as he looked down on Cyan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to repeat myself. Ask your sister what I said when she tried to accuse me of the same thing.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026son of a bitch\u2026!\u201d\u201cOr else you can try and retrace your memories. You might have been spraying vomit everywhere as you were rolling in the dirt, but your ears should\u2019ve still been working, right?\u201dCyan couldn\u2019t say anything in return. Eugene was right. Even though he\u2019d been in intense pain and was about to lose his mind from the nausea, Cyan had heard Eugene\u2019s words.However, even if he had to admit that it hadn\u2019t been a cowardly act on Eugene\u2019s part, the thirteen-year-old Cyan absolutely refused to accept his defeat. In front of his sister and all the servants \u2014 to have been forced into such an ugly state!\u201cNow then, you need to start cleaning all this up,\u201d looking at Cyan\u2019s face, which had twisted in humiliation, Eugene continued to provoke him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who vomited all over the place. So if you promise to clean up this mess, I\u2019ll also go and clean the carriage. Then everything is nice and fair, right?\u201d\u201cYou dare\u2026. You dare\u2026!\u201d\u201cAlso, since you\u2019ve lost the duel, the honorable and polite thing to do would be to acknowledge your defeat by humbly admitting, \u2018I have lost.\u2019 Even though you were spouting honor this and honor that earlier\u2026you aren\u2019t really going to try and do something so disgraceful as to refuse to admit your defeat, are you?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say anything back. He didn\u2019t have any way to express his anger, his whole body hurt, and he had a terrible taste in his mouth; everything seemed to have gone wrong for Cyan. If only the pain was a little less severe, he could get up and demand another fight, but currently Cyan was physically unable to do this.The pent-up anger and sorrow building up within him poured out as tears. As his nose kept sniffling sadly, Cyan buried his head in his arms. Of course, Eugene didn\u2019t feel any compassion toward such a sight. After all, wasn\u2019t it this brat who had approached him with such a shitty attitude in the first place?However\u2026he was starting to think that screwing with this thirteen-year-old brat might not have been in his best interests.\u2018I should have just held it in. This isn\u2019t going to lead to something pointless and shitty, is it?\u2019Eugene was finally starting to have a few concerns about the consequences of doing this. Right from the start, he\u2019d been blatantly harassed and disrespected, but now that he had made the child of the main family fall into such a state\u2026. In fact, what he was most worried about was that someone might take issue with this incident and set their sights on his father out in the countryside.\u2018Just let them try it and see what happens.\u2019While Eugene was thinking about this and that, Cyan was desperately trying to hold back his tears. Although he didn\u2019t want to look even worse than he already was\u2026he still didn\u2019t want to admit defeat. He was in a fit of childish stubbornness.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dThe shout came from afar, but the speaker quickly closed the distance. The man who arrived at the gymnasium was of strapping height and was dressed in a uniform. From far behind him, Nina could be seen chasing after him, out of breath and holding her skirt up with both hands.\u201cThis\u2026what on earth is this?\u201dFrom the fact that he didn\u2019t have the Lionheart on his breast to how he called Cyan a young master, taken all together, the man had to be a knight in service to the main family.\u2018Wow,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought, his eyes lighting up as he observed the man\u2019s movements.While Eugene couldn\u2019t tell how old the man was, he seemed much more skilled than Gordon, the knight who had been assigned to escort him here.\u201cHa-Hazard,\u201d Cyan burst into tears as he called out the man\u2019s name.\u201cI\u2026. I lost. I challenged that bastard\u2026to a duel\u2026but I lost\u2026.\u201d Cyan explained in between sobs.\u201cA duel\u2026.\u201dHazard eyed Eugene with a stiff expression. Then he lowered his body and picked up Cyan, covering his hands and uniform in Cyan\u2019s vomit. Ciel seemed disgusted by this sight and took a few steps back.\u201c...Pardon me for my late introduction. My name is Hazard, and I am in charge of tutoring Young Master Cyan.\u201dShifting Cyan into a more secure position, Hazard bowed his head in a nod.\u201cI heard part of the story from the maid, but I was in such a rush to get here that I didn\u2019t listen until the end. So\u2026what on earth happened here?\u201d\u201cI am Eugene Lionheart, from the Gidol province,\u201d Eugene introduced himself without bowing his head.\u201cGidol, you say\u2026. I believe that is where Lord Gerhard\u2019s estate lies.\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s my father. As for this situation, well\u2026 Cyan picked a fight with me. I tried not to argue with him, but\u2026.\u201d Eugene continued speaking while staring directly into Cyan\u2019s face. \u201cCyan insulted my father.\u201d\u201cWhen did I do that!\u201d Cyan protested.Eugene calmly explained, \u201cHe said that my father had failed to teach me what honor means, and he called me a coward to my face.\u201dAt these words, Cyan\u2019s face went red.\u201cHe also said that my body smells like cow dung,\u201d Eugene added.\u201c...It\u2019s the truth. Your body really does smell like cow dung\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd your mouth smells like vomit, so why don\u2019t you just shut it.\u201dEugene sharpened his eyes and glared at Cyan. Cyan unconsciously trembled at his fierce gaze. The place where Eugene had hit him for critical damage, his solar plexus, was still throbbing in pain.\u201c...so that\u2019s why you two dueled?\u201d Hazard asked.\u201cCyan didn\u2019t just insult me; he insulted my father. Sir Hazard, was there any reason why I shouldn\u2019t have accepted the duel?\u201d Eugen posed a question in return.Sir Hazard felt a strong sense of incongruity at this question. In front of him stood a boy who was just about the same age as Cyan and Ciel, but Eugene hadn\u2019t allowed his emotions to color his words, as his tone was completely calm. Hazard, who had endured years of the twins\u2019 whining, couldn\u2019t tell if it was the boy in front of him who was abnormal or if it was the twins who were abnormal.\u201c...You had a good reason for it, but\u2026 it seems like you were a bit too heavy-handed,\u201d Hazard admonished Eugene.\u201cIsn\u2019t it an insult to the opponent to show mercy during a duel?\u201d Eugene defended himself.\u201c....\u201d\u201cSir Hazard, if my skills were clumsy, then I would be grateful for your advice, but I don\u2019t want to hear any advice on how I should use a lighter touch on my enemies.\u201d\u201c...I apologize for my presumptuous remark,\u201d Hazard bowed his head once more.Cyan, who was still being carried by Hazard, shouted with his face twisting into a scowl, \u201cHazard! This bastard, he\u2019s trained his mana. Even though he\u2019s a collateral descendant! He\u2019s trained his mana without ever attending the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to shut your mouth?\u201d Eugene said as he glared at Cyan, his head tilted at a dangerous angle.Once again, Cyan fell silent and lowered his gaze.\u201c...Young Master,\u201d Hazard gave a long sigh and shook his head. \u201cMaster Eugene has not trained his mana.\u201d\u201cHazard! Even you\u2019re lying to me?!\u201d\u201cWhat reasons could I possibly have for lying to Master Cyan\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026! How could he beat me without training his mana! And\u2026 and those! Those sandbags! He moved while he had those sandbags hanging from his body\u2026.\u201d\u201cI cannot feel any mana coming from Master Eugene,\u201d Hazard said as he glanced at the sandbags piled behind him.Just from a glance, they definitely seemed heavy. So Eugene was able to move with all of that hanging from his body? Hazard was finding it difficult to imagine such a sight.However, no matter how many times Hazard examined him, Eugene did not give off any traces of mana.\u201cA lie\u2026 It has to be a lie,\u201d Cyan mumbled.\u201cMaster Cyan. For now\u2026 we should take a look at your injuries,\u201d while coaxing the boy, Hazard glanced over at Eugene.\u201cI stabbed him in the solar plexus with a spear,\u201d Eugene explained helpfully.\u201c...and where else?\u201d\u201cThere was only a single blow.\u201dA single blow\u2026? Hazard let slip a low groan as Cyan bit his lips in embarrassment.\u201c...If that\u2019s the case\u2026 Master Eugene, may we meet again.\u201dUnable to say anything further, Hazard bowed his head politely. Nina, who had still been trying to catch up to him, arrived at the gymnasium just at that moment. She hesitated, unsure what to do, and eventually just ducked her head.\u201cM-my apologies,\u201d Nina stammered.\u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d Eugene asked as he watched Hazard leave.He had a grin on his face as he watched Cyan, who was still being carried, flop down onto Hazard\u2019s shoulders. While it was true that he still felt uncertain about what he had done, it had been fun helping to fix the bad habits of such a spoiled brat.\u201cSee you later,\u201d Ciel, who had been skipping along behind Hazard, turned to look back at Eugene with a smile.\u201cBye-bye,\u201d Eugene returned the smile as he waved goodbye to Ciel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Ciel (1)\u201c...So\u2026.\u201d Ancilla paused as she tried to calm her agitation.However, every time she saw her son, whose eyes had swollen from crying too much, she was in danger of losing control of her emotions. Ancilla patted her chest to stifle the feelings of frustration and picked up a fan to cool her face.\u201c...My son, Cyan, challenged a collateral descendant to a duel\u2026 and lost?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Hazard replied.Hazard made sure not to lift his bent head. He didn\u2019t want to increase the number of reprimands he would be receiving from this bad-tempered tigress by pointlessly raising his head.\u201cMoreover, did you say that kid hasn\u2019t trained his mana?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Ancilla declared, her reaction unknowingly mirroring Cyan\u2019s.She looked at her son in disbelief. Cyan just stood there, sniffling with downcast eyes.\u201cCome here.\u201d\u201c...Mother\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you to come here!\u201d Ancilla screeched loudly, unable to hold it in any longer.Cyan\u2019s shoulders trembled, along with the rest of his body. Even so, although with hesitant steps, he walked forward until he stood in front of Ancilla.Taking a deep breath, Ancilla sharply thrust out her hand.\u201cUgh!\u201d Cyan cried out.Her hand was pressing firmly against his solar plexus, even though the pain from earlier had yet to subside\u2026 Hazard glanced regretfully at Cyan before lowering his head once more.\u201cIn a single blow at that?\u201d Ancilla hissed.\u201cM-mother, it hurts\u2026!\u201d\u201cStay still!\u201dJust as he was about to step backward, Cyan\u2019s body immediately stiffened at the order. Ancilla used all her strength and repeatedly pressed on his solar plexus without any hesitation. Each time she did so, Cyan was forced to clench his teeth to hold back a scream.Ciel was watching this scene with a sullen expression from her seat in the back of the room. She was almost bursting with a desire to say something, but, as young as she was, Ciel knew very well that there was nothing to be gained from opening her mouth here.\u201cHazard, are you willing to swear an oath that you saw correctly?\u201d Ancilla turned to Hazard.\u201c...\u201d Hazard hesitated.\u201cI asked if you were willing to swear an oath,\u201d Ancilla repeated herself. \u201cThat brat, has he truly not trained his mana?\u201d\u201cYes, I am willing to swear an oath on it,\u201d Hazard finally offered.Under no circumstances should an oath be sworn lightly. However, if he stayed silent now, something terrible would definitely be in store for him. Hazard was sure of it.\u201cThe son of Lord Gerhard, Master Eugene, has not trained his mana. Not even a single trace of mana can be sensed from his body.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dAncilla searched her memory for the name Gerhard. His name did not come to mind right away, signifying that she had already classified it as a name not worth remembering. This meant that\u2026 he definitely had to be the one from the Gidol province. She seemed to recall that Gerhard was the name of a certain insect who didn\u2019t even possess an official title and was buried away in the countryside. He was of a collateral line that had split off from the main family hundreds of years ago and, until now, not a single member of that household had ever made any impact.\u201cMy son\u2026\u201d Ancilla said as she pulled up Cyan\u2019s shirt.Cyan closed his eyes as his body shivered in fear.Ancilla continued, \u201cwas defeated in a single blow\u2026 by someone who hasn\u2019t even trained their mana.\u201dThe surface of his stomach was vividly colored in blacks and blues. Ancilla let out a snort at the sight of this deep bruising. She was also a scion of a martial family. Her father, Count Caines, held an important position in the empire\u2019s military.\u201cYes, this was definitely done in a single blow. Ciel, just how did your brother go about losing?\u201d Ancilla asked.\u201cM-mother. That\u2019s\u2014\u201d Cyan stammered.\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you,\u201d Ancilla shot her son a sharp look. Her eyes were so intimidating that it was hard to believe that she was looking at her own thirteen-year-old son.\u201c...The moment the duel began, Eugene thrust his spear,\u201d Ciel said with pursed lips. \u201cMy brother was startled and tried to fall back, but Eugene\u2019s spear was too fast for him to avoid.\u201d\u201cThe distance between the two?\u201d Ancilla questioned.\u201cIt was slightly large.\u201d\u201cAnd what was your brother doing at that moment?\u201d\u201cHe was trying to raise his sword.\u201dThis all happened only an hour ago, not long enough to make things difficult to recall. Each time Ciel answered one of Ancilla\u2019s questions, Cyan\u2019s body trembled with anxiety.\u201cTh\u2014\u201d Cyan was about to defend himself.However, Ancilla, who had finished processing the whole story, spat out, \u201cYou foolish boy!\u201d-Slap!Cyan\u2019s head twisted to the side. Cyan clenched his teeth and held back a groan, having predicted this would happen.\u201cSomeone who hasn\u2019t even trained their mana! A brat who\u2019s the same age as yourself\u2026! You allowed them to get the first hit?! You weren\u2019t even able to dodge properly! You let him close the distance on you! And when he struck you, you collapsed, spraying vomit everywhere?!\u201dAncilla punctuated each sharp scream with a slap to one of Cyan\u2019s cheeks. With each blow, Cyan\u2019s head spun from one side to the other. The hits weren\u2019t meant to hurt, as none of the slaps had any mana in them. However, it was excessive to inflict such corporal punishment onto a young child.\u201cRight in plain view\u2026 where anyone, even the lower classes, could plainly see! You dared to lose after asking for the duel first?! Do you\u00a0want\u00a0to see your mother hang herself out of shame?!\u201d\u201cS\u2026sorry\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, mother\u2026.\u201dHe could muffle his cries of pain, but he couldn\u2019t hold back his sobs. Streams of tears poured down from Cyan\u2019s eyes as he sniffled. However, Ancilla felt anger instead of sympathy in the face of her son\u2019s tears.\u201cDo you think you deserve to cry?\u201d Ancilla demanded.\u201cHic\u2026\u201d Cyan sobbed.\u201cWhy did you do such a pointless thing that will only make things harder for your mother?! Your father should be returning soon for the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to even look him in the eye\u2026! As for that bitch Tanis, how can I face her after this?!\u201dFor the sake of training, Gilead Lionheart, the patriarch of the main Lionheart line, had been away from the estate for three years.Under such circumstances, the authority of the head should normally rest in the hands of Tanis, the official first wife. However, during the family head\u2019s current absence, the authority had fallen not to the first wife, but instead to Ancilla.There was a simple reason for this. After giving birth to her child, Eward, Tanis\u2019 body had been rendered barren, unable to bear any more children. Gilead, who wanted to make ample preparations for the continuation of his line, couldn\u2019t be satisfied with just one son.This was why he had taken a second wife, Ancilla, who had given birth to twins.-If there are three, then it\u2019s enough.That was what Gilead said whenever it came up, but Ancilla could never agree with this. The reason why she, the daughter of Count Caines, had refused many good marriage offers and instead joined the Lionheart family through the shameful path of becoming a concubine, was that Ancilla was obsessed with the prestige of the Lionheart name.\u201cThey all\u2026 they all are going to laugh at me. Definitely,\u201d Ancilla muttered as she chewed her fingernails, already imagining Tanis\u2019 face when she learned of this.Cyan, who was consumed by terror in the face of his mother\u2019s frantic appearance, stuttered and tried to speak, \u201cI-I\u2019ll challenge him again. So that mother won\u2019t be shamed, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\u201cAgain?\u201d Ancilla asked, her voice rising sharply. \u201cWhy are you thinking of challenging him to another duel when you\u2019ve already been defeated once?! Don\u2019t do anything useless, and just stay out of trouble until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony begins!\u201d\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Cyan protested.Without letting him finish speaking, Ancilla shouted, \u201cHazard!\u201dHazard\u2019s head was still bowed low, and his shoulders trembled as he responded, \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d\u201cI wish I could just get rid of you for good,\u201d Ancilla said as her fists shook in rage. \u201cBut\u2026 I can\u2019t do that, even though you let something like this happen\u2026! Because you\u2026 are my husband\u2019s favored knight. That should mean that there are no problems with what you\u2019ve been teaching my son, right?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Hazard kept his silence.\u201cIf your teaching isn\u2019t the problem, then\u2026 my son is\u2026! Since he didn\u2019t learn well, he was defeated by that peasant brat.\u201d\u201c...My apologies.\"In such a situation, where he could neither affirm nor deny the accusation, and when keeping his mouth shut wasn\u2019t an option, offering an apology was the best Hazard could do.\u201c...Take Cyan and leave,\u201d Ancilla ordered.\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Cyan trailed off.Ancilla ignored his cry, \u201cGo and make him stronger, strong enough that he never tarnishes my reputation again.\u201dHazard nodded his head and backed away. Even though Cyan was in tears, the boy followed Ancilla\u2019s orders without question, leaving the room along with Hazard.\u201cCiel, you stay behind for a bit,\u201d Ancilla called out.Caught just as she was about to try and sneak out with the others, Ciel\u2019s face twisted as she replied, \u201c...Yes.\u201dShe quietly returned to her seat and waited patiently while taking peeks at Ancilla\u2019s expression.Ancilla finally began speaking, \u201c...That brat, you said that his name was Eugene, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you also challenge that brat to a duel?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t challenge him.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u201cBrother lost with a single blow. If we had fought, I wouldn\u2019t be able to win either,\u201d Ciel replied in a quiet mumble.Although she had decided to begin by answering honestly, she was still afraid that her mother might grow even angrier at such an answer.However, Ancilla didn\u2019t fly into a rage as she did before and instead said, \u201cYou did well.\u201dAlmost like she was a different person, she now stared at her daughter with calm eyes.\u201cIf even you had shown up here after being defeated\u2026 I truly would have hung myself out of shame,\u201d Ancilla confessed.\u201cPlease don\u2019t say such a thing, Mother,\u201d Ciel cried out.Of course, Ciel actually realized that her mother wasn\u2019t the type of person who would take her own life under any circumstances. However, she had learned from a young age that she could improve her mother\u2019s mood by acting so cutesy.\u201c...How is that boy, Eugene?\u201d Ancilla asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand what you\u2019re asking for, Mother,\u201d Ciel admitted.\u201cI\u2019m talking about his appearance and impression.\u201d\u201cHis appearance\u2026 um\u2026 I think he\u2019s better-looking than my brother. As for an impression, he\u2019s a bit strange\u2026.\u201d\u201cStrange? How so?\u201d\u201cWhen he was arguing with brother, he was very childish and mean, but when he was talking with Hazard, he seemed much older.\u201dAt these words, Ancilla was lost in thought for a few moments. Since the boy was only thirteen, she could understand him being childish and mean, but for him to seem like an adult when talking with Hazard?Ciel continued, \u201cHe\u2026 he kept saying something about honor. And he also said that showing mercy in a duel was an insult to the opponent. Because Eugene said that, Hazard actually apologized.\u201d\u201c...He apologized?\u201d\u201cYep. While saying that he had made a \u2018presumptuous remark.\u2019\u201dAs Ciel recalled that moment, she started smiling without even realizing it. She soon remembered that this wasn\u2019t a situation that called for amusement and immediately reverted her expression, but Ancilla was too distracted to point out Ciel\u2019s loss of control.\u2018...a \u2018presumptuous remark\u2019...?\u2019\u00a0Ancilla pondered.It seemed that later she would have to call for Hazard again and get the full story from him.With a slight nod, Ancilla asked, \u201cAre you angry that Eugene hit your brother?\u201d\u201c...Yes,\u201d Ciel said eventually.This was a lie. Although she didn\u2019t hate her brother, she had found the sight of him crying while still pretending arrogance to be pretty amusing.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t naively try to get revenge on your brother\u2019s behalf,\u201d Ancilla warned, though she was actually aware of her daughter\u2019s true feelings.Since the two of them were twins, Cyan and Ciel had been together ever since they were born. Ciel had revealed her character from an early age, habitually pulling pranks and making mischief even as she followed her brother everywhere. Ancilla knew that Ciel was a child who prioritized her own amusement over her affection for her brother.\u201c...For the time being, your brother will be busy receiving Hazard\u2019s guidance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll train with them,\u201d Ciel volunteered.\u201cOf course, you will. However, don\u2019t focus too much on that, and make friends with the child\u2026 Eugene.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a lot of friends,\u201d Ancilla evaded, her eyes growing cold.The brat had defeated her son and smeared her reputation. However, hearing that Eugene had defeated her son without training his mana had surprised her.\u201c...For now, that boy, Eugene, is still strong enough to beat your brother. As such, it would be better to get on his good side,\u201d Ancilla explained.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ciel asked in confusion.\u201cIt is.\u201dAncilla settled her simmering emotions. To be honest, she wanted to go along with her urges and cripple Eugene so that he would be unable to move for the rest of his life. However, she couldn\u2019t do that.Hundreds of years ago, there had been an intense struggle over who would inherit Lionheart\u2019s direct line. Somehow, peace was negotiated, but ever since then, murdering a relative had been considered a grave taboo among the Lionheart family. The reason that Gilead, the current head of the family, had said, \u2018If there are three, then it\u2019s enough,\u2019\u00a0in the first place was that he was afraid of pointlessly increasing the number of heirs to the main family, as it would only lead to siblings trying to kill each other for the sake of ambition.Ancilla herself did not want to risk breaking this taboo that had been passed down for hundreds of years, just for this matter.\u2018And if he is harmed, I\u2019m the one who will receive the most suspicion,\u2019\u00a0Ancilla reasoned.Although it was tradition that members of the direct line could openly oppress members of the collateral lines in the days prior to the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, there was still a \u2018line\u2019 that must be observed. For example, attaching a clumsy servant to be their personal attendant, assigning them an unused annex, and harassing them over trivial matters; no matter how much of a fuss these things kicked up, they still weren\u2019t crossing the \u2018line.\u2019However, if this line was crossed, the Guardians of the Family Commandments would intervene in the situation.Just imagining it caused Ancilla\u2019s body to tremble in horror. Ancilla didn\u2019t want to get involved with the Guardians, especially for such a disgraceful matter.\u201cUnderstood, mother,\u201d Ciel said, with a nod and a soft smile, after a few seconds of thought. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to get close to Eugene. That\u2019s all I need to do, right?\u201dShe had not the slightest of reservations about doing so. Ciel was instead feeling an intense curiosity about this inscrutable relative of hers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8.1: Ciel (2)Nothing had happened.\u201c...\u201dTruly nothing had happened. Although Eugene had expected some form of punishment to be imposed on him for leaving Cyan, a scion of the main family, in such a state\u2026. The annex was completely at peace, as if the duel with Cyan had never happened.Frankly, while nothing that could be called an actual incident had happened, it wasn\u2019t like there had been absolutely no changes. Following the duel, the looks from the annex\u2019s servants had changed. They were now cautious of Eugene\u2019s mood while also not being in any rush to approach him.They probably didn\u2019t want to get caught in the aftermath together with him.\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d Eugene asked as he looked at Nina.His first night at the annex was over, and it was now the following morning. When Eugene and Nina arrived at the first-floor dining hall, they had found that they were the only ones there. Even so, a large variety of dishes had been laid out on the dining table.\u201cMay I ask what you mean by that?\u201d Nina inquired.\u201cWith accompanying me,\u201d Eugene said as he roughly sliced off a piece of meat for himself.The chunks of meat were cut far too big for breakfast fare. The only thing that Eugene had actually requested among all these food items was the meat. If he didn\u2019t make sure to eat substantially despite exerting his body vigorously, both his stamina and, of course, his physical fitness would decrease.\u201c...Um\u2026\u201d Nina wasn\u2019t in a hurry to reply.While she hesitated, Eugene shoved the meat he had just sliced into his mouth with a knife.\u201c...It\u2019s not like I\u2019m unaware of the situation\u2026 but I can\u2019t do anything to help it. Therefore, while Master Eugene stays at this estate, I will continue to serve as Master Eugene\u2019s personal attendant.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to show any loyalty to a person who will be leaving after a month at most. After all, don\u2019t you have to keep working here once I\u2019m gone?\u201d\u201c...It\u2019s not all because of loyalty. This estate\u2019s head butler assigned me to be Master Eugene\u2019s personal attendant, and the one who ordered him to do that was probably the Second Lady.\u201dNina smiled bitterly and shook her head.\u201cIf I were to neglect my duties while trying to stay out of trouble, that would mean I was indirectly disobeying the Second Lady\u2019s orders. That\u2019s why, even more so, I should act according to the situation and continue serving Master Eugene.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got a good head on you,\u201d Eugene complimented with a grin, pushing his empty plate aside.He proceeded to grab a lamb shank that was as thick as his forearms.\u201cWhen you said that it wasn\u2019t all because of loyalty, doesn\u2019t that mean that you\u2019re at least slightly loyal to me?\u201d Eugene remarked.\u201c....Even if it is temporary, you are still my master,\u201d Nina said.\u201cThen I too have no choice but to act like a proper master. If something I do ends up causing you any grief, then don\u2019t keep it to yourself and instead just tell me right away.\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with the huh? You were unlucky enough to become my personal servant, and I was also a bit unfortunate to be assigned a maid like you. As such, we should at least try to keep the air clean between us.\u201d\u201cH-However\u2026.\u201d\u201cEnough. You shouldn\u2019t question any of my orders from now on and just follow them. Understand?\u201d\u201c...Yes.\u201d\u201cThen go and get me some damp towels,\u201d without another word, Eugene started tearing into the lamb shank with his teeth.Nina was momentarily stunned by this sight but nodded her head and began backing away.\u201c...I believe that towels alone might prove insufficient, so I will return after preparing a full basin instead,\u201d Nina said observantly.\u201cThat\u2019s just what I like to see, someone who can think for themself,\u201d Eugene said with a smile, even as he chewed on a mouthful of meat. \u201cOh, and since you\u2019re dropping by the kitchen, pass a message to the chef. Tell him to increase the proportion of meat to everything else during lunch and, instead of trying to pointlessly elevate the dishes with some fancy cooking, he should just make sure to serve more lean meat.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs she continued to politely withdraw from the room, Nina gave the table a glance. Did that mean he was really going to finish all that by himself?Of course, Eugene finished eating everything. Ever since his previous life, he\u2019d never been the picky sort and was able to enjoy eating all kinds of things.\u2018I\u2019ve even tried eating monsters and demons.\u2019After picking out a piece of meat stuck between his teeth, Eugene washed his hands in the basin. Then, while patting his stuffed stomach, he left the table. Nina followed behind Eugene at a brisk walk.\u201cHave you heard if anyone is arriving today?\u201d Eugene asked her.\u201cMy apologies, but no one has told me anything,\u201d Nina answered.\u201cThen go and find out. I\u2019ll be at the gymnasium if you need me.\u201d\u201cYes. However, please consider\u2026 you\u2019ve just finished eating. I\u2019m afraid that if you start exercising right away, your stomach may start to hurt\u2026.\u201d\u201cThanks for your concern, but it\u2019s unnecessary. My stomach doesn\u2019t hurt even if I start running right after a meal.\u201dNina had a normal body and found it impossible to comprehend such a physique. Even so, she quietly withdrew without asking any more questions.Eugene hadn\u2019t lied to her. Since he was young, his body had never once suffered any lingering illnesses. Even his palms, which had been torn open while swinging the spear yesterday, were now completely healed without a single scratch.\u2018This really is such an unfair body.\u2019Come to think of it, even in his previous life, Vermouth had hardly ever needed to use anything like healing magic or potions. Although it was rare for him to even be injured, his body would heal on its own on those very few occasions he was hurt.Thanks to this, Anise and Sienna\u2019s healing magic had been almost exclusively dedicated to healing Molon and Hamel.\u2014The reason why you keep getting hurt is that you always race ahead without thinking!\u2014Hey, that stupid bastard Molon was the one who charged ahead first!\u2014That guy does it because he\u2019s a fool. So why do you keep copying that fool? Are you stupid too?\u2014Then fuck, should I just let that bastard get beaten up by the monsters? Why are you getting mad at me for!?\u2014Sigh, let\u2019s just stop arguing. Take a look at Vermouth. Why can\u2019t you fight as carefully as he does without getting yourself hurt?\u2014If you want us to stop arguing, why do you keep saying shit like that?Every time he came back covered in wounds, Sienna had always torn into Hamel. Even though thirteen years had already passed since he was reincarnated\u2026 the memories of his previous life hadn\u2019t faded in the slightest, remaining as clear as ever.\u2018...A funeral was held for Vermouth after he died, but I don\u2019t know if the other three are still alive or not.\u2019The Wise Sienna, after serving the longest term as a Head Wizard of a Magic Tower in the entire history of the Magic Kingdom of Aroth, suddenly disappeared around two hundred years ago. Her whereabouts after this point were unknown.Even the Faithful Anise, revered as a saint by the Holy Empire of Yuras, withdrew from her work in the Central Temple during her later years and departed on a one-woman pilgrimage. Not even the Pope of the Holy Empire had managed to get her to divulge the destination of her pilgrimage.As for that foolish Molon, the first king of the Northern Ruhar Kingdom, that guy was fortunately still around, having been seen relatively recently. Though \u2018relatively recently,\u2019 in this case, meant a hundred years ago\u2026. After abdicating from the throne, he lived a leisurely life. He had last made an appearance about a hundred years ago on the anniversary of his kingdom\u2019s founding.\u2018No matter how much I think about it, I can\u2019t imagine that any of them would end up dying quietly, but\u2026.\u2019But such a thought was meaningless.Because Vermouth, the one who had seemed the most unlikely to die, had actually died more than two hundred years ago.As Eugene felt a bitter taste rising in his mouth, he shook his head to clear it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course, the one who had cleaned it all up was Nina.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201d Ciel was standing in the gymnasium. She smiled as she waved a hand at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come here after eating, right? I can still smell the meat.\u201d\u201cBut I brushed my teeth.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point if you only clean your mouth? The smell is coming from your entire body.\u201d\u201cNot the smell of cow dung?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something my brother said. I never said that your body smells of cow dung. Also, I wouldn\u2019t even know what cow dung smells like.\u201d\u201cWhat else could cow dung smell like? It\u2019s dung. If you don\u2019t know, you can get a whiff of your own poop.\u201d\u201cHow filthy.\u201d\u201cSo why were you waiting for me here?\u201dNothing at all had happened yesterday, but could she really have come here after only a day just to banter with him? Eugene narrowed his eyes and stared at Ciel.\u201cI came here to train with you,\u201d Ciel replied, giggling. \u201cI even wore my training uniform, see?\u201d\u201cIt looks cool,\u201d Eugene casually commented as he looked at the clothes Ciel was wearing.Her training uniform had the Lionheart embroidered on its left chest, declaring her descent from the direct line.\u2018And of course, there\u2019s no lion on the clothes they gave me to wear,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought before saying, \u201cDid you just leave your brother alone somewhere to come here?\u201d\u201cMy brother is training with Hazard. Did you know? Yesterday, my mother became furious because of you. She slapped my brother more than ten times.\u201d\u201cShe really hit him?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dEugene blinked his eyes at this news, and he\u2019d been so sure that the boy had grown up without experiencing any tough love.\u201cBut why hasn\u2019t she tried to slap me?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cWhy would my mother slap you?\u201d Ciel seemed confused.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that she hit your brother because I made her angry?\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026 That\u2019s right, but my mother is angry because my brother challenged you to a duel, and then you just happened to defeat him.\u201d\u201cNo, but\u2026 in the end, it\u2019s because of\u00a0me\u00a0that she got angry, right?\u201d\u201cYou could say that.\u201dNo matter how precocious, a child is still a child; Eugene now deeply understood this fact.\u201c...Does your mother also know that you\u2019ve come here?\u201d Eugene changed the subject.\u201cShe knows. My mother said that I should try to get closer to you,\u201d Ciel confessed without hesitation.\u2018Why would she say such crap about trying to get closer when I\u2019m the one who made her so mad that she actually slapped that brat in the face?\u2019\u00a0Eugene barely stifled a shout before it could leave his mouth.After all, how could such a young child like Ciel know what the Second Lady of the main family was really up to?\u201c...Is that right,\u201d Eugen finally acknowledged.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say yesterday that we can be pals since we\u2019re the same age?\u201d Ciel brought up Eugene\u2019s words from the previous day.\u201cBut your brother said that just because we\u2019re the same age, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re friends.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just what my brother said. It\u2019s not like I agreed with him. So, don\u2019t you want to be friends with me?\u201d\u201c...Fine, let\u2019s be friends. Well then, friend, since I\u2019m going to be training, why don\u2019t you go and play over there instead of bothering me?\u201d\u201cWill you play with me?\u201d\u201cNooo, I\u2019ll be training.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll train as well.\u201d\u2018Let\u2019s just give up and ignore her. I should have done that from the start,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with a click of his tongue as he headed for the gymnasium storeroom in the corner of the hall.\u201cYou swung a spear yesterday. Will you be swinging a spear again today?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThen what? A knife?\u201d\u201cFor starters, I\u2019m going to work up a sweat.\u201dEugene slammed the door to the storeroom open. The inside of the storeroom, which had been covered in piles of dust just yesterday, had been thoroughly cleaned overnight. It was obvious who had done it. It looked like Nina had spent the entire night cleaning.\u201cThat\u2019s just what I like to see,\u201d Eugene repeated with a mutter as he entered the storeroom.Not only had all the dust been swept away, but everything had also been organized and cleaned. That went especially for the sandbags, as their surfaces were smoother and they looked heavier than yesterday. In addition, it seemed that their leather had been polished and even the sand inside had been refilled.\u2018...Still, there isn't that much in here to begin with, so there\u2019s nothing that really catches my eye.\u2019For some reason, he was getting an urge to do some ax-work today. Even though there weren't any axes here. Eventually, Eugene left the storeroom, only carrying a heap of sandbags.\u201cWhat about your weapon?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cI\u2019m going to be working on my body instead,\u201d Eugene explained.Eugene sat down on the floor and began tying sandbags to his limbs. Ciel looked at him for a moment before heading to the storeroom and returning with some sandbags as well.\u201cI want to do it with you,\u201d Ciel said.\u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019ll be boring just watching you.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you like.\u201dEugene stood up, his body covered with hanging sandbags. Then he suddenly started running around the gymnasium\u2019s interior.\u2018...it\u2019s heavy,\u2019\u00a0Ciel thought as she staggered to her feet.The mana she generated at the core of her body began circulating throughout her body, boosting her strength in the process. Ciel was only able to move her body in the way she wanted to after doing this.\u2018So how can he run like that using just his body?\u2019Ciel\u2019s disbelieving eyes followed Eugene around the room. Eugene had just started running but was already finishing one lap of the gymnasium even as he breathed deeply. Ciel stayed where she was for a few moments, waiting for Eugene to return so that they could run together.\u201cHave you really not trained your mana?\u201d Ciel felt she had to ask.\u201cI\u2019ve told you already that I haven\u2019t. Stop talking to me.\u201d\u201cHow amazing\u2026 How can you run with all that on you when you haven\u2019t trained your mana?\u201d\u201cStop. Talking. To. Me,\u201d Eugene snapped at her with an angry glare.In response to this, Ciel stuck out her tongue at him once and then proceeded to stay silent.* * *Nina returned from the main house, having followed Eugene\u2019s orders. She had secretly prepared herself to receive bitter criticism from the other servants of the estate, but surprisingly they hadn\u2019t treated Nina harshly.\u2014Did Master Eugene tell you to ask this?\u2014Yes.\u2014Understood. Today, once noon has passed\u2026.Although they showed some signs of wariness, they still politely answered all of her questions. While feeling puzzled by this fact, Nina headed over to the annex\u2019s gymnasium.\u201c...Miss Ciel?\u201d Nina asked, her jaw dropping at the sight in front of her.\u201cOh, hey servant,\u201d Ciel casually greeted her.\u201cHer name is Nina,\u201d Eugene informed Ciel.Ciel corrected herself, \u201cHey, Nina,\u201dCiel smiled as she balanced on top of a rocking body. She was currently sitting on Eugene\u2019s back while holding an armful of sandbags.\u201cG-Good day Miss\u2026.\u201dNina belatedly bowed her head. But even as she did so, she secretly peeked upwards to look at what Eugene was doing. As sweat dripped from his body like rain, he was intensely focused on doing push-ups.\u201c...What number are you at now?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cNinety-Eight, Ninety-Nine, One Hundred,\u201d Eugene grunted. \u201cNow get off.\u201dBoom!Ciel threw the sandbags aside and got down from Eugene\u2019s back. Eugene then collapsed onto the floor, lying face-down as he caught his breath.Once he had stopped gasping, Eugene asked, \u201c...Did you find out?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Nina replied, nodding her head. \u201cSh-should I get you some water first?\u201d\u201cNo. Just tell me now,\u201d Eugene insisted, still lying on his front.\u201cMasters Deacon, Hansen, and Juris are expected to arrive sometime afternoon today,\u201d Nina responded quickly. \u201cAlso, Masters Gargith and Dezra will be arriving by warp gate at around dinnertime.\u201d\u201cAnd to think I was curious about what you were looking into,\u201d Ciel said with a giggle as she poked Eugene in the back. \u201cYou could have just asked me, so why didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI had already sent Nina to find out, so if I heard it from you first, that would mean I had sent Nina on a pointless errand,\u201d Eugene justified his decision.\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cAnd we were also in the middle of training,\u201d Eugene continued, ignoring her question.He was too lazy to argue with her. Eugene gathered up his splayed-out body and pulled himself into a sitting position.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that three people are arriving by carriage, and then two will be arriving by warp gates?\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cYes,\u201d said Nina.Starting with how they got here, the last two were receiving a marked difference in treatment. But even Eugene knew the reason for this. Those two were the scions of high-ranking families among the collateral lines.\u201cYou don\u2019t know who Gargith and Dezra are, do you?\u201d Ciel piped up.\u201cI know their names, but I\u2019ve never met them before,\u201d Eugene revealed.\u201cThose two are pretty strong for being collateral descendants.\u201d\u201cI know that their families are quite powerful. What about the other three?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know where they\u2019re coming from. They\u2019re similar to you in that way. Ah, but of course, you\u2019re much stronger.\u201dIt seems that those three also came from small families in the collateral lines.Setting those three aside, Eugene asked, \u201c...How about Gargith and Dezra? Have you met them before?\u201d\u201cThey came here for my brother and my tenth birthday party.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of people are they?\u201d\u201cGargith is no fun. He\u2019s a year older than me\u2026. Dezra is younger than me, but she isn\u2019t much fun either.\u201dBy them being no fun, did she mean that she wasn\u2019t able to tease them?Eugene took a moment to organize his thoughts,\u00a0\u2018Three from the direct line and six from the collateral lines, including me.\u2019Even though he\u2019d been told that everyone would be arriving by the fourth day at the very latest, it looked like everyone would be gathering earlier than he\u2019d expected.\u201cDo you know when the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is starting?\u201d he asked.\u201cSince it starts when we\u2019ve all gathered\u2026 maybe today?\u201d Ciel answered.\u201cProbably tomorrow. Because it\u2019s not like they would really start it right away. So, what form will this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony take?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Ciel said with a shake of her head.\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Eugene growled.\u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d Ciel pouted. \u201cIt\u2019s a tradition that the head of the family decides how the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony will be held. But because my father isn\u2019t here right now\u2026. Hmmm\u2026. But my mother said that he would be returning soon. Anyway, I really don\u2019t know.\u201dEugene couldn\u2019t believe her words completely. Since she was the direct descendant of the main family, shouldn\u2019t she at least have heard something?\u2018...Father said that during his time, twelve people competed in a tournament,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled.\u00a0\u2018And in the last Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, the participants were made to wander through a forest for ten days.\u2019Each time the form of the ceremony changed, but the essence remained the same. The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was meant to fairly judge the quality of the future generations who would inherit the name of Lionheart. But unfortunately, although that was what it was\u00a0meant\u00a0to be, life wasn\u2019t fair. In the end, the children of the main family, who had trained their mana since childhood, were the ones who excelled during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.Ever since Eugene had first heard about the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, he had thought that it was an odd tradition.As such, he had vowed to personally turn the tables on the main family during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u2018Vermouth, don\u2019t feel sorry for them once I\u2019m done messing with your descendants,\u2019\u00a0Eugene spoke in his head to Vermouth, who was probably already in heaven, as he pulled his stiff body up off the floor.\u00a0\u2018After all, it wasn\u2019t like I asked to be reincarnated as your descendant.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t share any sense of belonging with them, honestly speaking, they just didn\u2019t have anything worth his attention.First Deacon, who was eleven, then Hansen, who was fourteen, and finally Juris, who was ten\u2014these three children of minor collateral families arrived one after the other. As he absentmindedly exchanged greetings with them, in his head, he lumped these three together under one identity.\u2018They\u2019re the dropouts.\u2019In the first place, their attitudes lacked confidence, and they kept glancing around in a panic.He was especially skeptical of that guy named Hansen, who was one year older than Eugene. Hansen had chubby cheeks and an equally round body, but what Eugene really didn\u2019t like was the fact that he was pretending to be the leader of the current group of children just because he was the oldest. But he only kept up this attitude in front of Eugene and the other collateral descendants.Hansen, who had been arrogantly insisting that everyone call him big brother, immediately reverted to an obsequious attitude when he saw the Lionheart embroidered on Ciel\u2019s left chest.In fact, such an attitude wasn\u2019t particularly surprising. The collateral descendants from weak backgrounds had no choice but to be afraid of children from the direct line.\u201c...Who on earth is he?\u201dThat was why these three dropouts kept glancing at Eugene with confused eyes that betrayed their inability to find an answer to such a question.After the brief introductions, Eugene had returned to resume his training. It was an extension of the physical training that he\u2019d done earlier that morning.Eugene believed that all types of knowledge were bound to develop over time. That went for martial arts as well. So even if Eugene was one of the hero\u2019s companions three hundred years ago, it would be exceedingly arrogant of him to believe that the martial arts of \u2018Stupid Hamel\u2019 were indisputably superior to modern martial arts.However, no matter how advanced martial arts became, as long as the foundation built on physical training wasn\u2019t formed properly, then they couldn\u2019t be put to full use. Without any doubts, Eugene held full faith in this fact.So even if he could forgo training his mana, he couldn\u2019t neglect his physical training.\u2018Since I can\u2019t train my mana anyway, I actually need to focus on my physical training even more.\u2019Such a plan was one that indisputably screamed of ignorance and lack of any better options. But so what? Because of that damn tradition, the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, he was forbidden from training his mana in the first place.The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was designed so that only those of the direct line could really excel. Eugene\u2019s plan to turn the tables on the direct descendants during the ceremony was also, in part, a way to get back at Vermouth, who had allowed such a tradition to be passed.\u201cIsn\u2019t that hard?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cOf course it\u2019s hard,\u201d Eugene replied.Somewhere along the way, Ciel had taken a seat next to Eugene to watch him train. She had a lot of questions that she wanted to ask Eugene. Having been born to the direct line, Ciel and her brother had received various forms of training starting from their childhood. However, neither of the twins had ever seen such a barbarous and torturous training method as Eugene\u2019s.\u201cIt looks like someone has arrived,\u201d Eugene commented, shaking his sweat-drenched hair as he jumped up to his feet.The front gates, which could barely be made out in the far distance, were opening. Since it had drawn close to the time when the sun was slowly starting to set, Eugene assumed that the two collateral scions, who\u2019d been expected to arrive at around dinnertime, had instead arrived early.\u2018But isn\u2019t there too much of a commotion going on just for that?\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.The servants of the main house were running out and lining up in front of the mansion. Even the knights stationed in the rear of the mansion were running up and getting into formation.He had heard that the families of those two brats, Gargith and Dezra, were so prestigious that you could count the number of collateral families that held as much influence on just one hand. Still, it was puzzling to see all these servants running around hastily as if they had been unprepared to meet with them.\u201c...Ah!\u201d came the sound of realization.Ciel had also been feeling a similar sense of puzzlement, but as she stared at the gates with blinking eyes, she smiled brightly when she saw flags beginning to rise on the twin rows of flagpoles that lined the path to the entrance.\u201cIt looks like father\u2019s back!\u201d Ciel exclaimed in an excited voice.She jumped up from her seat and ran off towards the front gates without even saying goodbye to Eugene.\u201cM-Master Eugene,\u201d Nina called out as she approached Eugene while also in a fluster. \u201cIt looks like the master of the house has returned. We have to go out to meet him\u2014wait, no! We need to get you changed first.\u201d\u201cIt would look better to be there in such a sweaty state than to be the only one who was late,\u201d Eugene replied as he brushed the dirt off his body.Nina hesitated for a few moments before taking out a handkerchief from a breast pocket and wiping it down Eugene\u2019s arms and legs. Even with this, the intense odor of his sweat hadn\u2019t faded, so she even took out some perfume and sprayed it on Eugene.\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Eugene said.He finished by roughly patting down his unruly hair, which had become streaked with a mix of dirt and sweat. He hadn\u2019t taken too long in getting ready, but the servants of the annex and the dropouts from the collateral lines had already left for the front gates. In the end, Eugene and Nina were the very last to leave the annex, as they too headed to meet the new arrivals.\u2018Whoa\u2026.\u2019\u00a0Eugene said to himself, impressed at the sight.All the flags, embroidered with the Lionheart, were soaring proudly in the sky. There were easily over a hundred knights who had lined up along the path beneath the flags. The servants from the main house and the annex had also gathered in one location, lining up at the entrance to the mansion.The family members of the direct line were standing in front of the servants. Adjusting her outfit, Ciel was standing to the left of Ancilla, and on Ancilla\u2019s right stood Cyan, his face still pale.Although the real power over the household had been taken from her hands, Tanis stood a few steps ahead of Ancilla. Her higher position as the official first wife required her to stand in front of Ancilla during such a situation. However, even though she was about to meet her husband, who had returned after so many years, she had a relatively calm expression on her face.Eugene looked at the boy who was standing next to Tanis. Although he had a pretty handsome face, his eyes looked dull for someone his age, and his shoulders were slouched. This was Eward Lionheart, the eldest son of the main family and the first in the line of succession.Tanis\u2019s lips moved slightly as if she was saying something. This caused Eward\u2019s expression to stiffen, and then he straightened his back and threw back his shoulders.\u2018It looks like the children of the main family have all received their fair share of tough love. Though that might also be why their personalities are such a mess.\u2019 Eugene tutted in disapproval before turning his head away.\u201cPlease follow me this way,\u201d requested one of the main house\u2019s butlers, approaching the two late arrivals with his head bowed.The place where the children of the collateral lines were supposed to stand was to the side of the direct line\u2019s family members. Thanks to the moderate distance between the two groups, their difference in status had been made clear.Shiiing!The lines of knights drew their swords, all as one. Even though more than a hundred swords were being drawn at once, the sound wasn\u2019t scattered and instead registered as a single note. Then, holding the swords to their left chest with the blades raised high, the knights turned towards the gates.A man riding a huge black horse galloped in, leading two carriages behind him. There was no loud shouting or cheering. Instead, the knights welcomed their lord, who had returned after so many years, with a unified silence.\u2018So this is Gilead Lionheart.\u2019Eugene stared at the man with excited eyes. Although his face didn\u2019t resemble Vermouth\u2019s, the brilliant glow in Gilead\u2019s eyes was fairly striking.\u2018And the one following behind him should be his younger brother, Gion.\u2019The Patriarch of the Lionheart Family, Gilead, had two younger brothers. The second brother, Gilford, was already married but had yet to move out from the main estate. The third brother, Gion, had chosen not to marry and had instead followed Gilead on his training trip.\u201c...It would have been better if you had informed us before you arrived,\u201d Tanis chided Gilead as he rode through the gates.\u201cI, the Patriarch, am returning home, so what reason is there for me to need to inform you?\u201d Gilead replied as he got off his horse. \u201cEward, it\u2019s good to see that you\u2019ve grown quite a bit. Have your skills grown accordingly?\u201d\u201c...I have tried to live up to father\u2019s expectations\u2026.\u201d Eward trailed off as he avoided meeting his father\u2019s eyes.Gilead stared at his oldest son for a few moments before turning his head.\u201cAnd is this really Cyan and Ciel? I almost didn\u2019t recognize you. Children really do grow up quickly. It\u2019s so amazing.\u201d\u201cI missed you, father,\u201d Ciel replied with a wide smile.At that moment, Gilead smiled brightly and nodded his head in approval. He could smell the scent of dirt and sweat coming from the twins. It was a scent that couldn\u2019t be sensed from Eward.\u201cGilford, I heard that you now have a child. I\u2019m sorry that I couldn't be there to share that moment of celebration with you.\u201d\u201cBig brother, please don\u2019t say something like that,\u201d Gilford responded with his head bowed.Next to him, his wife, Neria, was cradling a soundly sleeping baby. Gilead stared at the baby for a few moments before looking away.His brilliant gaze wandered over the children from the collateral lines. The other children immediately straightened up, swallowing their fright. Eugene didn\u2019t care to follow their example. Gilead was just looking at them, so why act like their souls were about to leave their bodies?\u201c...There\u2019s no need to prepare anything special. Let\u2019s just go and enjoy a meal together,\u201d Gilead said, raising his voice so everyone could hear. \u201cThen we can discuss how the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is being held this year.\u201d* * *Everyone gathered around a long, rectangular dining room table. The children of the collateral lines began sitting down at one end of the table.The two carriages that had arrived with Gilead, had been carrying Dezra and Gargith. As if it was only the most natural thing to do, these two took the seats right at the end of the table, at the center of the other collateral descendants\u2019 seats.So Eugene took a seat next to Gargith.\u201c...?\u201d With a puzzled expression, Gargith scanned Eugene\u2019s face.It was an unsaid rule that everyone sat in their seats according to the order of seniority within the clan. So accordingly, the one who would usually be sitting next to Gargith was that fatty, Hansen. However, Hansen didn\u2019t express any dissatisfaction regarding this seating choice and instead sat down next to Eugene.When he had arrived at noon, Hansen had gotten a chance to observe Eugene\u2019s extremely barbaric training. He had also seen how Ciel, one of the main family\u2019s infamous devil twins, talked to Eugene in a friendly manner. Hansen really didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble with this mysterious relative of his.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Gargith and Dezra before, and we even traveled together on the way here, but as for the rest of you\u2026.\u201d Sitting across from the collateral descendants, at the head of the table, was the Lionheart Patriarch, Gilead. As he cleaned his hands with a wet towel, he looked closely at each of the children from the collateral lines before continuing, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you four are.\u201d\u201cI hail from Gidol province. Please call me Eugene. My father\u2019s name is Gerhard Lionheart,\u201d Eugene bowed his head slightly as he introduced himself.With him taking the lead, the other children from the collateral branches also introduced themselves. However, only Eugene was able to speak confidently. The other children\u2019s voices trembled as they stammered out their words. The fact that the Lionheart Patriarch was sitting right across from them had made these children nervous.\u201c...Hm.\u201dAfter hearing all their introductions, Gilead nodded deeply. Then, without saying another word, Gilead just rested his chin in his hands.There was total silence.The collateral descendants took their cue from the situation and tried to quieten the sound of their breathing. That went for Gargith and Dezra as well, but especially Dezra. Since she was sitting straight across from Gilead, she didn\u2019t know where to place her gaze, so she just kept nervously scratching her innocent thighs.\u2018So hungry,\u2019\u00a0Eugene grumbled to himself.Couldn\u2019t they have been called after the dinner preparations were already over? Eugene looked down at the sparse dinner table. Although a few pieces of bread and some tea had been set out, how was he supposed to make a meal out of that?\u2018And who\u2019s that bastard?\u2019A young, blonde man was sitting next to Eward. The man had arrived in a separate carriage from the ones carrying Dezra and Gargith. At first glance, he didn\u2019t appear to share any Lionheart ancestry. Eugene noticed that the one sitting right next to the man, Eward, didn\u2019t seem to recognize him either.\u201cFather,\u201d Ciel spoke up, breaking the silence.She smiled bashfully and looked up at Gilead to ask, \u201cIt\u2019s been three years since you left. Don\u2019t you have a present for me?\u201d\u201cIt seems like I forgot about that,\u201d Gilead replied with a smile.Like most fathers, Gilead favored his daughter. Moreover, Ciel was much better at playing cute than his eldest son.\u201cEh\u2026 But I really missed father every single day. Didn\u2019t you feel the same, father?\u201d\u201cOf course I did.\u201d\u201cLiar, you didn\u2019t even get me a present.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019ll give you a special gift once the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is over, so don\u2019t hold too much of a grudge against your poor father.\u201dDuring this conversation between the two, Eward firmly kept chewing his bottom lip. Cyan was also staying silent and keeping his gaze lowered, even though he usually would have been playing along with Ciel.However, the bruises from yesterday were still covering Cyan\u2019s abdomen. It was a constant reminder of his defeat. So Cyan kept quiet out of fear that his father would scold him for losing the duel.\u201cBut father, who is your guest?\u201d Ciel asked.After having met Eugene\u2019s gaze just once, Ciel had turned to look at the man sitting next to Eward. She could tell that Eugene was constantly eyeing the man, but her question wasn\u2019t just because of that. After all, Ciel was also curious about the identity of this unknown man.Currently, neither Ancilla nor Tanis, let alone Gilead\u2019s two brothers, were allowed to join them at this table.Only the Lionheart Patriarch, who would be administering the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, and the children, who would be attending the ceremony, were supposed to be sitting here. However, now an unknown stranger was seated along with them.\u201c...Hm. I was going to introduce him a bit later, but\u2026.\u201d Gilead hesitated.\u201cI don\u2019t mind introducing myself now,\u201d the man spoke up with a smile. \u201cAfter all, the food hasn\u2019t come out yet. These children should be finding this silence awkward, so it would be better to liven up the room with some conversation.\u201dGilead firmly agreed, \u201cDefinitely, I was just regretting having called this gathering early because I was in a hurry.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s not Master Gilead\u2019s fault. Anyone would feel nervous about meeting distant relatives for the first time,\u201d Lovellian comforted Gilead.The man turned to look at the children with a friendly smile. Eugene picked up a teacup so that he could drink while listening to the man\u2019s story. Since he was feeling so hungry, but was unable to do anything about it, he wanted to at least fill his mouth up with something.\u201cHello children, it\u2019s nice to meet you all. My name is Lovellian, and I am from Aroth\u2019s Red Tower of Magic.\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201d Dezra let out a startled sound.Lovellian. Several of the children tilted their heads as they seemed to recall having heard his name from somewhere.\u201cY-you\u2019re the Head Wizard of the Red Tower,\u201d Eward said as he turned to look at Lovellian with a shocked expression.\u201cGurk,\u201d Eugene gasped, accidentally inhaled some steaming hot tea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: Gilead(2)After having never gotten sick after gorging himself on meat every morning, was he really about to choke on some tea? His throat burning, Eugene coughed violently as he pounded on his chest.However, this revelation was something that he really couldn't help but be surprised by.The Magic Kingdom of Aroth had five Magic Towers\u2014the Red, Blue, Green, White, and Black Towers.Less than three hundred years ago, there was no such thing as a Black Magic Tower. However, it came into existence following the mysterious oath between the Hero and the Demon Kings, and hundreds of years had flown by since then.Even though the number of black magicians that Eugene had executed in his past life went far beyond a hundred, it was now seen as a respectable profession. Following the Oath between the Hero and the Demon Kings, the black magicians had also made their own special deal with the Hero, and in time, they amassed enough influence to erect their own Magic Tower in Aroth.In any case, unlike the Black Tower, the Red Tower had been in existence since three hundred years ago.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Lovellian asked as he looked at Eugene with alarm.\u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m fi- I mean, I\u2019m alright,\u201d Eugen coughed out.He had only accidentally inhaled some tea out of surprise. However, now that everyone was looking at him, he couldn\u2019t help but feel embarrassed. Eugene cleared his throat and grabbed a nearby napkin. However, before he could start cleaning up the mess he had left on the table, Lovellian tapped his finger, and the damp tablecloth was instantly dried clean.This was magic.\u201cIt looks like you were very surprised.\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026.\u201d Eugene lowered his outstretched hand as he pasted on an awkward smile. At times like these, being young, once again, proved to be an advantage.\u2018If he\u2019s from the Red Tower\u2026 that means he\u2019s Sienna\u2019s disciple.\u2019Though strictly speaking, Lovellian wasn\u2019t Sienna\u2019s immediate disciple. If Eugene recalled correctly, Sienna\u2019s immediate disciple should be Lovellian\u2019s master\u2019s master. But although they were far apart in terms of generations, both Lovellian and the Wise Sienna had served as the master of their respective Red and Green Towers.It was only logical that, three hundred years ago, Sienna had risen to become the youngest Head Wizard of the Green Magic Tower in all of Aroth\u2019s history. She was Great Vermouth\u2019s companion and an Archwizard who could slay both dragons and Demon Kings. Countless wizards had found their way to the Green Tower, hoping to become Sienna\u2019s disciple.On top of that, Sienna had accomplished many more feats during her time as Head Wizard. She had torn through all the common magic texts in Aroth, fixing mistakes, and proceeded to rewrite them all. Moreover, she held nothing back when teaching the disciples of other towers, and even her colleagues, the Head Wizards of the other towers, received her guidance.By the end of her tenure, the wizards who had been taught by Sienna all sat in senior positions in their respective towers. Her teachings had carried on to the present day, and two famed wizards who considered themselves disciples of Sienna had become the Head Wizards of the Red and Green Towers.\u2018His master\u2019s master\u2019s master\u2026.\u2019No matter how much he thought about it, it didn\u2019t seem likely that Lovellian had met Sienna in person. Still, Eugene hadn\u2019t expected that he would meet someone related to another old buddy of his here.\u2018If he\u2019s from the red tower\u2026 that means his specialty is summoning magic.\u2019Summoning magic was also one of Sienna\u2019s specialties. The house that the hero and his companions had stayed in during most of their adventures was also one of Sienna\u2019s summons.\u201c...You said that your name is Eugene, right?\u201d Gilead spoke up.Although he had been singled out, Eugene didn\u2019t seem too alarmed this time around, and he didn\u2019t choke on his tea either. Eugene simply turned to look at Gilead and nodded slightly.\u2018I was wondering when he\u2019d call on me.\u2019From the moment they had met in front of the mansion, Eugen had felt Gilead\u2019s subtle gaze rest on him.\u201cI heard quite the story from Tanis,\u201d Gilead said consideringly.At these words, Cyan started violently chewing on his bottom lip. However, Gilead raised his hand and gently patted Cyan on the shoulder in comfort.\u201cMy son\u2026 He insulted both you and your father,\u201d Gilead stated.\u201cYes, but there are no hard feelings left,\u201d Eugene said, sitting up straight in his seat. \u201cI was able to vent all of my feelings towards him during our duel.\u201dGilead pointed out, \u201cAnd you won the duel.\u201d\u201cEven if I had been defeated, I wouldn\u2019t have held a grudge. That would just mean I was too weak to protect my honor, and as such, I would be obliged to endure the insult,\u201d Eugene explained\u201cYou\u2019re much more mature than my son,\u201d Gilead said with a grin.Pat.With a final pat on Cyan\u2019s shoulder, Gilead resumed speaking, \u201cCyan.\u201d\u201c...Yes,\u201d Cyan meekly replied.\u201cI am not ashamed of your defeat. However, I am ashamed of you for avoiding meeting your father\u2019s gaze because of your shame in your defeat.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Ciel remained silent.\u201cI heard that the duel started because you insulted him. But, even though you lost the duel, you did not apologize to Eugene.\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cCyan. You bear the surname Lionheart. That means you are descended from the Great Vermouth. To live up to the blood that you both share, you have to be able to respect the honor of others as well as your own.\u201d\u2018But Vermouth, that bastard, never seemed to respect my honor.\u2019While thinking such a nonsensical thought, Eugene looked at Cyan\u2019s face. Because of how messed-up the twins\u2019 personalities were, he had thought that their father would also have the personality of a scumbag. But Gilead seemed to be someone who unexpectedly had his head on straight.\u2018They say that he\u2019s been away from home for three years.\u2019Three years is a long time for ten-year-old kids, about a third of their entire lives.\u201c...I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cyan admitted, his nose sniffling as tears shone in his eyes.He wasn\u2019t crying because he was sorry, but because he felt that apologizing was unfair. Even though Eugene realized this truth right away, he didn\u2019t point this out as he had never expected something like a sincere apology from Cyan in the first place.Gilead also felt his son\u2019s obvious reluctance. However, if he were to point it out here, their conversation would end up taking far too much time.Gilead changed the topic, \u201c...I\u2019m sorry to say this, but Eugene, I\u2019m not familiar with your father.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s only natural. Even I admit that my family is from deep in the countryside,\u201d Eugene conceded.\u201cDid you learn your skills from your father?\u201d\u201cHe taught me the basics, but the rest I learned through training by myself.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of training did you do?\u201d\u201cI just trained with wooden swords and spears\u2026 Due to the prohibitions set by the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, I could only use those training weapons after all.\u201d\u201cThat means you must not have had anyone who could teach you.\u201d\u201cAlthough we have a few knights at our estate as well, none of them were really good enough to qualify as my instructor.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dGilead was lost in thought for a few seconds. Cyan kept chewing his lips as he brooded, while Ciel\u2019s eyes were lit up like she was having fun. Eward was looking at Eugene with an absent-minded gaze.\u2018...He got into a duel with Cyan and won?\u2019\u2018Who was Gerhard again?\u2019As these thoughts flashed through their minds, Gargith and Dezra glanced at Eugene with astonished eyes. Beside them, the other children from the collateral branches were also looking at Eugene in shock.\u201c...It seems that this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony will be fun,\u201d Gilead finally broke his silence with a grin.\u201cI think so too,\u201d Lovellian who had been listening to their conversation with interest now nodded along with a smile on his face.The food started arriving from the kitchen. However, no one touched it as they were waiting on Gilead.\u201cI don\u2019t know if these dishes will suit your tastes, but please enjoy the meal.\u201d After this blessing, Gilead started eating.Following suit, the children also grabbed their cutlery. Then, as if he had been waiting for this, Eugene immediately sliced off a large chunk of meat for himself.Once the meal began, the atmosphere of the room relaxed a bit.\u201cEven though you ate all that for lunch, you\u2019re still hungry?\u201d Ciel asked Eugene.\u201cI may have eaten lunch, but I kept moving around afterward, so of course I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he replied.Giggling, Ciel moved some vegetables, like bell peppers and carrots, off of her plate and onto Eugene\u2019s.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then eat some of mine as well. I\u2019m not that hungry.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just doing this because you don\u2019t want to eat vegetables.\u201d\u201cNo way, I like vegetables,\u201d Ciel quickly excused herself, glancing up at Gilead\u2019s expression. \u201cIt\u2019s really because I\u2019m not that hungry.\u201dAfter everyone\u2019s dishes were just about empty, Gilead put down the glass of wine he had been drinking and started speaking, \u201cAs you may have already guessed, the reason we have arranged to hold dinner like this is to explain the contents of this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201dAt these words, the movements around the table began coming to a stop, one by one.\u201cIn this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, apart from the traditional goals, I also wanted to give all the participating family members a good opportunity to show what they can do,\u201d Gilead said as his eyes ran over the listeners.His gaze rested on Gargith, Dezra, and Eugene a lot longer than the others. Although the three people that Eugene had classed as \u2018the dropouts\u2019 definitely noticed this fact, they didn\u2019t feel any dissatisfaction from this. Deacon, Hansen, and Juris were well aware that they didn\u2019t possess the qualities needed to stand out during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.Gilead continued, \u201c...the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony takes place every ten years. The contents of the ceremony are decided by the Lionheart Patriarch. I was also the one who administered the last Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. As you may have heard before arriving here, the last Bloodline Continuation Ceremony had the twelve participating children wander around in the middle of the forest.\u201dGilead shook his head with a wry smile.\u201cOnly the children of collateral bloodlines participated in the last Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. However, in this year\u2019s ceremony\u2026 three of my own children will be participating. Although it might sound ridiculous coming from me, I believe that the tradition of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is far too discriminatory.\u201dGilead\u2019s three children all looked surprised at this admittance.\u201cThe Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is a tradition that favors the direct descendants. Collateral descendants are not allowed to wield real weapons or even train with their mana until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is over. Taking part in the ceremony under such conditions, wouldn\u2019t the results be obvious? The collateral descendants have never been able to defeat the direct descendants.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Everyone was listening silently.\u201cHowever it is impossible to get rid of a long-standing tradition all at once.\u201dThis rift had been dividing the direct line from the collateral lines for several hundred years.Recently, Gilead\u2019s brother, Gilford, had also been blessed with a child. When that child turned five, Gilford would be forced to leave the main estate and become the head of a new collateral branch.Although they were all descendants of the great Vermouth, only the Lionheart Clan\u2019s direct line could boast the true and direct bloodline. Therefore, the direct line could only be inherited by the Lionheart Patriarch\u2019s own children. That was how the legacy of the Lionheart estate had been passed down for generations.\u201cThose of the collateral lines, no matter how thin their bloodlines have become, don\u2019t they all still bear the name of Lionheart. The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony's main purpose has always been to confirm that those who inherit the name of Lionheart possess the same heroic qualities as the one they claim descent from, the Great Vermouth. Therefore, the concentration of the bloodline holds no importance.\u201d\u2018Vermouth,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought as he chewed on his meat,\u00a0\u2018your descendant seems like a better man than you were.\u2019\u201cWhat meaning is there in a competition where victory has already been decided? I want to confirm the heroic qualities of not just my own children but the rest of you who have inherited the name of Lionheart as well.\u201dGilead turned his head to the side.\u201cAs such, unlike with previous Bloodline Continuation Ceremonies, I\u2019ve decided to get some outside help for this year\u2019s ceremony.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Nice to meet you all, children,\u201d Lovellian smiled broadly. \u201cThe Patriarch\u2019s sermon was a bit too long-winded, wasn\u2019t it? I understand if you might be feeling a bit sleepy, but please rouse yourselves and pay attention now.\u201dGilead smiled sourly. Lovellian didn\u2019t pay him any attention and continued speaking.\u201cWe need to get started with preparations first before we\u2019ll know for sure, but the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony should begin in four days at the very latest. If you want to know what we\u2019ll be doing during that time, I plan to conjure a maze over there in that forest.\u201dLovellian raised his hands. Mana gathered between his palms like a mist before forming into the image of a giant maze hovering over the dinner table.\u201cAll of you will enter the maze through a different entrance and begin exploring. Various monsters will be wandering inside the maze, but\u2026 haha, there\u2019s no need to worry too much. None of you will be getting hurt or actually hurting anyone inside the maze.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ciel asked, tilting her head.\u201cWell, that\u2019s because everything inside will be an illusion created by magic. So whatever happens to you all inside the maze, it won\u2019t actually be real. However\u2026 it will still seem like an extremely realistic experience.\u201d Lovellian\u2019s smile widened. \u201cA monster you encounter inside the maze might even chop off your arm. So although your arm won\u2019t really be lost, inside the maze, you\u2019ll feel as if your arm really was cut off.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026,\u201d was the shared response.\u201cIsn\u2019t magic so amazing? If you have any interest in it, come visit me in Aroth. The great Vermouth was also an awesome wizard, you know.\u201dSo he was saying that, in addition to summoning magic, even advanced mental manipulation magic would be involved in this project.\u2018Well, you need to be able to do this much if you want to make it as the Head Wizard of a Tower.\u2019Eugene quietly listened to Lovellian\u2019s explanations.\u201cIn addition to the monsters, we will also be preparing all sorts of traps inside the maze. Of course, they also won\u2019t truly be dangerous.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Ciel cheerfully called out.Ciel was the only one giggling as she listened to Lovellian talk. The dropouts\u2019 expressions were instead filled with fear.\u201cOnce everyone enters the maze, there is only one simple thing that you all need to do. Head to the center of the maze to defeat the boss monster there.\u201d\u201cHow do we defeat it?\u201d someone asked.\u201cYou just need to kill it. Who here has hunted monsters?\u201d\u201cMe,\u201d this time, multiple voices spoke up.All three from the main family raised their hands. Of the collateral descendants, only Gargith, Dezra, and Eugene held their hands up. Eugene was about ten years old when he first killed an orc by beating it up with his wooden sword.\u201cThis will be similar to then. The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony will end when one of you nine participants reaches the center of the maze and defeats the evil boss monster.\u201d\u201cWill it be okay if we can\u2019t make it to the center of the maze?\u201d asked Hansen.\u201cOf course it is. If you\u2019re afraid of moving forward, then it\u2019s also fine to just stay where you are. However, you won\u2019t get a very good score by doing so\u2026.\u201d Lovellian responded kindly as he looked at Hansen and his chubby cheeks.\u201cIf I kill the boss monster\u2026.\u201d Eugene asked.\u2018What\u2019s with the \u2018boss\u2019 monster? No matter how young your audience is, isn\u2019t that name too childish?\u2019\u00a0Eugene shook his head as he thought this.Still, whether it\u2019s a boss or a commander, what\u2019s the point of killing that bastard?His first impulse was to just ask that out loud, so\u2026\u201c...do I get anything for it?\u201d He decided to follow his impulse and ask a straightforward question.\u201cI\u2019ll let you pick one item you desire from the main house\u2019s underground treasure vault.\u201dThe one who answered his question was Gilead.Eugene smiled brightly and nodded his head while exclaiming in childish delight, \u201cWow!\u201d\u2018What should I take, a sword, a spear, or a bow?\u2019Although the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony hadn\u2019t even started yet, Eugene was sure that he would be the first one to break through the labyrinth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony (1)\u201cIs it true?\u201dThe moment they arrived at the annex after leaving the main house, Gargith, who had been keeping his mouth shut so far, turned to ask Eugene a question. Then, as if she had also been waiting for this moment, Dezra turned to look at Eugene as well.\u201cWhat is?\u201d Eugene asked in return.\u201cYou, did you really duel with Cyan Lionheart\u2026 and win?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dGargith\u2019s eyes shook in surprise at this honest answer. He scanned Eugene from head to toe with a look of disbelief in his eyes.Gargith Lionheart, at fourteen, was a year older than Eugene. His family had only split off from the main family during the time of the previous Patriarch. Additionally, his family lived in the middle of a forest infested with monsters. Due to this, starting from a young age, Gargith would often play in the forest by crushing the heads of small monsters such as goblins. In other words, his family could be selected as one of the best among the collateral branches in terms of military might, a true martial family.That went for Dezra as well. Although her family had branched off from the main family several generations ago; since her grandfather\u2019s time, it had become a highly prestigious martial family whose members were known to enter the empire\u2019s military forces.As it turned out, the two of them had had a lot of contact with each other ever since they were young. Even though they shared the same family name, the degree of kinship between them was pretty far apart, and they were around the same age. Because of these factors and how close their families were, talk of them getting married in the future was often brought up as a joke.Naturally, their two families had also exchanged various opinions about this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Nothing much was expected from the other collateral descendants. So, in the end, it was predicted that Gargith and Dezra would be competing against the children from the direct line. Instead of pointlessly fighting against each other, the two had agreed to preserve their strength and join forces to try and obstruct the children from the main house.Thus they had headed to the main house, having received their parents\u2019 encouragement. However, upon their arrival, they found out that a bumpkin from a collateral line had appeared out of nowhere and dueled with Cyan Lionheart of the main family. He had even managed to defeat Cyan in a single blow to boot, catching the attention of the Lionheart Patriarch.\u2018Who is Gerhard anyway?\u2019\u00a0they wondered.These two couldn\u2019t even recognize who Eugene\u2019s father was. This was understandable, as there were a whole bunch of collateral families who all bore the name Lionheart. Among these Lionhearts, the only clan members whose names had become widely known were those closely related to the direct line and a prestigious few among the collateral lines.\u2018He wasn\u2019t at the birthday party three years ago either,\u2019\u00a0Gargith and Dezra exchanged intent looks as they communicated with each other.\u201cAre you done with your questions?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cUh\u2026 yes?\u201d\u201cThen I can go, right?\u201dEugene didn\u2019t wait for a reply. As he passed between the two, they turned to watch him leave with confused expressions. They were left wondering where he was going, and they saw him head for the nearby gymnasium instead of entering the annex.\u201cYou\u2019ve returned already?\u201dAmong all the annex\u2019s servants, Nina had emerged the fastest to greet them. As if she had been waiting for him in particular, she immediately handed Eugene a thick towel.\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go train, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Nina confirmed.\u201cI appreciate this,\u201d Eugene said with a grin and a nod to her.Although only a day had passed since they first met, Nina had already learned most of what she needed to know about Eugene. She just needed to plan as if her thirteen-year-old master had somehow been possessed by a ghost that had died because it wasn\u2019t able to train; before a meal, he needed to train to build up an appetite, and even after a meal, he also needed to train to help his digestion.\u201cWhen would you like to take your bath?\u201d Nina inquired.\u201cA couple of hours later.\u201d\u201cWill you be fine with cold water?\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s fine.\u201dNina trotted along behind Eugene. She had just recently finished her apprenticeship. So under the usual circumstances, Nina was supposed to take care of the annex\u2019s lowliest chores. However, the servants of the annex were wary of Eugene, so they didn\u2019t assign Nina even a single task. Thanks to this, Nina could focus entirely on adjusting her routine to Eugene\u2019s habits.\u2018Now, what are they up to?\u2019\u00a0he thought as he caught two voyeurs.Eugene had finished a full-body workout earlier that day, and since the night air was so refreshing, he had planned to swing his wooden sword a few times, but\u2026 Gargith and Dezra were now staring at him from a distance. Then, having reached some sort of conclusion, Gargith began striding up to him.\u201c...\u201d Eugene observed him wordlessly.Without any hesitation, Gargith pulled off his top and tossed it aside. His body showed an unbelievable level of muscle development for a fourteen-year-old. Not only that, his entire body was also covered in small scars.\u201c...\u201d Without saying a word, Eugene continued to stare at Gargith.Gargith proceeded to take a big gulp of air and flexed his chest, showing off his broad pectoral muscles and the twitching abs below.While putting on an air of arrogance, Gargith pounded his chest muscles and asked, \u201cWant a touch?\u201dEugene had just been wondering to himself,\u00a0\u2018What is that bastard up to?\u2019But as he stared at Gargith, Eugene realized that Gargith seemed to have fallen into some kind of stupid delusion that they were competing with their muscles.\u201cNo,\u201d Eugene replied without hesitation.With a disappointed expression, Gargith slowly deflated his pumped-up pecs. Then he also headed into the corner with the gymnasium\u2019s storeroom. After some time, Gargith emerged carrying a wooden sword.With an expression that was full of dissatisfaction, he said to Eugene, \u201cThe weapon selection in this storeroom is really too poor. It feels like it has less than a quarter of what a storeroom at my family\u2019s home has.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI mean, I graduated from this sort of ordinary wooden sword when I was about six years old. At home, I even have a huge greatsword that I custom ordered. Of course, since it\u2019s meant to be for training, I didn\u2019t get the edge sharpened, but since it has an iron core running through the center, it\u2019s extremely heavy.\u201d\u201cHow impressive.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you've also had a lot of training before coming here, but\u2026.\u201d Gargith glanced at Eugene\u2019s forearm with which he was holding his sword.It definitely couldn\u2019t compare to Gargith\u2019s own thick forearms, but Gargith could clearly tell that Eugene\u2019s arms had undergone a long period of training.\u201cWhat type of training do you usually do?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d replied Eugene with a question of his own.\u201cI heard that you defeated Cyan, right? Just how on earth did you train that enabled you to beat Cyan Lionheart, a child of the direct line?\u201d\u201cI just trained hard.\u201dIt was too annoying to explain, so, with this casual reply, Eugene resumed swinging his wooden sword. Each swing was a basic motion that rose and fell through the air. As Eugene silently repeated these movements, Gargith, who had been standing there stunned, also raised his wooden sword.Whoosh!The sound produced by Gargith\u2019s swing was so loud that it seemed absurd to think that it could have come from an ordinary wooden sword. It was a sound produced solely by pure muscle strength, without any assistance from mana.Gargith glanced at Eugene proudly, but Eugene didn\u2019t even spare him a single glance in return.\u201c...How many hours do you train in a day?\u201d Gargith finally asked when there was no response.\u201cApart from eating, going to the toilet, and sleeping, all my time goes to training,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cHow long do you sleep?\u201d\u201cAt least six hours.\u201d\u201cI only sleep five hours.\u201d\u201cHow impressive.\u201d\u201cThe truth is, I want to sleep even less, but my father told me that sleep is like medicine. He said that you need to sleep if you want your muscles to grow\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201d\u201cThe difference in size between my muscles and yours isn\u2019t just because I trained longer than you do. We actually have a revolutionary muscle growth supplement that we use in our family.\u201d\u201cHow impressive.\u201d\u201cWe made this drug with the help of a famous alchemist from Aroth\u2026 If someone hasn\u2019t accumulated any mana in their body, the drug promotes their muscle growth when taken alongside training. Any interest in trying it?\u201d\u201cNone.\u201d\u201cThere is a limit to the amount of muscle that can be developed with basic training. Usually, this kind of muscle growth supplement is favored by mercenaries, but the quality of their cheap supplements can\u2019t compare to our family\u2019s revolutionary drug.\u00a0Ours\u00a0doesn\u2019t come with any side effects.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cJust look at me. Although I might have the advantage of training an hour more than you do, your muscles still wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to mine regardless. And what about our difference in height?\u201dGargith definitely had reason to sound proud as he asked this question. Gargith was only one year older than Eugene, but he was already a head taller than Eugene. Even considering his still-youthful face, he didn\u2019t look like a fourteen-year-old.\u201cAs if there are no side effects. Where do you get off with your lies?\u201dThe person who shouted this in a sharp tone was Dezra, who had returned after changing her clothes. Her long hair was tied up in a ponytail, and it looked as if she was wearing an oversized training uniform.\u201cAbout that drug. Once you take it, you start growing facial hair,\u201d Dezra complained.\u201cSo what if it does that? It\u2019s natural for men to grow facial hair. I like the fact that I can grow a beard. Doesn\u2019t it make me look like an adult?\u201d Gargith said proudly.\u201cBut it grows on women as well, you fool!\u201dDezra glared at Gargith with narrowed eyes. Though she was only twelve, it might have been because they were childhood friends, but she spoke to him in a pretty rude manner.\u201cYou. I heard that you used a spear during your duel with Cyan. Why are you using a wooden sword now?\u201d Dezra asked.\u201cI can use both a spear and a sword,\u201d Eugene replied simply.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 You can use both interchangeably? And through self-study at that?\u201dIf it were anyone else who had claimed this, she would have given them a disbelieving look. However, Dezra didn\u2019t dare to do so and instead just stared at Eugene in assessment. After all, didn\u2019t they say he had defeated Cyan in one blow?\u201c...I am a spear specialist,\u201d Dezra finally admitted.\u201cIt suits you,\u201d said Eugene.Eugene wasn\u2019t lying. Dezra was tall for her age, and her limbs were especially on the long side.\u201cJust swinging your sword isn\u2019t any fun. So why don\u2019t you spar with me?\u201d Dezra said.\u201cFine.\u201dEugene nodded his head. He preferred Dezra, who had coolly asked for a spar, over Gargith, who kept saying this and that about his muscles. Moreover, he was curious about the skills of these children, who were considered elites among the collateral lines.\u201cYou should use a spear as well since I\u2019ll be using a spear,\u201d Dezra said.\u201cDo I really need to do that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cRather than your swordsmanship, I want to see your spearmanship.\u201dWithout waiting for a reply, Dezra raced off to the storeroom. Soon, she returned, carrying two long spears by her side.\u201cTake this,\u201d she said, thrusting one of the spears into his hands.The two children were soon standing across from each other, holding their spears at the ready. Gargith stood in the center, still topless.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Dezra asked Gargith.\u201cI thought I\u2019d serve as the judge,\u201d Gargith answered her.\u201cWhat kind of spar needs a judge?\u201d\u201cSpars should also be fair,\u201d as Gargith said this, he raised his hands into the air.Even though Eugene had no interest in seeing another man\u2019s fully exposed armpits\u2026\u2018This bastard. His actions keep reminding me of a certain fool.\u2019His size played a role in this as well. If his last name wasn\u2019t Lionheart, Eugene would have seriously suspected that Gargith was descended from Molon instead of Vermouth.\u201cYou may begin as soon as I call \u2018start,\u2019\u201d Gargith announced.\u201cJust hurry it up already, idiot,\u201d Dezra shouted.As commanded, Gargith dropped his raised arms with a quick leap backward.\u201cStart!\u201d he shouted.Although Eugene had ended his confrontation with Cyan in a single blow, he had no intention of doing the same thing this time, as he wanted to see Dezra\u2019s full range of skills.Instead of rushing in immediately, Dezra slowly moved in a few steps at a time, trying to find a gap in Eugene\u2019s defenses. Eugene held his spear in both hands and refused to move from the spot. However, the spearhead alone showed slight signs of motion as it traced Dezra\u2019s movements.\u2018...Ugh\u2026\u2019Dezra\u2019s eyes twitched in frustration. Although she was pretty confident in her spearmanship, at the moment, she really wanted to question if she was genuinely holding a spear in her hands or just a harmless branch.\u2018There are no gaps\u2026.\u2019She had made all sorts of movements and feints, but she still couldn\u2019t see any cracks in Eugene\u2019s defenses. With a spear in her hands, she should have been able to see something by now, but\u2026. Dezra chewed her bottom lip in worry. If she kept waiting for an opening, she would end up being unable to do anything. Convincing herself of this, Dezra boldly stepped forward.The distance between the two was shortened in an instant. Just the slightest bit slower than her first step forward, her spear shot straight out.Clack!A slight movement from Eugene\u2019s spearhead sent Dezra\u2019s spear flying to the side. At that moment, Dezra rotated her body along with the movement of the spear. The tip of her spear thus swung around in a circle and once again sped towards Eugene. However, the result was the same as before.Clack!As her second attack was blown away, Dezra\u2019s eyes wavered.\u201cHaah\u2026!\u201dShe bit her lips and tensed her arms as she thrust with her spear \u2014 thrust forward, withdraw, and thrust forward once more. Mixed in between each motion of her spear was the muffled sound of their wooden weapons clashing. Each of her decisive and piercing thrusts was smoothly parried away by Eugene.\u2018She knows how to incorporate rotation, and she even knows how to make use of recoil and momentum,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.If you considered that she couldn\u2019t use mana, it was a pretty impressive performance. On top of that, her potential for future growth was limitless with how young she was. But that was all talk for the future. Right now, she still wasn\u2019t Eugene\u2019s opponent.The shaft of her spear suddenly slid through Dezra\u2019s hands. She purposefully lowered her grip on the length of her spear to extend the spear\u2019s attack range for a single blow.Whoosh!The attack slashed down on Eugene from above. With a smile, Eugene twisted his body to the side.After parrying for so long, this was the first time he had actually dodged. Dezra drew confidence from this fact. If she could just pull back for another attack\u2026 Although her thoughts had gone in this direction, reality didn\u2019t turn out the way Dezra had imagined.The moment her spear had gotten close to the ground, Eugene stepped on top of it. Then, at that same moment, he stabbed his spear at Dezra. She flinched as the spear flew towards her face, and she threw her head backward with a yelp.The spear stopped right before it could touch the tip of Dezra\u2019s nose. She pursed her lips and looked over the tip of his spear to see Eugene\u2019s grinning face.\u2018...Why is he so heavy\u2026?!\u2019Dezra had tried to extract her trapped spear with all her might, but no matter how much strength she used, the spear wouldn\u2019t budge. Even though he was only stepping on it with one foot\u2026. Holding back tears, Dezra let go of her spear.Rather than being unable to extract her spear, it was the fact that Eugene\u2019s body hadn\u2019t even shaken, despite her pulling with all the strength she had, that convinced Dezra of her defeat.Gargith, who had been standing by as a judge, put on a serious expression and said, \u201cEugene Lionheart is victorious.\u201dDezra, who was already feeling disappointed and sorrowful, furrowed her brows and glared at Gargith.\u201cShut up, you fat bastard!\u201d she yelled at Gargith.\u201cI\u2019m not fat. Fat only refers to someone like Hansen.\u201d\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201dGargith shook his head in disappointment, \u201cDezra. So you didn\u2019t learn anything from the Lionheart Patriarch\u2019s impressive speech earlier. You shouldn\u2019t consider your defeat shameful, and you should be able to respect the honor of your opponent.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d with this groan, Dezra staggered a few steps back, unable to say anything in her own defense.After exhaling a weary sigh, she turned and bowed her head towards Eugene, saying, \u201c...I\u2019ve lost.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Eugene replied with a happy grin. \u201cBut you\u2019re quite good with a spear.\u201d\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201dEven though he was being sincere, Dezra shouted at him angrily. It was only then that Eugene once again remembered that he was a kid who was about the same age as Dezra. So Eugene decided to cover for his mistake by acting his age instead.\u201cBut I\u2019m just better,\u201d Eugene smirked.\u201cThis son of a bitch\u2026!\u201d Dezra hissed from between gritted teeth.\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I won, isn\u2019t it? If it upsets you so much, you should have won instead.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dEugene snickered mockingly, \u201cKekeke, says the one who lost to me without even landing a hit.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having washed and changed into a fluffy set of pajamas, he\u2019d been about to go to sleep with the satisfied feeling that he\u2019d made full use of his day.\u201cYou disturbed someone who was about to go to sleep, just to say that?\u201d Eugene responded without getting up from his bed.\u201cI want to hear your thoughts on this,\u201d said Gargith stubbornly.Dezra, standing next to him, had an expression full of dissatisfaction. Although she was now convinced of Eugene\u2019s skills, his teasing after she hadn\u2019t even been able to hit him once during their spar still lingered in her ears.\u201cAnd how exactly should we combine our strengths? You were also there listening to the Patriarch explain how this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony will be held. Remember? This year we\u2019ll have to enter a labyrinth through separate entrances and try to break through to the center of the maze.\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t our goals still the same? The center of the labyrinth and the evil boss monster.\u201dA big guy like him was seriously using the words \u2018evil boss monster?\u2019 Eugene kept his amusement hidden.\u201cThe boss monster should be extremely strong,\u201d Gargith continued his argument.\u201cThat might be the case,\u201d Eugene half-heartedly agreed.\u201cThe Patriarch and the Head of the Read Tower said there would be many traps and monsters in the maze. However, if it\u2019s the three of us, we should still be able to make it through to the center of the maze.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to try to know for sure,\u201d Eugene cautioned.\u201cI have never lost to any monster,\u201d Gargith proudly threw back his shoulders, \u201cand besides, they said that the monsters in the labyrinth aren\u2019t going to be real and will instead be illusions created by magic. So there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why do you want to join forces to hunt the boss monster anyway?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for safety. Didn\u2019t they say that even though it\u2019s an illusion, getting struck will still hurt?\u201d\u201cBut you just said that you\u2019ve never lost to a monster.\u201d\u201cFor a monster to deserve to be called a boss monster, it has to be a strong one,\u201d Gargith replied with a confident expression. \u201cAs such, we\u2019ll need to combine our strengths. Since the twins from the direct line will be working together as well, we should also join forces.\u201d\u201cSo you want to meet up in the center and fight the boss monster together?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut I think I\u2019ll be able to kill it even if I\u2019m on my own,\u201d Eugene replied with a grin.\u201cHow annoying,\u201d Dezra muttered from between pursed lips.Meanwhile, Gargith nodded in agreement with Eugene\u2019s words.\u201cThen let\u2019s do this. If you try to fight it and don\u2019t manage to kill it, we can join you in the fight,\u201d Gargith offered.\u201cAnd if you\u2019re not there?\u201d\u201cYou can just run away and wait for us to get there.\u201d\u201cIs there a need to even go that far? You\u2019re already a pair, aren\u2019t you? So just leave me out of this and work together yourselves,\u201d Eugene exasperatedly argued.\u201cDepending on the circumstances, we might do just that,\u201d this time, it was Dezra who replied. \u201cHowever, three people are still stronger than two. You might be unpleasant, but\u2026 you\u2019re stronger than me. With your help, we\u2019ll definitely be able to kill the boss monster.\u201d\u201cBut why are you so invested in killing it?\u201d Eugene questioned.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to defeat the main family?\u201d Dezra asked with narrowed eyes. \u201cThough you\u2019ve already defeated Cyan in a duel, if you beat him in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony as well, the Patriarch will even give you a present.\u201d\u201cIn a Bloodline Continuation Ceremony where members from both the direct and collateral lines are participating, the collateral lines have never once been victorious,\u201d Gargith added. \u201cHowever, this time, we have a chance at winning. There\u2019s Dezra, me, and then there\u2019s you, who has even defeated Cyan.\u201d\u201cIf I defeat the boss monster by myself, that\u2019s still a win for the collateral lines, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cIf you\u2019re able to fight it alone and win, then I\u2019ll be thrilled. Isn\u2019t it more impressive for the monster to be defeated by a single person from the collateral lines instead of three collateral descendants?\u201d Gargith replied while nodding.Eugene had been reminded of the foolish Molon after seeing how big Gargith was, but after listening to him speak, he realized that Gargith actually knew how to use his head and had quite a broad-minded side to him.\u201cOk, I\u2019ve got it, so just go already. I\u2019m going to sleep,\u201d Eugene shooed them away with his hands while still lying down.Dezra looked extremely dissatisfied, but Gargith just nodded and started dragging Dezra out by her wrist.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep five hours today as well,\u201d Gargith called out as he left.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep for six hours,\u201d Eugene repeated.Even though Gargith knew how to use his head and was surprisingly broad-minded, it looked like he was still just an idiot.\u201cYou fool, do you really think it will make any difference to sleep a little less than him?\u201d Dezra asked scornfully.\u201cAfter all, the early bird gets the worm,\u201d Gargith said cheerfully.\u201cSo you plan on catching worms tomorrow morning?\u201d\u201cSince you\u2019re two years younger than me, it looks like you still don\u2019t know what the proverb means.\u201d\u201cI said get out!\u201d Eugene shouted as he threw a pillow at the two talkative intruders.* * *Ancilla had been plagued with worry all through the night.It was all because of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. She had expected it to be the usual sparring competition between the participating children, but suddenly, it had become a labyrinth challenge instead.\u2018On top of that, to have personally invited the Head Wizard of Aroth\u2019s Red Tower?\u2019The Wise Sienna had left an indelible mark on Aroth\u2019s magical community. As descendants of the Great Vermouth, Sienna\u2019s close companion, the Lionheart\u2019s main family had always had a close relationship with the Archwizards of Aroth.In particular, the current Head Wizard of the Red Tower, Lovellian, who had always claimed to be a follower of the Wise Sienna, was someone who had attended several events hosted by the main family.\u2018Although he hasn\u2019t even shown up at my childrens\u2019 birthdays even once.\u2019Ancilla chewed her lip. Of course, the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was a traditional Lionheart family event, but\u2026 no matter how much she thought about it, it didn\u2019t seem like he had come here just for that.In the back of her head, she could just see the main wife, Tanis, smiling.\u2018...There\u2019s a possibility that he\u2019s here to make Eward his disciple.\u2019It was a plausible idea. From a very young age, Eward had always preferred reading a book over moving his body. He held a particular interest in magic and had even been practicing various forms of magic for a while now. However, he had never accepted a master.One of the titles given to the Great Vermouth was that of \u2018Master-of-All.\u2019 Vermouth had received this title because he wasn\u2019t just good at martial arts, but was also supremely capable of using magic.However, following Vermouth, there hadn\u2019t been many among the Lionheart\u2019s main family who had decided to delve into magic. There was a simple reason for this. It was challenging to make any progress with magic.The competition to succeed the Lionheart\u2019s direct line would begin at an early age. So for those who chose to focus on learning magic at this age, by the time it had come for the successorship to be decided, they would be unlikely to have learned enough magic to gain an advantage in their bid to become the Lionheart Patriarch.\u2018Eward is fifteen\u2026 Although he\u2019s been learning magic since he was young\u2026 How much could he really have learned through self-study.\u2019Would Eward\u2019s skill really be able to make rapid progress just because the Head Wizard had shown up now to take him as a disciple? Ancilla pressed her hands to her cheeks to stop them from twitching with laughter.\u2018The truth is that they\u2019ve probably given up on making him the Patriarch. If Eward really becomes the disciple of the Head Wizard of the Red Magic Tower, then he has no choice but to leave the family estate. In the meantime, Cyan and Ciel will have a chance to grow up and\u2026.\u2019When the body is far away, the heart also grows distant. If Eward were to leave for Aroth, Ancilla was confident that she would be able to take complete control over the family estate.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, they were actually excellent. Good enough to live up to their surname of Lionheart.\u2018...The problem is that this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony\u2026.\u2019Ancilla wasn\u2019t sure whether or not to feel dissatisfied with the contents of this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Asking them to explore a labyrinth after entering through separate entrances? That would mean that Cyan and Ciel would be unable to help each other\u2026\u2018If it was just simple sparring\u2026. Either Cyan or Ciel, one of them would definitely have won\u2026.\u2019Although, she could no longer be quite so sure of this. Eugene, from the collateral lines, had completely defeated Cyan in their duel. This fact had complicated things for Ancilla. But in a labyrinth with many variables\u2026 the outcome of their duel might not be so easily repeated.Should she be satisfied because of that? Or should she be dissatisfied that this ceremony castrated the main family\u2019s advantage and placed all the participants on an equal level from the very start?\u2018...And I definitely cannot be caught interfering with the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u2019Having stressed about this problem all night, Ancilla let out a long sigh. She had thought about secretly persuading her husband to give her children an advantage, but she knew that her husband was someone who held strict expectations of his children. Pointlessly trying to push her luck like this would only lead to her receiving a disappointed look from her husband.Ancilla turned her head to the window and murmured, \u201c...I need to give them an advantage, but what\u2026.\u201dThere were only a few more days until the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. During this time, the participants would need to cram any information that might prove helpful in the labyrinth. As a result of this, instead of training with Hazard, Cyan and Ciel were planning to dig through any labyrinth-related books they had managed to find in the capital.Although she might have slapped Cyan\u2019s cheeks out of rage, Ancilla truly loved her children. As such, she couldn\u2019t allow her children to live with the label of a concubine\u2019s child for the rest of their lives. After she had given so much, just to get to this point\u2026\u2018All the insults and disgrace I have suffered have only brought me closer to the position that I crave.\u2019Cyan and Ciel were still young. The twins were able to act so recklessly and get their way within the main estate all because Ancilla had refused to pay any attention to the insults and instead stood proudly as the Second Madam of the direct Lionheart line, sheltering her children in the process.That was why her son\u2019s loss had hurt so much. Getting defeated by a collateral descendant after having inherited the legitimate bloodline as a member of the direct line\u2026\u2018...Still, I\u2019d prefer\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Ancilla sighed again, a complicated look on her face.\u00a0\u2018If that boy named Eugene were the first to break through the labyrinth.\u2019If that were to happen, it would lead to an unexpected stalemate. The entire main family would be forced to suffer a disgrace, but now the shame of having lost to Eugene would no longer be borne solely by Cyan and Ancilla. The Patriarch, Gilead, and the First Wife, Tanis, would also share in this embarrassment.On the other hand, Eugene breaking through the labyrinth could even alleviate the impact of his victory over Cyan. It would no longer mean that Cyan was lacking but that the collateral lines\u2019 Eugene was suspiciously exceptional.\u2018....Although the optimal outcome would be if Cyan and Ciel were the ones to break through the labyrinth.\u2019Ancilla released yet another sigh and got up from her seat.\u2018If they can\u2019t do that\u2026 It would be better if the one who breaks through the maze is Eugene, rather than Eward or any other kid.\u2019Of course, this was just a thought. Ancilla had no desire to actually cheer for Eugene. She was only thinking about the best possible results for herself and her children.* * *Four days later, the children staying at the annex received a message from the main family. Since the preparation to summon a labyrinth into the forest had finally been completed, the message announced that the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony would begin today and formally requested their presence at the starting location.According to the message, they were allowed to wear casual attire, but any other privately prepared items were forbidden. Then what about their weapons? Most of the children harbored such concerns, but they did what they were told and followed the knights into the forest.\u201cI\u2019ll be preparing the weapons for you,\u201d Lovellian explained when they arrived.Both Lovellian and Gilead had been waiting for them inside the forest. Behind them stood the towering entrance to a cave that looked both suspicious and artificial upon close glance.\u201cJust tell me what weapons you need. Although they won\u2019t last for the whole day, children, remember that you\u2019ll be fighting illusions, not real foes. You should be able to fight with them as long as your weapons retain their proper shapes, right children?\u201d Lovellian said all this with a friendly smile.Eugene hated being addressed with the word \u2018children\u2019 more than anything else. After all, wasn\u2019t that treating him as a kid? However, since his body was, in reality, that of a child, he couldn\u2019t openly express his dissatisfaction.\u201cIs there only one choice of weapon?\u201d Ciel questioned Lovellian with a bright smile.\u201cNot at all. I can prepare whatever you need,\u201d Lovellian promised.\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201dWith a smile for how cute Ciel\u2019s wide-eyed look of curiosity was, Lovellian raised both hands while looking at her.\u201cLike this,\u201d he said.Whoosh!Streams of soil rose from the ground and formed clumps between Lovellian\u2019s palms. In only moments, a long sword had been shaped from these clumps of dirt.\u201cWow!\u201d came a collective exclamation.Ciel caught the sword sent flying towards her with both hands. The weight was just right, and the feel of the grip wasn\u2019t bad either. As if curious about its quality, Ciel tried swinging the sword a few times.\u201cWhat should I do if it breaks?\u201d she asked.\u201cHaha. Little lady, you don\u2019t need to worry about that. This man in front of you is an amazing wizard. Not only was that labyrinth over there summoned by my magic, but the sword that you, little miss, are holding will never break while you\u2019re inside of the labyrinth.\u201cApart from swords, can you make animals as well?\u201d\u201cI can make dolls, and golems are also within my purview\u2026 but I can\u2019t make anything that\u2019s truly living.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then can I go inside with a golem you\u2019ve created?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite the cunning idea.\u201dLovellian burst out laughing and turned to look at Gilead. Gilead, who was smiling at his daughter\u2019s request, slowly shook his head.Gilead denied her request, \u201cWe can\u2019t have you doing that. Won\u2019t that just be the golem fighting instead of you?\u201d\u201cThen please make me a doll next time,\u201d Ciel begged with a wide smile.Eward\u2019s eyes were shining as he looked at the light covering Lovellian\u2019s hand.\u201cWhy can't you create anything living?\u201d he asked abruptly.Lovellian turned to look at Eward, who had a fascinated expression on his face, at this question.\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a taboo of magic,\u201d Lovellian explained.\u201cA taboo?\u201d\u201cNot only is true life difficult to make but there\u2019s also nothing good to be had from making it. Giving birth to a living creature is a beautiful miracle of existence, and not so easily replicated.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d Eward nodded his head as if he understood what Lovellian was trying to say.\u201cMister, I don\u2019t want this one. Could I get a sword that\u2019s a little longer and a lot thinner, please?\u201d Ciel interrupted their impromptu lesson.\u201cNow, now, please hold on a moment. While I can make a weapon for everyone individually, it will be difficult for me if I have to keep changing the sword bit by bit so that it looks exactly like how you envision it in your head, young lady.\u201dLovellian held a hand up to Ciel. Then a bright strand of light shot over to her from his hand.\u201cAs such, young lady, why don\u2019t I allow you to sculpt it yourself. That goes for the rest of you children as well. It isn\u2019t difficult. After all, I\u2019ll be casting the magic, so all everyone else needs to do is to clearly picture in their head what type of weapon that they want and then touch the light.\u201dStrands of light shot out and connected to each of the nine children. Eward\u2019s fingertips trembled as he looked at the light with ecstatic eyes.\u201cWhoah\u2026!\u201d Gargith exclaimed.He had envisioned the greatsword that he regularly used when he was back home. Miraculously, everything was just as he remembered; even the familiar weight had been replicated. While hanging the sword over his shoulder, he kept bursting out in admiration.Dezra also made a spear that was identical to the one she used most often during training. While lingering on the feel of the spear as she held it in her hands, she thrust the spear several times into thin air. Then she hung the spear across her back with a satisfied look on her face.Ciel and Cyan both made swords. Ciel\u2019s sword appeared long and thin; while Cyan\u2019s sword was the same length, it looked slightly heavier.Eward made an ordinary sword. His eyes that had been shining brilliantly as he stroked the light instantly sank into their usual dim state the moment that Eward was left holding a sword instead.Although the dropouts were also making their weapons, Eugene didn\u2019t pay any attention to them. Those guys had shown no motivation on their way in. They would probably give up on the challenge as soon as they had entered the labyrinth.Eugene made a sword that fit with the length of his arm and also created a small shield to be worn on his left forearm.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you make a spear? You\u2019re good with a spear, after all,\u201d Dezra asked petulantly.\u201cI\u2019m also good with a sword,\u201d Eugene replied back confidently.\u201cAnd what\u2019s with the shield?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also good with the shield.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say that you\u2019re good with everything?\u201d Dezra grumbled.Ciel stared at the two of them as they shared a conversation before approaching Eugene. \u201cIf we meet in the maze, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d\u201cAre you going to fight me?\u201d\u201cAre we allowed to fight?\u201d Eugene turned to Gilead and asked.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop you, since the purpose of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is competition,\u201d Gilead replied with a grin.At these words, Ciel puffed up her cheeks. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t absolutely need to fight,\u201d Ciel protested.Gilead nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Rather than a straight competition between the participants, in this Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, I\u2019ll be looking for the ability to make accurate judgments based on the situation and the spirit of cooperation. After all, aren\u2019t we all part of a family that shares the name Lionheart?\u201d\u201cHe says that we\u2019re family,\u201d Ciel said as she turned back to Eugene with a small smile. \u201cWhen is your birthday?\u201d\u201cSeptember.\u201d\u201cMine is in April. That means I\u2019m your big sister.\u201d\u201cWhat bu\u2014\u201d \u2014llshit are you spouting? Eugene was about to say that before remembering that Ciel\u2019s father, Gilead, was still here.\u201c...You have such a cunning tongue,\u201d Eugene complained.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Eugene replied with a cough and turned his head away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the labyrinth ends up causing you too much stress, the necklace will react, and I\u2019ll know to intervene.\u201dSo it was a safety device in case of emergencies.\u201cAlso, if you truly feel like you won\u2019t be able to make it to the center of the labyrinth, say \u2018help me\u2019 while tapping on the necklace\u2019s jewel. Then you\u2019ll be able to escape the labyrinth without any problems.\u201dHansen and the other dropouts nodded their heads in relief at these words. They were only here to do the bare minimum needed to satisfy the family tradition. They held no grand ambitions going into the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201cWell, then. Please start entering the labyrinth in an orderly manner.\u201dHaving said all that was needed to be said, Lovellian smiled broadly and moved aside, leaving the entrance to the cave free.\u201cWhile it might seem like you\u2019re all heading in together, from the moment you all enter the cave, everyone will be led down a different path. So don\u2019t get too flustered, and keep heading straight ahead, since there\u2019s only one path leading forward at the very beginning. From that point onwards, if you get the feeling that you can\u2019t go on, remember to tap the jewel.\u201dThe children began to walk into the cave. Eugene strode forward, keeping the shield he had strapped onto his left forearm at the ready.Before they stepped into the cave\u2019s entrance, Ciel, who was walking beside him, gave Eugene a broad smile and said, \u201cDo your best.\u201dGargith and Dezra silently glanced at Eugene.Eugene laughed at their gazes and said to Ciel, \u201cYou too.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Ciel nodded her head vigorously at the casual encouragement he had tossed her way.The nine children all entered the cave together. The moment everyone passed through the sole entrance to the cave, their surroundings disappeared and were replaced by darkness. Someone may have cried out in surprise, but the sound wasn\u2019t carried to the others.Without the slightest bit of panic, Eugene took in his surroundings. Although he knew that he had just been transported into the maze through summoning magic, he hadn\u2019t actually felt any sense of discomfort during the process. Though it may have been that Lovellian was just that good of a wizard, living up to his title as an Archwizard, it might also be because Eugene\u2019s still growing body couldn\u2019t detect the peculiar sense of incongruity that came from having magic cast on it.\u2018Because I haven\u2019t trained my mana yet,\u2019\u00a0Eugene reasoned.If that was the case, he could only rely on his body\u2019s other senses. Luckily, that was one of the areas that Eugene felt particularly confident in.Eugene took a long, slow breath. Although he wasn\u2019t particularly agitated in the first place, both his body and mind calmed down even further. Then he started focusing on his senses one by one. First sight, then hearing, smell, and finally touch\u2026 And what about taste? Taste wasn\u2019t a sense that saw much use when exploring a labyrinth. However, by slightly chewing the tip of his tongue, Eugene at least made the taste of blood linger in his mouth.Through this method, all his senses had been sharpened. Moreover, through his repeated long, slow exhalations, he had also heightened his awareness of his surroundings. The sensitive intuition aroused through this process could even be called his sixth sense.This method to heighten his awareness came from the life experience of Stupid Hamel.Labyrinth explorations? He had gone through so many in his past life that he had become almost bored with them. Most of the monsters who could burrow through the ground would make their lairs into mazes. Since even a mere ant could build their nest in such a fashion, goblins and the like were definitely capable of doing the same when digging their lairs.And that wasn\u2019t even mentioning the demons. In modern times, the Devildom of Helmuth was said to have become a place where it was even possible to go on a sightseeing tour as long as you spent enough money. The Helmuth that Hamel had wandered through was a place that shouldn't be allowed to exist in this world, an unending and unrelenting hellscape.How many times had he almost died in that place? Most of the skills he had once been confident in proved useless once in Helmuth. Even that foolish Molon had been scared out of his habit of charging forward recklessly. Sienna, who exalted herself as an Archwizard, couldn\u2019t even trust in her magic to keep her safe. Even Anise, who claimed that God would always take care of her, found herself calling more often on her companions, instead of her God, for help.Only Vermouth had remained unmoved.\u201c...\u201dEugene smiled bitterly. The hero Vermouth and his companions\u2026 That was the correct way to put it. Vermouth was always the center of the party. If it weren\u2019t for him, the rest of them would never have been able to make it into Helmuth. After all, when they first entered Helmuth, Hamel, Molon, Sienna, and Anise were all still young and inexperienced.However, they didn\u2019t stay that way. People grew through adversity. Even if it wasn\u2019t to the same extent as Vermouth, all of his companions had at one point believed in the delusion that they were the best in the world. So they were all able to show explosive growth once sufficiently challenged.After a certain point, despite still being in Helmuth, the companions began returning to their daily routine. Molon resumed charging ahead, Sienna regained trust in her magic, and Anise restored her faith in God.As for Hamel, he hated that he was weaker than Vermouth. He hated the way his body shook in fear. He began to suspect that he could never be as good as Vermouth. So he started pushing himself even more. Since he couldn\u2019t be like Vermouth, then he needed to grow stronger in his own way.Vermouth never felt fear.Hamel, on the other hand, did feel fear. So he needed to get used to the fear and overcome it.Vermouth was able to accomplish anything easily.Hamel never had it easy. Even if it seemed easy at first, he would always end up running into a wall one day. As such, he would need to break through that wall if he wanted to advance.And that went for labyrinths as well.Even when Vermouth encountered a labyrinth for the first time, he didn\u2019t panic, and after some time, he found the way through. Yet, despite everything, he was still a human, so he couldn\u2019t always choose the right path.Whenever Vermouth made a mistake or found the right path again, Hamel would always look for the reasons that led to Vermouth finding the right path and what mistakes led to him choosing the wrong path in the first place. Since Hamel didn\u2019t have an innate instinct for this like Vermouth did, he made up for his own shortcomings through this painstaking method.And all of this experience was retained inside Eugene\u2019s head.Eugene analyzed this labyrinth,\u00a0\u2018This is a labyrinth made for children to be able to conquer it. The labyrinth isn\u2019t even designed with any intent to kill. Since that\u2019s the case\u2026 It should be blatantly simple to get through.\u2019Despite the lack of lighting, Eugene hadn\u2019t halted his steps. As Lovellian had said at the start, there could only be one way forward. His surroundings were still dark\u2026 But after progressing a certain distance, the darkness slowly began to peel back.After a while, he could start to see the walls on either side of him. The distance between them was large enough that it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to swing a weapon. However, if you wanted to swing a spear to your heart\u2019s content, you would need to keep your own positioning in mind at all times.That was why Eugene hadn\u2019t chosen a spear. Instead, he had gone for a sword and a shield. Although basic, it was actually a universal combination that would allow him to respond to almost any situation.\u2018So the ceiling is closed in,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with an upward glance.This meant that he couldn\u2019t use the shortcut of climbing over the walls.Among the senses that he had purposefully heightened, Eugene focused on his sense of smell. With the taste of blood still lingering in his mouth, he was able to first focus on the scent of blood, and with that as a backdrop, he was able to find any foreign odors that stood out against it.Through this, he detected a slight oily scent. If he had been able to manipulate his mana, he would be able to sense it even more clearly. While feeling a little regret, Eugene pressed forward.After walking for a short while, a fork came up in the road ahead. Both of the split paths looked identical. The oily smell was coming from the path to the left. Even though it was a trap created from magic, it still gave off an oily scent. This meant it had been purposefully made easy to detect.However, Eugene still took the left path. He wanted to confirm that his judgment was correct. While pretending to walk as if he hadn\u2019t noticed anything, he was concentrating on the weight transmitted through the soles of his feet with each step.The first step, second step, third step, fourth step\u2026 and finally on the seventh step\u2026. As his foot touched the ground, it gave way slightly. And another count from here: one, two\u2026\u2018Three.\u2019Thrum!Arrows poured forth from the gaps in between the wall bricks. Without panicking, Eugene lifted his shield.Tangtangtang!The arrows couldn\u2019t pierce his shield and just bounced off. Then, without going another step further down the path, Eugene simply turned back.\u2018That was too easy,\u2019\u00a0Eugene grumbled.It must have been because they had set the difficulty for a child\u2019s level.Eugene grinned as he recalled something. Every time he had insisted on checking out the wrong path like this, Sienna would just about have a seizure. His past life\u2019s memories had brought back not just his adventuring experience but also the various fond recollections associated with it.\u201cHah.\u201dAs Eugene felt his insides twist in longing, he returned to the fork and took the path on the right.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While thinking that he didn\u2019t stand a chance in this competition anyway, he had decided not to waste any extra effort. His parents also hadn\u2019t held any expectations that their son would choose to do anything different.\u201cY-yes.\u201dHansen had been hanging back hesitantly as he waited for the Patriarch's response to his surrender, but he quickly bowed his head and left. Sometime after he had left, another call for rescue was heard. The ten-year-old Juris had actually made it into the labyrinth, which was at least a little better than Hansen. However, he was struck by an arrow at the first trap and had started begging for help with tears pouring from his eyes.Shortly after that, yet another call for rescue came in. It was from the eleven-year-old Deacon. Although he had endured being struck by an arrow, he was beaten by the slime he had encountered afterward. Slimes were monsters that were difficult to deal with when equipped only with bladed weapons. Deacon was swallowed up by the slime\u2019s gelatinous body and had started screaming for his life.Though less than an hour had passed, the nine had shrunk down to six. It might seem pathetic, but these results were as predicted. No one had expected to see anything special from those three dropouts.\u2018As for Gargith\u2026 He\u2019s clumsy, but he never stops moving forward,\u2019\u00a0Gilead judged objectively.Lovellian floated an image of the labyrinth\u2019s interior into the air. The image was divided into six screens to show each of the six children. Rather than avoiding the traps, Gargith had chosen to force his way through them. Even though he was struck by arrows or confronted with a monster, he would smash his way through with one swing of his greatsword, which was about as large as his torso.Gilead turned his attention to another competitor,\u00a0\u2018Dezra is agile, and she also has a good intuition\u2026.\u2019Whenever she triggered a trap, she would change paths immediately. She had even managed to dodge through several traps. She didn\u2019t try to always fight the monsters either. If there was another path available, she would take it, and she only swung her spear when she couldn\u2019t get away in time.\u2018Cyan is being overly cautious, but that\u2019s not so bad.\u2019Ancilla had obtained the notes of famous adventurers and the blueprints of several labyrinths and had used them to train the twins. Through this, the twins had learned the basic information and strategies for conquering labyrinths. All of which would help them break through this transparent and easily explored labyrinth.For example, when the labyrinth was enclosed on all sides, but a wind was being generated by magic, then following the direction of the wind could help you find your way. If they looked carefully, they could also find several other artificial clues that pointed to the right way. And even without that, as long as they used their judgment, it was possible to escape a trap during the moment that it activated.Cyan was capable of doing just that. However, due to being overly cautious, there was some awkwardness to his movements. His mind just wasn\u2019t flexible enough. His vision was narrowed because he was trying to rely solely on what he could recall from memory. That was why there were times when he fell into an easy-to-avoid trap.\u2018Ciel is sensible, and her thinking is flexible. However\u2026 there is a childish side to her.\u2019Ciel would activate a trap by throwing things, like her shoes. After doing that a few times, she would be free to head down the now trap-free path. If her path became blocked, she would just turn around, and if her path wasn\u2019t blocked, she would just keep going. Whenever she encountered a monster, she wouldn\u2019t fight them right away and would instead harass them as if she was playing with a new toy.As for Eward.\u201c...How is he?\u201d Gilead asked.\u201cHe seems to be very interested in the magic,\u201d Lovellian replied.Eward wasn\u2019t focussing on the sole task of breaking through the labyrinth. Instead, he examined each trap one by one, and he exclaimed in admiration every time he saw a monster. He was amazed at how life-like they seemed despite being made from an illusion. And after defeating a monster, instead of leaving immediately, he would examine the corpse for quite some time with shining eyes.His eyes, which were dull and dead whenever he slashed at the monsters with his sword, revived with a smile whenever they touched on magic.\u201c...He\u2019s been like that ever since he was young. He liked reading books better than training his body or his skills. He especially enjoyed whenever I read him a fairy tale about magic. Do you know? Eward, that child, he respects the Wise Sienna more than his own ancestor, the Great Vermouth,\u201d Gilead confessed.\u201cMaster Sienna is someone who deserves the respect of all wizards after all,\u201d Lovellian smiled proudly.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he said. When listening to \u2018The Adventures of the Hero Vermouth,\u2019 he liked Sienna's stories better than those about Vermouth. He said that it was because, whenever the party was in trouble, it was Sienna\u2019s magic that could come up with the most surprising solutions for their troubles.\u201dGilead paused before continuing to speak.\u201cThat fairy tale was also read to me when I was young. But, I\u2026 to tell you the truth, I actually preferred Hamel,\u201d Gilead admitted.\u201cAre you really talking about Stupid Hamel?\u201d Lovellian asked in surprise.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him getting into trouble, the fairy tale would have been very boring. Although he was ill-mannered, he was also good-hearted\u2026 He inspired me to slowly overcome my inferiority complex towards my ancestor Vermouth through my own hard work. Because even when everyone else was already following Vermouth\u2019s opinion, Hamel, all on his own, insisted that he had a different opinion.\u201d\u201cI actually hated Hamel when I was a kid.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s fair. Thanks to Hamel, the party was forced into several crises\u2026 However, Hamel always tried to take full responsibility for his actions in each crisis. That was why I couldn\u2019t possibly hate Hamel\u2026.\u201dGilead looked at the events occurring within the labyrinth with a smile.\u201c...Eward, that child, has wanted to learn magic ever since he was young. I even invited a magic teacher from the capital, just so that he could learn properly\u2026 But halfway through, he refused to learn any more magic,\u201d Gilead recalled.\u201cDo you know his reasons for that?\u201d Lovellian asked.\u201cReality forced him to give it up. For the sake of his mother\u2026 he decided that he needed to become the next Lionheart Patriarch. And because magic provides no advantage in the competition for succession, he had to turn away from it.\u201dThe competition over the succession would begin in earnest when all his children had become adults.\u201c...Well, that\u2019s understandable. Although magic offers countless possibilities, it is still a long and difficult road to get to that point,\u201d Lovellian offered.\u201cTruthfully, I would be happy if Eward chose to walk the path of wizardry,\u201d Gilead smiled sadly and turned towards Lovellian.\u201cThere is only one family among the collateral lines specializing in magic. As such, I\u2019ve tried to point Eward towards them a few times, but he has always refused. However\u2026 if he receives an offer to become the disciple of the Head Wizard of the Red Tower, he won\u2019t possibly be able to refuse. Because Eward still has a great passion for magic burning in his heart.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you the answer you want right away, \u201c Lovellian shook his head. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t just make anyone my disciple. Since I have a good relationship with you, Sir Gilead, I can take him with me, but\u2026 if he doesn\u2019t show me that he has the qualifications for it, I won\u2019t be making him my disciple.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. It also wasn\u2019t my intention to force you to take him in. However, I want to let that child have a chance to follow his dreams.\u201dGilead wasn\u2019t doing this for the sake of Cyan and Ciel\u2019s succession rights. It was just that seeing his eldest son rot, as Eward forced himself to do work that he hated, was painful for Gilead.To convince his first wife, Tanis, and give Eward a push on the back, he had even personally invited the Head Wizard of the Red Tower, Lovellian.\u201c...Well, I\u2019ll just have to take a closer look at Eward\u2019s qualifications later. Right now, it seems that Eward has already decided that he won\u2019t be using any magic as he attempts to break through the labyrinth,\u201d Lovellian muttered as he looked at the screen.\u201c...However\u2026what on earth is that kid, Eugene?\u201dEugene had already caused him to feel amazement several times in a row. But, by now, feelings of perplexed confusion were overtaking his sense of admiration.\u201c...I don\u2019t know either,\u201d Gilead muttered in a sincere tone.On his screen, Eugene was in the middle of tearing the illusion of a troll into pieces.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Weren\u2019t they too much of an opponent for children in their teens?Eugene had this thought from the moment he encountered them in the labyrinth. However, on second thought, these weren\u2019t even real trolls, just an illusion created by magic. It wasn\u2019t like the children could really get hurt either. Although they might feel pain, that too was just an illusion caused by magic.If the children were able to overcome their fear, the trolls weren\u2019t an impossible opponent for them. If they could just endure the pain, dig their heels in, and get in a good first blow, then they could even defeat these illusory trolls.\u2018Though they look just like the real thing.\u2019Eugene felt admiration as he looked the troll up and down. Even though he knew that it was an illusion, he still got the feeling of facing a real troll. Not only were its movements the real deal, but it also had the disgusting body odor that was characteristic of trolls.\u2018But it looks like Lovellian and Gilead still have a conscience.\u2019Considering its size, it didn\u2019t seem to be an adult troll. Instead, it appeared to be at an age where a troll would still be dependent on their parents, lacking in the skills for hunting and fighting. They weren\u2019t even holding the clubs that trolls usually carried.All this being said, they were still much taller than the thirteen-year-old Eugene. Eugene slowly readied his shield as he approached the troll.\u2018I\u2019ve beaten both orcs and goblins, but this will be my first time facing a medium-to-large monster in this body.\u2019Just because it was an illusion without a tangible form, he didn\u2019t have any intention of fighting carelessly. Even if it wasn\u2019t the real thing, his body had been itching for a good fight. Although quite some time had passed since he\u2019d entered the labyrinth, and he thought that he had made a good amount of progress\u2026 having come this far, he had yet to feel any sense of danger. That was why he needed to warm up his body a bit.Eugene slowly and obviously narrowed the distance between him and the troll. Across from him, the troll simply blinked its large eyes at Eugene instead of attacking him right away.This wasn\u2019t something to be confused about. He had already experienced this several times during his exploration. The monsters in this labyrinth did not attack unless someone stepped within a certain range of them. This should probably be a safety measure placed in consideration for the ages of the participating children.\u2018Slowly, slowly.\u2019Just as Eugene\u2019s foot was inching forward, the troll\u2019s movements suddenly changed. The troll spun its body around and twisted its head towards Eugene as saliva dripped down from between its tusks. It had a face so ugly it could scare \u2014 no, terrify children.However, instead of fear, Eugene felt happiness.\u2018As I\u2019ve always said, they look just like Molon.\u2019Though the truth was that more than one monster resembled Molon. Things like trolls, ogres, cyclops, and so on\u2026 basically, any ugly humanoid monster that walks on two legs. Eugene believed that all of these monsters really bore a striking resemblance to Molon.Molon had never been able to conclusively deny this fact. After all, he was well aware of how ugly he was.As Eugene recalled the ugly face of his old comrade, he kicked off the ground. It was only after the distance between them had shrunk in an instant that the troll finally showed a reaction. This showed that it was both clumsy and dull.That was why it was easy for Eugene to do what he did next.Slaash!Eugene\u2019s sword sliced through the troll\u2019s calf as he slid between its legs. Once on the other side, Eugene quickly got back to his feet and turned to face the troll\u2019s back. Then, without any hesitation, he swung his sword down at the back of the troll\u2019s knee.These injuries would have been light for a real troll. But as expected, these illusions weren\u2019t exactly the same as the real thing. Besides, the blade that Eugene was holding wasn\u2019t a real, sharp-edged sword either. All of which made the sharp cuts it inflicted on the troll seem quite unreal.Nevertheless, the sword flashed out with one blow after another. As each slash landed where the previous blow had fallen, Eugene finally managed to sever the troll\u2019s leg at the knee.Dark green blood spurted out of the wound. Eugene didn\u2019t allow any of it to land on him as he covered his face with his shield. However, his heightened senses didn\u2019t miss the moment when the troll finally reacted. As it tried to balance its now-unsteady body, the troll let out a scream, and one of its large hands swung down at Eugene\u2019s head.Eugene\u2019s shield, which had been covering his face, shifted upwards.Screeech!Compared to the lightness of his own slashes, the troll\u2019s attack was extremely heavy. Although his thirteen-year-old body had been tempered through intense training, it was impossible for him to block the troll\u2019s blow head-on.That was why he allowed it to flow to the side. He used both a tilt in the angle of his shield and the full strength of his shoulder and arm as a support. So the descending fist struck the shield at an oblique angle and slid right off. If his timing had been even a little bit off, his arm could have been crushed, but Eugene had never even bothered to doubt himself for a moment.His parrying truly was perfectly executed. With one leg already severed at the knee, the troll\u2019s gigantic body lost all balance when its fist slammed into the ground. The troll wildly swung its other arm at Eugene as it tried to stay upright, but Eugene deftly swung the sword that he was still holding in his other hand.Chopchopchop!Blood spurted out as the skin on the troll\u2019s arm was lacerated. As Eugene ducked beneath its flailing blows, he reversed his grip on his sword.Squelch!Having already lost one leg at the knee, the troll\u2019s other heel was now pinned to the ground by Eugene\u2019s sword. Even if it was an illusion, it still reacted realistically to the pain from its wounds. The troll\u2019s jaws snapped open as it let loose a scream. The agony coursing through its body also momentarily paralyzed the troll.\u2018Was there really a need to copy its bad breath as well?\u2019As Eugene felt some displeasure at this thought, he swung his shield.Bang!The shield slammed up into the troll\u2019s lower jaw, which was hanging wide-open, and slammed it shut. At the same time, he pulled out the sword that he had stuck into the troll\u2019s heel and shoved it back in between the troll\u2019s ribs.\u201cKaaargh!\u201d the troll roared as its breath was driven out of it.Eugene had pierced the troll\u2019s lungs. It might be because of how large its torso was, but he couldn\u2019t quite thrust his sword clean through the troll\u2019s back. Though he hadn\u2019t expected to do so in the first place. Eugene continued slicing his sword along the lines of the troll\u2019s ribs. By doing so, he completely tore apart its lungs, and then he drew his sword out the moment it touched the sternum. This left the troll without any strength to swing its arms, and it coughed out bloody foam as it gasped for air.If this had been a normal monster, the fight would have ended here. However, trolls were famous for their strong regenerative powers. Eugene was curious to see if this illusory troll actually shared this trait, but he had no intention of allowing it to live a moment longer for the sake of such pointless speculation.As such, Eugene decided to completely neutralize the troll as a threat. Though he had already pushed it to the point that it could no longer offer any resistance, with just a little more effort, he could break down the troll\u2019s body completely. Eugene thrust his sword into its heart about five or six times, and then he stabbed it in the neck. Even though he kept swinging his sword so violently, he never once got his blade caught on any bone.\u201cPhew.\u201dAfter he had painstakingly finished dismantling the troll, Eugene walked past its corpse with a satisfied expression on his face.Lovellian and Gilead had watched this whole scene take place from beginning to end. Lovellian, whose jaw had dropped open in blank surprise, wondered what sort of remark he should make in response to this. Even if it was all an illusion\u2026 that was still a troll. Someone, who wasn\u2019t even from the main family, a thirteen-year-old child at that, had\u2026 without letting out any sound of surprise upon seeing a troll, proceeded to overwhelmingly tear it to pieces.\u201c...Wow, that was\u2026 brutal. I don\u2019t think there was a need to go that far\u2026.\u201d Lovellian muttered probingly.He was trying to feel out Gilead\u2019s reaction to this surprise. Gilead had been looking at the screen with similarly shocked eyes and immediately burst out laughing with a shake of his head as a response to Lovellian\u2019s words.\u201cYour illusions are so well-made that they need to be treated as if it were a real battle, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d Gilead defended Eugene.\u201cThat might be the case, but\u2026.\u201d Lovellian hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Very amazing\u2026 He shouldn\u2019t have faced a troll before, but\u2026 rather than stiffening in fear, he cleanly and confidently neutralized the troll as a threat\u2026.\u201dGilead couldn\u2019t find any flaws in Eugene\u2019s swordsmanship. If he had to point something out, it would be that Eugene\u2019s performance was closer to slaughtering and butchering an animal than it was to pure swordsmanship. However, what does that have to do with anything? No matter how it was done, Eugene had impressively slain the troll with just his sword.\u201cHe also hasn\u2019t had any difficulties with exploring the labyrinth,\u201d Lovellian lavished in amazement as he watched Eugene. \u201cExcept for the first time, he\u2019s never once been caught in a trap.\u201d\u201cIf you just look at his actions, it would seem as if he was familiar with labyrinths,\u201d observed Gilead.\u201cWhere is that boy\u2019s hometown?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in Gidol province.\u201d\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any ruins there. How remarkable\u2026.\u201dMost labyrinths were originally created as lairs by wizards. Then sometimes, after the wizard who created the labyrinth had either died or left, these labyrinths were discovered by adventurers.If they were lucky, these adventurers might even find a treasure in the labyrinth. Once everything that hadn\u2019t been nailed down was taken as loot, the now treasure-less labyrinth would be transformed into a potential tourist destination.\u201c...Well, it\u2019s not like he needs to have delved inside labyrinths all that often. He might have learned how to do it from books,\u201d Gilead offered an alternate explanation.\u201cNormally, a thirteen-year-old wouldn\u2019t spend time reading a book about labyrinths,\u201d Lovellian refuted.\u201cBut you can\u2019t consider that boy a normal child, can you? Also, if he\u2019s not relying on knowledge or experience, that means that he could only be depending on his senses\u2026.\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026 Although it is a labyrinth made with children in mind\u2026 to navigate it by his senses\u2026. I shouldn\u2019t have made it so easy, that he could simply rely on his senses to get through\u2026.\u201d Lovellian pondered doubtfully.\u201cNo matter how much of a child he is, as long as he was born with impressive talent, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for him to show such a performance?\u201d Gilead asked convincingly.Even Lovellian had to admit that was true, and he knew exactly what such a child should be called.\u2018A genius.\u2019Gilead no longer kept his eyes on Cyan, Ciel, and Eward.Instead, he watched with delight as Eugene headed towards the center of the labyrinth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The trolls in this labyrinth were one such example. With their huge bodies that made it inconvenient for them to move quickly and their slow reactions \u2014 rather than an unskippable fight, they should instead be seen as a \u2018trap\u2019 that required you to look for an opening to slip past.The only two who had dared to fight the troll were Gargith and Eugene.\u201cUwoooh!\u201d Gargith let out a fierce roar.Although he hadn\u2019t made it out of the fight intact, the courageous Gargith had finally defeated the evil troll. Gargith pulled out his greatsword that was lodged in the troll\u2019s chest and released another yell.With these roars, he celebrated his victory and his continued survival. But then he lost all of his remaining strength and had to slump down on top of the troll.\u2018...It looks like I took too many hits\u2026.\u2019Although Gargith might be proud of his muscles, the troll\u2019s attacks were just that powerful. He thought that a few of his bones might even be broken.\u201cIt hurts\u2026!\u201d Gargith spat out from between gritted teeth.It hurt even more than when he had been struck by arrows or when he had collided with that rolling iron ball. Although he knew that all these pain signals were a trick of magic\u2026 painful things were still painful\u2026. Holding back the stinging tears, Gargith rolled off the troll\u2019s body and onto his feet. Then, while holding on to the wall for support, he started staggering forward.\u2018Since I\u2019ve received such injuries\u2026 the others might also be\u2026.\u2019He knew that Dezra was strong and that Eugene was even stronger than her. However, they shouldn\u2019t be stronger than a troll. How could their fragile bodies contend against such a massive troll\u2026?In contrast to all his worries, Dezra was completely fine. Without facing the troll head-on, she had instead found a gap in its attacks and had successfully slipped past the troll. That went for Cyan and Ciel as well.Cyan and Ciel had actually met up along the way. Since then, Ciel had refused to take the lead and had instead secretly persuaded Cyan to open up the way. It had actually been very easy for her to do so.\u201cBrother, which path should we take?\u201d Ciel had asked.\u201cCan\u2019t you even tell that?\u201d Cyan said with a disdainful look.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d\u201cThis idiot, we both read the same book, so how could you not know? Just watch me.\u201dCyan had never once felt inferior to his younger sibling, Ciel, who was born a few seconds later than he was. Instead, while believing that he should be a role model to his sister, he never missed a chance to show off in front of her.That applied to the current situation as well. From the moment that the words \u2018not sure\u2019 had passed his sister\u2019s lips, Cyan had decided that it was an opportunity to put on a superior act in front of his younger sister. Since he had just been humiliated a few days ago right in front of her eyes, he thought that now was the time to restore his tarnished image.\u201cDon\u2019t fall behind and follow me closely. This is a labyrinth created by the Head Wizard of the Red Tower after all,\u201d Cyan ordered.\u201cWhy does that matter?\u201d Ciel asked naively.\u201cThat means we can never know what might happen. A monster might even suddenly appear in front of us. Or else something strange might fall down from the ceiling.\u201d\u201cSomething like a ghost?\u201d\u201cIdiot, at a time like this, you should be wondering about the undead, not ghosts. Do you know what the undead are?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re things like zombies and ghouls, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It was mentioned in the book that we read together about the labyrinth made by the evil black wizard. It became the grave of any foolish adventurers blinded by the treasure! It\u2019s said that the black wizards of the olden days would make undead minions and chimeras from the adventurers who died in their labyrinths.\u201d\u201cBut the Head Wizard of the Red Tower isn\u2019t a black wizard.\u201d\u201cThat might be the case, but you never know. The undead might show up as some form of illusion.\u201d\u201cI hate ghosts since they\u2019re scary,\u201d Ciel confessed.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d Cyan boasted.To tell the truth, Cyan was also scared of ghosts.When he was very young, back when the twins shared the same room, they were looked after by a nanny who read them all sorts of stories every night. Sometimes, when their nanny would read them a scary story, Cyan wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep all throughout the night as he vainly tried to keep an eye on the space beneath his bed and inside his closet.However, he could not expose such a shameful fear in front of his younger sister.\u2018Why did she have to start talking about ghosts all of a sudden?\u2019\u00a0Cyan thought to himself as he suppressed the tremors in his body and kept glancing up at the ceiling.The \u2018something strange\u2019 he had imagined falling from the ceiling was, at most, a spider or some other kind of monster. He hadn\u2019t even considered ghosts.Naturally, Ciel had brought up the topic of ghosts deliberately. She knew very well that her brother had been scared of ghosts ever since they were young, and she wanted to tease her brother, who kept strutting arrogantly as he forged ahead.\u2018It would be fun if something showed up to startle my brother,\u2019\u00a0Ciel thought mischievously as she trailed behind Cyan.At some point, forks had stopped appearing on the road. However, that didn\u2019t mean the road just kept heading straight. Instead, it began to bend this way and that as the different paths started to join together. Each time this happened, Cyan was filled with caution at the thought that something might come popping out from around the corner.Since her brother didn\u2019t end up screaming soon, like she had hoped, Ciel slowly began to grow bored. She wondered if she should just poke him in the back. If she did, Ciel thought that her brother might make quite an amusing sound of surprise. When would be the best time for that? Since her brother had his guard up, for now, she needed to wait until he was almost fully relaxed.\u201cBrother, do you think that Eugene is still in the labyrinth?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201c...The son of a bitch is someone who defeated me. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be taken down by monsters or traps,\u201d Cyan reluctantly admitted.\u201cBut there\u2019s a possibility that he might have gotten caught in a trap. Among all the traps that I saw, there was one that was almost a bottomless hole. If he got caught in that, wouldn\u2019t he be unable to get out?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Cyan nodded his head with a solemn expression on his face. \u201cThanks to our mother, we learned a lot about labyrinths before we entered, but the others probably weren\u2019t able to do that. Especially Eugene, since he\u2019s such a country bumpkin, he probably didn\u2019t even know what a labyrinth was.\u201d\u201cBut it would be fun if we could all meet up in the center.\u201d\u201cHey, what would be fun about that? Those guys are our competition.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t father say that there was no real need to fight and compete against each other?\u201dAt these words, Cyan pursed his lips. Finally, he said, \u201c...He might have said that, but he also didn\u2019t say that we weren\u2019t\u00a0allowed\u00a0to fight. So if I end up meeting with a certain someone, then I\u2019m going to fight them.\u201d\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll win?\u201d\u201cI lost back then because I got cocky. If we fight again, then I will definitely win!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cF-for sure!\u201dAlthough that was what he said, Cyan couldn\u2019t be certain of his victory. He remembered how much it had hurt when Eugene had struck him, as well as the cold look in his eyes. His body almost started trembling uncontrollably. It might have been because of the earlier talk of ghosts alread yputting him on edge, but he needed to focus even more to keep himself from trembling.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything unnecessary, Ciel,\u201d Cyan spat out as he turned to look at Ciel.Ciel stuck out her tongue at him and just smiled.With one final look at his sister, Cyan turned towards the front and said, \u201cI need to focu\u2014Aaaaargh!\u201dJust as they rounded a corner, a woman covered in bloodstains suddenly appeared out of a side-tunnel! Cyan\u2019s eyes widened, and his pupils shrank as he cut off his words in a scream.\u201cKyaaah!\u201d came a returning cry.From inside the side-tunnel, Dezra had been listening to the sound of approaching conversation. She had realized that it was Cyan and Ciel! Two of her competitors in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. She was thinking of surprising them with an ambush if they had negligently let their guards down, but\u2026 Dezra was the one who ended up startled by Cyan\u2019s loud cry, and she had let loose with her own scream in return.\u201cAaaaargh!\u201d\u201cWaaagh!\u201dAs their two cries mixed with each other, Ciel grabbed her stomach and burst out laughing at this sight. After screaming like this for some time, Cyan finally returned to his senses and instead drew his sword.\u201cDezra! You dare attempt to startle me?!\u201d Cyan demanded.\u201cI-I\u2019m the one who was startled!\u201d Dezra defended herself.Dezra was younger than Cyan. On top of that, since she came from a collateral line, she just couldn\u2019t feel confident speaking with Cyan. So instead, she jumped slightly and took a few steps back. Her ambush was a total failure.\u201cWhy would I startle you! And you, what\u2019s with your look? You\u2019re dressed like that because you wanted to jump out and scare me!\u201d Cyan said angrily.\u201cThis is because I got hurt!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201dDezra felt like she was about to burst something from the injustice of his accusation. She had to get past all kinds of traps, monsters, and a giant troll just to get this far. No matter how precocious Dezra was for her age, slight wounds were unavoidable. The reason for her bloodstained face was that she had grazed her forehead on the way here.\u201cI can\u2019t forgive you\u2026! You dare to startle me?! You, did you really think I wouldn\u2019t know what you were planning? You were planning on ambushing us after you surprised us, right!\u201d Cyan barked.\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t!\u201dHe had actually hit upon the truth, but Dezra hadn\u2019t even gotten a chance to attempt her plan before it was already ruined. Dezra groaned in frustration and turned around. Then she started running away at full speed.\u201cBrother, she\u2019s running away!\u201d\u201cShe dares!\u201dCyan was genuinely angry. He had been made to scream in an unsightly manner in front of his younger sister! Dezra was truly mean-spirited to have leaped out at him while pretending to be a ghost. It was even more hateful than Eugene\u2019s surprise attack. That was why he definitely couldn\u2019t forgive her.Cyan started chasing after Dezra. Ciel also followed behind Cyan, still giggling. No matter how long and agile Dezra\u2019s limbs were, she couldn\u2019t be faster than the twins, who had already started training their mana. The distance between them gradually narrowed.Dezra desperately wondered,\u00a0\u2018Where\u2019s that son of a bitch, Gargith, gone to?\u2019\u201cGargith!\u201d Dezra screeched loudly.However, at that moment, Gargith was in the middle of roaring out his victory on top of the downed troll, so he couldn\u2019t hear Dezra\u2019s call.\u201cDon\u2019t run away!\u201d Cyan demanded.\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything wrong!\u201d Dezra protested.\u201cThen why are you running away?!\u201d\u201cBecause you want to bully me!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do!\u201d Cyan exclaimed.At this reply, Dezra squeezed out even more strength. Could she have tried fighting back instead? If Cyan was on his own, that might have been a possibility, but he had Ciel with him as well. Besides, with her body covered in wounds, she definitely couldn\u2019t win.\u2018But Eugene might be able to,\u2019\u00a0Dezra recalled.But where was that bastard? While running headlong, Dezra accidentally stepped on the trigger to a trap.Booom!The floor ahead completely collapsed downwards. With a scream of surprise, Dezra leaped off the ground.Bangbang!Dezra just barely managed to jump over the hole and landed on her ass on the other side. While holding onto her sore tailbone, Dezra sobbed in pain.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you not to run!\u201d Cyan immediately halted in front of the sudden trap and shouted across to her.Dezra panted, as she tried to catch her breath, before eventually taking off running once more.\u201cBrother!\u201d Ciel cried as she caught up.Cyan looked down into the trap for a moment. It was so deep that he couldn\u2019t even see the bottom. On top of that, the other side of the trap was really far away. Cyan dithered for a moment out of hesitation. Should he go back and find another path instead?Just as he was about to turn back, he saw the look of expectation in his sister\u2019s eyes. Cyan bit down on his lip firmly. He could no longer show her such an embarrassing side of himself.\u201cIyaaaah!\u201d Cyan vaulted over the trap with a scream.The mana flowing through his body easily allowed him to leap over that great distance.\u201cCiel! You should jump too! I\u2019ll catch you!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dWith reassuring eyes, Cyan spread his arms wide. However, Ciel simply leaped over the trap and landed beside him on the other side without needing Cyan\u2019s help at all. The twins had had the same lessons ever since they were young. If Cyan could do it, then of course, Ciel was able to do it as well.\u201c...As expected from my little sister.\u201dAfter awkwardly lowering his outstretched arms, Cyan resumed his pursuit of the escaping Dezra. But the twins were stopped before they got too far.Ahead of them, Dezra had stopped as well.\u201c...It\u2019s the boss monster,\u201d one of them whispered.At the conclusion of their fierce race, the three had actually managed to reach the center of the labyrinth. At the end of their path lay a huge underground cave with walls on all sides. In the center of the cave sat a monster, which was even larger than a troll.\u201cWhy are the three of you together?\u201d Sitting with his back against the wall, Eugene tilted his head to the side and asked the new arrivals.\u201c...What are you doing here?\u201d Cyan asked, snapping out of his astonishment.\u201cWhat am I doing? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m just sitting?\u201d\u201cBut why here?\u201d\u201cI was interested to see who\u2019d be arriving first,\u201d Eugene laughed as he gave this reply.His round, wide eyes were overflowing with mischievous playfulness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, the one who had broken through the labyrinth and arrived at the center first was definitely Eugene.\u201cDezra was the first to arrive,\u201d Eugene decided.\u201cBut she was just running away!\u201d Cyan protested.\u201cWhy was she running away?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dThis was a question that Cyan absolutely couldn\u2019t bear to answer. This had all begun because he had mistaken Dezra\u2019s bloodstained appearance for a ghost and had let out a scream. Then, embarrassed and angered by this, he had decided to catch her and teach her a lesson\u2026. If he were to try and explain all of this, Cyan felt that he would first have to admit to Eugene that he had screamed because he was afraid of ghosts.\u201c...Dezra\u2026to me\u2026she insulted me,\u201d with some difficulty, Cyan came up with this excuse.\u201cYou really do like to use the word \u2018insult\u2019 a lot,\u201d Eugene observed.\u201cWhen did I ever insult you, Cyan?\u201d Dezra shouted with a resentful expression on her face. If only she had managed to ambush them as planned, then at least this abuse would be justified.\u201cCyan was the one who overreacted. We just happened to meet up on the same path!\u201d Dezra continued her explanation.\u201cYou deliberately startled me!\u201d Cyan accused her.\u201cThat\u2019s not how it happened! Instead, I\u2019m the one who got startled by your scream!\u201d Dezra refuted.\u201cI-I didn\u2019t scream,\u201d Cyan lied, as he clenched his fists and his ears were dyed red. \u201cI was just\u2026 I was just yelling because I was so angry. As for you\u2026 right! Dezra, you were trying to ambush us!\u201d\u201c...No, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Dezra attempted to deny.\u201cYou just hesitated for a moment, didn\u2019t you! I saw your eyes waver. So you really were planning to ambush us?! How dare\u2014how dare a collateral descendant like you try to attack someone like me?!\u201d\u201cAh jeez! I fucking said that I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Dezra shouted loudly, feeling both embarrassed and victimized.Cyan's eyes widened in shock at this explosive shout that exposed some of Dezra\u2019s usual foul-mouthedness.\u201cHow dare you swear at me! Not only am I the scion of the main family, but I also happen to be a year older than you!\u201d\u201cI told you that I didn\u2019t do any of that, but you keep fucking accusing me!\u201d\u201cAgain with the swearing\u2014\u201d\u201cStop,\u201d Eugene ordered, having had enough of listening to their childish quarrel.In the first place, he hadn\u2019t the slightest interest in whatever insult Cyan may have perceived.\u201cWhatever happened, Dezra was the first to arrive,\u201d Eugene stated once more.\u201cWeren\u2019t you the first to arrive?\u201d Ciel asked with a grin.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I did arrive here first,\u201d Eugene easily admitted.\u201c...Just what is it that you want to say?\u201d Dezra asked as she glanced sideways at Eugene.They had talked about a plan to combine their strengths to defeat the boss monster on the night they had met in Eugene\u2019s room, following their dinner with the Lionheart Patriarch. Could the reason he was waiting here for them be that\u2026 Eugene had challenged the boss monster on his own and failed?\u201cI just thought that I should concede this chance to all of you,\u201d Eugene said with a smile.\u201c...Concede?\u201d Dezra asked.\u201cThe thing is, I can fight with him and I\u2019ll probably win. But if I just went and nabbed him first, I\u2019d feel sorry for you lot who worked so hard to get here.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re saying?\u201d Cyan roared loudly in anger.He was definitely insulting all of them by saying this. Although Dezra wasn\u2019t shouting like Cyan was, she glared at Eugene with a frown. As for Ciel? She wasn\u2019t feeling at all angry or insulted. Instead, she found this situation so highly entertaining that she was on the edge of her seat as she waited to see what happened next.\u201cTo be fair, let\u2019s go in order of arrival,\u201d Eugene said, ignoring their outrage.\u201cYou\u2026 are you really in your right mind? How many times were you struck in the head by monsters on your way here?\u201d Cyan questioned.\u201cI didn\u2019t get hit at all. I\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d Eugene reassured Cyan as he looked over to Dezra without getting up from his seat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can win, feel free to give up. It\u2019s your right to do so, after all.\u201dGive up? Dezra furrowed her brows. She had gone through so much just to get here. His talk about a concession was already absurd enough, but when he told her to give up, Dezra really felt infuriated.\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up!\u201d Dezra shouted.\u201cBut it will be difficult for you on your own\u2026.\u201d Eugene smiled teasingly.As her shoulders shook in anger, Dezra turned to look at the boss monster standing in the central cave.Even from this distance, Dezra could clearly see that the boss monster had a tough, muscular build. It was even bigger than the troll that she had barely managed to escape from earlier. Its most distinctive characteristic was its \u2018head.\u2019 The boss monster was a giant humanoid with the head of a bull.In other words, a minotaur. It was a monster that almost always appeared in the many stories involving labyrinths. However, seeing the minotaur in reality, it didn\u2019t appear anywhere near as ridiculous as it sounded in fairy tales. Dezra gulped as she stared at the minotaur\u2019s twin pair of gigantic horns.\u2018...Why hasn\u2019t Gargith, that son of a bitch, arrived yet?\u2019The original plan was to join forces with Gargith to fight the boss monster. However, Gargith seemed to have gotten stuck somewhere as he showed no signs of arriving any time soon. Just in case, Dezra shot Eugene a look.\u201cI\u2019m only going to fight after you all have had your chances,\u201d Eugene insisted.\u201c...You really are crazy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Dezra hissed.Cyan was so perplexed that, for a few moments, he had just kept listening as they talked. However, he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.\u201cDo you really think that you\u2019ll get a turn?\u201d Cyan demanded.\u201cYeah, I think I will,\u201d Eugene replied confidently.\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me! Do you really believe that I won't be able to defeat a single cow-headed bastard?!\u201d\u201cIf you do defeat it, I\u2019ll acknowledge you as my big brother for the rest of my life.\u201dAt these words, Cyan hesitated for a moment. He imagined being able to hear this cheeky bastard call him \u2018older brother\u2019 for the rest of his life. The childish Cyan found this proposal extremely attractive.\u201c...Don\u2019t go back on your words later.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201dAfter hearing Eugene\u2019s confirmation, Cyan dropped down on the spot. Then, as he slowly breathed in and out, he began absorbing mana into his body. Since he had used up a lot of strength just getting here, he needed to quickly restore his mana through this method.\u2018If it\u2019s a minotaur\u2026.\u2019Truthfully, this was also Cyan\u2019s first time seeing one in real life. However, he had read many stories about minotaurs in the books he had been perusing at random for the past few days. It was a monster without any particular weaknesses, but it also didn\u2019t have any specific strengths.It had its strength and its tough skin, but these were natural features for a medium-to-large monster of that size. It didn\u2019t have the strong regenerative capabilities of a troll, nor did it have the unspeakable strength and fury of an ogre. It was of moderate strength and intelligence. The minotaur, as seen through Cyan\u2019s eyes, was a monster that could be beaten without much difficulty.However, Dezra got a completely different feeling from it. Calming her shaking heart, she hesitantly made her way out into the central cave. Both her spear and the hands holding it were shaking. Although she had hunted many monsters around the same level as orcs, she had yet to hunt a monster as large as the minotaur.\u2018...They say that minotaurs are higher up on the food chain than trolls, but\u2026.\u2019This wasn\u2019t always necessarily the case, but, for now, she would accept the fact that minotaurs were of similar or greater strength to trolls. Dezra, who had slipped past her troll without having been able to defeat it, found it impossible to imagine how she might be able to achieve victory.\u201c...Haiyaaa!\u201dThat said, she couldn\u2019t just turn back after having come this far. Dezra shouted a battle cry to still her fear. Then she tightened her grip on her spear and charged at the minotaur.Before Dezra could close the distance, the minotaur got to its feet. It showed an unbelievable speed of reaction for such a heavy creature. Even trolls weren\u2019t that fast, and its figure, as it got up onto its feet, was far larger than the average troll. The minotaur turned its head towards Dezra. The cattle eyes that Dezra was familiar with were normally bright and cute, but the minotaur\u2019s eyes were full of eerie light.The minotaur swung its hand and, with a cry, Dezra thrust her spear.Crack!The minotaur\u2019s large hand shattered her spear into pieces without any apparent difficulty.\u2018But they said that it wouldn\u2019t break!\u2019Dezra\u2019s face twisted in betrayal. The minotaur quickly raised its hand once more and slammed it down on top of Dezra\u2019s head, but this was still within the limits of Dezra\u2019s ability to react. She leaped to the side, dodging the attack, and then swung the end of her broken spear at the minotaur\u2019s exposed flank.Clack!Although the blow landed, the attack made using such unstable footing didn\u2019t prove very effective. Without making even a single grunt of pain, the minotaur caught up to Dezra.\u201cKyaaah!\u201dIts large fingers completely wrapped around her body. Dezra screamed fearfully as she tried desperately to escape. Her intuition was honestly telling her that she was about to die! Could this all really be an illusion? No, it was impossible! Dezra closed her eyes tightly in the face of her impending doom.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It didn\u2019t crush her body through its forceful grip, nor did it dash her against the ground. Instead, it simply threw her at the entrance of the path leading into the center of the labyrinth.Screech!Dezra was so consumed by fear that she forgot her training to deal with falls. So after skidding across the ground, she just lay where she fell, whimpering in pain. Her whole body was aching after having flown so far through the air before falling, and it felt like she had broken several bones.\u201cSince you\u2019ve lost, get back out of the way,\u201d Eugene ordered.\u201cIt hurts\u2026!\u201d Dezra cried out piteously.\u201cWell, of course it would hurt,\u201d Eugene pointed out without sympathy.\u201cWhy did it just stop at throwing her?\u201d Ciel asked, her face showing incomprehension.Although it wasn\u2019t like she wanted to see such a brutal scene taking place right in front of her, no matter how much Ciel thought about it, the minotaur\u2019s behavior just now didn\u2019t seem like something a monster would do.\u201cThat\u2019s because that thing over there isn\u2019t a real monster,\u201d Eugene replied dismissively. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why it\u00a0has\u00a0to kill us, since the moment it gets its hands on us, we\u2019ve already lost.\u201dThe organizers of this ceremony also had no reason to want to truly traumatize the young children.Having watched this situation play out, Cyan got up with a relaxed smile on his face.\u201cHmph. Instead of rushing out first, you should have recognized your place. Did you really think that you\u2019d be able to defeat a minotaur?\u201dDezra was unable to respond, and she could only sob and curl her aching body into a ball. Cyan smirked as he stalked past Dezra into the center of the labyrinth.\u201cWhat a fool! Just sit there and keep your eyes peeled wide open as I show you how it\u2019s meant to be done. I\u2019ll prove once for all that the blood of the main family is on a different level to a collateral descendant like yourself.\u201dCyan felt like he had to compliment himself on such a magnificent speech. Of course, these words weren\u2019t just meant for Dezra; they were aimed at Eugene as well. However, Eugene was simply smiling in amusement, as if he saw something funny that Cyan had missed.\u2018...Bastard. Does he really think that I can\u2019t kill a cow-headed bastard like that?\u2019Cyan drew his sword with an eye-catching flourish. Then he began focusing his concentration on his sword. As he did so, the mana circulating through his body began flowing into the sword as well.\u201c...Sword-light\u2026!\u201dDezra felt a huge shock hit her. A faint light had wrapped itself around Cyan\u2019s sword. That was definitely sword-light, something that could only be manifested once your mana had been trained to a certain level. Dezra personally knew just how powerful a light like that was. It was basically a blade of mana that could cut through anything it touched. She had sometimes seen her father wrap the spear-equivalent of sword-light around his spear and use it to pierce through a large block of iron as if it were a piece of tofu.\u2018If you train hard once you return from the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, you\u2019ll also be able to manifest sword-light,\u201d\u00a0her father had told her before she left for the main house.In order to activate the slightest ray of sword-light, you needed to have trained your mana for at least ten years. However, Cyan was only one year older than her and could already manifest his sword-light. This fact frustrated Dezra greatly.\u201c...Haha!\u201d Cyan laughed as he came out of his focus.Cyan enjoyed seeing Dezra in shock. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t maintain the sword-light for very long with the amount of mana that he possessed. However, it wouldn\u2019t take him very long to slice this stupid cow-headed bastard into pieces.With a confident gait, Cyan approached the minotaur.\u201c...Huh?\u201dHowever, before he had taken much more than a few steps, Cyan halted in his tracks. The mana that composed the sword-light had suddenly scattered. Cyan looked at his sword in confusion. He tried to focus his mind once more on emitting the sword-light, but no matter how much mana he used, he couldn\u2019t stop the sword-light from scattering into the air.\u201cWh-what the?\u201dEugene looked at Cyan\u2019s bewildered appearance with a playful light in his eyes. While it had been a surprise to see that Cyan already knew how to manifest his sword-light, the fact that he knew how to do this only made Eugene even happier.A faint magic circle was drawn on the walls surrounding the central cave, so faded that you needed to look very closely to see it. Eugene had recognized the appearance of this magic circle. Although several points seem to have been changed\u2026 the basic gist of it still remained.This was a magic circle that cut off all use of mana within its range. Three hundred years ago, Sienna had used this very same magic circle to counter several demonic wizards.\u2018Who\u2019d have thought that they would install this kind of magic circle in the center of the labyrinth?\u2019Since the collateral descendants hadn\u2019t trained their mana, this magic circle\u2019s only targets were the children of the main family.\u2018Well, he did say that he would be judging us on the qualities that we had inherited, not the concentration of our blood.\u2019Gilead was the one who had said this, and he had really put his words into action. Usually, the collateral descendants would never be able to win against the children of the direct line. However, what if the children of the main family could no longer use mana?Not knowing what to do, Cyan hesitantly backed away. The minotaur simply stood idly by and watched Cyan as he did so.\u2018Just\u2026 just what on earth is going on? Why isn\u2019t the sword-light activating? Even though I still have plenty of mana\u2026.\u2019\u201cBrother?\u201d Ciel called out to Cyan.Cyan\u2019s shoulders twitched at the sound of her voice. Could he really defeat the minotaur without the use of sword-light? Cyan gulped. He couldn\u2019t even absorb any more mana into his body. That meant he wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain the boost to his physical strength for very long.Did he really have a chance?\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to lose, then just come back. Don\u2019t pointlessly get your ass beaten out of stubbornness,\u201d Eugene called out as he snickered.That irritating voice! Cyan bit down firmly on his lips. He had nowhere to retreat. If he admitted that he couldn\u2019t do it and just turned back now\u2026.\u201cHaiyaaah!\u201d letting loose a loud roar, Cyan charged at the minotaur.Like the last time, the minotaur only started moving after Cyan had rushed in. Although he couldn\u2019t call up his sword light, Cyan\u2019s movements were incomparably faster than Dezra\u2019s had been.The minotaur swung its hand. Cyan avoided the minotaur\u2019s hand and dived into its reach with great difficulty. Then, with all his strength, he swung his sword.Clang!Cyan\u2019s sword sliced at the minotaur. However, this only left a shallow cut on the monster\u2019s skin. While enduring the pain in his wrists from the recoil, Cyan continued to fiercely swing his sword.Cyan was extremely desperate. As he narrowly escaped the minotaur\u2019s attacks by dodging here and there, he continued to slash and stab with his sword. However, none of his attacks were truly injuring the minotaur. It was incomparably stronger than all the monsters he had faced up until now.\u2018T-the leg. I need to hit its leg.\u2019Cyan\u2019s breathing was already strained. Having inflicted only shallow wounds so far, he was far from defeating the monster. He needed to make a decisive attack. For starters, it was just way too large, so he needed to bring it down somehow\u2026 but his thoughts didn\u2019t have the time to form properly.Watch out for its hand!Cyan quickly ducked his head. Then as he dived forward with his head down, he thrust his sword at the minotaur\u2019s knee.Crack!Unfortunately, he had gotten the angle of the stab wrong. Cyan\u2019s sword didn\u2019t pierce into the minotaur\u2019s joint as he had hoped, and instead, as it impacted with the minotaur's tough kneecap, the sword cracked into pieces. As he saw this happen, Cyan\u2019s eyes filled with tears of despair.\u2018But they said it wouldn\u2019t break!\u2019The moment his sword broke, Cyan resentfully complained to Lovellian in his head, just as Dezra had done. Unfortunately, what followed next was also identical to Dezra\u2019s experience. The minotaur\u2019s large hand wrapped around Cyan and threw him towards the entrance.\u201cHuuurgh!\u201dFortunately, Cyan was able to control his fall to minimize the damage. However, he was thrown so far, and his body was so exhausted, that he wasn\u2019t able to fully mitigate the force of the throw. Coming out of his roll, Cyan writhed on the ground as he tried to grab at his throbbing back.\u201cGaaah\u2026!\u201d he groaned.\u201cYou lost as well,\u201d Eugene teased Cyan with a chuckle.Cyan couldn\u2019t say anything in reply, so he could only bite his lips in shame.\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight,\u201d Ciel blurted out immediately. \u201cHis sword-light wasn\u2019t working because of that, right?\u201dCiel\u2019s finger pointed at the magic circle that had been inscribed on the walls.\u2018Oh\u2026.\u2019\u00a0Eugene exclaimed inwardly, impressed.It looks like she really did have better eyes than her brother.\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Eugene said with a smile as he stood up.After looking at her brother with eyes that showed a mix of worry and amusement, Ciel turned back to Eugene.\u201cCan you win?\u201d she asked him.\u201cI\u2019ll have to give it a try,\u201d he said, and with this reply, Eugene walked out to meet the minotaur.Although he may have spoken modestly, Eugene had no intention of losing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony (6)As Eugene headed out to face the minotaur, no hesitation or nervousness could be seen in his stride. Could it be because the minotaur was so minor an opponent that such feelings weren\u2019t needed? In any case, Eugene had yet to train his mana, so the magic circle didn\u2019t change anything.Not being able to use mana while fighting against such a large monster was quite an inconvenient problem, but it wasn\u2019t enough of a cause for Eugene to hesitate. In his previous life, before he had ever learned the use of mana, he had fought countless trolls, ogres, and such like.Compared to them, this minotaur was nothing to be wary of. On top of the fact that it wasn\u2019t even a real monster, judging by its movements, it seemed to be weaker than an actual minotaur. It definitely had had its level lowered to be an appropriate opponent for children.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll just have to pay attention in case my weapon breaks.\u2019Until now, no matter how roughly he had used it, his sword hadn\u2019t even chipped, but now things were obviously different. Was it because they wanted to know if the participants were capable of responding flexibly to unexpected situations? Or perhaps it was because they wanted to see what kind of skills and talents they might be keeping in reserve\u2026?Whatever their reasons might be, this suited Eugene fine. After all, hadn't this given him the chance to see the main family eat crow, just as he\u2019d planned? In fact, he could have succeeded in his plan to embarrass the main family just by defeating the Minotaur right away and ending the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony all by himself. Still, thanks to a little patience, he had also gotten the chance to see Cyan humiliated.\u2018While all this proves that the Patriarch is an upright guy\u2026.\u2019His son\u2019s personality was quite a mess. Before it was too late, Cyan needed to get that dog-shit attitude beaten out of him, otherwise he would never get better. Eugene was convinced of the necessity of some physical education.Even if Gilead, the Patriarch, had turned out to be an okay guy, his son was still a bastard. Moreover, since Cyan was already such a bastard at his age, he might become even more of a bastard going forward.As such, even if it was just for Gilead\u2019s sake, Cyan\u2019s character needed to be physically corrected, and Eugene was happy to volunteer.\u2018Although it might not be enough with just one or two beatings.\u2019Well, it wasn\u2019t like this was Eugene\u2019s responsibility. Gilead would probably take care of it once he found out the full scale of the problem.\u201cHm,\u201d Eugene hummed in thought.He had already determined the range in which the minotaur was set to react. Standing just outside that line, he stared at the minotaur. Although Cyan had slashed it several times, the Minotaur seemed perfectly fine.\u2018If that\u2019s the case, then\u2026.\u2019Eugene smiled as he stepped forward. Just like that, he entered the minotaur\u2019s reactionary range.\u2018...How shall I go about defeating it?\u2019The minotaur responded immediately. Moving its large body with surprising speed, it charged at Eugene. Unlike Dezra and Cyan, Eugene did not rush forward, but he didn\u2019t move out of the minotaur\u2019s range either.The minotaur\u2019s large fist flew towards him. Before the attack had even been flung, Eugene had already predicted what course the attack would take. There were many \u2018clues\u2019 to be seen on the minotaur\u2019s giant body. From the way its fingers clenched to the movement of its elbows and shoulders, and even the twitching of its muscles, all of this could be used to deduce a prediction.Boom!The minotaur\u2019s fist slamming into the ground overlapped with the movement of Eugene\u2019s sword. To strengthen the force of his slash, he counter-slashed the descending arm, aiming for the inside of the minotaur\u2019s elbow. The joints where its skin folded were an inevitable weak point in its tough leather hide, and the tendons there weren\u2019t as thick as its arm muscles.Of course, it wasn\u2019t easy to time such a slash. However, Eugene made the cut look easy. He was familiar with wielding a sword in such a surgical manner from his previous life. Moreover, Eugene\u2019s current body was overwhelmingly superior to Hamel\u2019s body when it was his age.Right from birth, there had been an innate difference between the two. And Eugene had continued to refine and develop this difference over the course of several years.So he wasn\u2019t allowed to use mana? Why should that matter? Even without mana, his young body was extremely agile.\u201cGuooo!\u201dThe minotaur let out a roar. Although his elbow was too thick to have been cut through completely, the tendon there was very sensitive to pain because it was densely packed with nerves. Even if it wasn\u2019t completely severed, that was still enough to make the pain seem unbearable.Its huge arm muscles were now left dangling uselessly, and the minotaur\u2019s reactions were slowed from shock. Without any hesitation, Eugene hopped onto the minotaur\u2019s arm. Then he started to sprint.It was easy to run up the minotaur\u2019s massive arm with his small child's body. Within moments, he had reached the minotaur\u2019s shoulders.Of course, the minotaur wasn\u2019t going to just stay still. It immediately twisted its body and swung its shoulders around as he ran up. However, Eugene was also experienced with running on unstable footing. And in the first place, this cheat body had been born with an innate sense of balance.Even with its body swaying randomly, Eugene continued to close in on the minotaur\u2019s head until its huge horns were tossing through the air right in front of him. Pausing to get the timing right, Eugene reached out his hand.Smack!Eugene\u2019s hand caught the minotaur\u2019s horn. Since he had been able to swing a sword completely wrapped in heavy sandbags, it was effortless for him to support his whole weight with just one arm. Eugene tightened his grip on the horn and pulled himself up. Just like that, he had climbed on top of the minotaur\u2019s head.\u201cGraaaagh!\u201dThe minotaur raised its remaining mobile hand. It tried to catch Eugene, who was hanging from its head, but the speed with which Eugene thrust his sword was faster than its grasping fingers could clutch.Squelch!The long sword plunged into the minotaur\u2019s ear. The sword stabbed in so deeply that it even managed to reach the minotaur\u2019s semicircular canal.[1]\u00a0The minotaur\u2019s body soon started shaking violently as it lost its balance, and its wildly swinging hand couldn\u2019t even get close to touching Eugene. Then, unable to bear it any longer, the minotaur fell down onto its tail.For his next move, Eugene pulled out his sword and thrust it back into the minotaur\u2019s left eye. The minotaur released a terrible scream of pain. Eugene twisted his deeply impaled sword a few times before drawing it back out. Then he stabbed with his sword once again, this time into its right eye. Although the minotaur had squeezed its eye shut defensively, Eugene\u2019s sword pierced right through the thin eyelid.\u201cGuwaaah!\u201dBang!The minotaur\u2019s hand swung upwards, but it missed Eugene completely and slapped its own blameless forehead instead. Due to its rage and panic, it had put too much force into the blow. The minotaur\u2019s head snapped backward abruptly, but this was a good opportunity for Eugene. He fell back down onto the minotaur\u2019s shoulders and, thanks to the Minotaur\u2019s raised chin, Eugene had a clear line of sight to its throbbing carotid artery.Once, twice, thrice, Eugene focused all three of his swings onto one location. With the second blow, he neatly sliced through its leather hide, and with the third, he had reached the blood vessel. Then, with a few more blows on top of that\u2026.Splash!Blood began spurting out violently. Eugene blocked the spray of blood with the shield on his left arm and continued to thrust his sword into the open wound.Soon the minotaur fell silent as its life bled out of it. It continued the rest of its fall to the ground, slowly collapsing backward onto the cave floor. But before it could fall completely, Eugene lightly leaped off it and landed on the ground once more.\u201cPhew,\u201d Eugene sighed in satisfaction at a job well done.Although he had tried to block it with his shield, so much blood had sprayed out that both his hair and face had gotten drenched in it. Eugene roughly wiped off most of the blood before turning his head to face his audience, Cyan, Ciel, and Dezra, who were staring in his direction with their mouths wide open. Then, while grinning at Cyan specifically, Eugene pointed at the minotaur\u2019s corpse.\u201cYou saw that, right?\u201d\u201c...Uh\u2026?\u201d Cyan mumbled blankly.\u201cI killed it,\u201d Eugene boasted proudly.Cyan didn\u2019t know how to react. He knew that Eugene\u2019s words were meant to rile him up, but after seeing something like that occur right before his eyes, he just couldn\u2019t muster up any outrage. Cyan was sure that he definitely wasn\u2019t able to do what Eugene had just done.But what if\u2026 what if he had been able to use sword-light? If that had been the case, he was sure that he could have killed the minotaur. However, he still wouldn\u2019t have been able to accomplish it as easily as Eugene had.Cyan was beginning to feel an unfamiliar emotion whenever his thoughts turned to center on this country bumpkin. It was similar to fear, but it brought with it an excitement in his chest that made it feel different from fear. The thirteen-year-old Cyan had yet to understand that this emotion was \u2018awe.\u2019\u201c...Oh,\u201d Eugene released a small sigh of surprise as he looked down at his own body.The bloody smell had disappeared in an instant. The minotaur\u2019s corpse that was lying right next to him, as well as the walls and the ceilings that had enclosed them from all sides, also started to disappear. His damp hair was dried back to a fluffy state as if it had never been wet in the first place, and the sword and the shield he was holding in his hands faded and then vanished into thin air.The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over.* * *Both Gilead and Lovellian were left speechless. Everything up to the point where Dezra and Cyan had been defeated was something that they had predicted.In the first place, they had known that it wouldn\u2019t be an easy challenge for children to hunt the minotaur.Wasn\u2019t that why Gilead had told them in advance that in this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony he wouldn\u2019t just be considering their individual performance, but their abilities to quickly make situational judgments and their cooperative spirit as well?He had wanted to see if they would retain the will to fight despite numerous setbacks. If the children had agreed to work together, it wasn\u2019t impossible for them to defeat the monster. And once they\u2019d caught the minotaur\u2019s attention, it was also possible to slowly draw it out of the magic circle\u2019s range. As long as the children didn\u2019t rush in impulsively, they could have tried out a few different methods until they finally succeeded, or at least\u2026 that was the way they had intended for the minotaur to be defeated.\u201c...Hahaha!\u201dAlthough his plans had been completely overturned, Gilead didn\u2019t feel any frustration. Instead, he burst out laughing with a broad smile on his face.\u201cIsn\u2019t he amazing?\u201d Gilead commented as he pointed to Eugene. \u201cThat kid, he\u2019s just a collateral descendant who hasn\u2019t even trained his mana, but he was able to defeat the minotaur through sheer overwhelming skill.\u201c...That\u2026seems to be the case,\u201d Lovellian slowly picked up his jaw off the ground before replying.Everything in that labyrinth had been created by Lovellian, both the traps and the monsters. He hadn\u2019t made them too difficult so that they could match the children\u2019s levels\u2026 but that child named Eugene had broken through the labyrinth with much more ease than Lovellian had expected.Lovellian felt the need to ask, \u201c...That child\u2026just what on earth is he?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d Gilead shook his head, still laughing. \u201cThat child\u2019s father is apparently named Gerhard Lionheart, from the Gidol Province. He\u2019s from a collateral line that\u2019s been separated from the main line for around two hundred years now, but, as far as I know, not a single member of that family has ever drawn any attention until now.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 how could such an exceptional child come from such\u2026?\u201d\u201cWho knows. He says that he wasn\u2019t taught by his father or any other knight, but\u2014\u201d Gilead burst out laughing before he could finish the sentence. \u201cBut his potential is indescribable. They say that that child, Eugene, since he has first arrived at the main estate, has gone to the gymnasium every day to repeat the same harsh training daily. I\u2019ve also sent a man to Gidol, and he reports that Eugene\u2019s extreme training is well-known throughout the whole estate.\u201dEugene was a child who had defeated his son in a duel, so Gilead couldn\u2019t help but have an interest in him. That was why he had sent a knight to the Lionheart family estate in Gidol to ask about Eugene. The man had reported that Eugene had first started going to the gymnasium every day when he turned five; and when he turned seven, he started swinging a wooden sword with an iron core that had been steadily increasing in weight over time.\u201cThat boy was born to be a warrior, and he also has an innate hard-working character that is worthy of such a physique. Even if it was just by unearthing such a jewel in the rough\u2026 this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony will prove to be of great significance.\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t you even the slightest bit displeased?\u201d Lovellian asked in genuine curiosity. \u201cMy apologies if I cause any offense, but that child\u2026 has outshone all of your own children, Lord Gilead. If there\u2019s already such a difference between them, once that child begins training his mana\u2026. And if he also happens to have an equally great talent for handling mana\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf that happens to be the case, isn\u2019t that something to celebrate?\u201d Gilead replied with a grin. \u201cAfter all, doesn\u2019t that child\u2019s name happen to be Lionheart? That means the more extraordinary that boy is, the more he makes the name of Lionheart shine brightly.\u201d\u201c...But what if that child reveals any ambitions for usurping the direct line?\u201d Lovellion asked bluntly, after being unable to think of a way to soften the blow.However, Gilead didn\u2019t feel at all offended by such a question.\u201cThat isn\u2019t something for me to be concerned about,\u201d Gilead answered sincerely. \u201cOnly the very best among the Lionhearts has the right to become the Lionheart Patriarch. If my children fail to keep the position of Patriarch, that would just mean that they were too weak to keep a hold of their birthright. If that was all the strength that they had to offer, they wouldn\u2019t deserve to be the Lionheart Patriarch in the first place.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d Lovellian pondered.\u201cOf course, before I am the Patriarch, I am also their father; and as their father, I will guide my children to become the best that they can be. If that is still not enough\u2026 then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d Gilead shrugged in defeat.\u201cAs an outsider, my apologies for bringing up something that wasn\u2019t my place to address,\u201d Lovellian nodded slowly in understanding and waved his hands as the labyrinth started to disappear. \u201cHowever, Lord Gilead, as an old acquaintance, I feel that I must advise you. If at all possible, you must adopt that child.\u201d\u201c...Adoption?\u201d Gilead asked in confusion.\u201cYes. A collateral descendent has finally overturned the main family in a Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. That alone would make many of the Lionheart\u2019s collateral lines look down on the main family. If that happens, some of those dissatisfied with the current system may start to join forces.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gilead was silent for a moment. The Lionheart name had been passed down for over three hundred years. A multitude of collateral lines had been born due to their inheritance practices.Each collateral family was founded by someone born with the bloodline of the direct line but had lost the competition to become the Patriarch. There were definitely a few among these collateral lines who harbored dissatisfaction against the main family.\u201c...The Guardians are responsible for enforcing the family\u2019s laws,\u201d Gilead muttered with a bitter smile.While thoroughly forbidding any dynastic disputes, the Lionheart Guardians also suppressed any rebellious individuals.\u201cI thank you for your advice. As for an adoption\u2026 I think it\u2019s an attractive proposition,\u201d Gilead finished.To be honest, the boy was so outstanding that Gilead had wished Eugene was his own son. Also, it seemed like being adopted would be better for the child\u2019s future as well.If Eugene just returned to Gidol like this\u2026 the seditious families who plotted to rebel against the main family might try to contact him. And if that happened, that young child with a brilliant talent might even be kidnapped because of his gifts.\u2018...If I keep the boy by my side\u2026 He could also be a great motivator to my children.\u2019The more he thought about it, the more appealing the idea was. And wouldn\u2019t it make for an incredible sight when the child\u2019s potential was allowed to fully bloom in the still distant future? At that time, if Eugene still proved to be overwhelmingly superior to the children of the main family, then\u2026.Not only would his adoption be good for the main family, but it would also be a happy event for the Lionhearts as a whole.\u201c...Well, before that, the celebrations have to come first,\u201d Gilead mumbled as he turned his head.Both the labyrinth and the cave leading to it had disappeared. The children were looking at their surroundings with surprised expressions, having yet to understand their situation.\u201c...Haaagh!\u201d Gargith, who had been lying on the floor, jumped to his feet with a gasp.Following his battle with the troll, he had started heading towards the center, but he had used up the last of his strength on the way there and had collapsed into slumber. However, as the magic dissipated, all of his injuries also disappeared.\u201cWhat about the boss monster?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d Dezra spat out as she looked at Gargith with scornful eyes.\u201cWho killed it?\u201d he asked.\u201cI did,\u201d Eugene answered with a grin.1. A sensory organ needed to regulate the balance and convey head position.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had spent far too much time studying the various magical traps and monsters on his way there. Truthfully speaking, Gilead was dissatisfied with this result.He knew that his eldest son had had an overwhelming amount of interest in magic ever since he was young. Since this type of magic wasn\u2019t often encountered, it was understandable for Eward to be overcome with curiosity. However\u2026 for him to prioritize his own curiosity over displaying his talents during this vital Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, Gilead couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed, both as a Patriarch and a father.On the other hand, Ciel and Cyan\u2019s performances left him feeling quite satisfied. The twins had been able to make their way to the center without facing any great difficulty from the traps or the monsters. Although they couldn\u2019t defeat the minotaur, that was just because the two children were still immature. And immaturity could be compensated for with experience.\u201c...All of you showed a great performance,\u201d Gilead said as he stopped focusing solely on his children and addressed the remaining participants. He nodded his head sincerely as he smiled at everyone before continuing, \u201cFrom here, we were able to see everything as each of you faced the labyrinth. While we had expected it to be a challenging ordeal, all of you have done amazingly well.\u201d\u201c...Thank you very much,\u201d the children awkwardly received the praise.Gargith had been staring at Eugene with surprised eyes, now quickly followed suit and bowed his head along with the others. Honestly, he was feeling a little embarrassed. After his fierce battle with the troll, he hadn\u2019t been able to make it to the center of the labyrinth.Dezra and Cyan also felt similar embarrassment, but for slightly different reasons. Dezra wasn\u2019t even able to mount a proper fight against the minotaur; and Cyan had allowed himself to get flustered when his sword-light failed to materialize, causing him to fight in a manner that, even in his own opinion, was lackluster.\u201cEugene,\u201d Gilead said.Eugene, who had just been called out, was grinning. He was amused that Cyan\u2019s shoulders were drooping so heavily, although he was also feeling a little curious. Inside the labyrinth, he hadn\u2019t caught even a glimpse of Eward, the main family\u2019s eldest son. Though he had thought that Eward seemed to lack the expected skill and confidence for someone of his position, Eugene had never imagined that Eward wouldn\u2019t even be able to make it to the center of the maze. Perhaps that was why Eward was also slouching his shoulders and avoiding everyone\u2019s gazes.\u201c...Although it seems funny for me to point out the obvious like this, you showed the best performance among all of the nine children who participated in this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201d\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Eugene said while bowing his head in a humble fashion.He thought it would be more appealing to give off a modest impression than acting overly proud.\u201cThe way you dealt with the traps and the monsters was impressively flawless. Especially when you fought the troll head-on. Unlike the other children\u2026 you didn\u2019t even receive any minor injuries in the process,\u201d Gilead continued his praise.\u2018No way,\u2019\u00a0Gargith exclaimed inwardly.Gilead\u2019s words made Gargith\u2019s shoulders tremble in shock. Did Eugene really not get injured at all while fighting that vicious troll? Gargith glanced at Eugene with a look of disbelief.\u2018How could he have done that when he\u2019s shorter and has fewer muscles than me?\u2019\u00a0Gargith asked himself. He really was impressive. Gargith\u2019s thoughts gave way to sincere admiration for Eugene, but at the same time, he also felt disappointed.\u00a0\u2018If only he had the help of our family\u2019s revolutionary muscle growth agent, that poor body of his would also appear equally amazing,\u2019\u00a0was Gargith\u2019s thought at this time.\u00a0\u2018As he is now, I\u2019d win in an arm-wrestling contest.\u2019Gargith decided that he needed to challenge Eugene to an arm-wrestling contest later.\u201cTruthfully, we expected all of you to be trapped in the labyrinth for at least two days,\u201d Lovellian said with a smile that didn\u2019t show any hint of embarrassment.Lovellian and Gilead had set reasonable expectations for the participants. After all, no matter how excellent they were, weren\u2019t they all still children younger than sixteen? Moreover, none of the children had ever been to a labyrinth in person. Lovellian had estimated that, after placing various sorts of obstacles in their way, the children would have to wander the labyrinth for more than a day before they could break through.\u2018But as expected of the bloodline of the Great Vermouth. It seems that I greatly underestimated them.\u2019Of course, this fact didn\u2019t cause him any embarrassment or offense. After all, seeing these gemstones of talent sparkle brighter than imagined could only be a pleasant surprise.\u201cApart from Eugene, everyone else should return to their rooms and rest. I would have liked to hold a grand banquet this evening; however\u2026 we didn\u2019t know that you would all emerge so quickly, and I\u2019m afraid that we weren\u2019t able to prepare the banquet in advance.\u201dAfter informing the other children, Gilead turned to Eugene with a smile.\u201cAs such, all of you can have a good rest today, and we will hold the banquet tomorrow. As for Eugene\u2026 you can come with me.\u201d\u201cYes sir,\u201d Eugene acknowledged.\u201cAre you going to give him his reward right now?\u201d Ciel asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.The underground treasure vault was a forbidden location, even to those who had inherited the blood of the main family; only the Patriarch was freely permitted to enter. From a young age, Ciel had pestered her father for permission to visit the underground treasure vault with him, but even Gilead, who had such a soft spot for his daughter, wouldn\u2019t allow her to accompany him into the treasure vault even once.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to delay, so wouldn\u2019t it be better if he got to choose more quickly?\u201d Gilead said as he patted Ciel on the head.Truthfully, Gilead was also curious to see which item Eugene would pick from the treasure vault.Lovellion personally escorted the other children back to their rooms, while Eugene and Gilead headed to the main family\u2019s mansion. They had quite a ways to go, so they both began thinking of bringing up something to talk about.\u201cYou\u2019re quite skillful to be able to wield multiple weapons,\u201d commented Gilead, breaking the silence.Although he didn\u2019t look back at Eugene, thanks to the warmth in his voice, it was easy to guess his current expression.\u201cI\u2019m not too bad,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cYou\u2019re more than not bad. I saw your performance in the labyrinth, and the way you wielded both your sword and your shield was truly adept. Moreover, didn\u2019t you use a spear to defeat Cyan and Dezra?\u201dGilead seemed to have heard the full story of Eugene\u2019s spar with Dezra. This wasn\u2019t surprising, as their spar had taken place in the open, where any of the annex\u2019s servants could have spectated it.\u201cYes. I like the spear because it\u2019s a fun weapon to use,\u201d Eugene responded.\u201cAnd swords?\u201d Gilead prodded.\u201cSwords are fun as well.\u201d\u201cApart from those, what other weapons do you enjoy using?\u201d\u201cUmmm\u2026 I also like bows. Although shooting something from afar isn\u2019t that fun, hitting a target from a long distance can be exhilarating.\u201dEugene tried to use an age-appropriate tone when speaking with Gilead. Truthfully, at the start of his new life, he hadn\u2019t felt like he would need to do something like this; Eugene had thought that it would be fine to just admit that he was reincarnated with the memories of his old life.However, the more he had thought about it, the more difficult he felt it would be to reveal the truth. If he were to admit that he used to be Stupid Hamel, but he was now reincarnated as Vermouth\u2019s descendant, who would believe such a ridiculous confession without any proof? Also, he felt like it would be galling to admit that he had been reincarnated as a descendant of Vermouth with his own mouth.\u2018And it\u2019d be just so embarrassing.\u2019It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if he had just admitted it from the beginning. But he had already been pretending to be a child for thirteen years\u2026. If he revealed the truth at this point, it felt like all he would receive were gazes of pity. With Eugene\u2019s pride, it was absolutely impossible to welcome such pitying looks.\u2018It also seems like things would get troublesome.\u2019Not much was known about the journey of the hero and his companions from three hundred years ago. After suddenly abandoning their subjugation of the remaining demon kings, the returning hero\u2019s party hadn\u2019t revealed much about their reasons for their sudden change of plan or the details of their journey. Right to this day, that damn fairy tale was the most famous and reputable account of the hero\u2019s journey in the world.The Stupid Hamel, as he was known in the fairy tale, had been reincarnated as the Great Vermouth\u2019s descendant\u2014 if this fact were to get out, the world would be turned upside down. Eugene didn\u2019t want to deal with the flood of people coming in from every corner of the world to ask him about the facts of their journey.But that wasn\u2019t his only reason.Eugene\u2014no\u2014Hamel refused to tolerate the continued existence of the Demon Kings. This hate-filled conviction had not changed even after three hundred years had passed. If somehow, the two remaining demon kings in the Devildom of Helmuth were to learn of Hamel\u2019s reincarnation, they might begin moving behind the scenes.Those two had claimed complete devotion to a peaceful existence for hundreds of years and had even willingly opened Helmuth to tourism. But how would these demon kings, who had seemingly flipped their attitudes out of the blue, react to a living witness of their past atrocities? Eugene had given it a lot of thought, but it didn\u2019t seem like they would welcome him with open arms.Well, even if they did, it\u2019s not like Eugen would accept their favor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a reason for the Great Vermouth to be called the God of War and the Master-of-All,\u201d said Gilead.As for why their family had been tied to the sword in the first place, it was all because of the Holy Sword, which had received the most acclaim among Vermouth\u2019s many weapons.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for you to know how to wield a variety of weapons, especially since you find these various weapons fun to use. It could even be considered an innate gift.\u201d\u201cThank you for your guidance,\u201d said Eugene.\u201cOf course, just because Vermouth was called by these titles, that doesn\u2019t mean he was the only one capable of using various weapons.\u201d\u201c...I heard that Hamel was also able to wield several weapons,\u201d Eugene said after a brief pause.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although Vermouth was called the God of War, his companion Hamel was also a master warrior, second only to Vermouth,\u201d Gilead readily agreed.\u201c...Ahem. But in the fairy tale I\u2019ve read, he keeps getting called Stupid Hamel.\u201d\u201cHaha! Well, that can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ve also read that fairy tale when I was young, but\u2026 I\u2019ve realized that it wouldn\u2019t be a very interesting tale without Hamel constantly getting into trouble. What do you think about Hamel?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re asking, sir.\u201d\u201cI just want to hear your opinion. As for me\u2026 I\u2019ve admired Hamel ever since I was young.\u201d\u2018Oh?\u2019\u00a0Eugene quickly swallowed the unconscious exclamation he had almost made.\u201c...May I ask why?\u201d Eugene asked, unable to leave the matter alone.\u201cRather than the flawless Vermouth, I preferred Hamel\u2019s more humane character. Doesn\u2019t it often come up in the fairytale? Hamel often felt inferior to Vermouth, but he never once allowed himself to be frustrated.\u201d\u2018But there were actually a lot of times I felt frustrated.\u2019\u201cInstead, he spared no effort to overcome his own perceived shortcomings. And in the end, he didn\u2019t care about his own safety but instead chose to sacrifice himself for his comrades. Even now, I respect Hamel more than I do my own ancestor, Vermouth.\u201dHamel\u2019s portrayal was deliberately flanderized[1]\u00a0in the fairy tale. It was because he was meant to serve as a simple lesson for young children: no matter how excellent the people around you are, don\u2019t be overly jealous of them. Rather than doing that, you should slowly try to improve yourself instead.\u201c...I also admire Hamel,\u201d Eugene replied while having complex feelings about doing so. \u201cBut the reason I use multiple weapons, well\u2026. It isn\u2019t because I want to become like Hamel or Vermouth or anything like that.\u201dEugene felt the need to explain himself. Although he didn\u2019t know if Gilead accepted his explanation, Gilead nodded his head with a grin.\u201cAs someone who isn\u2019t even a member of the main family, you will be the first person other than a Patriarch to step foot into the family\u2019s treasure vault,\u201d Gilead changed the subject.While receiving astonished stares from the servants, the two headed down to the basement. Although the stairs leading from the mansion to the basement were very long, glowing spheres were hanging from the walls every so often, so it wasn\u2019t dark.\u201cIs it really okay for me to go down there?\u201d Eugene inquired.\u201cOf course it is. Didn\u2019t I promise you that you\u2019ll be allowed to pick whichever item you desire? I\u2019ve already discussed this matter with the council of the family elders and obtained permission,\u201d as he said this, Gilead led the way down the stairs.The council. Eugene felt his mouth turn dry at the thought of them. The old lions of the Lionheart clan, the council was composed of the direct line\u2019s previous Patriarchs and those from the collateral lines recognized as giants in their respective fields before they retired.\u201cMay I ask, what exactly is contained inside the treasure vault?\u201d\u201cIt holds our family legacy, which has built up over the past few hundred years, of course. Among all these items, there are even quite a few relics left behind by our ancestor, the Great Vermouth.\u201d\u201cReally? Then is the Holy Sword in there as well?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s there, but\u2026 it\u2019s impossible for you to pick the Holy Sword,\u201d Gilead turned back to look at Eugene with a wry smile as if he had expected such a question. \u201cBecause the Holy Sword is the symbol of the Lionheart clan, it is a sword that no one person can own. Therefore, it is only wielded during ceremonies such as the succession of the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026,\u201d came Eugen\u2019s disappointed murmur.Gilead continued, \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason. Ever since the Great Vermouth, no one has been able to receive the recognition of the Holy Sword.\u201d\u201cRecognition?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026 rather than trying to explain it, it would be better for you to have a go at it yourself. Then you\u2019ll be able to understand what I\u2019m talking about right away.\u201dAt the bottom of the stairs stood an ornately decorated, massive door. Gilead held his hand up to the door after cutting his fingertips with his fingernails, causing red drops of blood to form on all his fingers.\u201cThis will take a moment.\u201dWith his blood-tipped fingers, Gilead reached for the doorknob. The doorknob had been sculpted in the shape of a lion\u2019s head with its mouth opened wide. The lion absorbed the drops of blood on Gilead\u2019s fingertips and closed its mouth, just as the engravings adorning the door began to wriggle. All of this was part of a rite to unlock the powerful barrier that had been set on the treasure vault using magic. Eugene took a few steps back and watched as the door began to move.\u201cWill you be entering with me, Patriarch?\u201d he asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ll wait here, so just go in and choose whatever you want.\u201dThe door opened fully.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to open this door from the inside. So once you\u2019ve finished making your choice, knock loudly on the door. That will let me know when to open it,\u201d Gilead explained.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to come in with me?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cWhile I believe that it might be fun to watch as you pick something\u2026. If I go in with you, I may end up unconsciously influencing what item you pick, and I would rather respect your freedom of choice. Also, If I do go in with you, I feel that I might distract you.\u201dBy saying all this, Gilead was showing his consideration for Eugene. Eugene smiled brightly and nodded his head. Although he had brought it up first, Eugene felt greatly excited that Gilead had decided not to go in with him. He wanted to get a close look at everything and have a poke at this and that. Truthfully speaking, if Gilead were to go in with him, Eugene would have to pay attention to his manners and avoid such conduct.\u201cBut Patriarch, what\u2019s stopping me from hiding something on my person and attempting to come out with multiple items?\u201dThis type of daring and impolite question was something that only a thirteen-year-old like Eugene would be allowed to ask. So Eugene made sure to look up at Gilead to show off his innocent eyes that were free of malice. Although he wasn\u2019t sure if his face truly managed to reflect his intentions, for now, he at least tried to contort his features into such an expression.\u201cThat isn\u2019t something that is likely to happen, now is it?\u201d Gilead replied to his question with a smile that showed no displeasure. \u201cIf that were to happen, I would be forced to scold you. And as these treasures are strictly guarded by magic, you would be caught as soon as you attempted to come out with something you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Eugene laughed awkwardly.\u2018As expected,\u2019\u00a0Eugene exclaimed inwardly, without feeling any disappointment.Gilead offered, \u201cStill, allow me to give you a piece of advice. Don\u2019t be in a rush, and slowly take your time to choose a weapon that you\u2019ll be able to use for the rest of your life. In your case, rather than focussing on its performance\u2026 I believe that it would be better for you to choose something that catches your eye and suits you.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201dGilead stepped out of the way, clearing the door to the treasure vault. Eugene nodded his head and approached the door with hesitant steps.\u201cThank you very much for this opportunity,\u201d before entering, Eugene turned and politely expressed his gratitude.Gilead smiled and patted Eugene on the shoulder. The thought of adopting Eugene was running through his mind. However, there was no need to bring up such a topic right now, as it wasn\u2019t a matter that should be rushed into hastily.As Eugene entered, the door to the treasure vault closed behind him. Once it did so, Eugen could finally take a deep breath and loosen his polite expression. Smiling too much had numbed his cheeks, so he patted them a few times before taking a long look around the treasure vault.Immediately after he had done so, a smile inadvertently spread across his face as he exclaimed, \u201c...Wow.\u201dVermouth\u2019s Holy Sword, the splendid golden sword from his memories, stood in the center of the treasure vault. With a grin, Eugene walked towards the center of the room.1.\u00a0The deliberate exaggeration of one aspect of a fictional character to the point where that one trait grows to encompass most of that character's personality.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 18.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18.1: The Treasure Vault (2)The Holy Sword was still just as extraordinarily beautiful as when he had first seen it three hundred years ago. It was a weapon that was impossible to consider as merely a \u2018sword\u2019 used for cutting things.It was unknown what type of metal the sword was made from. According to the legends of the Holy Empire, the home of the Holy Sword, it was a sword that had been bestowed by God.\u2018It\u2019s surprising that the Holy Empire didn\u2019t try to take back the Holy Sword.\u2019Eugene circled around the Holy Sword, studying it from all angles. It had a beautiful scabbard and a long hilt that was best suited to being wielded with both hands. The blade itself wasn\u2019t visible, but Eugene clearly remembered just how beautifully and dazzlingly the Holy Sword shone when pulled free of its scabbard.He had to admit that he wanted it. Such a desire couldn\u2019t be helped. After all, this was a sword personally bestowed by a God. The Holy Sword had been sealed in the central temple of the Holy Empire for a long period of time and it had accompanied them on their journey through the Devildom of Helmuth after recognizing Vermouth as its sole owner.Although Vermouth himself didn\u2019t end up using the Holy Sword all that often, this did not diminish the importance and value of the Holy Sword. This beautiful sword had cut down countless demons and had even pierced the heart of the first to be slain from Helmuth\u2019s five Demon Kings.\u2018....Although after that, it was almost exclusively used as a torch.\u2019When they defeated their first Demon King, everyone was still immature. While recalling back to that time, Eugene reached his hand out to grab the Holy Sword. It wasn\u2019t like he had decided that he was going to be leaving with the Holy Sword, but for now, he just wanted to hold it.Eugene grabbed the Holy Sword\u2019s hilt with his right hand. The feeling of wrapping his fingers around the hilt was amazing. Although it outwardly looked like a ceremonial sword that had absolutely no use in actual combat, apart from this fact, it had actually been expertly crafted.\u201c...Hm.\u201dThe Holy Sword\u2019s scabbard was embedded deep into the floor of the treasure vault. Eugene tried to forcefully draw the sword, but the scabbard would not release its hold on the blade. Eugene grabbed the sword with both hands and tried to pull it out once more using all his strength.\u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d he eventually admitted.The Holy Sword was immovable. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t pull it out.Just in case, Eugene bit the tip of his fingers to draw blood, then brushed his blood-stained fingertips on the hilt and the sheath of the Holy Sword. The blood that was smeared on the sword immediately vanished into thin air. He tried to draw the sword once again, but it still refused to be drawn.\u2018Just like Gilead said, you\u2019ll know once you\u2019ve had a go at it yourself.\u2019Gilead had meant that it was impossible to draw the sword. Eugene didn\u2019t waste more of his strength on it and cast away any regret. Even if he had managed to draw the sword, it wasn\u2019t like he would have been allowed to keep it.He took another look around. Sure enough, the vault contained a lot of different types of treasure. Besides weapons, there were also many jewels and accessories. With shining eyes, Eugene began his exploration.\u2018This was\u2026 Azphel, right?\u2019Several weapons caught his eye. One was an unusual sword hanging on a wall; the edge of its blade had jagged protrusions that looked like the fangs of a beast. This was the \u2018Devouring Sword\u2019 Azphel. It could devour whatever it cut to increase its own strength.At first glance, its actual power seemed difficult to judge, but Eugene was well aware of how broken this sword could be. It was a sword that could cut magic, a mana-devouring sword. No matter how powerful the spell was, in front of Azphel, it would be worthless.\u2018Though only someone like Vermouth could use it to its full potential.\u2019It was only thanks to the fact that Vermouth was an excellent wizard in the first place that he was able to target a spell\u2019s weak point and crush it in a single blow. So despite feeling more attracted to it than he had with the Holy Sword, Eugene decided to set it aside for now.Besides this sword, several other familiar weapons had caught his eye.\u2018There\u2019s the Dragon Spear Kharbos.\u2019Although its cooldown was a bit long, as long as you could compensate for that, it was a spear capable of unleashing an attack as powerful as a dragon\u2019s breath with a single thrust.\u2018The Storm Sword Wynnyd.\u2019A sword imbued with the protection of the Wind Spirit King.\u2018The Thunderbolt Pernoa.\u2019A bow that shot bolts of lightning, which could cross any distance to reach its target.\u2018The Phantom Rain Sword Javel.\u2019A sword that could create countless flying copies of itself when mana was inserted.\u2018And they\u2019ve even got Gedon\u2019s Shield.\u2019A deceptive shield that could divert any attack that came into contact with it into a different direction.These were all weapons that could turn the world on its head if they got out. Eugene shook his head as he clicked his tongue in amazement. So it wasn\u2019t just that they were Vermouth\u2019s descendants; by holding the ownership of so many treasures, the Lionheart clan could back up its status as a great family. Even a dragon would lose its mind in envy when it saw how much treasure had been collected in this vault.\u2018...But is this really everything?\u2019Despite all that was here, Eugene still had his doubts. After all, this wasn\u2019t the entire range of weapons that he knew Vermouth had owned. He couldn't see the terrifying Moonlight Sword or the Demonic Spear he had really been coveting.\u2018The weapons here are only about half as good as those.\u2019This wasn\u2019t anything strange. After all, three hundred years had passed. During this time, quite a few weapons may have left the treasure vault, never to return.\u2018Bastards. They must have known a good thing when they saw it and snatched up all the really cheat weapons.\u2019Eugene kept clicking his tongue as he shook his head. Although the weapons that were left in the treasure vault were all amazing, he still felt regret for the weapons that weren\u2019t there.As a result of their loss, he had to prepare himself to make a difficult choice.\u2018None of them would count as a waste for me to take, but\u2026.\u2019There was nothing that really grabbed his desire. Since he was still young, he didn\u2019t have to worry about a lack of familiarity with it. No matter which weapon he chose, if he held onto it for a few years, he could slowly adapt to it until he could use it to his satisfaction.\u2018The easiest to deal with is Wynnyd, but\u2026.\u2019It was a sword that had been personally blessed by the Wind Spirit King. Just holding it in your hands would allow you to command the spirits of the wind and, of course, it enabled you to use spirit magic. Although it would be impossible for a while, as long as he kept accumulating enough mana, he would even be able to one day summon the Wind Spirit King himself.An advantage of this sword was that, unlike ordinary magic, spirit magic didn\u2019t consume a lot of the user's mana. Once the spirit was summoned, any further mana costs were taken care of by the spirit itself.\u2018And with it, there isn\u2019t a big demand for innate talent.\u2019Spirit Magic was usually difficult to get into. If they weren\u2019t born with the trait that made a person attractive to spirits, even an excellent wizard wouldn\u2019t be able to summon a low-class spirit. However, if one held Wynnyd, there wasn\u2019t any need to worry about that, as it bypassed all the requirements for spirit magic.\u2018Javel is tricky to wield. Azphel might be a good fit once I\u2019ve learned some magic, but it would be hard to use it well for now. Pernoa\u2026 from what I recall, it consumes a whole lot of mana for each shot it makes.\u2019The Dragon Spear Kharbos didn\u2019t fit Eugene\u2019s tastes. As for Gedon\u2019s Shield? It did have quite the cheat ability, but just like the Thunderbolt Pernoa, it consumed an enormous amount of mana each time.\u2018Wynnyd is definitely the most convenient to use.\u2019Although he had come to this conclusion, Eugene didn\u2019t select it immediately. Instead, Eugene kept looking around the treasure vault with an aimless gait. In addition to these weapons, there were several other treasures that Vermouth had also used.\u2018These magic staffs\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how good they are.\u2019And there were quite a number of magic staffs at that. Since he was still young, he had thought about learning magic as well, but he didn\u2019t want to choose a focus without knowing anything about it.\u2018...Oh?\u2019Having wandered here and there through the treasure vault, Eugene halted in his steps. His eyes widened in surprise as he looked at the inside corner of a shelf. He quickly walked over and reached into the corner.Lying there was a small necklace.\u2018...Why is this here?\u2019Eugene held up the necklace and blinked in shock. It wasn\u2019t anything special. There was no great magic imbued into it, nor did it have any important symbolism.It was just an ordinary necklace filled with memories, for it was the necklace that Hamel had worn in his previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the sadness from that event had long since been converted into hate, after all, and Hamel had eventually taken revenge for their deaths with his own hands.Nevertheless, Hamel had continued to wear it around his neck until the day he died. It wasn\u2019t like there was any discomfort to be had from walking around with the necklace on and there had never been any particular reason for him to take it off. He had expected that this necklace had been buried with him.Or at least that was how it should have been.Eugene stood there, holding up the necklace for quite some time. His state of paralyzation was because he just couldn\u2019t understand what the necklace was doing here.\u2018...Could Vermouth have retrieved my body from Helmuth?\u2019But none of the weapons that Hamel had wielded were stored in this treasure vault. The only thing in here that was in any way connected to Hamel was this worn-out necklace.Eugene snorted as his hand wrapped around the necklace.\u2018....It looks like they didn\u2019t just forget about me.\u2019For some reason, he had a bitter taste in his mouth.To someday kill all five of the Demon Kings, that was the promise that everyone had vowed to each other. But despite this\u2026 Vermouth, Molon, Sienna, and Anise\u2014those four had made an \u2018oath\u2019 of peace with the Demon Kings. Even though three hundred years had passed since then, Helmuth and its two Demon Kings were still alive and well.\u2018...Just what exactly did they swear in that oath? Even though you retrieved my belongings and laid them to rest here, all of you\u2026especially you, Vermouth\u2026just what were you thinking?\u2019Eugene couldn\u2019t put down the necklace.Since he had even gotten the chance to reincarnate, he didn\u2019t want to get too bogged down with his past life. Even so, no matter how faint, the attachments to his previous life still existed. This necklace had stirred up a number of feelings that Eugene had been trying to ignore.He suddenly had a thought. This necklace was an item that didn\u2019t belong here. It belonged to Hamel after all.He didn\u2019t want to resent Vermouth and his other comrades. Since he believed that they must have had a reason for not being able to slay the remaining Demon Kings.The Faithful Anise, the woman from his memories, was so cheeky and annoying that it was hard to believe she had become a saint, but her faith had been real. If even Anise had agreed to pull back at the last step, then they must have had an unavoidable reason for not killing the Demon Kings.\u2018...It might have been that they lacked the strength to do so after I died.\u2019After all, the last two Demon Kings were terrifyingly strong.Although it embarrassed him to even think this idea to himself, he had to admit this was a possibility.\u201cWhat a pointless find,\u201d Eugene grumbled as he turned around.He still wanted one of the weapons, but he couldn\u2019t bear to leave this necklace, the keepsake belonging to Hamel, inside the Lionheart\u2019s treasure vault.That was his only reason.\u201c...That is?\u201d Gilead exclaimed with a surprised expression as he opened the vault door.His surprise was because he had made various guesses for what Eugene might choose, but he had never imagined that Eugune would actually return from the treasure vault after choosing a completely ordinary necklace.\u201c...It called to me,\u201d Eugene said with an awkward smile as he held up the necklace to display.Gilead blinked his surprise as he alternated between looking at Eugene and the necklace.\u201c...Are you sure about this?\u201d Gilead asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cBut there should be many other more amazing treasures\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs I\u2019m too inexperienced, I felt that I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them,\u201d Eugene recited his prepared excuse. However, even he found it hard to believe.Gilead felt increasingly confused as he thought about it. Of course, a child wouldn\u2019t be able to fully assess the values of the treasures within, but weren\u2019t there many weapons that appeared extraordinary just from their appearances? Could Eugene really have declined such treasures to pick a necklace like this?\u2018...And what exactly is it?\u2019What made Gilead even more bewildered was that he did not recognize the necklace Eugene had carried out with him. Did the Treasure Vault really have a necklace like that?And of course, there were a lot of other accessories inside the vault that were all so expensive that just one could be exchanged for a whole castle. Gilead would have accepted and understood Eugene\u2019s excuse if he had chosen such a trinket. Since there was nothing that had caught Eugene\u2019s eye right at that moment, he could have chosen to take something that seemed expensive and valuable so that he could somehow put the funds from selling it to later use.\u201c...Do you mind if I take a look at it for a moment?\u201d Gilead requested.\u201cPlease, go ahead,\u201d Eugene handed the necklace over with a nod of his head.As soon as Gilead received the necklace, he scanned it all over. But it was just a crudely-made and worn-out\u2026 necklace. No jewels were embedded, nor was the workmanship extraordinary. Even when he inserted his mana, there was no reaction in response.This was simply an ordinary and cheap necklace.\u2018...Why was such a necklace inside the treasure vault?\u2019The more he looked at it, the more Gilead failed to understand. He hesitated for a moment and then looked at Eugene.\u201cPlease wait here for a moment,\u201d Gilead ordered\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene replied with an unbothered expression.He understood why Gilead would feel so confused. Even in the privacy of his own thoughts, Eugene felt that choosing such a necklace was a very foolish decision. However, it couldn\u2019t be helped. Since he couldn\u2019t just leave it there, he had to bring it out with him.\u201c...Hm\u2026\u201d while letting out a curious hum, Gilead took the necklace and held it up to the treasure vault\u2019s door.Everything inside the vault, the honor and glory that the clan had accumulated over three hundred years, had been recorded by the magic of the treasure vault.\u201c...This is quite\u2026a mystery.\u201d After holding the necklace up to the lion on the doorknob, Gilead shook his head. \u201cThis necklace isn\u2019t an item that has been registered by the treasure vault.\u201d\u201c...What does that mean?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cExactly what I said. This isn\u2019t a treasure of the Lionhearts. This is an item that shouldn\u2019t have been in there.\u201d\u201c...But then why was it in there?\u201d\u201cThat is why I said that is quite a mystery. I\u2026 do not recall ever leaving this necklace inside there. Where did you find this?\u201d\u201cIn the inside corner of a shelf.\u201d\u201cCould this item have been left behind by the previous Patriarch\u2026? But if that was the case, then it should have been registered by the treasure vault\u2019s magic\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the previous Patriarch may have just lost it inside there,\u201d Eugene offered as an explanation.\u201cHaha,\u201d Gilead involuntarily burst into laughter. \u201cMy father, the previous Patriarch, wasn\u2019t such a sloppy person. Nor was he the type of person who would play such a strange prank\u2026.\u201dEugene was about to ask why Gilead didn\u2019t just ask the previous Patriarch personally, but then he remembered and stopped himself. Gilead\u2019s father, the former Patriarch, had already passed away long ago.\u201c...In any case, do you still want to keep this necklace?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo real reason, it\u2019s just\u2026 it calls to me.\u201d\u201cThis necklace doesn\u2019t seem to be valuable. It doesn\u2019t have any enchantments either. So even if you sold it, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to buy a cheap longsword.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s exactly right,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought in agreement as he nodded his head.\u201cBut I would still like to keep it,\u201d is what Eugene ended up saying.\u201c...You really are quite special,\u201d Gilead commented.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that a lot from my father ever since I was young.\u201d\u201cIf you really want to keep this necklace\u2026 then it can\u2019t be helped. However, I can\u2019t let you have it right away. Since the origins of this item are unknown, I\u2019ll have to ask Lovellian to examine it.\u201d\u201cAn examination?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although I\u2019ve checked it myself, I don\u2019t really have any skill in magic. Just in case it does have some kind of enchantment, it feels like it would be better to have it looked over by a professional.\u201d\u201cSo I can have it back once the examination is over?\u201d\u201c...That\u2019s right, I\u2019ll even promise you that I\u2019ll return it once the results are in.\u201dAfter Gilead nodded his head, he was silent for a moment.\u201c...About this necklace, it might have some kind of enchantment, or it might just be an ordinary necklace without any special qualities. However, since it is clearly not an item that has been registered by the treasure vault, that means it shouldn\u2019t have been in there in the first place,\u201d Gilead said when he finally broke the silence.\u201c...Yes,\u201d Eugene replied, unsure of where this was going.\u201cAlthough I really didn\u2019t think things could turn out like this\u2026 Eugene, strictly speaking, the item you brought back with you is not a treasure of the Lionhearts.\u201dFor a moment, Gilead hesitated. Would this really be allowed?\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be any problems with this,\u2019 Gilead thought as he patted Eugene\u2019s shoulder with a wry smile.\u201cAs that\u2019s the case, go back inside and only come out after you\u2019ve picked something else.\u201dEugene barely managed to restrain the exclamation of sheer surprise that he almost blurted out unconsciously and instead asked, \u201c...Can I really?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. After all, I promised you that if you were the first to defeat the minotaur, you could go into the treasure vault and come out with whichever piece of treasure you desired. But Eugene, you didn\u2019t come out with a piece of a treasure, so go back in and return with whatever you like.\u201d\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Eugene shouted in gratitude, even as he thought to himself,\u00a0\u2018I really can\u2019t believe that Gilead is Vermouth\u2019s descendant.\u2019Eugene bowed his head deeply towards Gilead, even as he held back a laugh. He had never imagined that Gilead would show such flexibility by giving him another chance to pick up a piece of treasure.\u2018I\u2019ve decided, it\u2019s you,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought upon returning to the treasure vault. He grabbed Wynnyd without any hesitation.\u00a0\u2018From now on, you belong to me.\u2019As if it had read Eugene\u2019s mind, its silverish-blue blade shone with a gleam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 19.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19.1: The Treasure Vault (3)Although he now owned Wynnyd, it was impossible for Eugene to summon a spirit immediately. No matter how little mana was consumed by spirit magic, it still required a certain minimum amount of mana in the first place. As Eugene had yet to start training his mana, not even a speck of mana could be found in his body.Even for Eugene, this was a problem that he couldn\u2019t help but be concerned about.The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over. Now, Eugene was free of any restrictions on wielding real swords, and he could even start training his mana.As descendants of the Great Vermouth, the Lionheart family possessed a mana training scripture far superior to any other scripture belonging to a martial family, knight, or mercenary. After all, it was a scripture developed three hundred years ago and continually refined over that time.The Lionheart\u2019s collateral lines were all families that had been split off from the direct line, and their mana training scriptures also originated from there. But needless to say, only the foundations of their mana training scriptures bore any similarities to the main family\u2019s mana training scriptures. This caused the level of the collateral lines\u2019 mana training scriptures to fall so low that they couldn\u2019t even be compared to the main family\u2019s.This difference in quality further allowed the direct line to maintain its superiority over the collateral lines.\u2018As for our family\u2019s mana training scripture\u2026 although I haven\u2019t learned it yet, it should be nothing special.\u2019Eugene was sure of this fact. His family had already split off from the main family hundreds of years ago and, during all that time, no one from their bloodline had been able to improve their family\u2019s status.\u2018And my father\u2019s strength isn\u2019t all that great either.\u2019After he had turned ten, Eugene and his father had stopped their spars disguised as child\u2019s play. However, Eugene could easily recall Gerhard\u2019s thick belly, sluggish movements, and how Gerhard would lose his breath after only swinging his sword a few times.Gerhard had a habit of sighing that he didn\u2019t have any talent. As the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony drew closer, the number of times his father had said something along those lines with a tearful expression on his face had only increased.\u2018...Still, since it\u2019s based on the one from the main family, our mana training scripture shouldn\u2019t be that bad.\u2019If it really turned out to be so terrible that he couldn\u2019t put up with it, it wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t have any other means available to him. Although it might have been three hundred years ago, hadn\u2019t he still been strong enough to become the hero\u2019s companion? The mana training scripture that he had learned during his previous life should still have some use in modern times.\u2018If even it proves insufficient, I can try mixing it with our family\u2019s training scripture.\u2019Since he had prior experience, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to do so. Eugene was confident of this. Not to mention that his current body\u2019s traits were so exceptional that the one from his previous life couldn\u2019t even compare to it.\u2018Even in my previous life, I graduated from using sword-light immediately and went around waving sword-force, so there\u2019s no way that I won\u2019t be able to catch up in my current body.\u2019Creating a layer of mana around your sword was called sword-light. Sword-force was a step above that. How long had it taken him to reach sword-force in his previous life, again? It felt like he had been in his twenties\u2026. Eugene smacked his lips and fell into thought.The mana training scripture that Hamel had learned in his previous life was a cheap scripture commonly used by mercenaries. He had lost his hometown to a surprise invasion from monsters when he was only twelve, so he had become a mercenary in order to get revenge\u2026.It was a past that he didn\u2019t really want to recollect. In any case, he had made quite a name for himself while diligently practicing that cheap training scripture. Of course, he didn\u2019t practice it as it was and had instead modified the scripture to fit himself.First, he met Vermouth. Then he met Sienna, Anise, and Molon. He had received all sorts of advice from them. In particular, Vermouth had given him various bits of guidance even though he had never asked for them, and as for Sienna\u2026.\u2014You paid actual money for this garbage? Are you an idiot?\u2014Don\u2019t you think that your words are a bit harsh?\u2014Fool! Come here and sit down.\u2014Why?\u2014If I tell you to sit, then just sit! Now then, from the beginning, show me how you practice that piece of trash you bought. Because I\u2019m going to tear it apart and fix it for you!\u2026He had received a lot of help from her.He parted ways with Gilead at the main mansion. Gilead headed straight for Lovellian, while Eugene returned to the annex. Dezra, Gargith, and Nina were waiting for him in the annex\u2019s gymnasium.\u201cShow it to us!\u201d Dezra burst out as soon as she saw Eugene.As she came leaping towards him, her eyes were plainly fixed on Wynnyd, which was hanging from Eugene\u2019s waist.\u201c...Why didn\u2019t you choose a spear?\u201d\u201cIt was my choice.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re great with spears!\u201d\u201cWhere the hell were you looking back in the labyrinth? Didn\u2019t you see that I\u2019m great with a sword as well?\u201dDezra put on a sulky expression at this answer. She really felt that he was rude and annoying, so she wanted to somehow refute his words; but as the image of Eugene defeating the minotaur flashed through her head, she found it impossible to do so. Eugene definitely was just as good with using a sword as he was with wielding a spear.\u201cIt looks way too light,\u201d Gargith spoke up while rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \u201cWith your strength, a larger and heavier sword would have been a good fit. A weapon like a hammer or an ax would also have been good.\u201d\u201cLike I said, it was my choice.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be a bad weapon, just because it\u2019s light. Since it\u2019s not just any weapon, but one from the main family\u2019s treasure vault\u2026. So, how about it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018how about it?\u2019\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about our family\u2019s muscle-growth supplement. Since the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony is over, you should come back with me to my family\u2019s home. I\u2019ll talk you up to my father, so that he\u2019ll provide you with as many muscle-growth supplements as you need.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need any.\u201d\u201cIt has the best effect if you take it during your growth period. If we add your barbaric training on top of that, you\u2019ll definitely start seeing results soon. No, wait, instead of training on your own, let\u2019s train together.\u201dGargith wasn\u2019t just saying all this on a whim. He genuinely wanted to build a deep friendship with Eugene. After all, this was the first time in the history of the Lionheart clan that someone from the collateral lines had defeated those from the direct line during a Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201cAfter all, didn\u2019t you say that none of the knights back at your home in Gidol are able to teach you. However, our family has a lot of exceptionally skilled knights. Of course, the best among all of them is my father. So, if you come with me, my father will also offer you guidance,\u201d tempted Gargith.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Eugene insisted.\"Instead of talking with that pig-bastard, hurry up and draw your sword,\u201d Dezra butted her way into their conversation.\u201c...Nina,\u201d Eugene called out with a sigh as he gripped Wynnyd\u2019s hilt. \u201cGo tell the chef to prepare some food for me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already given the order to do so,\u201d Nina replied.\u201cWhat about the bathwater?\u201d\u201cI have arranged for that as well.\u201d\u201cAmazing job.\u201dWhile nodding his head in approval, Eugene drew Wynnyd. The smooth metallic sound it gave off as it slid out of its scabbard made the corners of Eugene\u2019s lips twitch upwards. Eugene stared down at the thin, silvery-blue length of the blade.Its edge was so sharp that it felt like one could cut themself with even the slightest touch, and as long as one inserted mana, this sword would allow them to summon spirits of the wind. Eugene was well aware of how powerful this sword was.Even without wrapping it in sword-light or sword-force, if one had the support of a wind spirit, they could create a blade of wind around the sword. When the sword was swung in this state, almost anything could be cut as if it were just a piece of paper. Not only that, it could shoot blades of wind at a distant foe and could even be used to block most attacks.Of course, without being able to summon a spirit, he couldn\u2019t currently use these functions.\u201cWhich sword is it?\u201d Dezra asked with sparkling eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s called Wynnyd,\u201d Eugene replied. \u201cThe Patriarch told me that this sword is imbued with the protection of the Wind Spirit King. Once I\u2019ve started training my mana, I might be able to summon spirits.\u201dInstead of relying on his own memories, Eugene relayed the explanation that he had received from Gilead. Dezra pouted and looked at Eugene with eyes full of envy.\u201c...It\u2019s an impressive sword, but\u2026 there should have been a lot of spears even more impressive than that. I was sure you would choose a spear,\u201d Dezra threw in her selfish opinion.\u201cWell, there were quite a lot of spears,\u201d Eugene teased.\u201cHey, did you see that one? The Dragon Spear Kharbos! The one that shoots out a dragon\u2019s breath attack with just a single stab. They say that it can even wipe out a mountain!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what it even looks like.\u201d\u201cWhat about the Demon Spear Luentos? Was it there? I like that spear the most. After all, it was the strongest one amongst all of the Great Vermouth\u2019s weapons.\u201dDezra\u2019s eyes grew hazy with desire. Perhaps because she wielded spears as her primary weapon, she held a lot of fascination for Vermouth\u2019s spears.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of Luentos as well. Wasn\u2019t that the spear used by the Demon King of Cruelty?\u201d Gargith said, nodding in appreciation.Remaining silent, Eugene returned Wynnyd to its sheath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 19.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19.2: The Treasure Vault (3)\u2018...The Demon King of Cruelty.\u2019Helmuth\u2019s second Demon King \u2014 Eugene could clearly recall just how terrifying and strong the Demon King of Cruelty had been.Three hundred years ago, in the Devildom of Helmuth, there had been five Demon Kings. Ranked according to their strength:No. 1. The Demon King of Destruction.No. 2. The Demon King of Incarceration.No. 3. The Demon King of Fury.No. 4. The Demon King of Cruelty.No. 5. The Demon King of Carnage.Vermouth and his companions had begun their conquest with the weakest, fifth-ranked Demon King.Eventually, Hamel had died in the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration.The Demon Spear Luentos was the spear used by the Demon King of Cruelty. After killing him, Vermouth became the spear\u2019s new master. Hamel had actually wanted to use that spear, but, as its name suggested, the Demon Spear gave off such terrible demonic power that no one could actually use it, other than Vermouth that is.\u201c...It\u2019s wrong to say that the Demon Spear Luentos is the strongest among all of the Great Vermouth\u2019s weapons. The strongest one is, of course, the Annihilation Hammer Jigollath,\u201d Gargith declared after some thought.\u201cThe Demon King of Cruelty was stronger than the Demon King of Carnage,\u201d Dezra argued in favor of her choice.\u201cThe ranks of the Demon Kings have nothing to do with the ranks of their weapons.\u201d\u2018Now that I think about it, the Annihilation Hammer was also missing,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought, tuning out the argument.Among all of Vermouth\u2019s weapons, the Annihilation Hammer and the Demon Spear were the only ones that had belonged to Demon Kings.\u2018It makes sense. Since those weapons are so foreboding, they can\u2019t just be left inside the treasure vault. Perhaps they were sealed somewhere else. In any case, those weapons cannot be used by anyone other than Vermouth.\u2019As they were weapons he had often coveted in his previous life, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel regret at not getting the chance to pick them.\u201cThe Demon Spear is stronger.\u201d\u201cNo, the Annihilation Hammer is stronger.\u201dGargith and Dezra had started to quarrel childishly. Eugene shook his head as he looked at the two of them and headed to the center of the gymnasium. Nina followed after Eugene in a hurry.\u201cThe dinner preparations should be finished soon,\u201d Nina reminded him.\u201cI\u2019ll be done soon as well,\u201d Eugene reassured her.Although he couldn\u2019t summon any spirits right now, even without its spirits, Wynnyd was a good sword.\u2018It\u2019s also the first real sword that I\u2019ve held in this life.\u2019Perhaps due to this, he was already feeling attached to it. Eugene pulled Wynnyd out of its sheath and ran his eyes down its blade. When he gently reached out and touched the flat of the blade, the chill of the metal sent a shiver up his spine. As he had expected, a true sword gave off a different feeling just from a touch. Even though it was much lighter than his iron-cored wooden sword, its nature as a weapon that could kill with a single slash proved the difference between it and a wooden sword.\u201cAs I said, the Demon Spear is stronger!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the Annihilation Hammer.\u201dThose two were still going strong. After looking at them with a pitying gaze, Eugene turned his focus back on Wynnyd.Both the Demon Spear and the Annihilation Weapon were such great weapons that even he found it difficult to choose which of them was superior. However, if he had to choose the greatest out of all of Vermouth\u2019s weapons, Eugene would make that choice without any hesitation.\u2018It\u2019s the Moonlight Sword.\u2019It was pure destruction in the form of a sword; even the Devildom of Helmuth had chosen to seal it away. Eugene remembered just how terrible that sword was. Although the Holy Sword was used to kill the fifth-ranked Demon King, it was rarely used in battle after Vermouth got his hands on the Moonlight Sword.Both the Demon King of Cruelty and the Demon King of Fury had been slain by the Moonlight Sword. Neither the Demon Spear nor the Annihilation Hammer, which Dezra and Gargith were making such a fuss about, could overcome the light of destruction emanated from the Moonlight Sword.Eugene set aside all thought of the Moonlight Sword and started to swing Wynnyd.Swish.The sword gave off a soft glow as a slow swing of its blade cut the air itself apart. From the tips of his toes to the top of his head, Eugene felt a shudder of elation rush through his body.\u201c...Wow\u2026.\u201d Nina softly exclaimed in admiration as Eugene slowly flowed through the movements of a sword dance.Even from the perspective of someone like Nina, who had no skill with swords, Eugene\u2019s sword dance seemed extraordinary. Gargith and Dezra\u2019s childish quarrel was also cut short as the two turned to watch Eugene\u2019s sword dance with mesmerized eyes.It wasn\u2019t amazingly fast, nor were there any astonishing techniques mixed into his movements. However, the eerie gleam emanated by Wynnyd blended perfectly with each movement in Eugene\u2019s sword dance, flowing smoothly from one movement to the next without any interruption.\u2018I definitely have to get him to come back with me,\u2019\u00a0Gargith thought as he gulped down his astonishment.\u2018...What should I say to get him to go with me? Shall I invite him to take a look around our home? It\u2019s still quite a long time until my birthday\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Dezra was also having similar thoughts.If only her birthday were closer, she would have been able to invite him to her birthday party as an excuse, but\u2026. Dezra\u2019s lips pouted in disappointment.* * *\u201c...It\u2019s an ordinary necklace,\u201d Lovellian said as he opened his eyes and handed the necklace he was holding back to Gilead. \u201cI have checked it thoroughly, but this item doesn\u2019t have any magic attached to it.\u201d\u201c...Is that so?\u201dAlthough he tried to sound casual, these words caused Gilead to feel some embarrassment. It really turned out to be an ordinary necklace without any magic at all. In fact, even calling it an ordinary necklace was over-the-top. After all, wasn\u2019t it just a worthless, worn-out necklace?But then why on earth had such a necklace been included with the main family\u2019s treasures? Eugene had told him that the necklace had been buried deep in an inside corner of a shelf. Gilead had been in the treasure vault several times to search for this-and-that weapon, but he had never once seen such a necklace before.\u2018And the necklace wasn\u2019t even registered with the magic of the treasure vault in the first place.\u2019That meant someone else must have brought it in with them, but who? The late former Patriarch hadn\u2019t been the type to play such meaningless pranks. If that were the case, what about his other ancestors? But that still left the question, what reason could they have had for even doing so?\u201cWas this necklace really inside the treasure vault?\u201d Lovellian checked.\u201cYes,\u201d Gilead confirmed.\u201c...Could that boy, Eugene, have been playing a prank on you?\u201d\u201cWhat reason could he have for doing so?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026. From what I saw of him in the labyrinth, he has quite the cunning and mean-spirited side. Perhaps he snuck in with something that already belonged to him and picked that instead of something more expensive in order to leave a good impression on the Patriarch?\u201d Lovellian cleared his throat and carefully started speaking. \u201cHonestly speaking, Lord Gilead\u2026 you must have felt at least somewhat pleasantly surprised when Eugene returned with such a worthless necklace instead of something priceless.\u201d\u201c...I can\u2019t really deny that,\u201d Gilead admitted with a wry smile. \u201cHowever, isn\u2019t he just a thirteen-year-old child? I can\u2019t imagine that a boy like Eugene would be able to predict how I would feel about it and come up with a plan like this.\u201d\u201cIt would have definitely been a huge risk to take. He was lucky that Lord Gilead was able to show such a generous mindset; with just a bit of carelessness, he could have also lost his chance at a guaranteed piece of treasure.\u201dLovellian was only airing a few idle suspicions. Even he didn\u2019t really believe that Eugene could have come up with such a scheme. After pondering for a few moments longer, Lovellian held out his hand to Gilead.\u201cAllow me to check it just once more,\u201d Lovellian requested.\u201cHaven\u2019t you already finished all your scans?\u201d Gilead asked.\u201cI have confirmed that there is no magic hidden within the necklace. However, now that I\u2019ve also gotten a little curious about its origins, I\u2019d like to dig a little deeper into it.\u201d\u201cHow do you mean to do so?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 how should I explain this? To put it simply, I\u2019ll read the memories of the necklace from when it was young.\u201d Lovellian continued speaking with a wry smile, \u201cMana exists everywhere in this world. While it\u2019s impossible to communicate with mana directly, I know a spell that will allow me to read mana\u2019s \u2018memory.\u2019 It is a spell created by the esteemed teacher of our school, the Wise Sienna.\u201dLovellian was unable to hide the pride that he felt as he finished his explanation. That was just how amazing this spell and its creator were. In the history of magic, the only wizard to discover a way to interact with mana in such a manner was the Wise Sienna.\u201c...Then I\u2019ll be counting on you,\u201d instead of sharing in Lovellian\u2019s admiration, Gilead simply handed the necklace back to him.While feeling disappointed in his heart that Gilead didn\u2019t seem to recognize the greatness of Sienna, Lovellian took the necklace. Then, focussing his concentration, he started to resonate with the mana of the necklace.Mana existed everywhere in the world. Most objects also contained some amount of mana. Even if it was too meager to exhibit any mystical effects, it was still possible to read the memory contained within the mana.\u201c...Mmm\u2026,\u201d a moan escaped from Lovellian\u2019s lips as he concentrated so hard sweat drops formed on his forehead. \u201c...There really isn\u2019t anything. It seems to be an item from around a hundred years ago. This is\u2026 the capital? On the side of the street\u2026 it was sold there. Then\u2026 mmm\u2026 I can\u2019t read anything more from this point. It seems likely that magic of the treasure vault stopped the mana from recording any more memories.\u201d\u201cA hundred years ago\u2026.\u201d Gilead trailed off.\u201cAround that time, yes.\u201dThat meant this necklace went back several generations. Currently, there wasn\u2019t even anyone left from that time to ask about the origin of this necklace. In the end, he could only speculate that the Patriarch from several generations ago had decided to set this up as a prank for some unknown reason.\u201cSo, what are you going to do with this necklace?\u201d Lovellian asked.\u201cSince it doesn\u2019t have any magic imbued within, I\u2019ll just give it to that boy, Eugene. After all, he wanted it so much that he even passed up the opportunity to choose a treasure,\u201d Gilead explained.\u201cThere was no need to go that far. I guess the boy must have really liked it,\u201d Lovellian seemed perplexed.\u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason for why he shouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d Gilead replied with a smile.Lovellian returned the smile and handed back the necklace.Lovellian was the Head of the Red Tower of Magic. However, even he could not discover that this necklace was the very necklace that Hamel had worn three hundred years ago.The mana reading he had performed had managed to deceive Lovellian.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Usually, at around this time, he would have been doing some training to help digest his dinner.\u00a0Fortunately, the invitation had come with enough spare warning that there was no need for him to head to the main mansion while reeking of sweat like last time.Eugene had washed and put on some formal clothes while being fussed over by Nina. Upon exiting the annex once he was done, he found that all the servants were already waiting outside.\u201cHey there!\u201dThey were all out here because of the man who had just greeted Eugene in a cheerful tone. He was Gion Lionheart, Patriarch Gilead Lionheart\u2019s youngest brother. Gion was known to be an oddball who had chosen to tag along on Gilead\u2019s training trip and, even at his age, had yet to be married.\u201cM-master Gion!\u201d Nina cried out in surprise before bowing her head deeply.Following her lead, Eugene also bowed his head low, though he glanced up at Gion to get a look at him. If Gion had gotten married at the usual age, he might have already had a son about as old as Eugene, but the man still looked unbelievably young for his true age.However, his gray hair, which could be called a trademark of the Lionheart line, gave him a mature atmosphere despite his youthful face. This was due in a large part to the color of his hair, which looked almost white at first glance.\u2018Vermouth also had the same kind of hair.\u2019Though, unlike Gion, Vermouth\u2019s expressions had always been just as bleak as his hair.It seemed as if Eugene couldn\u2019t escape his blood-ties to Vermouth, no matter what, as despite being from a collateral line, Eugene\u2019s hair also had streaks of gray running through it.\u201cPleased to meet you. I am Eugene Lionheart,\u201d he introduced himself.\u201cOf course, I know who you are. The truth is that you\u2019ve drawn my attention ever since we first met on our return to the estate,\u201d Gion revealed.\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you gave off the smell of sweat. Ah, not that it was a bad thing. Anyone who bears the name of Lionheart should always smell at least slightly sweaty,\u201d Gion joked with a laugh, revealing his pearly white teeth. He patted Eugene on the shoulder as he continued speaking, \u201cAlso, I happen to have heard a lot about you from\u2014 Ah, hold on! It\u2019ll be awkward if we just stand around talking like this, so let\u2019s get going first before we continue.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re here to guide me to the Patriarch?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. My brother wanted to send one of his knights, but I told him that I\u2019d go and do it personally. I actually wanted to see you for myself,\u201d Gion laughed once again as he turned and set off.As he quickly walked off, his gait proved to be just as lively as the sound of his laughter. After tossing a goodbye back to Nina, Eugene started to follow behind Gion.\u201cDid you say that you wanted to see me in person?\u201d Eugene asked politely.\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, and I meant it. After all, you defeated Cyan in a duel\u2026 and I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve even won the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony?\u201d Gion turned his head back to look at Eugene as if waiting for an answer. \u201cI also wanted to see the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony in person, but it\u2019s tradition that no one except the Patriarch is allowed to watch the ceremony. Well, Master Lovellian also happened to be spectating beside my brother this year, but that\u2019s only because Lovellian helped set up this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony....\u201d\u201cIs there really such a tradition?\u201d\u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s a real tradition. Well, I guess you could call it part of the Patriarch\u2019s privileges. Like the fact that only the main family\u2019s Patriarch is allowed into the treasure vault. Similarly, only the Patriarch is allowed to have fun watching the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony,\u201d Gion grumbled a complaint, only to tap himself on the lips in regret at having said too much. \u201cAh, I know it might sound like it, but I\u2019m not really complaining about my brother, you know? It\u2019s just that the traditions are\u2014 But if I say it like that, does it sound like I\u2019m complaining about the family rules instead?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you do,\u201d Eugene said agreeably.Gion smiled and revealed, \u201cMy brother actually doesn\u2019t mind it when I complain about them either.\u201dAlthough they hadn\u2019t been talking for very long, Eugene had a rough idea of what Gion\u2019s personality was really like. His very attitude seemed to exude a sense of free-spiritedness. It was probably due to this character of his that he had decided not to marry yet.\u201cAbout Wynnyd,\u201d Gion said as he stopped walking ahead of Eugene; instead, he slowed his pace to walk alongside Eugene. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never used it before, I know that it\u2019s a good sword. Make sure to cherish it.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason you haven\u2019t tried using it before?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cNot really, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m quite fond of my current sword,\u201d Gion grinned and pointed down to the sword he wore at his waist.It wasn\u2019t one of Vermouth\u2019s many swords.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look cool? It\u2019s a sword that I found long ago while traveling around the world, but maybe because it\u2019s a sword that I got through my own hard work, I\u2019m really attached to it.\u201d\u201cIs it a magic sword as well?\u201d\u201cYes, but\u00a0its\u00a0magic isn\u2019t all that impressive. It can\u2019t compare to your Wynnyd. Well, if I had to explain it, its magic allows me to absorb mana a little more smoothly, or something like that?\u201dDespite Gion\u2019s claims, such an effect wasn\u2019t something to be underestimated. Although it hadn\u2019t seemed extraordinary at first glance, Eugene guessed that the sword might even have been made by the dwarves.Gion changed the subject, \u201cSo how did you find the labyrinth? Although I\u2019ve heard a few things from Cyan and Ciel, I\u2019d like to hear your perspective as you might have a different view of it.\u201d\u201cIt was really fascinating,\u201d Eugene offered his opinion.\u201cSo it seems that you didn\u2019t find it difficult,\u201d Gion observed as he burst into laughter. \u201cYou\u00a0really\u00a0had to face both traps and monsters, then trolls on the way to the center, and finally a minotaur waiting at the end? That\u2019s way too much for kids to handle. Even Cyan and Ciel didn\u2019t try to fight the trolls head-on. As for the minotaur\u2026. Brother and Lovellian were really being a little cruel with that.\u201d\u201cIs Cyan doing alright now?\u201d\u201cHis body\u2019s fine, but his mind is a more complex matter. After all, it\u2019s not like we can open it up and take a look inside, can we? Well, Cyan is just taking his defeat hard because he\u2019s still immature. But it\u2019s better for him to experience such frustrations at a young age. Once he gets a bit older, it\u2019ll be harder to get over such setbacks,\u201d Gion clicked his tongue in commiseration and turned to look at Eugene. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m actually feeling a little grateful to you. Thanks to you showing him up, Cyan\u2019s arrogance has been tempered slightly.\u201d\u201c...But wasn\u2019t Cyan just badmouthing me to you?\u201d\u201cOf course he was. He even spied on you from a distance and called you a son of a bitch.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cowardly to insult someone behind their backs.\u201d\u201cI thought so as well, so I smacked him a good one.\u201d With another smile, Gion again showed off his pearly white teeth. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve already drubbed him for it, don\u2019t needlessly get into a fight with Cyan later, okay?\u201d\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t mess with me, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. If he could get beaten up a few more times for being rude, then Cyan might be able to correct his bad habits while improving his skills at the same time.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you just say that I shouldn\u2019t fight with him?\u201d\u201cMmm, you\u2019re right. Well then, I\u2019ll just give you permission to fight with him whenever you want. That is, as long as you don\u2019t hurt him too badly.\u201dWhile they were discussing such topics, they arrived at the main mansion. Gion casually waved off the greetings from the servants and led Eugene upstairs.\u201cBut why is the Patriarch calling for me?\u201d Eugene finally asked.\u201cMaybe to compliment you?\u201d Gion guessed.\u201cI\u2019ve received his compliments earlier.\u201d\u201cNo matter how many times you\u2019ve heard them, it\u2019s not like you can ever have too many compliments.\u201d\u201cIt looks like Mr. Gion doesn\u2019t know the reason either.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have any clues\u2026 but it\u2019s not something to get all worked up over. Though it does have something to do with you and your future.\u201dOnce they got to the top of the stairs, they walked down a long hallway. As this was his first time visiting the main mansion, Eugene looked at his surroundings with curious eyes.\u201cHowever,\u201d Gion said, suddenly stopping in his steps; ahead of them stood a large, tightly shut door. \u201cI think it would be nice if we could see each other more often.\u201dGion turned to look at Eugene with a slight smile as he said this.\u201cMe too,\u201d Eugene agreed, not having had a bad impression of the man. Eugene decided to return the smile to show his sincerity.Gion turned back to the front, his expression turning neutral, and knocked on the door.\u201cCome in,\u201d Gilead\u2019s voice was heard from inside.After opening the door for Eugene, Gion took a few steps back. Then he winked at Eugene and shooed him in.\u2018Although his personality is good, he\u2019s a bit overbearing.\u2019With a slight feeling of nervousness, Eugene entered the room. The spacious room had been furnished into the Patriarch\u2019s personal office.\u201cSorry for calling you so suddenly,\u201d Gilead led with an apology.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Eugene answered, bowing his head.Gilead smiled and pointed to the visitor seating area, \u201cFor now, why don\u2019t you\u00a0take a seat.\u201dSome refreshments had been prepared for him on a coffee table. However, Eugene didn\u2019t lay a hand on any of the cookies or tea and instead\u00a0stared\u00a0pointedly at Gilead. Although it was rude, his behavior was still in the acceptable range for a child.\u201cAbout the necklace,\u201d Gilead said, not taking offense to Eugene\u2019s attitude; instead, he felt that the spunky look like Eugene\u2019s was actually kind of cute. The first impression of someone will forever skew how that person is viewed, and Gilead had had a good impression of Eugene.\u201cI asked Master Lovellian to examine it, but it turned out to be just an ordinary necklace,\u201d Gilead continued.\u201cSo that was the case,\u201d Eugene feigned ignorance.\u201cHe even read the earliest memories recorded in the necklace\u2019s mana, but nothing special was found.\u201d\u2018They even read the mana\u2019s memories?\u2019\u00a0For a moment, Eugene almost revealed his panic before he quickly concealed the emotion.\u00a0\u2018Oh yeah, there was a spell like that, wasn\u2019t there?\u2019But even though they had used one of Sienna\u2019s spells, they hadn\u2019t found anything special from the necklace? At these words, Eugene couldn\u2019t help feeling ashamed on behalf of his previous life as Hamel.\u201c...There are memories recorded in the necklace?\u201d Eugene asked, trying not to sound too hurt.\u201cHm\u2026 how should I explain it? To put it simply, Master Lovellian used a spell to read the history of where the necklace had come from. He said that the necklace was purchased in the streets of the capital around a hundred years ago,\u201d Gilead recounted before handing the necklace to Eugene.After receiving the necklace, Eugene checked it carefully. No, there was no mistake about it. This was definitely the necklace that Hamel had worn three hundred years ago, the keepsake left by his parents. There was no way he would mistake a necklace that he had constantly worn during his travels for over twenty years. Both the discoloration on the chain and the scratches on the cheap crystal hanging at the front were exactly the same as in his memories.\u2018In the first place, who\u2019d be so crazy to sell an old necklace like this at a roadside stall?\u2019Such a necklace could only be sold if the seller was insane and the buyer was even more insane.\u2018Lovellian could be lying, but\u2026 there\u2019s no reason for him to do so. Could he really have read it wrong? An Archwizard currently serving as the Head of a Tower of Magic?\u2019If that wasn\u2019t the case, then\u2026.\u2018That would mean a spell that can even deceive the Head of a Tower of Magic has been cast on the necklace\u2026 creating a layer of new memories in the mana. But who on earth would have done that?\u00a0Could it have been\u00a0Vermouth?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 20.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20.2: The Offer (1)But what reason would that guy have for doing something like this?It wasn\u2019t unusual for someone to have taken a keepsake from their dead companion to commemorate him and stored it in their treasury. Vermouth hadn\u2019t seemed to be the type for such frivolities, but then again, Eugene had never expected that Vermouth would take more than ten wives after returning from the Devildom either. That was proof, if anything, that time changes people.\u2018But if they really wanted to commemorate me, they should have just killed all the Demon Kings.\u2019If they couldn\u2019t do that, then at the very least, they should have properly registered the necklace into the treasure vault. While feeling a complex mix of dissatisfaction and doubt, Eugene nodded his head to show he understood.\u201c...Then is it okay for me to take this necklace?\u201d\u201cThe necklace is completely worthless. Are you sure you still want it?\u201d\u201cFor some reason, it just calls to me.\u201d\u201cHm. Well, I suppose that there are times when items do that.\u201dChildren were often attracted to strange things. Even Gilead used to collect old coins when he was a child.\u201cHave you always liked such antiquities?\u201d Gilead asked curiously.Eugene prevaricated, \u201cI don\u2019t hate them, but I just find this necklace strangely fascinating.\u201d\u201cWell, if you really want it, you may keep it.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dWith a grin, Eugene immediately hung the necklace around his neck before looking back up at Gilead. When Gilead was caught staring at Eugene, he gave a low cough and got up from his seat.\u201c...Eugene. I called you here to give you the necklace, but\u2026 there was one more reason as well.\u201d\u201cWhat reason would that be, sir?\u201dInstead of replying immediately, Gilead walked over and took a seat in the chair across from Eugene. Then he picked up a teacup and started fidgeting with it as if trying to sort out his thoughts.\u201c...This might seem sudden, but I have an offer for you. It\u2019s nothing unpleasant, and in fact, this offer is for the sake of your future.\u201d\u2018No way,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought, his eyebrows twitching in frustration at the halting pace of Gilead\u2019s words.An offer concerning his future? In such situations, for an offer to be worded like that, there were only a few options of what that offer might be.\u201cEugene, are you\u2014\u201d\u201cSir Patriarch,\u201d Eugene interrupted him.Gilead stopped mid-sentence and tilted his head in curiosity, \u201cHm?\u201dEugene continued, \u201cCiel is kind and cute, but I don\u2019t want to start thinking about marriage so soon.\u201dEugene was sure that this was about engaging him to Ciel. If he thought about it, things had seemed a little strange from the very beginning. Even after Eugene had left her twin brother in such a state, Ciel had still come looking for him the very next day with a smile on her face; and ever since then, she had been clinging to his side like an annoying tick.Also, before the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, Ciel had been acting so overtly friendly to Eugene that it felt off-putting. And she kept blabbing some nonsense about how he should call her \u2018big sis,\u2019 just because she was a few months older than him.\u2018I wondered why she kept going on about that, so she\u2019s already trying to put me in my place as her\u00a0future consort.\u2019[1]That was definitely it. And what was with her behavior in the labyrinth? She had actually giggled as she watched her brother get beaten up by the minotaur.\u2018She was sitting beside me then as well.\u2019It felt like there had also been times where Ciel subtly kept Dezra from getting close to him.Recalling all the times he had met with Ciel since arriving at the main estate, Eugene felt increasingly sure of his suspicions. It may not have been planned that way from the start, but after the twins had walked over to pick a fight, they must have decided to trap him in an arranged marriage upon seeing the result of their duel.\u2018No wonder. So that\u2019s why he was willing to give me a weapon from their treasure vault. They intend to tie me to the main family by engaging me to Ciel.\u2019How could they have come up with such a terrible scheme while still outwardly treating him with so much courtesy? If it was to achieve their purpose, were they even willing to sacrifice their daughter\u2019s future? To be able to hide their evil intentions to such an extent, just as expected from the descendants of Vermouth.\u2018No, even Vermouth wouldn\u2019t stoop this low.\u2019Inside Eugene\u2019s head, Gilead\u2019s image underwent a rapid transformation.Eugene continued trying to excuse himself, \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m too young to even be thinking about marriage. I need to get my father\u2019s permission as well\u2014 And even if my father does allow it, I don\u2019t want to get married to Ciel\u2014\u201d\u201cHold on,\u201d Gilead, who had been listening to Eugene\u2019s speech in shock, suddenly raised his hand. \u201cEugene, I think you may be misunderstanding something.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t call you here with the intention of engaging you to Ciel. That\u2019s\u2026 hmm\u2026 well, that\u2019s something for Ciel to decide. But of course, your opinion is important as well.\u201dIn fact, he actually thought that it was quite a good idea, but Gilead didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of forcing either of them into such an arrangement.\u201c...Is that\u2026 so?\u201d Eugene choked out these words as he felt his face burn red-hot in embarrassment.It looked like he really had put his foot in his mouth this time.\u201cI called you here because I wanted to offer to adopt you.\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201dEugene thought he had been surprised before, but Gilead\u2019s follow-up was even more shocking.\u2018So they had that method available to them.\u2019Eugene\u00a0got their reasoning for their offer of adoption, but at the same time, he wanted to leap out of the window in embarrassment. He wanted to tear off his own mouth for admitting that he didn\u2019t want to marry a thirteen-year-old kid. No, more than that, he wanted to smash his own head for thinking that he was about to be engaged to a thirteen-year-old chick in the first place.\u2018I must have been crazy.\u2019After having to act like a child, it seemed that his mind had somehow become like a child\u2019s.\u201c...An adoption\u2026 uh\u2026 this is all too sudden\u2026,\u201d Eugene mumbled distractedly.\u201cBut not as sudden as an engagement, right?\u201d Gilead teased with a grin.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting the wrong idea.\u201d\u201cBut do you really hate the idea of getting married to Ciel? From the way you speak of her, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re completely against the idea\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I hate it.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026.\u201d Gilead put on a disappointed expression, but he soon let it fall and continued speaking. \u201c...Setting this talk of engagement aside, what do you think about being adopted?\u201dEugene hesitated, \u201cBut\u2026 my father is waiting for me in Gidol.\u201d\u201cIf you wish, I\u2019ll invite Gerhard to stay at the main estate as well.\u201d\u201cSo then I\u2019ll have two fathers?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. But your biological father is, and always will be, Gerhard.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the point of me getting adopted.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to think about it too much,\u201d Gilead smiled faintly as he picked up his teacup. \u201cIt\u2019s just to bring your family into the same fold as the main family. Although nominally, I\u2019ll be your adoptive father, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to treat me as your real father. Of course, that\u2019s only if you agree to the adoption.\u201d\u201cI feel like this would trouble my father greatly,\u201d admitted Eugene.\u201cI\u2019ll probably have a lot of things that I need to go over with Gerhard, but Eugene, I too am a father of three children. I am not trying to steal Gerhard\u2019s son away from him.\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never met Gerhard, I promise to respect him as if he were my older brother.\u201dEugene frowned, \u201cDoes that mean that, if I refuse, the Patriarch won\u2019t show my father respect?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d Gilead burst into laughter at such a bold question. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m embarrassed to even say this out loud, I\u2019m not such a childish person. So, if you refuse\u2026 I\u2019ll just\u2026 feel a little regret. That\u2019s all. I will, of course, respect your choice and wish you the best of luck with your future. However\u2026 I really do hope to allow your future to shine as part of the main\u00a0family.\u201d\u201c...I don\u2019t think this is an issue that I should decide by myself,\u201d for now, Eugene decided to postpone making a decision.While in the end, it would be up to Eugene to decide whether or not to accept the proposal, he still wanted to hear his father\u2019s, Gerhard\u2019s, opinion.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then let\u2019s leave it until after the banquet,\u201d Gilead decided.The banquet originally meant to celebrate the end of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was scheduled for the following evening.\u201cI\u2019ll send messengers to Gidol and tell them to respectfully escort your father over,\u201d Gilead said.\u201cI am grateful for the Patriarch\u2019s consideration, but I also feel a little guilty for the inconvenience,\u201d Eugene confessed.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t owe me anything. You\u2019ve proven yourself the most outstanding child in this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. It would be a sad affair if your father could not be with his son during your moment of celebration and glory.\u201d\u201cThank you so much.\u201dWithout showing any further hesitation, Eugene bowed his head in thanks. By doing so, he was also hiding his joy. Truthfully, he was interested in the offer to join the main family through adoption.If Gerhard\u2019s personality was just as terrible as his sword skills, then he would have accepted being adopted by Gilead without any hesitation. However, Gerhard was in fact a truly caring father. Unfortunately, due to the memories of his past life, Eugene had never really been able to accept Gerhard as his father, but even still, he liked and respected the man.\u201c...Earlier, you said that this would be good for my future as well,\u201d Eugene focussed, putting down the teacup he\u2019d been sipping from. \u201cWhat exactly did you mean by that?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re fostered with the main family, there are a lot of benefits you can enjoy,\u201d Gilead enticed Eugene; he was glad that Eugene was showing interest in his offer. \u201cFor example\u2026 that\u2019s right, didn\u2019t you say that there weren\u2019t any knights you could go to for instruction back in Gidol? But at our main estate, you won\u2019t need to worry about that. After all, we have a lot of excellent knights here.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m going to learn from anyone, I want to learn from the best,\u201d Eugen demanded, as he tried to smile as innocently as possible. Then looking straight at Gilead, he continued speaking, \u201cIf I\u2019m adopted by you, Patriarch, will I be able to learn from you as well?\u201dEugene was curious to see just how strong the Lionheart clan\u2019s Patriarch truly was.1. The Korean word used here was \ub370\ub9b4\uc0ac\uc704 which basically means\u00a0a son-in-law who marries into his wife's family, rather than a daughter-in-law marrying into her husband\u2019s family, and has a lower status because of this. Part of the reason why it\u2019s considered shameful is that by marrying into his wife\u2019s family, the husband is giving up the responsibility and duty of passing down his family name, as his children will inherit his wife\u2019s surname instead. Although that doesn\u2019t apply in this case, as both Eugene and Ciel have the same surname, it still implies that Eugene will have a lower standing than his wife.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, he actually felt both pleased and sympathetic at the hungry look on Eugene\u2019s face. If a child truly was a scion of a martial family, then they should have such a greedy desire.\u201c...Of course, I\u2019ll be able to teach you,\u201d Gilead said, looking at Eugene with a happy smile. \u201cHowever, if you want to learn from the very best, then there\u2019s someone even better than me.\u201d\u201cWho is that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cIt\u2019s Gion.\u201dEugene recalled Gion and his shiny white teeth. When he was opening the door for Eugene, Gion\u00a0had\u00a0said that he\u2019d like it if they could see each other more often.\u201cIn the past, my skills were better than his, but currently that\u2019s no longer the case,\u201d Gilead admitted.\u201cReally?\u201d Eugene asked skeptically.\u201cIs there any reason for me to lie and downplay my skills?\u201d Gilead returned the question.Eugene\u2019s eyes sparkled with curiosity and interest.Gilead continued speaking with a low laugh, \u201cHave you received instruction on your family\u2019s mana training scripture from your father?\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t even learned its name yet,\u201d Eugene said.\u201cWell, that\u2019s quite unusual,\u201d Gilead commented.Usually, children from the collateral lines were instructed in their mana training scriptures before leaving for the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. That way, they could try to initiate their mana as soon as the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over. Since they were already several years behind the children from the main family, the collateral descendants would try to speed up their initiation into mana, even if it was just by a few days.\u201cI told my father that I didn\u2019t want to learn it yet. If I needlessly learned it beforehand, I felt like I might accidentally start training my mana without even meaning to,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cSo that was the case. After all, you\u2019re so diligent that you haven\u2019t neglected your training even once during your entire stay here\u2026.\u201d Gilead nodded his head in understanding.At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel pity.Gerhard\u2019s household was one of the weakest among all the collateral branches. Even so, as long as they still held the name Lionheart, families like Gerhard\u2019s could live a prosperous life as local landlords, but their children couldn\u2019t dream of much more than that.On the other hand, what about Dezra and Gargith\u2019s families? Among the collateral lines, families as powerful as theirs could only be counted on the fingers of one hand. Their two families were capable of making all sorts of preparations to support the growth of their children.\u2018They\u2019ve probably already started purchasing mana stones years ago.\u2019Crystals of mana could be found in the bodies of higher-leveled monsters and in mana-dense ores, like mithril. These aggregations of mana were called mana stones. When first initiating mana, the assistance of these mana stones could not be neglected.\u2018Gerhard\u2019s household probably doesn\u2019t have enough money to afford any mana stones\u2026.\u2019Due to their high utility and the difficulty of obtaining them, the price of mana stones was exorbitant. On top of that, for initiates to get the most benefit out of mana stones, they needed someone with outstanding abilities to guide them. Eward, Cyan, and Ciel had each been personally guided by Gilead when they first initiated their mana.That was why he couldn\u2019t help but feel regret. The boy had already proven his excellence, but the soil of Gerhard\u2019s countryside household was too poor to allow Eugene\u2019s talent to bloom.However, Gilead absolutely couldn\u2019t allow such words to leave his lips. Even if they were said out of honest worry and concern, Gilead didn\u2019t want his careless words to cause a son to turn against his father and the family he was born to.Instead of Eugene, this was something that he needed to discuss with Gerhard.However, even if Eugene didn\u2019t hear it from him directly, he could guess what Gilead was thinking. It wasn\u2019t difficult to figure it out, considering how much compassion was showing in Gilead\u2019s eyes.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s true that our family is poor after all.\u2019After this, the two continued to talk about various things. As the banquet\u2019s guest of honor, Eugene was asked if he needed anything or wanted any particular dishes served at the banquet.Time flowed quickly as they touched on various topics. Finally, when a glance out of the window revealed that it had turned completely dark outside, Gilead stood up.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ve kept you up for far too long,\u201d Gilead apologized.\u201cNo, it was fun for me too,\u201d Eugene denied any fault.\u201cI\u2019ll call someone to escort you over soon, so please wait a little longer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to do that. It\u2019s not like the annex is that far from here. I\u2019m fully capable of walking back in the dark,\u201d Eugene reassured Gilead.After refusing Gilead\u2019s offer once more, Eugene left the Patriarch\u2019s office. As he was walking down the corridor to the stairs, he sensed that someone was sneakily lying in wait for him on the other side of the hallway.It was Ancilla. She was attempting to stage this as an accidental meeting, but Eugene wasn\u2019t surprised in the least. He had been able to notice Ancilla while she was still hiding out of sight, thanks to the scent of her perfume.As she turned the corner, Ancilla fluttered her eyelashes in surprise.\u201c...Oh my,\u201d Ancilla gasped in feigned shock, unaware that her ruse had already been seen through. \u201cIt\u2019s Eugene, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, good evening, Madam,\u201d while deliberately putting on a surprised look of his own, Eugene bowed his head in greeting. \u201cMy name is Eugene Lionheart, and I hail from Gidol.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know your name,\u201d Ancilla said with a fake smile.Ancilla hated Eugene. It wasn\u2019t just because he had handed her beloved son an embarrassing defeat, but this cheeky brat had also given the main family its first defeat ever in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. And there wasn\u2019t even a single reason why Ancilla should actually like Eugene.That said, she couldn\u2019t treat him with hostility. No matter what had happened, he was definitely a talented kid. Since he could already reach such heights at his age, as long as he didn\u2019t suddenly die somewhere along the way, he would continue to grow and perhaps even be able to raise his humble family out of obscurity within ten years.\u2018There\u2019s no need to make an enemy out of him in advance.\u2019That was why she had allowed Ciel to stick to Eugene\u2019s side. Unlike her husband, Ancilla thought that the idea of ensnaring Eugene and Ciel into an arranged marriage was actually quite a promising plan for the future.\u201cI heard that you and the Patriarch were having a private conversation, but it looks like the two of you chatted for quite a while. I didn\u2019t know that you were still here,\u201d Ancilla continued speaking to Eugene with a feigned smile.Eugene felt a strange pressure emanating from behind her kind smile and overly sweet tone.So, for now, Eugene decided to test her intentions with a question, \u201cIs there something you wished to speak to me about?\u201dGilead had responded quite favorably to his bold behavior, but this wasn\u2019t the case for Ancilla.\u2018His arrogance is already skyrocketing.\u2019Though she could understand why. It must already be quite exciting for such a country bumpkin to visit the main estate. On top of that, he had even managed to defeat a child from the main family in a duel on his very first day and then went on to win the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. She secretly wanted to crush his arrogantly upturned nose, but Ancilla firmly held back this urge.\u2018...After all, this kid might become my son-in-law one day.\u2019\u00a0While inwardly repeating this to herself, Ancilla said, \u201cI was curious about what you might have discussed with the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cBecause it was a private conversation between the Patriarch and me, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t dare tell you,\u201d Eugene refused her subtle inquiry.\u201cOh, right! Of course, that\u2019s the case. I didn\u2019t mean to put you on the spot, so please don\u2019t feel pressured. Besides that, there were actually a few other things I wanted to talk to you about\u2026.\u201d Ancilla trailed off, seeming apologetic.Eugene simply tilted his head silently in question.Ancilla maintained her friendly smile as she added, \u201cWell, wasn\u2019t Cyan very rude to you just a few days ago? If it were under the usual circumstances, as Cyan\u2019s mother, I should have already apologized to you personally. But as the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was just ahead of us, things were out of control, and my apology was delayed.\u201dLike hell, she would have. If she had really wanted to apologize to Eugene, then Ancilla could have just gone looking for him that very day.But instead of pointing that out, Eugene simply said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. At that time, I had already reconciled whatever problems I had with Cyan.\u201d\u201c...Oh my. For a child your age, you sure are mature and broad-minded,\u201d Ancilla\u2019s cheeks twitched as she forced herself to keep smiling. \u201cIf those are your feelings on the incident, then that\u2019s fortunate for us. As for Cyan, who showed you such disrespect, I\u2019ve given him a strict warning, so I hope that the two of you will get along with each other from now on.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will try my best. After all, we do share the same name, so ultimately, aren\u2019t we all part of the same family?\u201d Eugene replied with a grin.On the other hand, Ancilla\u2019s face twisted into a complex expression. He said that they were part of the same family? Although he wasn\u2019t wrong, for some reason, when the word \u2018family\u2019 dropped from that irritating boy\u2019s lips, she couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable.\u201cWould you mind if I take my leave now?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201c...Yes, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ancilla permitted.Ancilla didn\u2019t want to hold on to Eugene any longer. She needed to be careful of drawing her husband\u2019s attention, and she also needed to be wary of the head wife, Tanis. It wouldn\u2019t look good for her to keep talking to Eugene in the hallway like this.\u201cBe careful on your way back,\u201d Ancilla said with a slight smile as she patted Eugene on the shoulder.\u2018What an irritating brat,\u2019\u00a0she thought to herself. Even though Ancilla had planned out this meeting, it still felt like she had started the conversation on the wrong foot. However, she would just have to take better care from now on whenever she spoke to Eugene.\u201cYes. I hope you have a good night,\u201d Eugene also bade farewell, bowing his head deeply.He didn\u2019t know for certain what kind of personality Ancilla was hiding behind that smile. However, looking at the harassment she had authorized for him on that very first day, she obviously had quite the cruel streak. As such, he didn\u2019t want to needlessly get involved with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although only a single knight, Gordon, had been sent to escort Eugene; this time, the Patriarch\u2019s own younger brother, Gion, had personally accompanied Gerhard to the main estate.This fact caused Gerhard to feel immense pressure. The only times he had been to the main estate were for the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony twenty years ago and the Patriarch\u2019s succession ceremony; following that, there had been no further visits to the capital city, let alone the main estate.\u2018...So Eugene really won this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony?\u2019My son did that? Truly? Gerhard was currently suspecting that he might be in the middle of a dream. Or else, maybe all of this was a prank meant to make fun of him.But what reason would they have to do that? What on earth could cause the main family of the Lionheart clan, the direct descendants of the Great Vermouth, to summon the patriarch of a small collateral family out in the remote countryside, just to play this sort of prank on him.However, he simply couldn\u2019t accept it so easily. When Gion had first arrived at his doorstep, he had been so surprised that he almost passed out. He was even more surprised when he saw the luxurious carriage waiting outside, flying the unmistakable banner of the courageous Lionheart. Even after hearing Gion recount the stories of what Eugene had done on the way here, his surprise still hadn\u2019t faded in the least.After traveling through several warp gates, they had arrived at the capital. It was only when they reached the main family\u2019s personal warp gate, which was only used for special occasions, that Gerhard accepted that this was all really happening.\u2018My son\u2026 he really defeated the children of the main family.\u2019Gerhard felt like he was about to start crying. It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t held\u00a0any\u00a0expectations for Eugene. His son had always been out-of-the-ordinary, ever since he was young. He was such an exceptional child that\u2026 Gerhard had sometimes doubted if Eugene really was his son.That was why he had always felt guilty. Gerhard knew full well that with his own capabilities, he couldn\u2019t give his son the lift that Eugene needed for his talents to soar. He had thought that the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony would force Eugene to see the reality of his situation. After all, no matter how exceptional the collateral descendants were, defeat was still inevitable. It should not have been possible to overcome the gap that existed between the direct line and the collateral lines by innate talent and hard work alone, but\u2026.\u201cFather!\u201dThe moment he saw his son, Gerhard forgot all propriety as tears began pouring down his face. Pride and guilt warred in equal measure as he looked at his only son.The Lionheart flag was flying proudly in front of the majestic and splendid main family\u2019s mansion. His son stood in the center of this intimidating scene, smiling brightly as he waved his hand at Gerhard.Gerhard had never been able to provide Eugene with any meaningful support. He hadn\u2019t been able to find an excellent knight to serve as Eugene\u2019s teacher, and Gerhard himself was incapable of providing such instruction. Apart from the wooden swords and training dummies, he hadn\u2019t been able to supply anything else.Nevertheless, his son had been able to attain victory at the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201cMy son, Eugene\u2026!\u201dGerhard pulled his son into an embrace as he continued to shed tears. Eugene was startled to see Gerhard like this, but he soon slipped on a childish expression and returned Gerhard\u2019s embrace.\u201cI\u2019m so\u2026 I\u2019m so proud of you. The fact that you\u2019re my son makes me so proud,\u201d Gerhard sobbed through his tears.\u201cI told you that I would send you good news, didn\u2019t I? Did you really not believe me?\u201d Eugene teased his father.Eugene did, in fact, say this when he left Gidol to attend the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Of course, Gerhard hadn\u2019t been able to whole-heartedly believe in these words. This fact also caused Gerhard to feel some guilt.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 you did say that, didn\u2019t you, my\u2026 my son. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry for not believing in you,\u201d Gerhard sobbed out between sniffs.\u201cHey now, what\u2019s with the apologies again. If I were in your place, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it either,\u201d as Eugene gave this soothing reply, he pinched Gerhard\u2019s belly.This instinctively caused Gerhard to step backward in shock. The stinging pain coming from his thick gut once again reminded him that this was real.But his son wasn\u2019t the only one waiting for him at the gates. Right behind Gerhard was the Patriarch\u2019s younger brother, Gion, and in front of him\u2014Gerhard swallowed visibly and quickly pulled a handkerchief out of a breast pocket.In front of him stood Gilead Lionheart, the Lionheart Patriarch who Gerhard had last seen during the ceremony of his ascension to the seat of Patriarch. Gerhard could still clearly recognize Gilead\u2019s appearance from that event. He quickly wiped the handkerchief over his face, which was drenched in tears and snot, then bowed his head to Gilead.\u201cA-apologies for the late greeting. My name is Gerhard Lionheart, and I hail from Gidol.\u201d\u201cI am Gilead Lionheart. Please forgive my rudeness of inviting you in such haste.\u201dGilead walked directly over to Gerhard and offered him a handshake. Startled, Gerhard scrubbed his hands on the sides of his trousers before shaking the offered hand.\u201cWhat rudeness\u2026?! I don\u2019t consider it that way at all. In fact, I am extremely grateful that you have invited me like this,\u201d Gerhard said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up too much of your time with your son, but if it is okay with you, would you mind coming inside with me for a short conversation?\u201dGilead didn\u2019t wish to have a lengthy exchange of greetings with Gerhard out here in the open. As a member of the collateral lines, Gerhard couldn\u2019t help but keep his head bowed low in the presence of the direct line\u2019s Patriarch, and Gilead didn't want Eugene to see his father like this.\u201cOf course, that\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Gerhard immediately agreed.Eugene considerately withdrew, allowing the two men to pass. While shooting curious glances at Eugene, Gerhard followed Gilead into the main family\u2019s mansion.It felt like his son had a lot of stories to tell him, and there were many things that Gerhard wanted to ask Eugene in turn, but Gerhard stayed quiet as he left Eugene for the moment. He was curious about the intention behind this offer to have a conversation with the Patriarch.When he thought about it normally, the fact that his son had surpassed the main family\u2019s children to win the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony\u2026 was a huge insult to the main family. Were they trying to put pressure on him because of this? But if that was what they were trying to do, it felt like Gion was much too cheerful to have been sent as their emissary to do so, and it hadn\u2019t felt like anything was out-of-place with Eugene. Patriarch Gilead also seemed far too polite to hold any intention of embarrassing him like this.Refreshments had already been prepared for their enjoyment in the Patriarch\u2019s office. Gilead got straight to the point after watching Gerhard wet his throat that had dried up out of tension with some tea.\u201c...You\u2019re talking about\u2026 an adoption?\u201d Gerhard asked in disbelief.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Gilead confirmed.He hadn\u2019t just recklessly thrown the offer at Gerhard. Instead, Gilead had explained in detail exactly why he was making this offer.Eugene\u2019s talents were so brilliant that he couldn\u2019t be left to his own devices. However, for his potential to bloom splendidly, the support of the main family was absolutely necessary.A child of a collateral line had won the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony by defeating those of the direct line. While it was a blessing for the Lionheart clan to have such a talented sprout, it could also stir into action those among the Lionheart\u2019s countless collateral branches who held seditious thoughts.There was a risk that a conspiracy of these rebellious dissidents might reach out to Eugene. If Eugene didn\u2019t agree to their offer, they might even try to put pressure on him in some form or another.\u201cOf course, as a representative of the main family, I promise to do my best to protect Lord Gerhard\u2019s household from harm.\u201dHowever, in reality, there was a limit to the protection that the main family could provide.\u201cEven if you refuse the offer, there will be no grudges held by the main family. I also promise that I will still spare no effort to support Eugene\u2019s growth as much as possible.\u201d\u201c...Haha\u2026.\u201d Gerhard unconsciously let out a laugh.Wasn\u2019t this\u2026 really just a dream? No, he couldn\u2019t escape from reality like this. Gerhard clutched his spinning head.\u2018Eugene\u2026 adopted by the main family\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Gerhard attempted to sort out his thoughts.Gilead started to speak when he saw Gerhard remain silent,\u00a0\u201cIf Eugene were to be adopted\u2026 you, Lord Gerhard, may also be accepted into the main family. I know that this offer comes as a shock, but\u2014\u201d\u201cI mean no disrespect with what I am about to say next,\u201d having interrupted Gilead like this, Gerhard took a deep breath before continuing to speak. \u201cFor showing such high regard for my son\u2019s potential and consideration for my own feelings, I offer you my deepest gratitude. However, in my view\u2026 I have no choice but to consider what would be best for my son\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cAnd so?\u201d\u201cEven though the Patriarch\u2019s intentions are well-meaning and honest, I am worried that others within the main family might persecute Eugene.\u201dGilead didn\u2019t feel offended by this concern. Instead, he actually felt respect for Gerhard, who was brave enough to state his opinions firmly.\u201cAlthough I was born a Lionheart, I am but a humble person who has never truly lived up to the Lionheart name. I\u2026 I\u2019ve always wished to fully support my son\u2019s future, but\u2026 I\u2019ve always carried the guilt that my humble means will prevent my son from achieving his brightest future,\u201d Gerhard admitted his insecurity.Even as his voice wavered, Gerhard continued speaking. Though he clasped his trembling hands together to suppress the turbulent emotions he was feeling.\u201cThe Patriarch already has three children, don\u2019t you? If my son is adopted into your family\u2026. No matter the reason for his adoption, won\u2019t he be treated as an unwelcome outsider?\u201d asked Gerhard.\u201cI understand what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d Gilead nodded. \u201cBut the main family values its traditions. So even if Eugene was adopted into the main family, succeeding in my position as the Patriarch\u2026 would be very difficult.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Gerhard listened silently.\u201cMy wives and children are also aware of this fact. This tradition\u2026 unfortunately, it cannot be overturned in my generation. I will promise you one thing; I don\u2019t want to limit Eugene\u2019s future. However, my will alone cannot represent the will of the main family or of the elders in the council,\u201d Gilead offered this caveat.\u201c...Alright,\u201d Gerhard recognized Gilead\u2019s sincerity.\u201cAs long as that boy, Eugene, doesn\u2019t become too ambitious\u2026 he will be able to freely display his talents with the help of the main family. Becoming the Patriarch\u2026 will be difficult for him. However\u2026.\u201d For a moment, Gilead stayed silent before bowing his head deeply and continuing, \u201cLord Gerhard, I hope that you will not be offended by these next words.\u201cIt would be far better for Eugene\u2019s future if he was nurtured as a member of the main family than if he were to remain in Gidol. As long as he doesn\u2019t hold any ambitions of becoming the Patriarch, Eugene will be able to build up a friendship with my children, as they will all become siblings once he is adopted into the main family. Their relationships will open up many more opportunities and possibilities for Eugene in the future.\u201dGilead felt quite guilty for saying such things. Eugene\u2019s talents were superior to his children\u2019s. That was obviously so with Eward, but even Cyan and Ciel\u2019s amazing talents couldn\u2019t compare to Eugene\u2019s. Since there was already such a gap at their young age, the difference would become even more pronounced within the next few years.However, Eugene still couldn\u2019t become the Patriarch. Gilead actually wanted to see what would happen if Eugene were to become the Patriarch, and he genuinely wished for Eugene to bring glory to the main family, but these two desires were incompatible. In the first place, a collateral descendant who was adopted into the main family becoming the Patriarch would undermine the traditions and prestige of the main family.Even if Gilead, the current Patriarch, didn\u2019t care about that, the Lionheart clan would be turned into a laughingstock, and the Council would never allow such a thing to happen. In their eyes, the direct line had to maintain its superiority over the collateral lines. The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was a tradition held for this reason and this reason alone.\u201c...I suppose that would be the case,\u201d Gerhard accepted the truth with a long sigh and a nod.His child\u2019s future, and the greater opportunities and possibilities that the main family could offer, Gerhard understood what was at stake so well that his heart ached for it. Gerhard keenly realized his own helplessness and relative poverty. Eugene could enjoy an incomparable amount of glory by becoming the adopted child of the main family than he ever could by remaining as the only son of Gerhard from Gidol.\u201c...I don\u2019t believe this is something I can decide by myself,\u201d Gerhard smiled bitterly and shook his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to have a conversation with my son.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gerhard looked as if someone he knew had just died and was swaying weakly as he walked. Eugene could clearly guess what Gerhard had been talking about with Gilead, which emotions Gerhard was currently feeling, and why his father was coming here now.\u201cFather, what\u2019s with the expression?\u201d Eugene asked.Instead of acting like he already knew what was wrong, Eugene decided to ask Gerhard directly. Gerhard raised his lowered head at Eugene\u2019s words, catching sight of the annex as he did so. He realized that even a single annex assigned to the guests was bigger than their house in Gidol.Gerhard tried to draw confidence from the fact that, at the very least, their gymnasium at home was larger, but the sword his son was holding made his shoulders fall once more. It was the Storm Sword Wynnyd. He had heard the whole story from Gion about how his son had chosen the sword personally as a gift from the main family\u2019s treasure vault.Even if he sold off all the property that Gerhard\u2019s family had accrued over the years, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a sword like that.\u201c...Son,\u201d Gerhard began to speak, even as his feelings of inadequacy continued to grow. \u201c...The Patriarch of the main family has offered to adopt you.\u201d\u201cI already knew about that. He discussed it with me earlier,\u201d Eugene replied with a shrug. \u201cBut what does that have to do with your expression, father? After all, it\u2019s not like the adoption would separate us since you\u2019ll be coming with me into the main family.\u201d\u201c...That\u2019s what he said. However\u2026 I\u2019m not sure\u2026 if I should. If it\u2019s for the sake of your future, allowing you to enter the main family through adoption is the right choice. But in that case\u2026,\u201d Gerhard hesitated, unable to finish what he was trying to say.Persecution from the main family and future conflicts over succession rights\u2014Gerhard could easily imagine these dangers lying in wait for Eugene in the future. However, he doubted whether his still thirteen-year-old son would be able to comprehend such concerns.\u201c...Hypothetically\u2026 if you are adopted into the main family, you may have to face many difficult things later on,\u201d Gerhard warned Eugene.\u201cProbably,\u201d Eugene agreed readily.Although Gerhard didn\u2019t go into detail, Eugene clearly understood what he was implying.\u201cBut father, so what if there are?\u201d Eugene riposted.\u201c...Huh?\u201d Gerhard mumbled in incomprehension.\u201cAlthough there might be a lot of difficult things awaiting me in the future, there should also be plenty of good things as well,\u201d Eugene reasoned.\u201c...\u201d Gerhard couldn\u2019t respond.\u201cFather, I\u2019ll be fine no matter what happens,\u201d Eugene promised while sheathing Wynnyd in its scabbard.Then he walked over to Gerhard with a grin.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to be adopted, then let\u2019s just go back to Gidol,\u201d Eugene said with ease.\u201c...,\u201d Gerhard stayed silent.Eugene continued, \u201cI really mean it. As I said, I\u2019ll be fine no matter what happens. Can\u2019t you see, father? I\u2019m doing quite well now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u2018I really have grown up well despite everything,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought to himself with a nod.\u201cEven though I haven\u2019t trained my mana or learned from a great teacher, I was still able to beat the children of the main family. As your son, I think I\u2019ve done pretty well for myself. Even if I don\u2019t get adopted into the main family, I will continue to do well,\u201d Eugene promised.Gerhard felt the sincerity in his son\u2019s words, and it led his eyes to shine with unshed tears.Eugene gave him the finishing blow, \u201cI\u2019ve never regretted that you are my father.\u201dHiccup.Gerhard swallowed a sob.\u201cI was born as your son. It\u2019s thanks to you that I am here today,\u201d Eugene was fully willing to admit this.If Gerhard had turned out to be someone with a puffed-up opinion of himself that didn\u2019t match his abilities, Eugene\u2019s childhood could have been troublesome in many ways. However, Gerhard wasn\u2019t that type of person. He had respected Eugene\u2019s determination and, from a young age, he had given Eugene whatever training materials he had asked for.\u201cThat\u2019s why, father, don\u2019t needlessly blame yourself. Instead, you should be proud of who you are. I was only able to grow up so well because, father, you were able to raise me, your son, well.\u201d\u201c...Eugene\u2026.\u201d In the end, Gerhard couldn\u2019t hold back any longer and burst into tears, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ll follow you wherever you want to go. Instead of considering my reputation, you should decide based on your own dreams for the future.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s in Gidol or in the main family, I\u2019m sure that I\u00a0will\u00a0achieve my dreams,\u201d Eugene replied in a voice filled with confidence.As well as confidence, these words held a ring of certainty to them. While there were a lot of advantages he could get by being adopted into the main family, they weren\u2019t absolutely necessary for him to achieve his goals.\u2018They\u2019ll only speed up my progress by a few years anyhow.\u2019He only needed to train up a minimal amount of mana to summon spirits. He could manage at least that much, even if he returned to Gidol. If Gerhard\u2019s family mana training scripture proved inadequate, he could still use Hamel\u2019s mana training scripture. With this absurd body of his, even that cheap mana training scripture used only by mercenaries should still prove quite effective.And after that? At that point, he would be able to summon the lowest level of spirits. Even if this only enabled him to cover his sword with a blade of wind, it would replace the need for sword-light. With just that, Eugene was confident that he could overpower any knight he faced.\u201c...However, Eugene, if you\u2019re adopted into the main family, you will have a lot more opportunities available to you,\u201d Gerhard reminded his son after he had calmed down.\u201cWell, that\u2019s true,\u201d agreed Eugene.\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid you might face a lot of disdain once you\u2019re adopted\u2026,\u201d Gerhard confessed his concern.\u201cFather, you\u2019ve been watching me ever since I was young,\u201d Eugene said as he began poking Gerhard in the gut. \u201cI\u2019m not the type to just let any disrespect go unchallenged. Didn\u2019t you hear about it? On my first day here, I beat up Cyan from the main house.\u201dGerhard winced, \u201cI almost passed out when I heard about that\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat was so shocking about it? In any case, you don\u2019t need to worry about me. Instead, you should be worrying about yourself, father.\u201d\u201cWorrying about myself\u2026?\u201d\u201cAbout this dad bod of yours,\u201d Eugene said, as he stopped poking Gerhard\u2019s gut and instead lifted it up with both hands. \u201cThe food they serve in the main estate is a whole lot tastier than what we\u2019ve had at home. With how little exercise you get even now, if you start stuffing yourself full of all sorts of food once you\u2019re staying at the main estate, your beer belly will explode for sure.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026ha ha ha,\u201d Gerhard burst into laughter.\u201cIf you want to be around to see my future, you need to take care of your health first,\u201d Eugene threatened.Faced with his son\u2019s serious appearance, Gerhard finally calmed down and agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026. You make a good point.\u201dAll the helplessness and self-loathing he had felt, now seemed ridiculous in hindsight.\u201cEugene,\u201d Gerhard said, belatedly donning a solemn expression. \u201c...Your name is Eugene Lionheart, the name given to the son of Gerhard Lionheart.\u201d\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Eugene replied.\u201cYour name was\u2026. Both your late mother and I chose it together for you. Never forget this fact,\u201d Gerhard said with some sadness.\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. Do you really think I\u2019d forget my own name?\u201d Eugene asked with a snicker, but he still obediently nodded his head.\u201cEven if you are adopted into the main family, your real father who raised you from birth is, and always will be, Gerhard Lionheart,\u201d Gerhard finished this with a silent nod.Despite his solemn expression, tears were still dripping down his face. Without letting out any sobs, he hugged Eugene tightly.\u2018In the end, it looks like I\u2019m getting adopted,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought from within Gerhard\u2019s embrace.\u00a0\u2018Although it seems like things will be a bit bothersome, there\u2019ll be many things I can wring benefits from, so it\u2019ll be worth it in the end.\u2019Eugene held no desire to become the Lionheart clan\u2019s Patriarch. Although he didn\u2019t know what might happen later, if he needlessly showed any signs of ambition for the position of Patriarch at this early stage, there would surely be a lot of annoying restraints placed on him.\u2018Although I\u2019m not sure if everyone will believe me when I say that I\u2019m not interested.\u2019Especially the main wife, Tanis, and the second wife, Ancilla. Those two would have no choice but to try and keep Eugene in check.\u2018...They\u2019ll definitely have a lot of injunctions and restraints placed on me\u2026. Unless I confront them head-on, that is. Or I could just try ignoring them.\u2019Eugene, of course, preferred the former solution to the latter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While the results of this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony could only be considered an embarrassment to the main family, as if he wasn\u2019t at all ashamed of this outcome, Gilead had also invited the families of each of the children who had participated in the ceremony.This was to give everyone the impression that this year\u2019s Bloodline Continuation Ceremony wasn\u2019t a disgrace of the direct line but instead an honor of the collateral lines.Ancilla was pleased by her husband\u2019s decision.Although she didn\u2019t believe that Eugene Lionheart\u2019s victory was the optimal outcome, and she hadn\u2019t truly hoped for it, in the end, Eugene had defeated the main family and earned his victory. If his victory was publicized through this banquet, Cyan\u2019s defeat would seem even more insignificant in comparison.\u201cStand up straight,\u201d she ordered.Ancilla was dressed in a fancy evening gown that framed her regal posture. Cyan had been standing beside her with his shoulders slumped and a dire look on his face and was startled by her words and turned to look at Ancilla in surprise.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about the defeats you\u2019ve already experienced. Whether it\u2019s the duel or the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, what\u2019s happened has happened. However, you still shouldn\u2019t reveal your frustration,\u201d Ancilla lectured her son.\u201c...Mother\u2026,\u201d Cyan whined.\u201cYou are my son.\u00a0The only son of Ancilla Caines. Even if you were defeated in a duel and showed a shameful performance during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are my son.\u201dCyan couldn\u2019t fully understand the meaning of these words. However he could vaguely feel that there was a deeper meaning behind them, so he nodded and threw back his shoulders.\u201c...Cyan,\u201d Ancilla said after a pause.\u201c...Yes, mother,\u201d Cyan responded hesitantly.\u201cFrom now on, you will constantly be compared to that child. The first thing that everyone will remember when they see you is that you\u2019ve lost a duel to Eugene. They will also laugh at the fact that you were partially responsible for the main family\u2019s first recorded defeat in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony.\u201d\u201c....\u201d Cyan stayed quiet.\u201cThis is something that cannot be helped. Cyan, you are allowed to feel ashamed, but you must not be discouraged. No matter how many people mock you, you must remember that you are my son and in line to inherit the seat of the Lionheart clan\u2019s Patriarch.\u201d\u201cYes, mother.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t change the past. So remember Cyan, it\u2019s what you do from now that\u2019s important,\u201d Ancilla bit out these words as she glared at Eugene.Ancilla had been holding on tightly to Cyan\u2019s hand. Through this grip, Cyan could feel his mother\u2019s hand trembling slightly.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Cyan tried to reassure his mother.\u201c...That\u2019s right, as expected of my lovely son,\u201d Ancilla said, accepting her son\u2019s comfort.Eugene was to be adopted into the main family. Tanis and Ancilla were informed of this fact the previous day. Naturally, they had objected. However, they hadn\u2019t been able to change their husband\u2019s mind. 'For the Lionheart clan and for the glory of the direct line,\u2019 her husband had said, his words filled with familial pride and enthusiasm that could not be overturned.Rather than the family\u2019s glory, Ancilla preferred to ensure the glory of her children. However, she was also greedy enough to want to first raise the prestige of the Lionheart name. Combining this greed, her desires as a mother, and recognizing the importance of the bloodline for an inheritance, Ancilla had adapted to the new reality forced onto the main family.\u201cThere is no way that Eugene can become the Patriarch,\u201d Ancilla said, lowering her voice. \u201cHowever, Cyan, don\u2019t allow yourself to relax just because of that fact. Because you never know what the future might have in store. Since you have so many disadvantages compared to him, you need to work even harder to become the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cYes, mother,\u201d Cyan didn\u2019t allow his shoulders to droop down once more, even though they wanted to.Instead, he turned his head to look in Eugene\u2019s direction while nodding.\u201c...Still. There\u2019s no need to needlessly make an enemy of Eugene,\u201d Ancilla added.\u201c...Because we\u2019ll be brothers from now on?\u201d Cyan uncertainly asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ancilla honestly wasn\u2019t happy to acknowledge that Cyan would have to treat Eugene as his brother, but her reply differed from her inner thoughts. \u201cMake sure to build up a brotherly connection to him. Make it strong enough that that child will become your strength in the future. After all, you\u2026 you have time on your side.\u201d\u201c...Time\u2026?\u201d Cyan muttered questioningly.\u201cDon\u2019t belittle him because he\u2019s adopted. Instead, treat him as an equal. As you play together and train together, create some fond memories. Don\u2019t allow that child to hold a grudge against you. Just like that\u2026 make it so that one day that boy will be willing to assist you,\u201d Ancilla continued her advice.\u201c...Yes, mother,\u201d Cyan hesitantly said, quietly nodding his head.This small child held quite a complex array of emotions regarding Eugene. From his defeat in their duel came humiliation, unwillingness, and rage. But because of the overwhelming ability that Eugene had showcased during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, there was also admiration towards him, as well as envy and awe\u2026.\u2018...Now I need to be friendly with him\u2026,\u2019\u00a0if this were only a few days ago, he would have burst into anger at these words. However, the current Cyan didn\u2019t show any trace of that. Instead, he actually felt slightly embarrassed.\u201c...M-mother,\u201d Cyan tentatively spoke up.\u201cSay whatever it is you want to say,\u201d encouraged Ancilla.Cyan nervously asked, \u201cHow exactly\u2026\u00a0do I\u00a0become friendly with him? C-can\u2019t you speak to him for me, mother? You can tell him to make friends with me\u2026.\u201dAlthough these words were to be expected from a spoiled child who had never needed to make friends, Ancilla looked at her son with a gaze full of disappointment.\u201cTalk to Ciel,\u201d Ancilla eventually hissed.Ancilla would have taught her son a harsh lesson if it weren't for the eyes surrounding them. Instead, she let out a sigh and shook her head.Meanwhile, Ciel was currently standing beside Eugene.Gerhard was surrounded by the adults from the other collateral families and was busy chatting about this and that. Among these adults, the parents of Gargith and Dezra were especially eager to talk to Gerhard.\u201cYou really have raised a wonderful son.\u201d\u201cI heard that he will be adopted into the main family?\u201d\u201cWhat type of training did your boy do?\u201d\u201cThey also say that Lord Gerhard will be entering the main family.\u201d\u201cI heard from my son that your boy\u2019s strength is really impressive for his size.\u201d\u201cCould you give some advice on how to educate my own children?\u201d\u201cEven the main family doesn\u2019t have our house\u2019s revolutionary muscle growth agent. Are you interested in trying some?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite serendipitous that we were all able to meet like this, so I think that from now on, we should continue to arrange events where members from the different collateral lines can mingle and get to know each other.\u201d\u201cThis muscle growth agent is most effective when taken by children, but even adults show some effect. Of course, it has to be combined with the proper exercise and nutritional supplements, but I think Lord Gerhard might be able to make good use of it.\u201d\u201cOh my, then that works out perfectly. You were supposed to go out hunting with the guys next month, right dear? Gerhard should go along with you as well.\u201d\u201cOnce you start working up a good sweat while running across the mountains, Lord Gerhard will also become addicted to the taste of our\u00a0muscle growth agent.\u201dGerhard had no choice but to keep making sounds of agreement as the words poured in from all directions.Eugene didn\u2019t want to pointlessly get singled out by these over-eager adults. As such, he immediately left them behind while Ciel trailed along in his footsteps.\u201cMy father told me that we\u2019ll be siblings from now on.\u201d\u201cDo you have any objections to that?\u201d\u201cIt feels a little strange,\u201d Ciel said with a giggle as she tugged on the back of Eugene\u2019s shirt. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve only ever had Cyan and Eward as brothers, but now suddenly, a new little brother has appeared.\u201d\u201cWhat kinda crap is that?\u00a0Little brother?\u201d\u00a0Eugene objected to this new title.\u201cBut your birthday is later than mine,\u201d Ciel pointed out.\u201cWhy should that matter? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a difference in years, only by a few months, so how can I allow you to call me your little brother?\u201d Eugene asked aggressively.\u201cI was born five seconds later than my brother, but I\u2019m still his little sister,\u201d Ciel calmly pointed out.Eugene was left dumbstruck by her logic.After some hesitation, he weakly argued, \u201c...This and that are a little different.\u201d\u201cHow is it different? I\u2019m younger than Cyan by a few seconds, so I\u2019m his little sister. You\u2019re younger than me by a few months, so you\u2019re my little brother,\u201d Ciel continued relentlessly.\u201cNo, as I said, it\u2019s different,\u201d Eugene was still trying to escape.\u201cWhy is it different?\u201d However, Ciel didn\u2019t halt her interrogation.So why was it different? Even Eugene, who had memories of his previous life, couldn\u2019t come up with a reasonable answer to that question.\u201c...That\u2019s\u2026 because I\u2019m not your real brother! We have different parents, so\u2026 that means I can\u2019t be your little brother,\u201d Eugene tried to put some confidence in his words.\u201cHowever, you\u2019re still my brother,\u201d Ciel wasn\u2019t having it.\u201cAlthough that might nominally be true, we\u2019re fundamentally strangers. That\u2019s why I will absolutely never call you by big sis.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just call me big sis even once?\u201d\u201cNot even if my life was on the line.\u201d\u201cHmph,\u201d Ciel began to pout her lips.She began choking Eugene by tugging the hem of his shirt back and forth.\u201cCall me big sis, just one time,\u201d she pleaded.\u201cNo way,\u201d he refused.\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a hard thing to do.\u201d\u201cI said no way, and I mean no way.\u201d\u201cIf you keep acting like this, big sis will have to punish you,\u201d Ciel changed tack with a threat.\u201cStop spouting nonsense,\u201d Eugene huffed.\u201cYour words are way too mean. I\u2019m going to tell on you to mom.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, tell on me, but before that, why do you keep grabbing me like this?\u201d Eugene asked in annoyance as he shook Ciel\u2019s hands off his shirt.This caused Ciel\u2019s lips to\u00a0pout\u00a0even more.\u201cWhy are you being so mean?\u201d Ciel whined.\u201cI\u2019m not being mean. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re doing stupid sh\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you want me to cry?\u201d Ciel interrupted before he could finish.\u201cHold\u2014Hold on a moment,\u201d Eugene started to panic, looking around for help as his fists trembled uselessly at his sides.After staring at Eugene sulkily, Ciel suddenly stuck her tongue out at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna cry, idiot.\u201d\u201cOf course, you weren\u2019t\u2026,\u201d Eugene sighed.\u201cI just want to hear you call me big sis, even if it\u2019s just once, is that really so hard?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult for me,\u201d Eugene answered.After all, how could he call a thirteen-year-old brat his big sis?\u2018I\u2019d rather die,\u2019\u00a0Eugene sincerely believed this statement.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His sparkling eyes were full of longing and anticipation for his future in Aroth. However, Lovellian wasn\u2019t in a position where he could unconditionally grant this young man his desires.\u201cThe Red Tower of Magic, of which I am the master, specializes in summoning magic among all the various types of magic. As such, you must first go to Aroth and take the systematic aptitude test to see if you fit our specialty.\u201d\u201cBut what if\u2026 I do have an aptitude for summoning magic?\u201d Eward asked hopefully.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s a joyous discovery, but aptitude alone won\u2019t qualify you to be my disciple.\u201dWith this, Lovellian clearly drew the line at what he was willing to do. Eward looked disappointed for a moment, but he quickly changed his expression, keenly aware of Gilead and Tanis who were sitting next to Lovellian.Eward was about to leave this suffocating household. That alone would be enough to make this a moment to celebrate. Even if he couldn\u2019t become Lovellian\u2019s disciple right away, the fact that he could leave his family behind and escape to another country made the tips of Eward\u2019s fingers tremble in excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s because there are a lot of wizards who desire to be my disciple,\u201d Lovellian continued speaking. \u201cIn Aroth, your identity as an heir to the Lionheart clan won\u2019t grant you any leeway. Unless you have enough talent to silence all the other wizards\u2019 protests, I cannot take you as my disciple.\u201d\u201c...I understand,\u201d said Eward, in a much subdued tone.Now that he had delivered his warning, Lovellian began comforting Eward, \u201c...While Aroth won\u2019t show any special treatment to those who bear the Lionheart name, I am Gilead\u2019s old friend before I am the Head Wizard of the Red Tower\u2026. With my resources, I will be able to provide you with many opportunities, and I will also be able to protect you from the voices claiming unfair discrimination. This is all to provide you with the best environment to train the magic that matches your aptitude.\u201dAll these promises made Eward\u2019s heart pound faster in excitement. However, Eward didn\u2019t rush to accept the offer or burst into excited laughter, no matter how much he wanted to. Instead, he turned to look at Tanis and Gilead with timid eyes.\u201c...This is something you should decide by yourself,\u201d Gilead spoke first. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be concerned about me. If you want to go, then go.\u201d\u201c...Father\u2026,\u201d Eward mumbled.\u201cEward,\u201d Tanis, who had stayed silent, suddenly called out while staring at her son, \u201cThis is an opportunity your father has worked hard to grant you. Receive it with gratitude.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eward was cowed into silence.Noticing his son\u2019s discomfort, Gilead took over, \u201cWhat reason do you have to hesitate? After all, from an early age, you\u2019ve always shown more interest in magic than you have in swords or spears.\u201dEward still seemed unsure but was unable to think of something to say.\u201cFor your sake, I requested several of the capital\u2019s greatest wizards to come and tutor you, but unfortunately, none were suitable to become your teacher,\u201d Gilead sighed in disappointment.There was some irony in these words. The wizards who had been invited from the capital to teach Eward magic were all famous wizards who could have risen to positions of considerable height in their towers if they had chosen to remain in Aroth.None of them had become Eward\u2019s teacher because Eward himself hadn\u2019t been able to devote himself fully to the study of magic. This suffocating household had suppressed both Eward\u2019s passion and his free will.\u201cEward,\u201d Tanis said, narrowing her eyes.Eward was afraid of meeting his mother\u2019s gaze. He was much more afraid of his mother, who was always standing by his side monitoring his every action, than he was of his father, the Patriarch of their house.Tanis started one of her oft-repeated lectures, \u201cYou must not forget. You are the first heir of the Lionheart clan. As my son, you are destined to become the Patriarch of the main family.\u201dEward hated the sound of these words. They filled him with fear and weighed heavily on his shoulders each time he was forced to listen to them. Unable to say anything in response, Eward lowered his gaze to the floor.\u201cYou must not forget this fact, even in Aroth,\u201d Tanis concluded firmly.\u201c...Tanis,\u201d Gilead chided his wife.Tanis defended herself, \u201cAs his mother, I am only trying to encourage my son.\u201dGilead was just trying to get her to ease up, but Tanis shot her husband a cold glare. She hadn\u2019t fully agreed with her husband\u2019s plans in the first place. She hated the thought of a stranger like Eugene entering the main family. An adoption of all things? How ridiculous! Wasn\u2019t it enough that Gilead had even taken a second wife and ended up with twins?She also didn\u2019t want to send Eward to Aroth. If the eldest son, Eward, was sent to Aroth, it was obvious that that damned Ancilla would go crazy with joy.However, Tanis had no choice but to send Eward to Aroth. Although her hateful child had been born as the eldest heir to the main family, he hadn\u2019t inherited the qualities needed to appear suitable for such a position. Even worse, he had a weak and naive nature. No matter how much Tanis wanted to keep her son close to her, by doing so, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see even the slightest of improvements in Eward\u2019s capabilities.\u201c...Eward,\u201d Tanis continued in a softer tone, taking hold of Eward\u2019s hand.She simply stared at her son\u2019s face as she waited for him to respond, without saying anything more. Eward slowly forced himself to raise his gaze and meet Tanis\u2019 eyes.That night, Tanis spent a long time speaking with Eward in his room.Eward would be leaving with Lovellian for Aroth the next day. Tanis hoped that Eward would be able to become Lovellian\u2019s disciple. But if he couldn\u2019t do that, then she at least hoped that he would be able to increase his chances of succeeding his father by interacting with other wizards in Aroth.She hoped that by getting along with these wizards, he could create relationships that would later benefit him, thereby gaining support for his bid to become the Patriarch; this was an opportunity that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of by remaining at the main estate.\u201cYou are the heir to the Lionheart clan,\u201d Tanis repeated this line several times throughout the night.\u201cY-yes, mother,\u201d unable to raise his eyes off the floor, Eward repeated the same response every time.* * *The day after the banquet, a lot of people were departing from the main estate. Lovellian was headed to Aroth with Eward, and Gargith and Dezra were returning to their homes along with their parents.Even the dropouts whose names weren\u2019t important enough to remember had left, so the annex should have been nearly empty, but the servants in the annex were still bustling with activity since early this morning.This was because, from now on, the annex would be solely used by Eugene and Gerhard. Gilead had offered for them to stay with him in the main family\u2019s mansion, but Eugene had rejected this offer. This was for the sake of his father, Gerhard. If he ended up staying in the estate\u2019s main mansion without a good reason for doing so, Gerhard would probably have no choice but to keep walking on eggshells around the members of the main family. So instead of being forced to endure that discomfort, by living separately in the annex, things would be easier for the both of them.\u201cI hope we get along well from now on,\u201d Eugene said with a smile.Nina nodded her head in reply. Her duties as his servant hadn\u2019t been suspended following the end of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Following Eugene\u2019s request, Nina would continue to serve as his personal attendant.Nina knew that this was a sign of Eugene\u2019s esteem.\u201cIs there anything you would like me to bring back from Gidol?\u201d Gerhard asked as he prepared to leave.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything, father, so you should just focus on packing up your own things,\u201d Eugene replied.Even though he was currently suffering from a headache as part of his hangover, Gerhard couldn\u2019t afford to rest until he recovered. Because he needed to head to Gidol immediately with a few of the main family\u2019s groundskeepers. Since he would be living in the annex with Eugene from now on, he needed to arrange for his mansion in Gidol to be closed up.All the knights who had been serving Gerhard for so long, as well as all the servants and groundskeepers, were waiting for him in Gidol. While he wouldn\u2019t be able to return to the main estate with all of them, a chosen few would accompany Gerhard back. Meanwhile, a few would be left behind and charged with the necessary duty of maintaining the now owner-less estate. As long as they were paid well enough, many of the servants would be willing to stay at their old mansion.\u201cSince the items in the annex are a lot better than the ones at our mansion, don\u2019t pointlessly pack things that we won\u2019t need,\u201d Eugene advised his father.\u201cI still haven\u2019t gotten used to the idea\u2026. Are we really\u2026 living here from now on\u2026?\u201d Gerhard asked hesitantly.Gerhard chuckled in disbelief as he turned to take in the annex. Although he had tried his best to adjust to the situation multiple times, reality still sometimes felt like a dream.\u2018...But this is definitely reality,\u2019\u00a0he reminded himself.Gerhard felt his heart swell with pride as he looked down at his son's smiling face. After hugging his son once more, he got onto the carriage prepared by the groundskeepers.\u201cGo safely and make sure to brag about our good fortune,\u201d Eugene said with a smile as he saw Gerhard off.The morning of the first day in his new life as an adoptee had passed like this. Normally, he would have begun his training at this point, but Eugene instead just waited around aimlessly inside the gymnasium.Today was an important day for Eugene in many ways. Not only was this the first day in the rest of his life as an adopted member of the main family, but it was also the day he would be initiating his mana for the first time since his reincarnation.All mana training scriptures began by first teaching how to sense mana. Although mana was everywhere in the world, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find it with the naked eye no matter how hard you looked for it. Only after refining yourself and your senses according to the mana training scripture could you begin to sense mana.Such \u2018refinement\u2019 could broadly be divided into two categories. The Breathing techniques and the Physical techniques.Breathing training techniques accumulated the mana that was dissolved into the atmosphere by breathing it in; Physical techniques accumulated this mana through the movement of the body. Neither of them was easy to learn, but if Eugene had to pick, he would say that Breathing techniques were superior to Physical techniques. Once a Breathing technique was completely internalized, the user was able to absorb mana with every movement they made, but it was extremely hard for Physical techniques to do likewise.In his previous life, Hamel had trained his mana according to a Physical technique. Later, with advice from\u00a0Sienna\u00a0and Vermouth, he had converted his Physical technique into a Breathing technique.\u2018The Lionheart\u2019s mana training scripture is a Breathing technique,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled.Although it might seem obvious, mana training couldn\u2019t be done just by breathing normally.\u00a0Breathing techniques used to train mana also required a certain knack, somewhat similar to casting magic.\u201cYou\u2019re here early,\u201d a voice called out to Eugene.It was Gion Lionheart. He approached Eugene while leading two horses behind him. Without showing any surprise, Eugene bowed his head to Gion in greeting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 23.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23.2: Mana Training (1)The previous night, after the banquet had ended, Eugene had received a summons from Gilead. Now that the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over, and he had even been adopted into the main family, it was time for Eugene to begin training his mana in earnest. For this, Gilead had decided to provide a detailed explanation of how Eugene\u2019s training would be conducted.His training would take place on top of a leyline, a place where mana was heavily concentrated.Deep within the forest of the main estate, there was a leyline that only members of the main family were allowed to visit. The leyline wasn\u2019t naturally occurring but instead had been formed by the Great Vermouth himself three hundred years ago.Only the children of the main family were usually allowed to make use of the leyline\u2019s power. Although part of the reason why Cyan was already able to manifest sword-light was because of his own outstanding talent, the leyline\u2019s help had undeniably played a huge role in his success.\u2018He actually created an artificial leyline. Vermouth really was a monster,\u2019\u00a0even with the experience from Eugene\u2019s previous life, he still found it difficult to comprehend.So Vermouth had somehow forcibly twisted the flow of mana deep within the earth to create this artificial leyline? And it was even able to last for over three hundred years?\u2018Crazy bastard,\u2019\u00a0Eugene silently cursed.If it was Vermouth they were talking about, this definitely seemed possible. However\u2026\u00a0instead\u00a0of feeling admiration for Vermouth\u2019s prestigious accomplishments, Eugene couldn\u2019t help but feel a warped sense of unfamiliarity. Just what the hell had happened to Vermouth\u2019s brain in his later years that he had even thought of ensuring the future glory of his descendants by creating such a leyline?\u2018Taking more than ten wives, having dozens of children, splitting them into the direct and collateral lines while preaching the importance of legitimacy, and even creating the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony\u2026.\u2019\u00a0There was just too much of a difference between the Vermouth that Eugene remembered and the founder of the Lionheart clan.\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d Gion suddenly asked, pulling Eugene out of his thoughts.\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Eugene replied with a smile.He set all his doubts and unpleasant feelings regarding Vermouth aside. In any case, Eugene had been adopted into the main family and then allowed to enter the leyline thanks to Gilead\u2019s kindness. Gion was also going to personally assist with his initiation of mana, so he shouldn\u2019t let his opinions of Vermouth color his view of the main family, especially when they were currently riding to the leyline.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Gion warned. \u201cBecause mana is\u2026\u00a0something\u00a0that is always around you, but it\u2019s still difficult to sense it for the first time. Although I\u2019ll be helping you, as someone who\u2019s just started initiating their mana, you\u2019ll have to go through quite a lot of trouble first.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cMhm. The younger you are, the easier it is to feel it. As you grow older\u2026 your sensitivity to mana dulls. This is because your body gets used to not being able to sense mana,\u201d Gion continued his explanation.This was something that Eugene was aware of as well. Just as any sense that hadn\u2019t seen regular use became dull, mana sensitivity suffered from the same detriment as well.\u201cCyan and Ciel first initiated their mana when they were six. As\u00a0for Eward\u2026 my sister-in-law was a bit too eager, so he initiated his mana when he was only five,\u201d upon saying this, Gion turned to look at Eugene with a bitter smile. \u201cAlthough they were initiating their mana at such a young age, it still took them around three days to sense the mana. Eward\u2026 mmm\u2026 didn\u2019t it take him a week?\u201d\u201cDoes that mean he took a long time?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cNo, it\u2019s actually very fast. The collateral descendants usually initiate their mana when they\u2019re around your age, but it\u2019s said that it takes them around a month just to \u2018feel\u2019 slight amounts of mana. Then after slowly absorbing these traces of mana into their body, it takes them a few more months until they can develop a full awareness of mana,\u201d Gion showed some sympathy as he explained all this.Eugene nodded slowly.Glancing at Eugene, Gion quickly added, \u201cAh, but\u2026 it shouldn\u2019t take you that long. Because we have the leyline here, which gives you a quick and easy way to sense mana. On top of that, I\u2019ll also be helping you.\u201d\u201cHow many days do you think I\u2019ll take?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cUm\u2026. Maybe ten days\u2026?\u201d Gion said with a half-hearted smile.Gion was lying. In his opinion, ten days would actually be very fast. Although thirteen wasn\u2019t too late of an age at which to initiate mana, it wasn\u2019t a particularly early age either.\u2018And even with the leyline, we can\u2019t guarantee he\u2019ll be able to feel the mana\u2026,\u2019\u00a0he thought, but Gion kept his doubts to himself.After all, wasn\u2019t that why Gion was here, to ensure Eugene\u2019s success? So, for the time being, he needed to stick to Eugene\u2019s side.\u201cFirst of all\u2026 it\u2019s important for you to be able to feel mana. Although the mana at the leyline will already be very dense, in addition to that, I will be directly infusing more mana into your body,\u201d Gion laid out the plan.\u201cWill that allow me to sense it more easily?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Gion confirmed.To have a master like Gion personally assist with your initiation into mana was a huge privilege.\u2018They really are taking good care of me,\u2019\u00a0Eugene remarked to himself.Eugene had initially expected them to just provide him with a few manastones; instead, they had actually allowed him to enter their training grounds on top of a leyline and even set an expert at his side to guide him.\u201cTen days, huh\u2026. If that\u2019s the case, will I be spending the full ten days at the leyline along with you, Sir Gion?\u201d Eugene double-checked the details.\u201cAlthough the leyline might be in the middle of the forest, it has everything we\u2019ll need. Although it\u2019s small, there\u2019s even a house\u2026. All our daily necessities and food will also be supplied by servants,\u201d Gion answered his question in detail.\u201cWow, it sounds like this will be fun,\u201d Eugene said, smiling childishly.\u2018As if it will take me ten days,\u2019\u00a0Eugene scoffed behind his innocent smile.\u00a0\u2018It won\u2019t even take me ten minutes.\u2019Eugene had only kept himself from absorbing any mana into his body by avoiding any sort of mana training. He hadn\u2019t neglected and dulled his ability to sense mana in the first place.\u2018Although\u2026 sensing mana and accepting it into the body are two different things,\u2019\u00a0Eugene acknowledged.He was feeling some anticipation. Would this cheat body also be good at absorbing mana?Far away from the mansion, a secluded hut stood inside the forest. Although Vermouth had created the leyline three hundred years ago, the hut looked to be in good shape, as if it had been constantly maintained since then.Gion ordered, \u201cStay here for a few moments. It will take some time to undo the security. Unfortunately, there isn't much for you to look at while you wait.\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene smartly responded.Gion first got down from his horse. Then he took out a keyring from his vest and began unlocking each of the cabin\u2019s locks one by one. These locks weren\u2019t simple iron affairs either. Without the permission of the Patriarch, it would be impossible to undo the locks and open the door, even with the right keys.During this time, Eugene had also gotten off his horse and turned to take in his surroundings. Although he had also ventured into the forest just two days back, they hadn\u2019t ventured anywhere near this deep.Eugene looked around at all the dense trees. He could see various small animals and insects, but there were no monsters. This entire gigantic forest was under strict management as part of the main estate.\u2018Though, if you just look at this natural atmosphere, it even feels like an elf might appear,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.Three hundred years ago, the Demon Kings of Helmuth had begun to run rampant, and the races that had suffered the most from this were not the humans, but the elves and the dragons. More elves had died each time Helmuth\u2019s ominous power had grown stronger, and the dragons who attempted to confront the Demon Kings were killed in droves.\u2026Even now, when only two of the five Demon Kings remained, the two races had yet to fully recover from their past disasters.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s head on in,\u201d Gion called to Eugene.Immersed in a mix of complex emotions, Eugene took a moment to compose himself before turning around.\u201cIt all looks spotless,\u201d Eugene remarked as he saw the inside of the hut.\u201cThere are all sorts of magic that have been cast on it,\u201d Gion answered the implied question as he led Eugene inside.They headed straight for the stairs leading down into the basement.\u201cIs it okay if we start right away?\u201d Eugene asked excitedly.\u201c...Hm?\u201d Gion gave a startled hum as he turned to look at Eugene.Then after blinking his eyes for a moment, he put on a wry smile and nodded his head.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Gion acquiesced.It was a good thing that Eugene was ambitious. However, Gion couldn\u2019t help but feel a little concerned.This boy, Eugene Lionheart, was truly exceptional. Even Gion acknowledged this fact. Although he hadn\u2019t personally seen Eugene\u2019s performance in the duel with Cyan or during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, he could clearly feel the truth from what he had heard about Eugene. On top of that, the habitual movements of his body were so light and agile that it was hard to believe they belonged to a child who hadn\u2019t even trained his mana.\u2018...Although being able to move his body well doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be equally as skilled with manipulating mana,\u2019\u00a0Gion mused.Gion was truly well aware of this fact. He was also someone who had heard countless praises calling him a genius ever since he was young. However, even though his talent for the martial arts was amazing, it had taken him a very long time to get familiar with his mana.\u2018Hopefully, he won\u2019t be disappointed after fruitlessly getting his expectations up\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Gion worried silently.The more you were aware of your own talent and the greater the pride you felt from it, the worse the pain and frustration that came from your continued failure.I\u2019m definitely a genius, so why can\u2019t I just do this?As a child, Gion had needed quite some time to get over the frustration from his failures. Eventually, he had managed to overcome the wall blocking his progress, but initiating his mana for the first time and mastering its uses had still been extremely arduous.\u2018...At the moment, he\u2019s especially at risk of this since he\u2019s still full of confidence in himself,\u2019\u00a0Gion sighed inwardly.Eugene\u2019s achievements were unprecedented in the history of the Lionheart clan. It was the first time that a child from the collateral lines had defeated the children from the direct line to win the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. It was also the first time a child had been adopted into the main family. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he had even claimed Wynnyd from the family\u2019s treasure vault and then was allowed to enter the leyline.When even adults could be shocked by this list of achievements, how proud and full of himself must Eugene be as a thirteen-year-old child who had managed to accomplish all this.Every time this thought went through his head, Gion\u2019s expression softened in concern. Although he knew that his worries were premature, Gion couldn\u2019t help but fear that Eugene would become despondent when confronted with the difficulties of reality.If Eugene had been able to read Gion\u2019s thoughts, he would have doubled over laughing. Frustration over not being a genius? He had already gone through something like that three hundred years ago.Standing beside the Great Vermouth, he had had the truth of what a \u2018genius\u2019 really was rubbed in his face over and over again. Compared to Vermouth, there was not a single person in this world who could be arrogant enough to call themselves a genius. Only Vermouth was worthy of that title, and the word genius seemed to exist solely for someone like Vermouth.As Hamel, Eugene had come to fully accept these facts.\u2018The Stupid Hamel,\u2019\u00a0when he had first seen this name written in a children\u2019s book, Eugene had felt like he wanted to rip a particular anonymous author to pieces. However, after further consideration, he realized that the name wasn\u2019t all that inaccurate.After all, Hamel had been pretty stupid, unlike Sienna, Anise, and Molon, who had never considered Vermouth to be their rival. To them, Vermouth was just a friend and a companion with whom they had risked life and death together.Although Hamel also felt this way, he was the only one who wanted to surpass Vermouth. As such, he was the only one who continued to argue with Vermouth\u2019s decisions.\u201cSit over there in the middle,\u201d although the basement was completely empty, Gion pointed to the center of the room as he said this. \u201cFor the first step, just try to clear your mind as you breathe. Since you\u2019ll need to get started by sensing the mana in your surroundings.\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene obeyed the order.Mana was always present but was difficult to feel. And if you wanted to accumulate mana inside your body, you needed to be able to feel it first. Full-scale \u2018training\u2019 could only begin after that.\u201cThe mana training scripture that has been passed down through the direct line was inherited from our ancestry, the Great Vermouth,\u201d Gion began his lesson.\u2018Oh,\u2019 Eugene perked up. He had been waiting for these words.\u201cAlthough at the start it might have been the same as the ones used by the collateral lines, by now, it has become completely different. After all, so much time has passed, and\u2026 the collateral lines are not allowed to pass down the original scripture,\u201d Gion continued.The Great Vermouth had drawn a clear line between the main family and its collateral branches. All the collateral branches shared the same roots as the main family. Even Eugene\u2019s ancestor had once been a member of the direct line in the distant past and was pushed out of the main family when they could not become the Patriarch. After they were exiled like this, an inescapable restraint was placed on all the ancestors of the collateral lines.This restraint made it impossible for them to pass on the mana training scripture that they had learned from the main family to their descendants. The only thing that could be passed down to the descendants of the collateral lines was a poor imitation of the main family\u2019s original scripture. This fake scripture was also made by Vermouth, but of course, it was much less effective than the original copy.\u201cThe White Flame Formula,\u201d Gion uttered the name of their scripture as he roused the mana within his body.Mana that gave off a pure white light immediately surrounded Gion\u2019s body, appearing as if a flame had just engulfed his entire body.Eugene hadn\u2019t known that the name of the scripture was the White Flame Formula, but he clearly remembered the unique appearance of the mana generated by this scripture.The high-quality mana that Vermouth had used had always been expressed in the form of a pure white flame like Gion\u2019s. Whenever Vermouth had charged forward with this white flame-like mana wrapped around his body, the sparks that flew off him had looked just like a lion\u2019s flowing mane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

By now, the mana training scriptures inherited by the oldest collateral houses bore almost no resemblance to their original form.However, the modified versions of the Red Flame Formula still could not reach the full power of the White Flame Formula. Even after such a long period of development, the knock-offs still couldn\u2019t overcome the original. The combined wisdom and effort of entire lines of descendants couldn\u2019t compete with that of the Great Vermouth.The Lionheart clan\u2019s direct line was well aware of this fact. As such, they hadn\u2019t altered the White Flame Formula to be in any way different from its original form because there was no need to make any changes in the first place. What reason was there to\u00a0add to\u00a0something that was already perfect?\u201cYou will be learning the White Flame Formula,\u201d said Gion.Distracted from staring blankly into Gion\u2019s flame as he had been so far, Eugene nodded eagerly at these words. Although the name, White Flame Formula, was unfamiliar to him, he couldn\u2019t be more familiar with its appearance. It was a sight that had caused him to feel frustration more than a few times in his past life.Until the very end, Hamel hadn\u2019t been able to surpass the power of these flames.\u2018...Haaah,\u2019\u00a0Eugene sighed to himself.He could feel the echoes of bitterness lingering from his past. However, this did nothing to cool the burning excitement in his heart.Gion continued, \u201cOf course, you won\u2019t be able to learn it right away. You\u2019ll need to be able to sense mana first\u2014\u201d\u201cI can already feel it,\u201d urged on by his excitement, Eugene didn\u2019t have the patience to keep listening until the end and instead chose to interrupt Gion.\u201c...Huh?\u201d Gion grunted in confusion.\u201cI said that I can already feel the mana,\u201d Eugene repeated.Gion was speechless as he stared at Eugene for a moment, his eyes blinking in disbelief. Then he burst out laughing at the absurd claim.\u201cThat\u2019s just an illusion,\u201d Gion corrected Eugene.He understood how Eugene could have come to make such a mistake. Once you got too absorbed into something, it was easy for strange delusions to arise in your head.\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Eugene insisted.\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d Gion hummed as he wondered how he should convince Eugene that he was mistaken.After a few moments of contemplation, Gion gently prodded his mana. Then, according to Gion's will, an intangible wisp of mana moved and hovered at Eugene\u2019s side.When Eugene remained silent, Gion smiled and\u00a0said, \u201cSee. It\u2019s too early for you to\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d Eugene said, pointing to his left thigh. \u201cThe mana has gathered in this location.\"\u201c...,\u201d Gion\u2019s face froze as he was struck dumb.No way, it couldn\u2019t be. Gion moved his mana once more. This time, instead of focusing it in one place, he dispersed it. A light stream of mana curled around Eugene\u2019s body.\u201cHere, over there, up, and now down.\u00a0How long do you want me to keep this up?\u201d Eugene asked as his hand kept moving around to follow the flow of mana.Each time he got it correct, Gion\u2019s jaw dropped even further. Eventually, Gion took a few steps back and shook his head violently.\u201c...This is unbelievable,\u201d Gion muttered in shock.But perhaps this was just a sign that Eugene\u2019s five senses were unusually developed. Gion changed the movements of the mana. Instead of allowing it to touch Eugene\u2019s body directly, he had the mana move further away.\u201cOver there.\u201dBut even with that, Eugene was able to point in the direction of the mana without any hesitation.Gion was struck by a dizzying sense of vertigo. Was this even possible? A thirteen-year-old kid who had yet to train his mana, who had never received any training to develop his sense for mana, was able to feel the mana as soon he tried?\u201c...\u201d Gion tried to speak, but words failed him.They hadn\u2019t even gotten to the part where Gion was going to flow mana directly into Eugene\u2019s body! Eugene had learned how to sense mana all on his own. If Eugene had been able to sense mana after ten days with his assistance, Gion would have already called that quick. But Eugene was so fast that it was unbelievable.\u201c...Haha,\u201d Gion finally broke out of his stupor and walked over to Eugene while shaking his head. \u201c...Although these words might seem a little rude, how great would it have been if you were born to the main family.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been adopted into it, haven\u2019t I?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cAdopted\u2026. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s\u00a0good enough,\u201d Gion agreed with a wry smile.Gion sat down in front of Eugene and held his hands so that their arms formed a circle.\u201c...If you can already feel the mana, then we can begin right away. From now on, just focus on what is happening inside your body without getting distracted,\u201d Gion told Eugene seriously.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Eugene obediently.Gion began transmitting the White Flame Formula. Eugene closed his eyes and turned his concentration inwards. Soon, mana began flowing into his body through Gion\u2019s hands. The mana leaped across the points where their hands were joined and then scattered into numerous branches within Eugene\u2019s body.His body had never before taken in any mana. However, Eugene\u2019s body seemed to be able to absorb mana \u2018well,\u2019 to an almost unbelievable extent. This fact surprised Gion once again.Gion muttered to himself,\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s a genius\u2026. No, this is\u2026.\u2019Gion\u2019s eyes wavered. He adjusted the flow of mana that he was sending into Eugene to be a little stronger. He was going to teach Eugene how to breathe in mana, not the Physical technique equivalent. Gion led Eugene into becoming conscious of the mana that was in the air he breathed in and then helped him memorize how to flow this mana through his body according to a set pattern, thus forming the mana breathing cycle.Eugene concentrated on feeling how the mana was flowing within his body. As the mana spread throughout his body, it formed a center at his heart. The mana converged around his heart and then settled into the blood vessels connected to the heart.Mana began flowing back out along with his blood. Although they flowed together, the movement of his mana didn\u2019t completely follow the circulation system of his blood.\u2018...He\u2019s a monster,\u2019\u00a0Gion finished his earlier thought.Gion slowly cut off the flow of mana that he was infusing into Eugene. However, the circulation of mana within Eugene\u2019s body didn\u2019t stop, following the withdrawal of Gion\u2019s mana. This showed that Eugene was already able to independently adjust the flow of mana within his own body. He was even making sure not to rush, going slowly so that his body had time to get used to it. Gion couldn\u2019t help but feel even further surprised that Eugene was able to accomplish this much.\u201c...Make sure not to stop breathing,\u201d Gion eventually managed to squeeze out in a shaking voice. \u201cImagine that you\u2019re breathing in the leyline\u2019s mana with each breath you take. Yes, like that\u2026. Take the mana you\u2019ve breathed in, and guide it to follow the circulation path set by the White Flame Formula. Back now\u2026 back to the heart.\u201dEugene\u2019s face showed no response. He was concentrating all his attention on memorizing the flow of mana. Then, as he breathed in more mana, he guided this inhaled mana into his heart.Gion was no longer holding Eugene\u2019s hands. Unable to close his gaping mouth, he stood up and took a few steps back.\u201c...That\u2019s right\u2026 you\u2019re doing\u2026 very well,\u201d the words that slowly fell from his lips seemed ridiculous to Gion.Doing well? How were these words enough to describe what was happening? It was just that he didn\u2019t know what else he could say, forcing him to babble something inane like that.With each breath he took, Eugene was sending ripples through the rich mana of the leyline. Since Eugene had just initiated his mana, there was a tight limit to the amount of mana his body could accept. Or at least, that was how it should have been. However, Eugene was currently in the middle of breaking that piece of common sense into pieces.\u2018This is insane.\u2019Gion wasn\u2019t the only one feeling astonished.\u00a0Eugene was also surprised by the performance of this body that he had been reincarnated into. Because he had the memories of his past life, sensing mana wasn\u2019t difficult for him. That applied to forming the mana breathing cycle as well.However, even with all that, his body was absorbing mana with surprising ease. It was to the extent where he could feel the mana stored within his body increasing significantly with each breath. Of course, even a small increase would seem significant when he didn\u2019t have any mana in his body in the first place. Still, no matter how good his sensitivity to mana was, it was a fact that his mana absorption rate exceeded all expectations.\u2018...But it looks like I still have limits,\u2019 Eugene finally realized.There was an inevitable end to the amount of mana that this young body could absorb.\u00a0After being immersed in concentration for quite some time, Eugene opened his mouth and released a long sigh as he\u00a0opened his eyes. His whole body felt sticky from being drenched in sweat.\u201c...Haha,\u201d Eugene laughed in satisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 24.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24.2: Mana Training (2)Eugene had been in this focused state for a good long while. Although the length of time was actually shorter than Gion had expected their first session to be, what Eugene had managed to accomplish during these few hours broke all of Gion\u2019s beliefs and certainties.The mana of the leyline had actually thinned enough that a difference could be felt. Although it would recover with time, this was a sign that Eugene had absorbed as much mana as his body could possibly\u00a0handle in just a few hours.Cyan, Ciel, and Eward had taken several days just to sense mana. Then it took them a lot longer to absorb mana into their bodies and eventually form a core from it.That went for Gion as well.Eugene, however\u2026 had been able to sense mana as soon as he took a seat and, immediately after forming the mana breathing cycle, had gathered the mana around his heart in order to form his core. Eugene had even managed the whole process without much help from Gion. All Gion had done was provide an initial influx of mana and transmit the flow pattern of the White Flame Formula.\u2018...The size of his core is also alarming,\u2019\u00a0Gion observed.It was so large that it was impossible to believe that Eugene had just initiated his mana. If you didn\u2019t know Eugene\u2019s circumstances, the size might lead you to believe that he\u2019d been training his mana for a few years now.\u2018It\u2019s usually much smaller than that, but\u2026.\u2019When Gion had first started training his mana, his core was much smaller than Eugene\u2019s, but as he diligently trained his mana, the size of his core grew larger.\u201c...So you really are a monster,\u201d Gion finally managed to choke out the words.While wiping away the sweat running down his cheeks, Eugene smiled calmly and asked,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u00a0right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely\u2026 a compliment,\u201d Gion muttered in a dull tone as he gave Eugene a hand up. \u201c...Well\u2026 um\u2026 let\u2019s start heading back.\u201dGion\u2019s thoughts were preoccupied with a single question, how exactly should he explain what had just happened to his brother?\u2018Thanks, Vermouth,\u2019\u00a0Eugene smiled as he thought of this comrade from his previous life.Eugene continued to learn more about the White Flame Formula on the way back.The biggest difference between the White Flame Formula and the Red Flame Formula was the former\u2019s ability to split off part of the original core to form a new core. No matter how much you developed and trained in the Red Flame Formula, in the end, you could only have a single mana core inside your body. However, when the White Flame Formula grew past a certain level, the core would split into two. In this way, the body would become able to absorb even more mana, and the split cores could resonate with each other to amplify both cores\u2019 power.Each of these cores, both the original and the one that had split off, were called \u2018stars,\u2019 and the number of stars you had reached marked your progress in the White Flame Formula.The Great Vermouth, the progenitor of the Lionheart clan and creator of the White Flame Formula, had held ten stars in his body. In the entire history of the Lionheart Clan, Vermouth was the only one who had managed to reach the Tenth Star of the White Flame Formula.\u201cBoth my brother and I are at the Sixth Star,\u201d Gion revealed.This seemed like nothing next to the Great Vermouth. However, in the history of the Lionheart clan, the number of people who had managed to reach the Sixth Star of the White Flame Formula could be counted on one hand.\u201cCyan, Ciel, and Eward are all at\u2026 the First Star. Although I\u2019m not sure about Eward, the twins should reach the Second Star after a year or so,\u201d Gion cited as an example of how fast progress in the White Flame Formula usually was.\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201c...I really can\u2019t tell,\u201d Gion replied with a wry smile.The unbelievable sight he had seen back at the leyline caused Gion to answer very cautiously out of fear of having to eat his words.Gion continued the lecture, \u201cIn my case\u2026 it took me eight years to go from the First Star to the Second Star. It was around the same for my brother. Since Cyan and Ceil initiated their mana when they were six\u2026 if they manage to reach the Second Star by next year, it would have taken them eight years, just like my brother and me.\u201d\u201cThen will it take me eight years as well?\u201d Eugene guessed.\u201cNo,\u201d came the immediate reply.Although he couldn\u2019t guess how long it would take Eugene, Gion felt certain as he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a lot faster than that.\u201dGion could at least be confident of this belief. In the records of the Lionheart clan, there had never been a child who was able to sense mana and begin practicing the White Flame Formula as fast as Eugene. At the moment, just looking at Eugene\u2019s core, it seemed to be bigger than Cyan\u2019s when the boy was ten.\u201cIt definitely won\u2019t take you eight years. Well\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t become lazy, that is,\u201d Gion reminded Eugene.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to work hard,\u201d Eugene replied with a grin.As if Eugene would be lazy, there was no way he would do something as brain-dead as that. Now that he had been reincarnated into a body that was overwhelmingly better than the one from his previous life, he didn\u2019t want such a body to go to waste out of his own slothfulness.\u2018On top of that, I\u2019ve even learned Vermouth\u2019s mana training scripture,\u2019\u00a0Eugene mused in excitement.How often had he been left feeling frustrated by that damned white flame and the shining lion\u2019s mane that had sped ahead of him? Until the very end, Stupid Hamel had never been able to surpass Vermouth. No matter how hard he had worked, he had never been able to match Vermouth in strength.But now, was it possible for him to catch up to Vermouth?After some thought, Eugene decided,\u00a0\u2018No way.\u2019Eugene didn\u2019t want to just match the hero. What he wanted, what he had always wanted, was to surpass Vermouth.It wasn\u2019t for the sake of bragging rights. He had never even thought about doing something like that. You should be grateful for your hard-earned strength and make sure to use it properly. Why do needless shit like that and waste your own hard work?\u2018For now, I should just focus on learning all I can about the White Flame Formula\u2026. But the Tenth Star\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to reach it.\u2019Of course, there was no way that Eugene was just going to follow the lesson plan obediently. Although he would have to try and dig deep into the structure of the White Flame Formula first, if there was anything that didn\u2019t quite suit him, then he would make his own adaptations to fix it.\u2018Guess I\u2019ll have to deconstruct it as I\u2019m learning it.\u2019Hamel\u2019s abilities weren\u2019t as exceptional as Vermouth\u2019s. Eugene was well aware of this fact. Still, his inherited abilities were better than most people\u2019s, and they could perhaps even be better than those of the previous Lionheart Patriarchs.\u2018Although I\u2019ll have to give it a go to know for sure.\u2019He would have to try out various ideas based on the original White Flame Formula. Now that he had initiated his mana, Eugene was currently capable of doing much more than he could before.\u201cI'll explain things to the Patriarch. As for you\u2026 you must be tired, so go get a good rest,\u201d with these words, Eugene parted ways with Gion in front of the annex.Eugene sent Gion off with a bright smile.Eugene had clearly heard the order to go and rest. Truthfully speaking, his body was quite tired. Although his body wouldn\u2019t let out a single protest no matter how much abuse he put it through, just absorbing a lot of unfamiliar mana was enough to make it feel exhausted.However, Eugene had no intention of resting. Since there was no one to tell him otherwise, why should he rest? This kind of fatigue would get better with just a full night\u2019s sleep anyway.\u2018First of all, why don\u2019t we go have a look at my new abilities,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought to himself.Eugene pulled off his sweat-drenched clothes and tossed them aside. Nina, who had come running out of the annex, stopped and stiffened as she saw his current appearance before turning around and heading back inside. This was because Nina realized that she needed to go and fetch a few necessary items for Eugene, such as a new set of clothes, a towel, and a washbasin.As she was leaving, Nina turned her head and called out, \u201cAh\u2026. Hold on, Master Eugene! What would you like for dinner?!\u201d\u201cMeat!\u201d came the answering shout.\u201cYes, master!\u201dIt was just as she had expected. Nina ran back into the annex, hurrying to prepare for Eugene\u2019s unexpected return.Eugene stood still and turned his attention to the core inside his body. From its appearance, it truly deserved to be called a star. Created through the flow of mana guided by the White Flame Formula, the core centered around his heart looked as if all the stars in the night sky had gathered into a sparkling sphere.\u2018It\u2019s small,\u2019\u00a0Eugene frowned.It was so small that it couldn\u2019t even be compared to the one he had in his previous life, but this wasn\u2019t something to be disappointed about. At thirteen, Hamel had yet to even initiate his mana. At that time, Hamel was\u2026 just trying to survive\u2026.When he was young, Hamel had lived in a village frequently attacked by monsters, a small village at that. There had only been occasional attacks in the beginning, but by the time Hamel turned ten, the attacks had become more frequent and even more ferocious.In order to protect the village, everyone needed to know how to fight the monsters. So all the adults carried weapons like swords and axes, and the children held smaller versions of these weapons.Hamel was like that as well. As soon as he received a weapon, he had learned various ways of fighting\u2026.But then, before too long, the village was destroyed. The reason behind the steady intensification of monster attacks was the Demon Kings of Helmuth. Finally, a sudden assault wiped out the village and left a young Hamel as the only survivor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Due to these facts, it didn\u2019t make sense to compare the current size of his core with the core he had\u00a0first cultivated in his past life.Eugene shook off his melancholic feelings and focused on the star around his heart. He began moving his mana, allowing it to flow alongside his blood, but also in different directions. While maintaining the flow of the White Flame Formula, Eugene started warming up his body. Soon, Eugene was nodding with a satisfied expression.\u2018Looks good,\u2019\u00a0he decided.Just because your core had a lot of mana, that didn\u2019t mean you were strong. What was important was how you used that mana. The White Flame Formula also strictly abided by this principle. Even with this meager amount of mana, his body movements had already improved noticeably.From there, Eugene tried applying the experiences obtained from his previous life. He had always had a knack for handling mana, and he knew just how to maximize his power.Pow!A clenched fist burst through the air with a bang. Although he had only punched once, his muscles and bones already felt numb. Even though Eugene hadn\u2019t neglected his physical training, he had yet to familiarize himself with the amplifying effect that mana had on the body.\u2018This is something that I\u2019ll just need to gradually get used to.\u2019After moving his body around a few more times, Eugene concluded that he wasn\u2019t able to create sword-light yet. Although he might be able to succeed if he forcefully tried to squeeze some out, he didn\u2019t want to do something like that so soon.\u2018If I pointlessly deplete my core, even taking a day off won\u2019t be enough for me to recover.\u2019Just like how you could get serious health problems by overworking your body, the same went for the core as well. If he used up all his mana, his core would be depleted, placing a corresponding burden on his body.\u201cMaster Eugene,\u201d Nina called out as she approached.After setting a heavy water basin down on the ground, she didn\u2019t pause to catch her breath and immediately started wiping Eugene\u2019s body with a dry towel. Eugene stood still, allowing her to work as he continued to think.\u2018I might be able to make a contract now,\u2019 he pondered\u00a0uncertainly.He had gone through all sorts of things in his previous life, but he had never signed a contract with a spirit. So Eugene was currently unsure if he could summon a spirit with the minimal amount of mana he had now.\u201cStand back a little,\u201d Eugene ordered.\u201cYes,\u201d Nina immediately skirted backward with a nod of her head.Eugene slowly took a deep breath as he drew Wynnyd. The bluish-silver blade slid out of its sheath with a smooth ring. Nina\u2019s shoulder trembled as she was startled by this sight. After taking a few more deep breaths, Eugene began drawing mana away from his core.\u2018Let\u2019s give it a try,\u2019\u00a0he thought with anticipation.He had never learned any sort of magic, let alone spirit magic. So he couldn\u2019t predict the amount of mana it would take to summon something. As such, he had no choice but to try blindly.The mana from his core flowed into Wynnyd. The star revolving around his heart began to shine. Strangely, even though he couldn\u2019t see this, he could feel this happening to the star deep inside his body.Wynnyd\u2019s blade trembled. The magic sword began to hungrily devour all the mana Eugene was feeding it. Sweat once again dripped down from his body, which had just been wiped clean. The blade emitted a soft light, and a gentle breeze started to whirl around Eugene.\u201c...Aah\u2026\u201d Nina gasped in shock upon seeing such a sight.As the wind gradually grew stronger, it began fluttering Eugene\u2019s hair. His mouth had dried up out of tension, but Eugene clenched his teeth and continued to infuse his mana into the blade.Roooooar!At some point, the gentle breeze began turning into a violent storm. Nina jolted in surprise and drew back even further.However, the one that was most surprised was Eugene. What was going on? The wind was already so strong that he couldn\u2019t even open his eyes properly, but it was still growing stronger. Even though Wynnyd wasn\u2019t taking in any more mana.Eugene felt something like a \u2018door\u2019 appear inside of his body. This door opened slowly, and as the opening grew wider, the wind grew even stronger. By now, the wind blowing around Eugene had formed a tornado.[...You are\u2026.]In the center of this tornado, Eugene lifted his head to look around. The fiercely blowing wind seemed to be carrying a voice that was speaking inside of Eugene\u2019s head.[...Could it really be\u2026 are you really Hamel?]Eugene\u2019s heart started pounding as he tried to find out where this voice was coming from.\u201cIs that you, Tempest?\u201d he asked.Tempest was the Wind Spirit King who had bestowed his protection onto the Storm Sword Wynnyd. Eugene had seen Vermouth summon him a few times in his previous life.[How could it be you? Could it really be that\u2026 you\u2019ve reincarnated?]Eugene began responding to Tempest in his head,\u00a0\u2018You old fucker, how could you tell it was me?\u2019[As Vermouth\u2019s companion, how could I forget the appearance of your soul?]Three hundred years had flown by, and even his face had changed, but his soul was still the same. Spirits weren\u2019t beings of the material plane. So the Wind Spirit King, Tempest, had easily recognized Hamel by his soul.[...It looks like you also remember me.]\u2018How on earth did you get here? I wasn\u2019t trying to summon you,\u2019\u00a0Eugene demanded.[It\u2019s been a long time since I last heard Wynnyd\u2019s call. I was curious to see which of Vermouth\u2019s descendants had been chosen to wield it, but then I felt\u2026 a familiar soul.]The wind slowly began to die down. As it did, static began to interfere with Tempest\u2019s voice as it echoed inside his head.[How could this be? For someone to be reincarnated with their old memories\u2026 and as Vermouth\u2019s descendant at that? And it\u2019s Hamel of all people?]\u2018Why didn\u2019t Vermouth kill the remaining Demon Kings?\u2019\u00a0Eugene suddenly asked.How had he been reincarnated? Eugene had no idea. He had died in the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration, and by the time he had come to his senses, he was already in the body of a wailing newborn baby.\u2018Tell me, Tempest. Didn\u2019t you accompany them on the rest of their journey through the Devildom? Why are the Demon King of Incarceration and the Demon King of Destruction still alive after three hundred years?\u2019[I don\u2019t know why Vermouth made that decision,] Tempest replied. [The only thing I know is that\u2026 in the decisive battle with the Demon King of Incarceration\u2026 Vermouth sheathed his sword.]\u2018What?!\u2019\u00a0Eugene exclaimed.[...I don\u2019t know exactly what happened at that moment.] Tempest\u2019s voice was getting harder to hear,\u00a0[...Their fight at that time\u2026 was fierce but ultimately futile. In the end, only Vermouth and the Demon King of Incarceration were left standing. At the final moment, Vermouth put down his sword and refused to kill the Demon King of Incarceration. Neither did he go on to the castle of the Demon King of Destruction\u2026. Their journey ended at the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration.]\u2018...Don\u2019t bullshit me,\u2019\u00a0Eugene growled through clenched teeth.Their journey had just ended here? According to the stories, the Hero Vermouth and his companions had driven the Demon King of Incarceration to the brink of death. However, the Demon King of Incarceration had managed to escape without dying and begged the Demon Lord of Destruction for help.During Hamel\u2019s death, Vermouth had sworn an oath that he would kill all of the Demon Kings. Of course, Eugene hadn\u2019t been around to hear such an oath, but all the fairy tales agreed on this.So the hero\u2019s party had headed onwards to the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration. However they could not defeat the two Demon Kings who had joined forces and instead forced them to swear an \u2018Oath\u2019 to bring peace to the world\u2026.\u2018Like I said, don\u2019t bullshit me,\u2019\u00a0Eugene demanded as the taste of blood filled his mouth, and his head grew dizzy.\u00a0\u2018What the fuck is with that Oath? Why did they make such an Oath? Why? Vermouth sheathed his sword? Instead of killing the Demon King of Incarceration\u2026?\u2019[I don\u2019t know anything about that Oath or why Vermouth made such a decision.]\u2018So what do you know, you son of a bitch?\u2019[Only those who were there know what kind of Oath was made. From the moment that Vermouth put away his sword, I could no longer intervene in that situation.]\u2018Those who were there\u2026? Didn\u2019t you say that no one was left standing there apart from Vermouth and the Demon King of Incarceration? Doesn\u2019t that mean\u2026 everyone else lost consciousness\u2026?! Are you asking me to dig up Vermouth\u2019s corpse and ask him?\u2019[There\u2019s no more time\u2026.] Tempest let out a long sigh. [With your inadequate mana, it would be impossible for you to have summoned me\u2026.

    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 25.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25.1: Mana Training (3)When Eugene woke back up, it was in the bed he had been using for the past few days. Nina, who had been waiting at his bedside, let out a startled gasp and was about to call for someone, but Eugene immediately raised his hand to stop her.\u201cPlease, keep quiet,\u201d Eugene groaned.\u201cA-allow me to call someone for assistance,\u201d whispered Nina.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d refused Eugene. \u201cJust stay still.\u201dNina let out a confused noise, \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cStay still and don\u2019t say anything,\u201d forcing out these words, Eugene clutched his aching head.His memories weren\u2019t clouded, and Eugene clearly remembered what he\u2019d been doing just before he collapsed and the contents of his conversation with Tempest.But that still left him with a throbbing headache, along with a hollow feeling of emptiness inside his body. This would have been an unfamiliar sensation for the thirteen-year-old Eugene if not for his memories as Hamel. This feeling was mana depletion. He had managed to squeeze out what little mana he had until there had been nothing left.\u2018...This is all because Tempest just had to show up in person.\u2019All his mana had been sucked dry just by opening the door to the spirit world. From there, Tempest had taken over and crossed over into the physical world for a short time under his own power.Doing this had placed quite a considerable burden on Tempest as well. Even spirits with great strength weren\u2019t able to open the door to the spirit world by themselves. But as someone who had become a Spirit King, Tempest was able to push the door open further by placing the burden for doing so on himself.\u2018It looks like Tempest must have been quite excited as well.\u2019Tempest had recklessly shouldered the burden and forcibly widened the opening to descend to the physical world and confirm the truth for himself. That was how much Tempest, the Wind Spirit King, had been alarmed by Eugene \u2014 no, Hamel\u2019s reincarnation.\u2018...It would have been shocking for him to see that I was reincarnated with memories of my past life intact, but the fact that I was reincarnated as Vermouth\u2019s descendant must have made it seem even more so.\u2019Spirits remembered people by their souls, so Tempest had managed to recognize the one wielding Wynnyd, Eugene, as Hamel\u2026.This fact had Eugene grinning broadly.After accepting that he had been reincarnated, Eugene hadn\u2019t been able to shake off a few lingering, unpleasant concerns.Was he really Hamel? The Hamel seen in his memories of a past life from three hundred years ago?What if\u2026 he wasn\u2019t reincarnated and was just someone who had Hamel\u2019s memories implanted into him?\u2018Even if that\u2019s the case, these memories are definitely real,\u2019\u00a0Eugene had reassured himself whenever these fears popped up.He had also comforted himself by saying that it wouldn\u2019t make any\u00a0difference if he wasn\u2019t Hamel reincarnated. He didn\u2019t want to attach too much meaning to the uncertain nature of his existence. I think, therefore I am; that belief alone would have to be enough.\u2018But Tempest called me Hamel,\u2019\u00a0Eugene remembered with a grin.Those words had completely erased all those unpleasant concerns. Eugene shook his head with a carefree grin.\u201c...Master Eugene, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Nina asked uncertainly.Eugene dismissed her concerns, \u201cI\u2019m fine. How long was I out?\u201d\u201cAbout half a day\u2026.\u201d\u201cI must have made you all worry.\u201d\u201cThe Patriarch and Master Gion have been staying in the annex, waiting for you to regain consciousness.\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Eugene said, shaking his head as he looked over to the room\u2019s closed door.Thanks to the mana absorbed into his body, his physical senses had become even more sensitive. As a result, he could feel a few presences hovering impatiently by the door.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you open the door,\u201d Eugene suggested to Nina. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019ve caused them a lot of worries.\u201dThose two had every right to be let in. Gilead had granted him a lot of conveniences, adopted him into the main family, and even given him Wynnyd. Then they had passed on the White Flame Formula that only the members of the main family were allowed to learn and even opened up the leyline\u00a0for him to initiate his mana.After having all this provided for his mana training, Eugene had still ended up collapsing. When word of this had reached them, Gilead and Gion had rushed over in alarm and were now waiting impatiently outside the door to check his recovery.As soon as Nina opened the door, Gilead and Gion rushed in. Upon seeing Eugene sitting up in bed, Gilead sighed in relief and approached him more sedately.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Gilead asked in concern.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene gave his reply with a reassuring smile.Although he wasn\u2019t able to personally check his appearance in a mirror, Eugene guessed that his face would appear like it had been drained of all its blood. Gilead and Gion both looked at Eugene\u2019s face for a moment before exchanging\u00a0gazes.It was now Gion\u2019s turn to speak as he asked, \u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201dAs they were leaving the leyline and returning to the annex, Eugene had seemed perfectly fine. However, not long after his return to the annex, Eugene had collapsed.Thanks to this, Gion couldn\u2019t help but feel a whole tidal wave of concerns. He was the one who transmitted the White Flame Formula to Eugene and guided him into forming his own mana breathing cycle. What if Gion had made a mistake during this process, which had led something to go wrong within Eugene\u2019s body? Although Gion had faith in his own abilities, he couldn\u2019t help but worry now that something had gone terribly wrong.\u201cI\u2019ve already heard part of the story,\u201d this time, Gilead resumed speaking. \u201cI was told that after you drew Wynnyd, a large\u2026 breeze\u2026 suddenly started blowing. Was this because you summoned a spirit?\u201dAlthough he had expected such a question, Eugene hesitated for a moment without answering right away. How should he try and explain this? Did he really have to come up with a blatant lie?\u201cThe Wind Spirit King descended from the spirit world,\u201d Eugene finally admitted.There was no point in divulging the whole story, but he had to say something. There were too many eyes who had seen Tempest\u2019s descent, and it was impossible for any other spirit to be able to provoke such a storm through their arrival on this plane.\u201c...What?\u201d Gilead yelped.Eugene explained, \u201cHe said that it had been a long time since he\u2019d heard a summon, so he wanted to see who it was.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of\u2026!\u201d Gilead fell silent, too shocked to finish his sentence.Both Gilead and Gion couldn\u2019t help but be astonished. Three hundred years had passed since Vermouth had left them, so of course, more than a few ancestors in the direct line had wielded Wynnyd. Although this might be stating the obvious, most of them were able to summon the spirits of the wind with the help of Wynnyd.However, the expectations that the Wind Spirit King, Tempest, held for his summoners were just as lofty as his own royal standing. So following Vermouth, not a single ancestor had managed to successfully summon the Wind Spirit King.Gion gave an audible gulp and asked, \u201cIs that really the truth\u2026?\u201dHe knew that Eugene would have no reason to tell such a lie, but the news was so shocking that Gion felt he had no choice but to ask.\u201cYes, The Wind Spirit King\u2026 um\u2026.\u201d Eugene trailed off.Eugene frowned, making it obvious that he was having some difficulty remembering.While tapping the side of his own tousled head in order to jog his memories, Eugene continued speaking. \u201c...I think he said that I didn\u2019t have enough strength yet. And that next time\u2026 when I had enough power, he was looking forward to seeing me again someday. Then he returned to the Spirit World.\u201d\u201c...Hahaha\u2026!\u201d Gilead, who had been silently listening to Eugene\u2019s explanation, suddenly burst into laughter.While shaking his head, he plopped down onto a chair next to Eugene\u2019s bed.\u201c...Eugene. You really are \u2026one surprising child,\u201d Gilead sighed in relief.Eugene didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he just smiled. After staring at Eugene for a few moments, Gilead placed a hand inside his vest.\u201cI heard about what happened at the leyline from Gion. In less than an hour, you were able to sense mana and make a core using the White Flame Formula. All that would have been shocking enough, but for you to attract the Wind Spirit King\u2019s attention as well.\u201dSomething like that happening was unprecedented. However, what about Eugene wasn\u2019t unprecedented? Winning the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony as a collateral child, being adopted into the family, becoming the new owner of Wynnyd, and receiving the White Flame Formula with the\u00a0leyline\u2019s\u00a0assistance; all these things were unprecedented in the history of the Lionheart family.\u2018He went from sensing mana to accumulating it into his body in less than a day. That too\u2026 is something unprecedented,\u2019\u00a0Gilead reminded himself.Gilead felt nothing but pure pleasure at this news. The Wind Spirit King had taken note of this young child and had even descended personally to take a look at him. An event like this could even be considered the revitalization of the Lionheart Clan.\u201cDrink this,\u201d Gilead ordered.When his hand came out of his vest, Gilead was holding a small-sized potion.Gilead explained, \u201cThis will restore your depleted mana. However, you have to promise me that, instead of overdoing it, you will lie in bed for the next few days.\u201d\u201cBut my body feels fine.\u201d\u201cI still want your promise. If you injure your body by needlessly overburdening it, you will regret it in the future.\u201d\u201cFine, I promise,\u201d without any further protest, Eugene nodded his head.The mana recovery potion was just as valuable as it was useful. Eugene gulped down the whole bottle under the watchful eye of Gion and Gilead.His hollowed-out body started to refill with mana. Without getting flustered, Eugene immediately began using the White Flame Formula to recharge his core with this mana, but the mana from the potion wasn\u2019t enough to fully restore his depleted core. Due to the nature of mana, the amount that could be contained within the potion wasn\u2019t all that great. Even so, after emptying the entire bottle, his headache and the stiffness in his limbs were considerably relieved.\u201cAfter a few days' rest, Gion will resume your lessons,\u201d Gilead said as he stood up. \u201cInitially, we were planning to go on another training trip once the Bloodline Continuation was over, but now\u2026 it looks like that will be impossible.\u201d\u201cIs it because of me?\u201d asked Eugene.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think that we will need to prioritize cultivating your talents instead of our own training.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up too much of Patriarch and Sir Gion\u2019s time,\u201d Eugene admitted shyly.\u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that. After all, I\u2019m the one who really wants to guide you personally,\u201d Gion spoke up.He patted Eugene on the shoulder with a grin.Gion added, \u201cAh, but of course, I\u2019ll be teaching Cyan and Ciel right alongside you. And the Patriarch will also be helping with our lessons.\u201dEugene was certainly special. However, it wouldn\u2019t be good to show Eugene excessive favoritism because of this. The eldest son, Eward, had left the main estate and headed to Aroth, but Cyan and Ciel were still staying at the main estate. They also deserved to receive the same level of teaching as Eugene.\u2018I expect it will be a good stimulus to have Eugene train alongside those two,\u2019\u00a0Gilead thought.After hearing that Eugene had returned from the\u00a0leyline\u00a0with impressive results after spending less than a day there, Cyan and Ciel had immediately headed to the gymnasium and started their own training. So Gilead was also nursing high expectations of\u00a0both Cyan and Ciel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Eugene\u2019s brow still furrowed at this as he felt a slight dissatisfaction. Instead, a spirit that was only the size of his palm began hovering around him.It was a sylph, a lesser spirit of the wind. Composed of a mass of wind, it didn\u2019t even have a proper shape. However, with Eugene's small amount of mana, it was normal for him to have summoned a sylph.Just in case, Eugene tried to mentally ask the sylph,\u00a0\u2018Hey, have you heard anything from your king?\u2019However, there was no reply. It seemed that it was impossible to converse with a spirit that had such low intelligence. With a click of his tongue, Eugene brandished Wynnyd.Eugene began his test by calling out an incantation in his head,\u00a0\u2018Wind-blade.\u2019Once he had done so, an opaque stream of wind formed around his sword. Eugene glanced down at this wavering blade-shaped wind before giving it a swing.Schick.The eerie sound that the blade made as it swung through the air caused Nina\u2019s body to tremble. After swinging Wynnyd around a few more times, Eugene released the sylph back to the Spirit World.Before doing so, he attempted to mentally communicate with it once more,\u00a0\u2018Pass this message on to Tempest, \u201cIf you were lying to me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\u2019But the Sylph still didn\u2019t reply. However, it appeared to sense that its king had been insulted, as it sent a gust of wind to ruffle Eugene\u2019s hair before returning to the Spirit World.\u2018...Though Tempest shouldn\u2019t have any reason to lie about that,\u2019\u00a0Eugene admitted to himself.It was just that Eugene couldn\u2019t quite understand what he was feeling, so he felt like he had to say something. While feeling a mix of complex emotions, Eugene sat down heavily on the bed.\u2018...I need to think about this rationally,\u2019\u00a0Eugene told himself,\u00a0\u2018without letting any useless emotions get in the way.\u2019Three hundred years ago, Hamel died. His companions, Vermouth, Sienna, Anise, and Molon, continued to make their way to the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration.It had to have been a tough journey. The second-ranked Demon King of Incarceration was strong enough that none of the previous Demon Kings of Fury, Cruelty, and Carnage could compare to him. Just getting to his castle was as difficult as slaying one of the previous Demon Kings.\u2018...And with me dead\u2026.\u2019Speaking objectively, Hamel had been strong. Although he wasn\u2019t as strong as Vermouth, he was easily the next strongest in the party. So with Hamel dead, the remaining four may have found it impossible to deal with the remaining Demon Kings.They would have already been exhausted from making the torturous trek to the Demon King of Incarceration\u2019s castle, and Hamel had perished before the battle. In such a state, it was questionable whether they would have even been able to defeat the Demon King of Incarceration. In that case\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it have been better for them to retreat for the moment and reconsider their plans?\u2018...So did everything really end there?\u2019With only Hamel having perished, Vermouth and the other four had returned from the Devildom of Helmuth after making some kind of mysterious promise. However, the only ones who knew the details of this promise were Vermouth and the remaining Demon Kings.\u2018But really, what was in that Oath?\u2019That was what bothered Eugene the most. For the Demon Kings who lived to cause the world suffering, what on earth could have made them change their minds and swear to uphold the peace? Who exactly was the one who proposed such an oath in the first place? What were the contents of the Oath?\u2018...It all comes back to Helmuth.\u2019Just thinking about it by himself wouldn\u2019t bring him any answers. The memories of his past life clearly ended when he had died in the Demon King of Incarceration\u2019s castle three hundred years ago. As for the events after that\u2026 most of what he knew came from the contents of the fairy tales that the young Eugene had read.\u2018I need to find some time to go to Helmuth,\u2019\u00a0Eugene finally decided.Three hundred years ago, Helmuth was a horrifying place. Demonic beasts whose only purpose in life was to catch and eat humans roamed the land, and the demonfolk inhabiting that land were constantly marching out to invade human territories. Fallen Wizards \u2014 now known as Black Wizards \u2014 hunted humans to offer them as tributes to their masters, the Demon Kings. These evil wizards wanted to become demons themselves, so they sought the truth of the Demonic Path[1]\u00a0even if it meant bending the knee to the Demon Kings.Helmuth had been a twisted hell of such vicious and ugly desires.However, that was no longer the case.\u00a0Since two\u00a0hundred years ago, Helmuth had begun accepting human visitors, and the Demon Kings and the demonfolk showed such hospitality to their visitors that it seemed as if they were trying to overcompensate for their past cruelty.Nowadays, people\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0think of Helmuth as a hellish place. Instead, they thought of it as a tourist destination where one could experience unique, seductive, and decadent entertainment that couldn\u2019t be found anywhere else.The demonfolk, who had once taken the initiative to invade human territories, were now volunteering their services in neighboring countries as reparations for the war. And the black magicians, who had been wagging their tails for the Demon Kings, had cast themselves as victims and, after managing to sway public opinion, they had even managed to eventually erect the Black Tower of Magic in Aroth.In Eugene\u2019s opinion, all of this was complete bullshit.The demonfolk were volunteering to work? They were definitely siphoning off human souls behind the people\u2019s backs. The Black Tower of Magic? It would be better to call it a Black Swamp of Corruption.Even though they said it was for the sake of promoting the study of magic, it was apparent why those crazy bastards in Aroth had welcomed the Black Wizards and averted their eyes from these same wizards\u2019 past crimes. Although the truth hadn\u2019t been revealed, Eugene was sure that there must be all sorts of ugly things hidden behind the construction of the Black Tower of Magic\u2026.\u2018Helmuth, Aroth, Yuras, and the Ruhr\u2026,\u2019\u00a0as Eugene recalled each of the places where his former life\u2019s companions had left their traces, he clicked his tongue in irritation.Of course, he couldn\u2019t just set off immediately. With his young body, it was impossible to head off alone on a journey to such distant countries.\u2018But someday,\u2019\u00a0Eugene told himself with determination before letting out a deep sigh and patting his stomach.His empty stomach was rumbling in hunger.* * *What exactly should he say to Eugene?After leaving the banquet, this worry had kept Cyan up for most of the night. Although he had barely managed to get some sleep, that damn dream had ruined his rest. In that dream, Cyan had dueled with Eugene and lost once more.Except this time, Cyan was a minotaur instead of himself.Within the dream, he had personally experienced the scene he had witnessed during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. After becoming a minotaur who couldn\u2019t use sword-light, Cyan was brutally dismembered by Eugene.Torn into pieces mercilessly.As he emerged from the gymnasium, Cyan attempted to shake off the last vestiges of his dream with a shudder. However, the frown on his face remained as heavy as ever. As he rubbed his eyes, which had been skewered multiple times during his dream, Cyan bit his lip in frustration.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, brother?\u201d Ciel suddenly asked.\u201cNothing is going on. Why are you asking?\u201d Cyan responded defensively.\u201cYour expression looks like it belongs at a funeral, and you didn\u2019t have much for breakfast either.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always had this expression, and I ate just as much breakfast as I usually do.\u201d\u201cLiar,\u201d accused Ciel, sticking her tongue out at him with a smile. \u201cI know what\u2019s really going on with you. It\u2019s because of Eugene, isn\u2019t it?\u201dCyan bristled, \u201cWhat does any of this have to do with him?\u201d\u201cThey said that we will be learning together with Eugene starting from today. I know that you\u2019re really bothered because of this.\u201d\u201cI said that it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with him!\u201d\u201cSee, see, you\u2019ve lost your temper quicker than usual. Why are you taking your anger with Eugene out on me?\u201d\u201c...I haven\u2019t lost my temper.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t deny that something is bothering you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026,\u201d hesitating, Cyan clenched his fists as he glared at his cheeky younger sister. \u201c...Honestly, it does bother me.\u201d\u201cBut mother said you need to become friends with him,\u201d reminded Ciel.\u201cDo you think I can really do that just because she tells me to?\u201d\u201cI did. Would you like me to put a word in for you with Eugene?\u201d\u201c...What are you going to tell him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just ask him to be friends with my brother.\u201dCyan\u2019s shoulders slumped at these words, and his fists started trembling in embarrassment. Although he might be able to ask his mother to do something like that, Cyan definitely couldn\u2019t allow his sister, who was a few seconds younger than him, to make such a humiliating request\u2026.\u201cI\u2019ll do things my own way,\u201d Cyan spat out before immediately clamping his lips shut.He had just caught sight of Eugene walking over from the far-off annex. Cyan\u2019s eyes widened as he caught sight of Wynnyd hanging from Eugene\u2019s waist. Even at this distance, he could make out all the tiny details of that famed weapon.\u201cThey told me that he\u2019s already a First Star in the White Flame Formula,\u201d Ciel chimed in beside him.\u201cI know,\u201d Cyan gritted out.\u201cDidn\u2019t it take us a really long time to reach the White Flame Formula\u2019s First Star?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long. Since it took us around a month, that means only a handful of our ancestors in the direct line were as fast as us.\u201d\u201cBut Eugene didn\u2019t even take a day to reach the First Star. Doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s the fastest in history?\u201d\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d\u201cI heard this from Uncle Gion, but apparently, Eugene was able to feel the mana as soon as he sat down on the leyline. It took us more than four days, right?\u201d\u201cSo what,\u201d Cyan responded in a sharp voice as he turned to stare at his younger sister.Ciel just giggled in amusement at her older brother\u2019s reaction.Instead of continuing to tease her brother, Ciel waved at the approaching Eugene and called out a greeting, \u201cHi!\u201d\u201cWhy\u00a0do you plan on staying\u00a0in the annex? You should just live with us in the main family\u2019s mansion,\u201d Ciel said to Eugene once he got closer.Cyan immediately replied in Eugene\u2019s place, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201dAfter glancing at Cyan with hooded eyes, Eugene nodded and said, \u201cI also think that would be a terrible idea.\u201d\u201cBut I think it would be great,\u201d Ciel insisted with a grin before pointing to Wynnyd. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard that you were able to summon the Wind Spirit King using Wynnyd?\u201d\u201cThat has to be a lie,\u201d just like last time, Cyan replied instead of Eugene.Although his heart was slowly opening up to Eugene, Cyan absolutely couldn\u2019t bring himself to change his hostile behavior. Cyan was too young to understand his feelings of awe for Eugene, and it was even harder for him to identify the dawning sense of respect that he felt because of this.\u201cExcept for the Great Vermouth, none of our ancestors could summon the Wind Spirit King while wielding Wynnyd,\u201d Cyan cited as evidence.Eugene snorted at these words and drew Wynnyd. This startled Cyan into leaping backward, away from him.\u201cW-what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Cyan demanded.Instead of replying, Eugene infused his mana into Wynnyd. Soon after, wind gathered into the form of a sylph. Seeing its appearance, Cyan inwardly felt relieved and burst out laughing.\u201cWhat is that? The Wind Spirit King?\u201d he asked mockingly.\u201cNope,\u201d came the simple reply from Eugene.Eugene held up Wynnyd so that it could be seen clearly and the sylph proceeded to wrap itself around the sword. Cyan\u2019s jaw dropped as he took in this blade of wind.\u201cSw-Sword-light?!\u201d Cyan exclaimed in shock.\u201cDoes this really look like sword-light to you?\u201d Eugene asked mockingly.Cyan\u2019s face reddened as he felt the tables being turned on him. While swinging Wynnyd around a few times, Eugene stared firmly at Cyan.\u201cShall we spar?\u201d Eugene offered.\u201c...W-what?!\u201d Cyan choked in panic.\u201cYou can feel free to use sword-light, because I\u2019ll be using this.\u201d\u201c....\u201dWhen Cyan remained silent, Eugene coaxed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just have some fun? Or if you\u2019d like, we could bet on it? If you win, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\u201cI-I won\u2019t,\u201d Cyan immediately stepped back while shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 come here today\u2026 to learn from Uncle Gion. I\u2019m not here to spar with you.\u201dEugene grinned, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019m not scared,\u201d Cyan replied hesitantly while urgently sending Ciel a pleading look.He was hoping that his sister could somehow salvage this situation. However, Ciel just ignored Cyan\u2019s glance and smiled in amusement.\u2018That evil bitch.\u2019Fortunately, before Cyan was forced to make any excuses, Eugene backed down and gave him an out.\u201cLet\u2019s not argue pointlessly,\u201d Eugene said with a sigh.Cyan couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, \u201c....\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re brothers now, so we should try to get along,\u201d said Eugene with a broad smile as he offered Cyan his hand.For a few moments, Cyan alternated between staring at Eugene\u2019s hand and face.Eugene eventually asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you know what this handshake means?\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201d Cyan seemed confused.\u201cIt means that I want us to get along well as brothers.\u201d\u201c...Oh, well\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026,\u201d after some hesitation, Cyan eventually took Eugene\u2019s hand with a grateful nod.\u201cShake hands with me as well,\u201d Ciel demanded, cutting into their conversation from her position at their side.This request forced Eugene to cross his arms so that he could hold both Cyan and Ciel\u2019s hands simultaneously.\u201cSince I was born earlier than you, you should call me your big sister,\u201d Ciel brought up once more.Eugene refused, \u201cWould you shut up about that?\u201dDidn\u2019t that mean he was Eugene\u2019s big brother? Although Cyan felt this thought pop up in his head, he decided to keep his mouth shut when he saw Eugene\u2019s narrowed eyes.He definitely didn\u2019t have the audacity to claim Eugene as his younger brother.1.

He casually tidied up his shaggy mop of hair as he stared at his own face in the mirror.He was now seventeen years old.Four years had already passed since the end of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony and his adoption into the main family. Although his face still looked like that of a young boy\u2019s, his body was almost fully grown. As Eugene examined his own wide chest and broad shoulders, for a moment, he was overcome by his emotions.\u2018This really is a great body.\u2019This was a topic that he had thought of several times over the seventeen years he had lived in this body, but he never got bored of repeating this fact within his head whenever it came up.First of all, he had a handsome face. Eugene wasn\u2019t just saying that because it was his. Even if he was forced to look at it objectively, he would have to admit that his features were good-looking. Although he felt that Hamel\u2019s face from his past life wasn\u2019t all that ugly, comparing that face to his current face after being reincarnated as Eugene, the difference in their looks was about as much as the difference between an ordinary elf\u2019s and a human\u2019s.\u2018Though not as much as an elf compared to an orc.\u2019Eugene had no desire to disparage the face of his previous life to that extent. After patting his smooth cheeks a few times, Eugene started stretching his facial muscles by pulling all sorts of expressions in the mirror.The nasty look in his eyes when he frowned hadn\u2019t changed at all since childhood. It was just a part of his innate character. Despite going around with narrowed eyes ever since he was young, Eugene was just glad that he didn\u2019t have any wrinkles.\u2018I had an even nastier look in my eyes during my previous life.\u2019Relaxing his frown, he gave a broad smile instead.But was this handsome guy in the mirror really him?Although he had already graduated from truly thinking such nonsensical thoughts, even after seventeen years of living in this body, he still felt amazed each time he saw this handsome face in the mirror.\u2018I have to admit it, your blood is strong,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought as he raised his eyes to his gray hair.The older he grew, the more prominent the gray hairs became. Every time Eugene saw this hair color, he was reminded of Vermouth.Eugene had his reasons for indulging in such self-absorbed sentiments this early in the morning.After initiating his mana when he was thirteen, Eugene had trained his mana every morning without skipping a single day. And today, Eugene had finally reached the Third Star in the White Flame Formula.\u2018That was quick.\u2019He could feel the split-off cores circling around his heart. Three points of light that showed he had reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.\u2018Way too quick.\u2019After he had started to train his mana, Eugene had realized something.The White Flame Formula\u2019s performance was incomparable to the mana training scripture he had learned in his previous life. Eugene was able to extract the optimal degree of efficiency from just a small amount of mana, and the speed with which he absorbed mana was also extremely fast. The cost of spreading this absorbed mana throughout his body and turning it into strength was also not very high.However, for him to have achieved this rank so quickly\u2026 it couldn\u2019t just be attributed to the superiority of the White Flame Formula; it was also because Eugene\u2019s body was naturally \u2018attuned\u2019 to absorbing mana.\u2018...Although it\u2019s great that this body\u2019s performance is so amazing\u2026.\u2019Sometimes he couldn\u2019t help but feel perturbed.\u2018If it\u2019s already this fast\u2026 just how much faster will my progress be later.\u2019It would be the opposite of subtle.But this was actually quite a pleasant issue to be perturbed about. Eugene smiled as he looked at his reflection.\u2018But the strength I had in my previous life won\u2019t be enough.\u2019This amazing body had been granted to him, Eugene Lionheart, and it had given him a lot of expectations for his future. With this body, he couldn\u2019t be satisfied with just relying on the memories and experiences of his past life. Eugene had become convinced of this fact years ago.Hamel had definitely been a great talent. Although he wasn\u2019t as good as Vermouth, he had also known how to wield all sorts of weapons. Without any formal training, Hamel\u2019s skills had been forged and honed on the battlefield as he\u00a0toed the line between life and death. This meant his techniques had been refined through constant usage.Hamel had made a name for himself with just these skills and had even come to mistake himself as a genius. It was at this point that he had met Vermouth and\u2026 Hamel had suddenly realized that he wasn\u2019t a genius after all.After becoming Vermouth\u2019s companion, he had also gone through a lot. His techniques had been further polished, and he\u2019d added even more skills to his repertoire.\u2018But it\u2019s still not enough.\u2019It wasn\u2019t enough to just acquire the strength he had in his previous life. To take advantage of this talented and greed-provoking body of his, he needed more than just his past life\u2019s memories.\u2018I need to learn everything.\u2019And not just to a basic level either.The sword, the spear, the ax, and the bow; he already knew how to skillfully handle most weapons. He had confidence in his weapon techniques since he had refined these skills in order to not just survive but thrive in the Devildom.But he wasn\u2019t quite there yet. Although he was still a little slower than he had been in his previous life, he knew in his head how to get there; it was just a matter of when not if. His body would catch up to what he knew it was capable of. So if he would eventually get there anyway, wouldn\u2019t it be more efficient to use\u00a0his time elsewhere.***\u201cLooks like I need to learn some magic,\u201d Eugene suddenly spouted.\u201cWhat kind of bullshit is that?\u201d Cyan gasped.As Cyan sat on the ground, trying to catch his breath, he lifted his head to look up at Eugene. The monstrous guy standing beside him wasn\u2019t showing any signs of exertion even after all the exercise they had just done.At first, this would have made him flare up in envy, but now\u2026 after four years of looking at that relaxed expression, he was already used to it.\u201cI said that I need to learn some magic,\u201d Eugene kindly repeated.\u201cAnd\u00a0I\u00a0said, \u2018what kind of bullshit is that?\u2019\u201d Cyan spat out with a confused expression on his face.Eugene wasn\u2019t the only one whose body had grown during these four years. Cyan had also grown a lot. Of course, it was obvious that Cyan didn\u2019t really appreciate this fact, and Eugene was a big reason for that. Although they might be of similar age, Cyan was just a tiny bit shorter than Eugene, and the difference in their skill levels was just as great as ever.\u201cSpeaking of this morning\u2026.\u201dEugene continued speaking without offering Cyan a hand up. Cyan was still a brat with too much self-respect; he wouldn\u2019t admit he had lost even when he was defeated, and he wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if Eugene offered him a hand up. Even though Cyan would no longer fuss about being insulted or whatnot, like what had happened when they first met, it would only stoke feelings of frustration lingering within the corners of his heart if Eugene were to show him any kindness.\u201c...I was just training in the White Flame Formula like I usually do\u2026.\u201d\u201cCould it be, did you really\u2026?\u201d Cyan couldn\u2019t finish the question.Cyan\u2019s eyes started trembling as he got a bad feeling. Gritting his teeth, he jumped to his feet.Eugene smiled as he saw Cyan getting flustered like this.\u201c...and then this happened.\"As Eugene finished speaking, the mana that was usually spread throughout his body gathered near his heart. Once there, the three stars at his core began to resonate with each other. These stars, locked together in a circuit around his heart, began to explosively amplify the power of his mana.Fwooosh!Mana, in the form of pure white light, engulfed Eugene\u2019s entire body. Cyan stared at this sight with wide eyes. The white flame-like light wrapped around Eugene\u2019s form looked like a flowing lion\u2019s mane.\u201cWhat\u2026 the fuck\u2026!\u201d Cyan swore, his voice shaking.Since he also practiced the White Flame Formula, he was well aware of what that mana cloak engulfing Eugene signified. By covering his body in a blaze of mana like that, he had truly created a fiery beacon that honored the name of the White Flame Formula.This meant that Eugene had reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had initiated his mana seven years earlier than Eugene and had been training in the White Flame Formula for nearly as long. Thanks to this, he had managed to reach the Second Star of the White Flame Formula three years ago.But until now, Cyan\u2019s progress had remained stalled at the Second Star. The stars around his heart seemed like they were just about to divide, but they never did. But instead\u2026 that annoying son of a bitch, Eugene, who had initiated his mana seven years later than Cyan, had already reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Eugene said with a relaxed smile as he allowed the mana to dissipate. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a genius.\u201dEugene thought declaring something like that from your own mouth was rather shameful. Or at least, he used to think that. But now, he had to admit that it would be ridiculous to pointlessly act humble. He had been born with the body of a genius, and on top of that, he had memories of his past life.Although Hamel from his past life wasn\u2019t a genius, Eugene definitely was.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go and die,\u201d Cyan cursed.Eugene chided him, \u201cBrothers shouldn\u2019t say such things to each other.\u201d\u201cLike you can talk about what brothers shouldn\u2019t do. Every morning you beat me up so badly that it feels like I\u2019m going to croak.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who keeps asking for a spar every morning? If you don\u2019t want to get beaten up, let\u2019s just stop. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201dCyan ground his teeth as he glared at Eugene. Challenging Eugene to a spar every morning was Cyan\u2019s own way of dealing with the frustration of his rivalry with Eugene.Honestly speaking, Eugene appreciated this change in Cyan\u2019s attitude. At first, he thought that Cyan was just a stupid brat, but perhaps because he had come to accept Eugene after the adoption, Cyan\u2019s foolish streak had shown a lot of improvement.\u201c...But why magic of all things?\u201d Cyan returned to the main point.\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never learned any magic,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cSo that\u2019s why you want to learn magic? Don\u2019t make me laugh\u2026. And how exactly do you intend to learn magic? Do you want to call up a teacher from the capital?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll need to check with the Patriarch regarding that.\u201d\u201cAre you really serious? No, but \u2014 why on earth do you want to learn magic all of a sudden?\u201dCyan just couldn\u2019t understand Eugene. Since he had that much talent in martial arts, why would he want to dabble in magic instead of focusing on what he was good at?Cyan tried to dissuade Eugene, \u201cAren\u2019t you too old to be learning magic?\u201d\u201cSeventeen is still plenty young,\u201d denied Eugene.\u201cThis is nonsense. Have you forgotten about what happened to Eward?\u201d Cyan asked with a snort as he dusted off his pants. \u201cHe went off to learn magic when he was fifteen, two years younger than you are now, and now he\u2019s just being treated like a fool in Aroth.\u201dEugene glared at Cyan and growled, \u201cBastard, how dare you say such a thing about your older brother?\u201d\u201cDid I say anything that wasn\u2019t true?\u201d Cyan protested while shrugging off Eugene\u2019s glare. \u201c...Instead of putting on airs and pointlessly heading to Aroth to learn magic, just stay here at the main estate, where it\u2019s comfortable. \u2026If you really do tell him that you want to start learning magic, Father might just start crying tears of blood.\u201dThat did seem to be a possibility.Four years ago, Eward Lionheart, the eldest son of the main family, had accompanied Lovellian, the Head Wizard of the Red Tower, to Aroth as soon as the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was over.\u2026But in the end, he couldn\u2019t become Lovellian\u2019s disciple. It seemed that his potential wasn\u2019t bad, as he had been allowed to remain in Aroth, but he couldn\u2019t become as big of a success as his parents had hoped for. Now four years had passed, and Eward was still staying in Aroth.According to what Eugene had picked up in passing, he was currently learning magic from a wizard affiliated with the Red Tower of Magic, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t seem to be achieving much progress. Thanks to this, it wasn\u2019t just Lovellian\u2019s authority as the Head Wizard that had obviously been affected, but the main family\u2019s prestige had also been tarnished.Although the Patriarch had just done his best for his eldest son by using his connections to send him to the Red Tower of Magic to learn magic, to others, it appeared as though the Patriarch was getting rid of a mediocrely-talented heir by exiling him to the Red Tower.\u201cEven if the Patriarch does shed tears of blood, Madam Ancilla should end up supporting me,\u201d Eugene commented.\u201c...I could see Mother doing that,\u201d Cyan mumbled with a needlessly wary glance at the main family\u2019s mansion. \u201cH-however, it isn\u2019t that my mother dislikes you.\u201dEugene objected, \u201cBut sometimes when we cross paths, she gets a really fierce look in her eyes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s seen how you beat me like a dog,\u201d argued Cyan.\u201cEven if she has, what can I do? How can I just stop beating you when you keep asking for it?\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201dIt was admittedly Cyan who had asked him to take their spars seriously. This was because Cyan had thought that his skills wouldn\u2019t grow if Eugene kept taking it easy on him, but, for a long time now, Cyan had come to feel deep regret for saying something like that.Eugene showed absolutely no mercy during their spars. If he even saw a tiny opening, he would pierce through it right away and keep attacking mercilessly. While doing so, Eugene would also constantly point out Cyan\u2019s various inadequacies. Still, because Eugene explained his criticisms clearly and in a way that was easy to understand, Cyan was forced to listen to him silently even when he felt like his heart would stop beating out of anger.Eventually, Cyan asked Eugene, \u201c...Do you really intend to go to Aroth?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to learn something, you should learn it properly,\u201d was all Eugene needed to say in explanation.If you wanted to properly learn magic, the best thing to do would be to go to Aroth.\u2018And there\u2019s also something that I want to investigate,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought to himself.He wanted to see what Sienna\u2019s life had been like in Aroth following their journey. This desire had been building up within him for a long time. And it wasn\u2019t just Sienna, but Anise and Molon as well. He wanted to know how his companions had lived their lives after they returned from the Devildom three hundred years ago, and ultimately\u2026 he wanted to know the truth of what had happened then.\u2018Even here, at the main estate, there are hardly any records of them.\u2019The history of the founding ancestor, Vermouth, was also left very vague. Although he had searched here and there during these four years, there were hardly any traces of what the hero and his companions did after returning from the Devildom.\u2018And this necklace as well.\u2019Eugene stared down at the necklace hanging from his neck. He had constantly worn the necklace since he retrieved it from the treasure vault four years ago. Even when the Head Wizard of the Red Tower had personally peered into the memories left within the necklace\u2019s mana, Lovellian hadn\u2019t been able to find any memories identifying it as Hamel\u2019s keepsake.This meant someone else had created an undetectable, false layer in the necklace\u2019s memories.From what Eugene thought, the only people who could do something like that were Sienna or Vermouth. But why on earth would they have done it? He couldn\u2019t figure out what their reasons for doing so might be.However\u2026\u00a0if he\u00a0had to say it, Sienna seemed more likely to have prepared such a prank in the necklace, rather than Vermouth. The Vermouth that Eugene remembered wasn\u2019t the type of person to do something like this.\u201c...That\u2019s\u2026 if you do go to Aroth\u2026,\u201d Cyan coughed before continuing with a hesitant expression, \u201c...Ciel will be sad.\u201d\u201cReally,\u201d Eugene said, with a laugh for how absurd Cyan\u2019s claim sounded. \u201cAre we talking about the same Ciel, the one who looks disgusted whenever she sees me?\u201d\u201cThose aren\u2019t her true feelings,\u201d although he said this, Cyan didn\u2019t seem to have any confidence in his own words.Ciel Lionheart, that cunning brat, seemed to have started going through puberty at the beginning of this year. She no longer stuck close to Eugene like she used to, and she wouldn\u2019t even start a conversation with him. Perhaps it was because the symptoms of her puberty were quite severe; she rarely even left her room. Although Ciel didn\u2019t neglect her training, she no longer trained with Eugene and Cyan as she had done before.\u2018I hate the smell of sweat,\u2019\u00a0was the reason that she had given for it.Thanks to that, Gion and Gilead were forced to keep very busy. They first met with the puberty-stricken Ciel in the morning and spent half the day teaching her while the other half was spent teaching Cyan and Eugene.\u201c...Anyways, if you do go to Aroth, Ciel will be sad,\u201d Cyan insisted.\u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll change my mind just because Ciel will be sad?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cYou heartless bastard,\u201d Cyan spat as his fists trembled in anger at Eugene\u2019s careless comment. \u201cHave you even considered how Mr. Gerhard will feel?\u201d\u201cMy father will be perfectly fine without me.\u201dEven Cyan couldn\u2019t help but agree with that. Gerhard had initially been uncomfortable with living at the main estate, but he had become completely accustomed to life here over the past few years. Now, he regularly went on hunting trips with the heads of the other collateral families, and he sometimes spent whole nights drinking beer with Gion and Gilead. Even Ancilla got along quite well with Gerhard.Of course, Eugene was well aware of the reason for this. Ancilla didn\u2019t wish to show much hostility to Eugene. Although she hadn\u2019t relaxed her considerable vigilance towards him, she knew that it was better for both of them if they appeared to get along than to appear openly hostile.However, Tanis, as Eward\u2019s mother and the official first wife\u2026, was openly wary of Eugene and Gerhard. Following Eward\u2019s failure to become Lovellian\u2019s disciple, Tanis\u2019 overly sensitive personality had continued to worsen.\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll need to be a little careful of Tanis,\u2019\u00a0Eugene reminded himself.If she was told that Eugene was going to Aroth, Tanis would definitely become even more sensitive to the threat he posed to her son\u2019s candidacy. This wasn\u2019t a problem that Eugene could simply solve by paying more attention to her. Instead, this was something that he would have to secretly entrust to the Patriarch, Gilead.\u201c...Where are you going?\u201d Cyan asked as he noticed Eugene beginning to walk away.\u201cTo meet with the Patriarch,\u201d Eugene explained over his shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet with him right now?\u201d\u201cI need to get his permission quickly, after all,\u201d with this final reply, Eugene left the gymnasium.After staring absent-mindedly at Eugene\u2019s receding back, Cyan gave a deep sigh.\u201c...What the hell is with this bullshit about learning magic?\u201d Cyan grumbled and began following after Eugene.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While casually exchanging greetings with the main family\u2019s servants, Eugene sent through a request to meet with Gilead. Before long, the Head Butler arrived to personally escort Eugene to Gilead\u2019s office.\u201cYou should really think it over before deciding,\u201d Cyan attempted to persuade Eugene.\u201cI\u2019ve already given this matter a lot of thought before coming to my decision,\u201d said Eugene.Cyan took a deep breath and swallowed his protests. Now that he thought about it, it was ridiculous that he was trying to hold onto Eugene and prevent him from leaving. If that monster were to turn his hand towards learning magic, wouldn't that mean his training in the martial arts would slow down?\u2018That would actually be better for me,\u2019\u00a0Cyan realized.Although Eugene\u2019s progress might be ahead of his for the moment, Cyan would also rise to the Third Star within the next few years. So Cyan decided to see Eugene\u2019s departure as more of an opportunity. Of course, Cyan had no intention of being satisfied with just reaching the Third Star of the White Flame Formula. He hoped to have somehow reached the Fourth Star by the time he became an adult.\u2018...But can I really?\u2019Truthfully speaking, he had his doubts. In the history of the Lionheart clan, there wasn\u2019t a single person who had ever managed to reach the Fourth Star of the White Flame Formula while in their teens. Even the family ancestors who had made a name for themselves as geniuses, and even Gilead and Gion, had all been stalled at the Third Star before they had become adults.In other words, just being able to rise to the Third Star of the White Flame Formula at this age was enough for him to be compared to his genius predecessors.However, such thoughts merely filled Cyan\u2019s mouth with a bitter taste. Eugene and Cyan were both currently seventeen, but today, Eugene had already risen to the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.That was an unprecedented speed of advancement\u2026. It wasn\u2019t like this was the first time that that monstrous child had left his mark in the history of the direct line, but\u2026. Cyan gave a heavy sigh as he turned to stare at Eugene\u2019s back. Eugene was currently in the middle of waiting for a reply from the other side of the door before he could enter Gilead\u2019s office.\u2018...I too\u2026.\u2019Cyan forced himself to swallow another sigh that almost fell from his lips and faced forward once more. It had already been four years since Eugene had joined the main family. Since then, Cyan had suffered countless defeats to this absurd brother of his, with whom he didn\u2019t even share a single drop of blood.These successive defeats had taught the young Cyan an unquestionable lesson. Despair is nothing but nourishment for further despair. Instead of spending any time in despair, shedding even a single drop of sweat in an effort to improve was far more useful.\u201c...Tsk\u2026,\u201d Cyan clicked his tongue as he recalled an unpleasant memory.This wasn\u2019t a lesson that Cyan had managed to learn all by himself. When he was still a child, the despair from his inability to defeat Eugene had led Cyan to hide in his room and cower beneath his blankets. However, Eugene had thrown open the door, barged into his room, and kicked Cyan in the ass.-Do you really think that I\u2019ll just play around while you do shit like this?Even if Cyan was consumed by despair, Eugene would continue to train without taking even a single day off. As such, the difference between them would only continue to grow.After Cyan reminded himself of this lesson, he left Eugene to his own affairs and headed to the gymnasium.\u201cWhat are you doing here so early in the morning?\u201d Gilead welcomed Eugene into the room with a bright smile on his face.Instead of getting to the point immediately, Eugene first bowed his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve come because I have something that I would like to report to you.\u201d\u201cReport?\u201d Gilead asked, tilting his head to the side as his eyes gleamed with curiosity.He was curious about what kind of surprise his adopted son would be bringing him this time.As he sat down on the sofa, Eugene began speaking, \u201cJust this morning, I reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.\u201dAt these words, Gilead unconsciously leaped up from his seat.\u201cIs that true?\u201d he demanded.\u201cYes, sir, it is,\u201d admitted Eugene.Gilead rushed over with hurried strides. Meeting his unspoken request, Eugene began resonating the stars circling his heart. As white flames engulfed Eugene\u2019s body, Gilead took a deep breath in astonishment before bursting out laughing.\u201c...Ha\u2026 hahaha!\u201dAfter taking in Eugene as his adopted son, Gilead had gone through so many different things that he had thought that he could no longer be surprised by anything. However, once again, Gilead couldn\u2019t help but be astonished. Was it really possible for him to reach the Third Star of the White Flame Formula at just seventeen years of age? Even among all his predecessors, no one had managed the Third Star at Eugene\u2019s young age.As Gilead plopped down on the seat in front of Eugeen, he shook his head.\u201c...Adopting you into the main family\u2026 might just be the best thing that I have ever done,\u201d Gilead admitted.\u201cThis is all thanks to the Patriarch\u2019s support,\u201d Eugene replied with a faint smile.Although four years had passed since he\u2019d been adopted, Eugene had yet to call Gilead \u2018father.\u2019 The only one he called \u2018father\u2019 was his biological parent, Gerhard.Gilead didn\u2019t feel any unpleasantness due to this. Instead, he approved of Eugene\u2019s filial piety to his biological father and was proud of how considerate his adopted son was. But if only such an impressive child was truly his son\u2026 then no one would raise any objections to Eugene becoming the next Patriarch. On the contrary, everyone would actually be united under the opinion that Eugene\u00a0should\u00a0become the Patriarch.\u2018...I shouldn\u2019t have such thoughts,\u2019\u00a0Gilead attempted to discard this dangerous idea with a shake of his head.Such careless thoughts would lead to bloodshed and death. For the clan, and of course, his family as well, Gilead didn\u2019t want to force his children to have to bare their knives at each other.After he finished casting off such thoughts, Gilead continued, \u201c...My support, you say\u2026. I don\u2019t believe that I gave you anything too impressive. So this achievement is all the result of your hard work.\u201d\u201cBut it was all thanks to the Patriarch\u2019s support that I was able to work so hard,\u201d Eugene argued.After carefully examining Eugene\u2019s smiling face, Gilead burst out laughing.\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s something you need,\u201d he observed.Without any hesitation, Eugene confessed, \u201cI want to learn magic.\u201dIn the past, he had had to pay attention to maintaining his childish facade while speaking to Gilead, but now there was no longer any need for that. Eugene had grown up quite a bit, and Gilead had gotten used to Eugene\u2019s forthrightness over the past four years.\u201c...Magic?\u201d Gilead asked.Despite all this, Gilead wouldn\u2019t find it so easy to grant Eugene\u2019s current desire as he would any other request. The confusion that Gilead initially felt was the same as Cyan\u2019s. Why did Eugene suddenly want to learn magic? After all, Eugene had never once expressed any desire to learn magic during these past four years.\u201c...Are you serious when you say this?\u201d asked Gilead.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cBut why? No one from our family\u2019s entire line was able to reach the Third Star of the White Flame Formula at your age. If you continue to work as hard as you have been, you might be able to rise to the Fourth Star before you become an adult.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll still be able to train hard, even while I\u2019m learning magic,\u201d Eugene stated without any uncertainty.Although this might seem arrogant, in Eugene\u2019s opinion, someone like him had the right to say such a thing.\u201cSir Patriarch. In the four years since I was adopted into the main family, I have never once left your care,\u201d Eugene said as he straightened his back and faced Gilead firmly. \u201cToday, as I was advancing to the Third Star, I realized something. If I continue to stay at the main estate and keep practicing as I have been, I don\u2019t believe that I will continue to show the same amount of growth.\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d Gilead hummed in consideration.\u201cI am extremely lacking in real-life experience,\u201d Eugene concluded.Although Eugene\u2019s voice was calm as he said this, Gilead felt a surging vitality coming from these words that matched Eugene\u2019s young age. Eugene\u2019s voice was full of his sincerity and desire for growth.Eugene confidently continued his argument, \u201cI want to learn much more, especially about magic. While it is something that I have never studied before, I know that it is also a discipline that uses mana. Although I don\u2019t yet know if I have any great talent for magic, I believe that by venturing into magic, I\u2019ll be able to view mana from a different perspective than the one I\u2019ve had until now.\u201d\u201c...\u201d Gilead stayed silent.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t make much progress in it, just by learning a new discipline, I believe that it will still be a great experience for me. I am sure that all of this won\u2019t be in vain. That is why I have dared to make such a request,\u201d Eugene stopped talking at this point and stared at Gilead with sparkling eyes; then, he placed his hands on his knees and bowed his head low. \u201cI sincerely beseech you.\u201d\u201c...Haha,\u201d Gilead let out another laugh. Then, as he shook his head from side to side, he continued speaking, \u201cRaise your head. Do you really think that there is any need for you to bow your head just for a small request like this?\u201d\u201cYes, Patriarch.\u201d\u201cEven if I am your Patriarch, how can I pour cold water on your burning desire to learn and grow? Eugene, I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. So if you really want to learn magic, then\u2026 I\u2019ll just have to give you my permission to learn.\u201dEugene shook his bowed head in relief and smiled. Of course, when he raised his head, there was no trace of amusement left on his face.\u201cSo then, how exactly do you want to go about learning magic?\u201d Gilead asked.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026,\u201d Eugene trailed off.\u201cSince you\u2019ve already come to ask for my permission, you must have thought it through already, no?\u201d\u201cI want to go to Aroth.\u201dAlthough Gilead had expected this, he couldn\u2019t hide his uneasy reaction when Eugene mentioned the Magic Kingdom of Aroth. If you wanted to learn magic, then Aroth was definitely the best place to go. \u2026And if it wasn\u2019t for what his eldest son, Eward, had experienced in Aroth, Gilead wouldn\u2019t have felt any discomfort from these words.\u201c...Aroth, you say\u2026,\u201d Gilead murmured.\u201cI don\u2019t need anything else, just your permission,\u201d Eugene continued speaking quickly.From here on, Eugene knew that he needed to be careful with his words. Eward was Gilead\u2019s soft spot. Even though he was the eldest son, Eward hadn\u2019t made any outstanding achievements in the martial arts; and despite showing interest in magic ever since he was young, the eldest son had failed to show much progress in magic as well.Although he had stayed in Aroth ever since he was sent there four years ago, Eward hadn\u2019t been able to escape the heavy weight of the Lionheart clan\u2019s prestigious name and instead had been made into a laughing stock for having only managed to enter the tower through his connections.Eugene didn\u2019t want to get involved with Eward. He only wanted to go to Aroth to learn magic and follow any clues left behind by Sienna.However, if the word \u2018Aroth\u2019 was spoken anywhere in the main estate, whoever heard it instantly thought of Eward. So he needed to be very careful, as Eugene didn\u2019t want to create any pointless misunderstandings.Gilead eventually shook off his unease and said, \u201c...If that\u2019s what you want, then I can only give you permission to go there. Allow me to inform Lovellian first, though.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m grateful for your thoughts, I don\u2019t want to receive too much in terms of support,\u201d Eugene paused for a moment to examine Gilead\u2019s expression before continuing. \u201c...To be honest\u2026 it feels like any assistance would be very burdensome, and Master Lovellian should be quite busy as well. If possible, I would like to try studying quietly on my own without any assistance from Master Lovellian.\u201d\u201cThat would actually be quite difficult,\u201d Gilead said, unable to stop a wry smile forming on his face. \u201cEven if you leave the main estate, you are still a member of the Lionheart clan. The moment you arrive in Aroth, many of Aroth\u2019s wizards will be paying attention to you. Even if you refuse it, a lot of people will approach you to make connections to the Lionheart clan.\u201d\u201cThen I just won\u2019t accept their offers,\u201d Eugene said determinedly.\u201c...Your convictions are praiseworthy,\u201d Gilead complimented with a sigh.How good would it be if his eldest son could be like that? As dangerous thoughts rose up in his head once more, Gilead shook his head to clear it.\u201c...Eugene, just promise me one thing,\u201d Gilead requested.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cDo not get involved with black magic.\u201dIn Aroth, there was a Black Tower of Magic where black wizards gathered. There weren\u2019t any disturbing rumors that matched their sinister reputation, and unlike in the distant past, the public opinion of them wasn\u2019t too bad. However, the Lionheart clan had been founded\u00a0by the Great\u00a0Vermouth. Although some of the collateral branches had chosen to specialize in magic, black magic was still forbidden to the clan as an unwritten rule.\u201cI also despise black magic,\u201d Eugene replied without any hesitation.Gilead nodded in relief and said, \u201cAs long as you can promise me that, I won\u2019t lift a finger, so you\u2019ll be free to leave for Aroth in whichever way you desire. I won\u2019t even inform Lovellian. \u2026I hope you won\u2019t have to personally experience the same sorts of troubles that Eward did. Is there anything else you would like to request?\u201d\u201cI would like to shamelessly ask for an allowance.\u201d\u201cHow long do you plan on staying in Aroth?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll need to go there first and start studying to get a rough idea of how long it will take me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be returning before becoming an adult.\u201d\u201cThat means you intend on staying for at least a few years.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll be able to actually learn something,\u201d Eugene confirmed with a laugh.\u201cHm, that certainly seems true. However, since magic is a completely different discipline from what you\u2019ve been taught so far\u2026 it will be impossible for you to make any progress if you go into this half-heartedly,\u201d Gilead warned Eugene.He had never learned any magic in his past life. As such, even Eugene didn\u2019t have the confidence to say that he would be able\u00a0to make rapid progress.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he walked back down the hallway, he heard a knocking sound coming from a tightly locked door.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Eugene asked without any alarm as he halted in his steps.He knew whose room that was. It was one of the rooms Ciel was using. Ever since she had started going through a rough patch of puberty a few months ago, she had stopped going to the gym and instead used some of the rooms in the mansion for her own training.\u201cAre you really going to Aroth?\u201dCiel didn\u2019t open the door fully and instead let her voice leak from a crack in the doorway.\u201cDid Cyan tell you that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cMhm. He also told me that you\u2019ve reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ve already heard everything then.\u201d\u201cI asked if you\u2019re really going to Aroth?\u201d\u201cYep, I\u2019ve even got permission from the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cWhy are you even going?\u201d as she said this, Ciel knocked on the door once more.Knock knock.Eugene smiled and responded with a few knocks of his own.\u201cBecause I want to learn magic,\u201d he explained.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you don\u2019t really need to go to Aroth. You can just invite a wizard from the capital to be your teacher,\u201d argued Ciel.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that they won\u2019t be as good as the wizards of Aroth?\u201d\u201cIf you request it, Father would even summon a wizard from the royal court.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that a court wizard would be better at teaching than a wizard from one of Aroth\u2019s Towers of Magic.\u201d\u201cThe court wizards are guaranteed to be skillful.\u201d\u201cWhat I want isn\u2019t a skillful wizard, but a wizard who is good at teaching,\u201d Eugene patiently explained.\u201cDo you really need to learn magic?\u201d Ciel asked, her voice growing petulant.She opened the door slightly and let her head poke out of the room. At seventeen years old, Ciel was left with very little of her past mischievous look, but the change was only skin-deep. Eugene was well aware of just how cunning this girl\u2019s true personality could be.Ciel once again insisted, \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to learn magic, right?\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s also nothing wrong with learning magic, is there?\u201d Eugene argued back.\u201cIf it\u2019s magic you want, then isn\u2019t your spirit magic enough? Also, while you aren\u2019t here, brother and I might be able to catch up to your skill level.\u201dCiel was blatantly provoking him, but Eugene just snickered in amusement.\u201cIf that happens, that\u2019s actually good for me,\u201d Eugene smirked.\u201c...What\u2019s so good about it?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t that just mean that the main family is growing stronger, and that it will be more fun sparring with you two? Ah, although it has been quite a while since I sparred with you.\u201d\u201cIf I start sparring with you from now on, will you stay here instead of going to Aroth?\u201d\u201cNo, I will still be going.\u201d\u201cBastard,\u201d Ciel insulted him with a pout on her face before pulling her head back into her room.Until just now, Ciel had been immersed in her training, so her hair was frizzy, and her body was damp with sweat. She didn\u2019t want to show such an appearance to anyone, nor did she want anyone to notice her body odor.After a short silence, Ciel continued speaking, \u201c...How long will you be gone?\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t know until I get there,\u201d answered Eugene casually.\u201cYou should know roughly how long it will take.\u201d\u201cIt will be a year at the very least.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to stay for so long? Moving out will be a pain, and what will you do about Mr. Gerhard?\u201dIt might be because they were twins, but Ciel had ended up saying the same thing as Cyan.\u201cMy father will be just fine without me,\u201d Eugene pointed out.\u201c...Uncle Gion will be lonely,\u201d Ciel eventually said after some hesitation.\u201cThat might be true.\u201dEugene also happened to enjoy his frequent spars with Gion.\u201cTo make up for me not being here, you both should make sure to play with him,\u201d teased Eugene.\u201cAnd what about my brother?\u201d Ciel suddenly brought up Cyan.\u201cWhy bring up Cyan here?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is that my brother enjoys sparring with you as well.\u201d\u201cIf he really does enjoy getting beaten up by me, your brother has to be a little strange in the head.\u201d\u201cIn any case, brother will be lonely if you\u2019re not around. Earlier, while he was talking to me, he even secretly confessed that he didn\u2019t want you to go.\u201d\u201cBut I plan on going anyway.\u201d\u201cI would also prefer it if you didn\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m still going.\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201dBehind the door, Ciel\u2019s face twisted into a frown. In the main family, Eugene was the only one who would allow Ciel\u2019s words to wash over him without any reaction. Ciel popped her head out just to glare at him before slamming the door shut with a loud bang.\u201c...When are you leaving?\u201d Ciel\u2019s muffled voice came through the door.Eugene answered, \u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhy are you leaving so quickly?\u201d\u201cIs there any reason for me to delay it? Since I\u2019ve received Gilead\u2019s permission, I should just save time and head off right away.\u201d\u201cRude jerk, shouldn\u2019t we at least have a farewell party?\u201d\u201cWhy would you want to throw a farewell party for a jerk?\u201dKnocking on the door again as a goodbye, Eugene resumed walking down the corridor. Only after Eugene had gotten some distance away did Ciel open the door once more.\u201cAre you really leaving tomorrow?\u201dAs this voice came from behind him, Eugene just waved his hand as a response without turning back to look at Ciel.Since he had obtained Gilead\u2019s approval, Eugene showed no hesitation in his subsequent actions. After returning to the annex, he knocked on Gerhard\u2019s door.\u201cCome back safely.\u201dAlthough he had been suddenly informed that Eugene would be leaving for Aroth tomorrow, Gerhard didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about it before giving his blessing.It wasn\u2019t like he didn't have any concerns for his son, but Gerhard also didn\u2019t want to suppress his son\u2019s freedom after Eugene had already grown so splendidly.Gerhard lectured his son, \u201cWhile you\u2019re there, don\u2019t hang around with naughty kids, and make sure not to neglect your lessons.\u201dEugene returned the favor, \u201cEven when I\u2019m not here, don't do anything you shouldn\u2019t do, father, and don\u2019t neglect your exercise either.\u201dGerhard burst into laughter at this rejoinder. Gerhard had greatly improved himself during his past four years at the main estate. He had lost a lot of weight and even gained quite a bit of muscle. It was all thanks to his regular hunting trips with the collateral patriarchs and frequent walks he enjoyed in the main family\u2019s extensive forest.\u201cAlso, if anyone tries to cause you trouble because I\u2019m not here, write to me right away. Don\u2019t pointlessly suffer in silence on your own,\u201d Eugene insisted.Gerhard tried to reassure his son, \u201cI\u2019m sure that the Patriarch will be able to spare the attention if I bring the matter to him.\u201d\u201cStill, wouldn\u2019t you feel better if it was your one and only son who was looking out for you instead of the busy Patriarch?\u201dGerhard smiled silently and patted Eugene on the shoulder. This gifted son of his was Gerhard\u2019s pride and treasure. If it wasn\u2019t for his son\u2026. Gerhard nodded his head as he recalled his memories of Gidol, where they had been living just a few years ago.Gerhard tried to soothe Eugene\u2019s protectiveness, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be a hindrance to you.\u201d\u201cWhat hindrance? Don\u2019t say things like that anymore. I have never once thought of you as a hindrance,\u201d Eugene responded bluntly while poking Gerhard in the side. \u201cIn any case, I\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow. I\u2019ll make sure to stay healthy while I\u2019m gone, so you should also make sure to stay safe, Father. Got that?\u201d\u201cFine, fine. I\u2019ve got it.\u201dEugene was now taller than Gerhard. Gerhard smiled happily while looking up at his son, who had grown so mature.That night, Eugene and Gerhard, as well as all the members of the main family, gathered together and sat around a large table. Even Ciel, who hadn\u2019t shown her face at dinner in quite some time, was now sitting at the table wearing a nice dress.Although it wasn\u2019t a lavish farewell party, they had at least managed to wrangle something into place so that the whole family could offer Eugene blessings for the future as he prepared to leave them for a few years.Various well-wishes were exchanged over a table laden with an array of luxurious dishes.\u201cSo you intend to learn magic in Aroth, really\u2026. Since you have such an amazing talent in martial arts, I\u2019m sure you will be good at learning magic as well,\u201d Ancilla praised Eugene.The news of Eugene rising to the Third Star of the White Flame Formula had made Ancilla chew on her lip in frustration, but the fact that that monstrous child was leaving the main estate for the time being was a joyous consolation.\u201cI really envy Sir Gerhard for having such a wonderful son,\u201d flattered Ancilla.\u201cHaha, you\u2019re too kind,\u201d Gerhard accepted the compliment with a laugh.During these four years, Ancilla\u2019s attitude hadn\u2019t seen much change from when they had first met. She had no intention of forging a hostile relationship with Gerhard, let alone Eugene. Instead, she held out a hand with a smile, thus creating a friendly relationship with Gerhard and Eugene.But Tanis, the first wife, showed the two a completely different attitude.The dark circles under Tanis\u2019s eyes and her sallow cheeks left a rather desolate impression. For the past few years, Tanis had rarely left the main family\u2019s mansion, and she spent her days reacting with great agitation to even the slightest mistakes from the servants.Tanis felt that she had no choice but to do so. And she felt like she was being driven further into a corner with each passing day. Eward had not been able to become Lovellian\u2019s disciple as she had hoped, nor did he manage to forge any connections with Aroth\u2019s high-ranking wizards. Since even Gilford and his wife, who had been friendly with Tanis, had left the main estate a few years ago, Tanis had no allies in the current main estate.\u2018Although it\u2019s her fault for being so prickly,\u2019\u00a0avoiding Tanis\u2019s intense gaze, Eugene focussed on cutting his meat.Gilead had never discriminated against Tanis. He didn't even force Eward to return despite all the negative rumors. Instead, Gilead kept providing support to shore up Eward\u2019s insufficiencies.It was Tanis\u2019s own decision to spend her days shunning any contact and clawing at her surroundings.Just as the meal was ending, Tanis suddenly called out, \u201cEugene.\u201dAlthough Ancilla treated Eugene warmly whenever they met, this was the first time the temperamental first wife had called Eugene by his name all year. Though it wasn\u2019t like they had even held frequent conversations in the previous years.Tanis requested, \u201cOnce you get to Aroth, please take care of your older brother, Eward.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene was unable to respond to these words that had suddenly been thrown at him and could only blink in surprise.Tanis continued, \u201cHe must have been lonely, staying in Aroth all by himself for the past few years. \u2026I know that he didn\u2019t get to spend much time with you as siblings, but Eward is still your brother.\u201d\u201c...Yes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Eugene eventually replied.\u201cYou might be adopted, but Eward is your brother. So, please treat him like a younger brother should,\u201d even as she said this, Tanis\u2019s eyes slid to the side. She continued speaking while glaring at Cyan and Ciel, who were sitting close to Eugene, \u201c...Take care of your older brother. You can at least do that, right?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Eugene avoided promising.\u201cOh my, you\u2019re being too insistent, big sister. I\u2019m sure that Eugene will do what he can,\u201d Ancilla gave a polite laugh as she drew Tanis\u2019s gaze away from Cyan and Ciel with these words.Tanis glared at Ancilla with her narrowed eyes, then pushed her chair back and stood up.\u201cPlease excuse me. I\u2019m feeling exhausted. I\u2019ll be leaving now to go and get some rest.\u201d\u201c...You may be excused,\u201d Gilead nodded in permission with a perplexed look on his face.Over the past few years, Eugene had gotten quite close to Gilead. Thanks to this, he was able to make a fully informed decision about Gilead\u2019s position.\u2018Sure enough, the Patriarch\u2019s seat is a shit place to be stuck on.\u2019Eugene never wanted to become the Patriarch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, wouldn\u2019t it feel awkward being followed around everywhere by armed guards?\u201cIt\u2019s not like Aroth\u2019s public security is that bad, and I\u2019m skilled enough to take care of myself,\u201d Eugene had argued.All five of the Towers of Magic were located in the capital of Aroth. Since he was moving to such a bustling capital city and not some remote village, he wouldn\u2019t need any guards.Gion had backed him up, \u201cWith Eugene\u2019s skills, he shouldn\u2019t require an escort.\u201dSince even Gion had spoken up for Eugene, Gilead could only nod in agreement.The two adults were well aware that Eugene had unbelievable levels of skills and experience for someone his age. On top of that, since he had also reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula, they couldn\u2019t treat him like a child any longer. At his age and skill level, Eugene needed to learn how to make his own decisions.\u2018...Unlike Eward.\u2019Gilead washed down the bitter taste that this thought left in his mouth with a sip of wine.The next day, everyone was there to see Eugene off as he headed to the warp gate in the outskirts of the estate\u2019s forest. Gerhard, who had been smiling happily the day before, burst into tears at the sight of Eugene leaving.\u201cMake sure to eat healthily and don\u2019t skip any meals.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you get sick, go find a doctor immediately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf things get too hard and lonely\u2026 don\u2019t try to endure it and just come back, got it?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it.\u201dEugene responded to each of Gerhard\u2019s reminders perfunctorily.It was hard for him to look at Gerhard directly as the man wept in love and concern for his son. In the past, Eugene\u2019s acknowledgment of Gerhard as his father had been faint, but strangely, the older he grew, the more he began to feel that Gerhard was truly his father despite having been reincarnated.\u2018...He is my real father, after all,\u2019\u00a0even as Eugene realized this, he said out loud, \u201cStop with the tears already. Do you really think I\u2019m just heading out there to die?\u201dGerhard paled, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt fate like that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just going to learn some magic. Maybe do some sightseeing in the vicinity of Aroth as well,\u201d Eugene reassured his father.\u201cYou\u2019ve been living in Gidol for most of your life, and for the last few years, you\u2019ve spent all your days at the main estate. As someone who hasn\u2019t really seen the world, I\u2019m just not confident that you\u2019ll be fine living in Aroth all by yourself\u2026,\u201d Gerhard trailed off.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. So please stop crying. All the servants are watching,\u201d Eugene said as he pulled out a handkerchief from his vest and scrubbed Gerhard\u2019s cheeks.\u201cHow about taking Nina with you at the very least?\u201d\u201cNina also arrived at the main estate when she was very young, so she\u2019s just as ignorant of the outside world as I am. Besides, I\u2019ve already told her to take this chance and go for a vacation to her hometown.\u201d\u201cThank you so much for your consideration, sir,\u201d Nina cut in with a smile and a nod.Eugene had personally requested the Patriarch to give Nina leave to go on this vacation. Thanks to this, Nina was able to visit her home with a heavy purse and an escort to protect her.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading off now,\u201d Eugene said as he handed the tear-soaked handkerchief over to Gerhard. \u201cAlthough it won\u2019t be often, I\u2019ll write to you from time to time, whenever I remember to. So you need to remember to stay safe as well, father.\u201dGerhard tried to speak, but all that came out was a sob.\u201cGeez, I told you to stop crying. Do you really think I won\u2019t go just because you keep crying, father?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cY-you\u2019ll definitely still go\u2014\u201d Gerhard choked out.\u201cYou know me so well. That\u2019s why you should stop crying. Can\u2019t you just send your grown-up son off with a smile?\u201dFinally, Gerhard stopped crying and put on a smile. But it seemed that Eugene had made a pointless mistake. Looking at Gerhard\u2019s tear-stained face, Eugene felt like a nail was being pounded into his chest.Still, Eugene didn\u2019t change his decision. Accompanied by his father\u2019s tearful smile and the farewells from the members of the main family, Eugene departed for the warp gate. He never looked back even once. Just like in his previous life, Eugene never changed his mind once he had decided to do something.* * *The Capital of the Magic Kingdom of Aroth was called Pentagon. The five Towers of Magic formed the corners of a pentagon with the Royal Palace at its center.Eugene stared down at this scene in awe. Although he had been to Aroth in his previous life, the landscape he saw then was far different from the landscape he was looking down at now.\u201c...Wow\u2026.\u201dThe five majestic and grand Towers of Magic were far more eye-catching than the palace. It couldn\u2019t be helped. The towers were both the symbol of Aroth and the source of its power. Unlike most kingdoms, the king had almost no ruling power. Aroth was instead governed by the prime minister of the parliament.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dFrom up here, Eugene had a great view of the sprawling city.Pentagon\u2019s warp gates opened up in the sky, contained within large floating stations. Among the various kingdoms, Aroth was the only one to have its warp gates located in the sky. Each floating station was held aloft due to the multiple bits of magic that had been cast on it, and they were a symbol of the pride of Aroth, which called itself the Magic Kingdom.\u2018They didn\u2019t have anything like this in my last life.\u2019For them to have raised a piece of land this size into the air and fixed the coordinates so that it could be used as a warp gate\u2026. In addition to showing off just how great their magic was, they were also marketing its convenience and quality.Thousands of people wanted to travel to Pentagon\u2019s floating stations just to take in the sprawling capital at a single glance.\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d a high-pitched voice said to Eugene. \u201cThis view could even be said to be one of Aroth\u2019s cultural assets. There are as many as fifteen floating stations all around Pentagon, and all of them were created by the Wise Sienna.\u201d\u201c...Wow,\u201d Eugene awkwardly exclaimed.The voice continued its spiel, \u201cTo go from this East Gate station, which Sir Eugene is currently at, to the Royal Palace, it would take at least half a day even with the help of a carriage. However, just by warping from one floating station to another, we can dramatically reduce the traveling distance....\u201dEven a blind person could understand what this meant.\u201cAlso, there are aerial carriages assigned to each floating station! With these carriages, even those suffering from warp motion sickness can head to their destination while enjoying this view of Pentagon as comfortably as if they were lying in their own\u00a0bed.\u201d\u201c...Are those also something that chick\u2014I mean, that Lady Sienna came up with?\u201d\u201cOf course they are! Ah, but there\u2019s no need to worry too much. Although they were constructed using magical techniques from hundreds of years ago, they have been continuously improved and repaired, so the annual rate of accidents is very low.\u201dBut that meant there wasn't a zero chance of accidents.\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d Eugene hummed consideringly.The man standing next to Eugene, chattering away as he gave out explanations, was a guide who worked for the East Gate floating station. Due to the large number of tourists, many guides worked at each floating station.Most of them were young, inexperienced wizards who hadn\u2019t been able to enter a tower and instead worked as guides to cover their living costs and tuition fees.\u2018It was a mistake to wear these clothes here,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with a frown as he looked down at his chest.He was wearing the official dress of the Lionheart clan, which had the Lionheart sigil embroidered on the left chest. Thanks to this outfit that he had worn without much thought, a guide had been attached to him the moment he stepped out of the warp gate.\u201cThe tourist attractions in the Pentagon are\u2014\u201d\u201cJust one moment,\u201d Eugene interrupted the guide to open a tourist brochure.After taking a few moments to check the tourist attractions listed in the brochure, Eugene nodded.\u201c...I would like to hire you just for today,\u201d he eventually decided.\u201cIf you sign up now, I can give you a discounted price of four days for the whole week,\u201d the guide offered.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s just sign the contract now.\u201dFor now, there was only one place that Eugene wanted to go to. After visiting that location, he had decided to head straight for the Red Tower of Magic to see Lovellian.As if he had been waiting for this, the guide pulled out a contract. After Eugene signed the contract using the pen that had come with it, he pulled out a cheque for a million sals from his wallet and handed it to the guide.\u201cWhoah!\u201d the guide exclaimed in excitement.Eugene explained, \u201cThis is the hiring fee for today, plus any other expenses that might crop up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my very best to show you around.\u201d\u201cFor now\u2026 I would like to visit the mansion that belonged to the Wise Sienna.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent choice,\u201d the guide praised with a smile. \u201cIf you visit Pentagon, the three things that you absolutely need to see are: the Wise Sienna\u2019s mansion, the Towers of Magic, and the night view from the floating stations.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get a chance to see the night view later. Right now, I just want to take a walk in the mansion by myself.\u201d\u201cDid you say that you wanted to go in by yourself?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAs you wish,\u201d the guide bowed his head and turned to lead the way.\u2018...So this is Eugene Lionheart,\u2019\u00a0the guide considered the name written on the contract as he headed towards the warp gate.\u00a0\u2018But why has he come to Aroth? Is he trying to learn magic like the eldest son? Or could it be that he\u2019s come to pick up that dunce?\u2019The name Eward Lionheart was also quite famous in Pentagon. Especially among those poor and young wizards who were forced to cover their living and tuition expenses by doing odd jobs such as guide work, Eward\u2019s name was an object of envy.\u2018...If he was born to a martial family, he should just learn martial arts. Why act like such a know-it-all and come here to learn magic without having already learned shit-all in the first place?\u2019Even though he didn\u2019t have much talent in magic, Eward was someone who had been able to enter a Tower of Magic by relying solely on his personal connections. Although he hadn\u2019t become a disciple of the Red Tower Master, this had still enabled Eward to learn magic from one of the Tower Master\u2019s subordinates.To these poor, young wizards, he was known as a dunce, a fool, and a son of a bitch.Having gone through the warp gate, the guide pointed out of a window, \u201cThe Wise Sienna\u2019s mansion is there, below us.\u201dAs the mansion was such a famous tourist destination in Pentagon, a floating station had been specially assigned to it.As they rode down in an aerial carriage, the guide continued to chatter, \u201cThree hundred years ago, after returning from the Devildom of Helmuth, Lady Sienna was the youngest person in Aroth\u2019s history to rise to the position of a Tower Master. In the square at the entrance to the Green Tower of Magic, which Sienna was once in charge of, you can find a statue that perfectly reproduces her image.\u201dEugene continued to stare at the view outside the window without any reply.\u201cThis mansion was the last place that Lady Sienna was ever seen. Two hundred years ago, Lady Sienna left a message in this mansion, saying that she was going into seclusion and then disappeared.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that story as well,\u201d Eugene, who had been listening silently, turned his head and said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still a mystery where Lady Sienna went after leaving that message?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Lady Sienna thoroughly erased all of her traces. Many of Aroth\u2019s wizards, and even Lady Sienna\u2019s own disciples, attempted to follow her tracks, but no one has been able to find out where Lady Sienna went into seclusion.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t there any speculations or rumors of her whereabouts?\u201d\u201cOf course, there were a lot of unconfirmed stores. Some say that she went to the\u00a0Devildom\u00a0to slay the remaining Demon Kings. Others say that she wandered into Samar Forest, the sanctuary of the elves\u2026.\u201d After wracking his memories for a moment, the guide continued speaking. \u201c...There were even rumors that she had caught an incurable disease from somewhere and went into seclusion to die peacefully.\u201dEugene stayed silent, \u201c....\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much truth these rumors hold. What is clear is that Lady Sienna hasn\u2019t been sighted even once in these past two hundred years.\u201d The guide lowered his voice with a sad expression, \u201cThe lamentable fact is that the day Lady Sienna disappeared also happened to be her birthday. Just what on earth could have happened to her\u2026 that she decided to go into seclusion instead of celebrating her birthday? This might just be my opinion, but I believe that Lady Sienna may have gone to the Devildom.\u201d\u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cIf it was two hundred years ago, that would be the hundred-year anniversary of Lady Sienna\u2019s return from the Devildom of Helmuth. A hundred years since she was forced to return, leaving behind the body of her comrade, the Stupid Hamel\u2026. On the eve of her birthday, Lady Sienna may have recalled the fate of her long-dead comrade and\u2026.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene was speechless.\u201c\u2018I want to avenge Hamel\u2026,\u2019 it may have been such a desire that made Lady Sienna leave. You should have heard about this as well, right, Sir Eugene? It seems that Hamel had a crush on Lady Sienna. Like a bratty young boy, he couldn\u2019t confess his feelings to Lady Sienna, so he instead teased her throughout their journey\u2026. Then shortly before he died, Hamel confessed his love for Lady Sienna\u2014\u201d\u201cStop your fucking bullshit!\u201d Eugene suddenly shouted, unable to restrain himself.\u201cHuh?\u201d the guide reeled back in astonishment at this sudden outburst.Eugene stammered as he tried to come up with an excuse, \u201cAh, no\u2026. Um\u2026. That was\u2026.\u201d\u201cAhah\u2026,\u201d after blinking in surprise for a few moments, the guide made a noise of enlightenment as he concluded with a wide smile. \u201cIt looks like Sir Eugene is very against Hamel\u2019s romance with Lady Sienna.\u201d\u201c...Well, yes, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cI often argued with my friends about this when I was young. I\u2019ve always claimed that Lady Sienna\u2019s romance with Hamel was canon, but my friends insisted that Lady Sienna and the Great Vermouth were truly in love. That\u2019s why you were so angry, right?\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene couldn\u2019t find any words.\u201cWell, that would still be a pretty interesting story. The Stupid Hamel\u2026 who was constantly frustrated by Vermouth, even lost his love to the hero\u2026 but in the end, he still threw himself in front of the blow meant for Vermouth and confessed his love as he was dying\u2026. Ah, I really like such tragic stores as well.\u201dSince Eugene had given him a million sals, shouldn't it be all right for him to slap the guide across his mouth just once? Eugene seriously began to consider such an idea.\u201cIn any case, that\u2019s just what I believe. Lady Sienna left Aroth and went to Helmuth alone to avenge Hamel\u2026 but in the end, she failed to get her revenge\u2026 and her eyes closed for the last time in Helmuth\u2026.\u201d\u201c...It seems that you really like tragedies,\u201d Eugene commented with some difficulty.\u201cIn Aroth, there are a lot of novels that have been written about Lady Sienna. If you are interested, I could bring you a selection of them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u2026. However\u2026 about Lady Sienna heading to Helmuth, that\u2019s just a wild guess, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely unfounded. It\u2019s quite the famous story, but Lady Sienna hated both black magic and the demonfolk, and until she went missing, she continued to oppose the erection of the Black Tower of Magic.\u201dIt had been two hundred years since the Black Tower of Magic had been raised in Aroth.This meant it was built shortly after the Wise Sienna\u2019s disappearance.\u201c...Some have argued that the radical black wizards who were promoting the construction of the Black Tower of Magic may have assassinated Lady Sienna, but\u2014\u201d\u201cThere is no way any black wizard could assassinate Lady Sienna,\u201d the tone with which Eugene spit out this objection was so cold that he almost couldn\u2019t believe it belonged to him. \u201cEven the Demon King of Fury was unable to break through Lady Sienna\u2019s magical barrier. So how could mere black wizards break through a spell that even stopped a demon king?\u201dThe guide exclaimed in amazement, \u201cWow, you really know your stuff! Yep, that\u2019s what I think as well. Even the wizards who made up the Black Tower of Magic two hundred years ago stubbornly denied this assassination theory.\u201dDespite Eugene\u2019s denial, a corner of his heart was still stained in darkness. Black wizards might not be able to assassinate Sienna, but what about the Demon Kings? Helmuth\u2019s two remaining Demon Kings had poured enormous amounts of support to construct the Black Tower of Magic.Eugene turned his head to look at the Black Tower of Magic in the distance. The lofty tower was shorter than the other towers of magic, but its extravagant splendor was so obvious that it could even be seen from such a distance.To this day, Helmuth was still keeping an eye on Aroth through the Black Tower. That was why they had given such great effort to have their pawns, the black wizards, become part of Aroth. So from the perspective of the Demon Kings, Sienna, who continued to oppose the construction of the Black Tower of Magic, must have been a thorn in their eyes.So much so that they even wished to kill her.\u2018...Sienna,\u2019\u00a0as the aerial carriage landed on the ground, Eugene hopped off the carriage and immediately looked towards Sienna\u2019s mansion.\u00a0\u2018Are you really dead?\u2019But the place was so packed that he couldn\u2019t really appreciate the view. Too many tourists were crowding around the mansion for him to get a good look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 29.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29.1: Aroth (4)The crowds were a natural sight. The Wise Sienna's mansion was a holy place that all young saplings of magic wanted to visit; and even for those not learning magic, it was a standard tourist destination that needed to be seen at least once when visiting Aroth.\u201cPlease\u2026. Please let me pass this exam so that I can enter a Tower of Magic\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis will be my eleventh time failing. Please at least let me get to the interview stage\u2026.\u201dThe recruitment exams for the Towers of Magic, which were held twice a year, were reputed to be a truly brutal competition. Across all five towers, there were thousands of wizards taking the exam, but only a few dozen wizards at most would pass the exam and be accepted.There were still two months until the next terrifying public examination, but the road in front of Sienna\u2019s mansion was already packed full of students praying for success.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to pay them any attention,\u201d the guide said upon noticing Eugene looking in their direction with shocked eyes. He walked over with a grin on his face. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get into the mansion anyway since they don\u2019t have the money for it.\u201d\u201c...Is that so?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cThe mansion\u2019s gate fee alone costs hundreds of thousands of sals. And that\u2019s just the cost to see the garden; if you want to look inside the mansion, you need to pay several times that amount.\u201d\u201cWhy is the price so high?\u201d\u201cBecause there are still people who are willing to go inside even if they have to pay such a price. There\u2019s a superstition that if you pray for help in passing your exam at the portrait of Sienna that\u2019s hanging in the mansion's main hall, you will definitely pass the recruitment exam for the Tower of Magic that you plan on entering.\u201d\u201cIs that even possible?\u201d\u201cOf course, it isn\u2019t\u2026. A few years ago, after working hard to save enough money, I prayed at the portrait, but I still failed.\u201dThe guide\u2019s shoulders slumped as he admitted this.\u201c...In any case, the fact that it\u2019s so expensive just shows how valuable the opportunity to enter is, right? Since Lady Sienna never married and didn\u2019t leave behind any children, all tourism fees from this mansion go to the royal palace.\u201dTogether with the guide, Eugene headed to the mansion's front gate. Although there were already people lining up here, the Lionheart name proved effective in getting them to step aside.\u2018So this is why he told me to keep my formal clothes on.\u2019Before boarding the aerial carriage, Eugene had started to feel bothered by all the gazes coming his way, so he had tried to change out of his formal clothes. However, the guide had insisted that he needed to continue wearing them, or at least keep them on until he was done visiting Sienna\u2019s mansion.Thanks to his advice, there was no need for them to wait in line. After the guide had pulled the guards aside to have a word with them, the captain of the guards immediately emerged to greet Eugene.\u201cSir Eugene Lionheart, your identity has been confirmed.\u201dEugene\u2019s identity card was linked to his blood, so it was impossible to forge it. Especially since Eugene\u2019s identity card had a rare and eye-catching appearance, as the Lionheart sigil had been engraved on the back of the card after he was adopted into the direct line.\u2018Back in the old days, we went around carrying badges instead\u2026.\u2019And although they had all kept those badges on them, they actually weren\u2019t very suitable for identification purposes, as the badges were easy to forge. Back in that era of constant bloodshed, it was strength, not a badge, that was used to prove their identities.\u2018Even the currency has been converted into some strange pieces of paper\u2026.\u2019Although the currency had still been called sals, they used to carry around coins made of copper, silver, and gold. But the paper money that they use nowadays? Where exactly did its value come from?\u2018The world really has changed quite a lot.\u2019While Eugene was living at the main estate, he hadn\u2019t really felt the difference. But since venturing out into the world, it all felt a little unreal to him upon noticing that so many things had changed from his past.The captain of the guards asked, \u201cHow would you gentlemen like to pay for the entrance fee?\u201dWith casual ease, the guide replied, \u201cWe want a full course tour of the mansion. Sir Eugene, would you like to pay with cash or card?\u201dCaught off guard, Eugene stammered, \u00a0\u201c...W-with card.\u201dFumbling, Eugene took his card out of his wallet. This thing called a wallet was pretty awkward as well. Why did you need to pull your money out of these thin leather pockets? Didn\u2019t anyone use money bags nowadays? And what\u2019s with this card? He\u2019d been told that he could use it without any hesitation whenever he needed to pay for something. It was a black card with the Lionheart sigil engraved on it.\u201cA bla\u2014a black card,\u201d the guide took the proffered card with a gulp.The national banks only issued such black cards to the highest level of accounts. Even though this might tempt thieves to try and steal it, stolen cards could not be used so easily. The public banks had linked cards like these to their owner\u2019s blood, just like the ID cards.\u201cWhoa\u2026,\u201d after a slight pause, the captain of the guards took the card with a respectful bow of his head.Once they were done with the payment process, Eugene and the guide were escorted away, not to the crowded main gate but to another more secluded gate instead.\u201cPlease enjoy the tour,\u201d the captain of the guards saw them off with a bow.While still ruminating on the acute difference between the current day\u2019s common sense and the common sense he had inherited from his past life, Eugene put away his wallet.\u2018I\u2019ll just have to try and get used to it.\u2019Even when Eugene was back in Gidol, he had hardly ever left the mansion. After all, once he left his mansion, all there was to see were endless fields of wheat. And after he was adopted into the main family, Nina was there to bring him whatever he needed, so he devoted all his time to training his mana and martial arts.\u201cHow long would you like to stay here?\u201d the guide asked politely.\u201cMaybe one or two hours?\u201d Eugene answered, sounding unsure.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll wait out here until you\u2019re done,\u201d the guide replied with a smile.Eugene absentmindedly nodded and turned away from him. At first,\u00a0he had wondered why someone\u00a0would even need a guide, but now he found it convenient to have someone handle the troublesome work for him.\u201c...Now then\u2026,\u201d Eugene took a deep breath before putting his best foot forward. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at how\u00a0that\u00a0chick lived.\u201dSienna\u2019s mansion was huge.It was a home that she had lived in for over a hundred years. During that time, Vermouth had married more than ten wives, and even that foolish Molon had gotten married and had several children.However, Sienna never married. She didn\u2019t even live together with her three personal disciples. Except for her servants, Sienna had lived in this spacious mansion all by herself.\u2018If she lived here for a hundred years, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange for her to have married and even gotten to her grandchildren.\u2019Because of her faith, it was normal for Anise to not get married. But what about Sienna? If she was going to live that long, wouldn\u2019t it have been better for her to get married and have children like Vermouth and Molon, just so she wouldn\u2019t get lonely?\u2014Hey, what are you going to do after all this?This memory, when did it come from again?It was probably\u2026 sometime after they had killed the fifth-ranked Demon King of Carnage. In the ruins of the Demon King\u2019s Castle, while everyone was still exhausted from the battle, they had set up an order for the watch.On a night when everyone else had fallen asleep out of exhaustion, Hamel had been bandaging the wounds on his body when Sienna, who was next up for the watch, suddenly opened her eyes and had asked him that question.\u2014Why are you asking that all of a sudden?\u2014I\u2019m just curious. Since we\u2019re going through all this shit in a hellish place like this when we\u2019re meant to be enjoying the bloom of our youths, shouldn\u2019t we at least get to enjoy some happiness once all this is over?\u2014I\u2019ve got no idea. Never given it any thought.\u2014Molon, that idiot, says he wants to become a king. Doesn't that sound hilarious?\u2014Crazy bastard. What a load of bullshit. Why on earth does he want to become a king?\u2014Hey, leave him alone. It\u2019s what he wants to do\u2026. Everyone has the right to dream.\u2014Have you been drinking? \u2018Everyone has the right to dream\u2026.\u2019 See this? I\u2019m getting goosebumps from the cringe.\u2014Scumbag. Even though I was trying to be sincere\u2014!\u2014Then, what do you plan on doing once this is over? Do you want to become a queen like Molon?\u2014Are you crazy? Why would I choose to do something so boring?\u2014But you\u2019re implying that something like that isn\u2019t impossible for you?\u2014Of course, it\u2019s not impossible. If we return after slaying all the Demon Kings, won\u2019t they still try to pawn kingships onto us, even if we tell them not to? Molon has probably thought of that as well, and that\u2019s why he says that he wants to become a king.\u2014So then, if you don\u2019t want to become a queen, what do you want to do?\u2014For me, I\u2019d like to\u2026.Eugene looked up at the portrait. There was Sienna, just as Hamel remembered her. Light purple hair that would enchant the eye, even from a stray glimpse caught in the middle of a crowd, and green eyes just as beautiful as her hair.\u2014...live a normal life\u2026 just like everybody else\u2026. I want to get married, have children, live comfortably, and eventually become\u00a0a grandmother.In his mind, he saw the wind blow through Sienna\u2019s hair.Unconsciously, Eugene stretched his hand out towards Sienna\u2019s portrait.Suddenly a voice reminded him, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to touch the portrait.\u201dEugene couldn\u2019t help but curse,\u00a0\u2018This motherfucker, just when I was feeling a bit emotional.\u2019One of the guards deployed throughout the mansion gave him a warning glance. Although all of the objects in the mansion had been enchanted with preservation magic, that still didn\u2019t mean that they could be touched freely.\u201cI understand your feelings,\u201d the guard said sympathetically. \u201cLady Sienna is truly beautiful\u2026. Of course, there\u2019s no way that that portrait can fully capture Lady Sienna\u2019s beauty.\u201dStill slightly annoyed, Eugene asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen her in person, so how could you be so sure of that?\u201d\u201cBecause portraits always pale compared to the real thing,\u201d the guard stated confidently.Eugene wasn\u2019t too sure about that. He raised his head to stare up at the portrait. At first, he had thought that the portrait\u2019s appearance perfectly matched his memories, but now that he took another look, it felt like the portrait seemed more beautiful than the real thing.\u2018...Really now.\u2019The more he continued to look at the portrait like this, the more uncertain Eugene felt. If she had returned without killing the last two Demon Kings, she should have just gotten married, had children, and grown old peacefully surrounded by her grandchildren. So why did Sienna live all by herself for\u00a0over a hundred years?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, Eugene was here to see if\u00a0Sienna\u00a0had left any clues behind. According to his calculations, Eugene believed that it was definitely Sienna who had placed his necklace in the treasure vault.\u2018....Lovellian did say that the memory he read was from a hundred years ago,\u2019\u00a0he recalled.If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t that mean Sienna was still alive one hundred years ago?\u2018No, we can\u2019t say that for sure. It could have been an entirely fabricated memory\u2026. Or perhaps\u2026 the one who left it there was actually Vermouth.\u2019His\u00a0thoughts were spiraling in circles. Eugene took a deep breath and stroked his necklace. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that this had caught his eye, he wouldn\u2019t have been left with such complicated thoughts.\u2018It can\u2019t just be some kind of surprise gift for me, so what on earth were they trying to do with this? Why did they put the necklace there?\u2019While forcing down his inner turmoil, Eugene left the portrait and moved on. Although there were many things to see in this spacious mansion, the most remarkable sight of all was the basement that had been entirely transformed into Sienna\u2019s personal study.Eugene glanced at the bookshelves that were packed with magical texts. Copies of the original texts had been made two hundred years ago and stored here. Although powerful preservation magic had been cast over these books, they were still not allowed to be touched.\u2018There should be something that she left behind\u2026.\u2019There was no way that his reincarnation was a coincidence.His vague suspicions had been confirmed upon finding this necklace from his past life. The necklace hadn\u2019t been registered by the treasure vault\u2019s magic, and a fake memory had even been laid over it.\u2018What are the odds that the necklace just happened to be in the treasury, and I just happened to stumble across it once I entered?\u2019It all sounded impossible. While it was already extremely unlikely for him to have been reincarnated with his memories intact, for him to coincidentally be reunited with a keepsake from his past life?\u2018Something is going on. Someone had a hand in my reincarnation. Was it you, Vermouth? Or could it be you, Sienna? It might even be Anise, but there\u2019s no way it could be that idiot, Molon.\u201dIf someone had planned for him to be reincarnated like this, they would definitely have made other arrangements as well.His soul hadn\u2019t changed at all, despite his reincarnation. Tempest had recognized that Eugene used to be Hamel with only a glance. What if the magic that made use of this fact was cast on the necklace as it lay in the treasure vault? Then wouldn\u2019t it make sense for the necklace to go undiscovered by anyone for hundreds of years, only to reappear in response to Hamel\u2019s \u2018soul\u2019?If the one who had planned for this was Sienna\u2026.\u2018Then she should have left some other clues behind. But where\u2026?\u2019Of course, this conclusion was full of holes. The most obvious being, why use such a convoluted method? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if they had just immediately explained the situation to him as soon as he had gotten hold of the necklace? But if they were using such a cumbersome method, there must have been a good reason for it.However, what on earth could that reason be?\u201cI can\u2019t fucking figure it out\u2026,\u201d Eugene cursed after wandering through Sienna\u2019s study for quite a while.He had traversed through the entire maze of bookshelves, scanning through the titles in the tightly-packed bookshelves. However, he hadn\u2019t managed to find anything.So he left the study and headed upstairs. He took a look in Sienna\u2019s bedroom and the many other rooms as well. But nothing stood out in his sight.\u2018I really have no fucking clue.\u2019As he scratched at his hair in frustration, Eugene stared up at the portrait.\u2018So I guess I\u2019ll just have to do things my way. If there was something that you wanted me to do, you should have at least found a way to tell me properly. If you don\u2019t tell me anything, then how the hell am I supposed to know what you want me to do?\u2019It was frustrating trying to cooperate with some unknown scheme. If there really was some plan in motion, then as long as she hadn\u2019t died yet, they would definitely meet up again someday. Eugene took a quick look around to see if the guards were looking in his direction. Once he confirmed that they weren\u2019t,\u00a0Eugene raised his middle fingers to Sienna\u2019s portrait.\u201cIf that pisses you off, you can come right at me.\u201dIn the first place, he was the one who had been reincarnated, not Sienna.\u201c...As long as you\u2019re alive, that is.\u201dEugene let out a long sigh and turned around.The sun was currently setting, and the sky was getting dark. He had been so focussed on his search that he hadn\u2019t realized how much time had passed.\u201cDid I keep you waiting for too long?\u201d Eugene asked guiltily.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d the guide replied.Even though Eugene said he\u2019d be out in an hour or two, the guide, who had been left waiting outside for twice that time, forced a smile.\u201cIt looks like you really enjoyed the tour,\u201d the guide commented.\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s just that I ended up spending a long time thinking about various things. And it didn\u2019t help that the inside of the mansion was really spacious,\u201d Eugene tried to excuse himself.The guide changed the subject, \u201cYou saw Lady Sienna\u2019s portrait, right?\u201d\u201cYes, it was a really beautiful painting.\u201d\u201cThat beautiful appearance along with her unprecedented magical abilities that would even shame a Demon King\u2026. Lady Sienna could truly be called a goddess of magic.\u201dEugene felt awkward, \u201cWell, calling her a goddess is a bit\u2026.\u201dAnd he didn\u2019t think that her abilities had really been strong enough to put a Demon King\u2019s to shame.\u201cWhere would you like to go now?\u201d the guide asked. \u201cThis is a popular tourist attraction, so there are plenty of great restaurants nearby.\u201dEugene casually pulled out his wallet. The guide\u2019s eyes started sparkling when he saw this.\u201cHere\u2019s a tip,\u201d Eugene said, handing over some money.\u201cThank you so much!\u201d the guide shouted excitedly.\u201cI\u2019m fine with not going to a restaurant, so let\u2019s head straight to the Red Tower of Magic. Once we arrive there, your work is over for today.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dAt these words from Eugene, the guide\u2019s expression stiffened slightly.\u201cYes, sir, please follow me.\u201dSwallowing his jealousy, the guide continued to act professionally. Unlike that foolish eldest son, at least this adopted son had given him more money than he would have been able to earn after months of working as a guide.\u2018...And at least he\u2019s shown that he has true skills,\u2019\u00a0the guide argued to himself.Unlike the eldest son, whose only virtue was being born to the direct line, Eugene had been recognized for his abilities and been adopted into the main family despite being born to a collateral line. The guide took the lead as he used these thoughts to soothe his depressed feelings.\u201cIs it okay if I ask you something?\u201d Eugene suddenly asked.\u201cOf course, as long as it's something that I can answer,\u201d the guide proclaimed.\u201cIt\u2019s about Eward Lionheart.\u201d As they were riding an aerial carriage on its way to the Red Tower of Magic, Eugene casually brought up his name, \u201cHe\u2019s my elder brother, but have you heard of him?\u201d\u201c...Among the younger generation of wizards in Pentagon, there are only a few who don\u2019t know that name,\u201d the guide replied while giving Eugene a nervous look.Noticing his expression, Eugene smiled warmly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nervous. I just brought it up since we\u2019re heading to the Red Tower, and we\u2019re indebted to them for taking care of him.\u201d\u201c...Ah\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201cHasn\u2019t my older brother been staying with them ever since he arrived four years ago? I\u2019m not sure if you know of our family situation, but I wasn\u2019t originally a part of the main family and was instead adopted into it. Just as I was being adopted into the household, Eward left the main estate and headed to Aroth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. Yes, I\u2019m aware of it. It\u2019s quite the famous story.\u201dWas it really that famous? Eugene had been living in the main estate for the past few years, so he was in the dark about the rumors spreading outside.Eugene continued, \u201cThanks to that, I haven\u2019t been able to meet with my older brother, Eward, even once since I was adopted into the family. That\u2019s why I would like to ask, by any chance, have you heard any rumors concerning my older brother?\u201d\u201cAhhh\u2026. Um\u2026,\u201d the guide dithered uncertainly.\u201cAll I\u2019m asking you to do is to tell me any rumors concerning my older brother,\u201d Eugene pressed, his eyes narrowing.The guide\u2019s Adam's apple bobbed as he felt the subtle pressure coming from Eugene.\u201cThe rumors that I\u2019ve been able to piece together about my brother aren\u2019t very substantial,\u201d Eugene admitted. \u201cBut I can roughly tell that there aren\u2019t many good things being said about him. So don\u2019t you think I need to learn a bit more about my brother, just so that I don\u2019t make a mistake when we meet?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. Yes, well\u2026,\u201d the guide still proved hesitant.\u201cOf course, I won\u2019t feel offended by your words, nor will I punish you for any slander. I won't reveal the source of my information to the main family, especially not to my brother. I can swear all this on my family name.\u201dSince Eugene had gone so far as to swear a vow, the guide had no choice but to nod in agreement. Eugene\u2019s gaze was far too piercing for him to try and insist that he didn\u2019t know anything. He had heard that Eugene was currently only seventeen, but how could his gaze be so overbearing? If Eugene were to give them this look, even mercenaries who had wandered the battlefields for decades might run away with their tails between their legs.The guide finally started spilling everything, \u201c...Well\u2026 I also don\u2019t know much about him, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease, speak freely,\u201d Eugene prompted.\u201cAbout Sir Eward\u2026, I\u2019ve heard that he\u2026 that he leaves the Tower of Magic every night to indulge himself in certain forms of entertainment.\u201d\u201cEntertainment?\u201dHow old was Eward again?\u2018He was two years older than me, right?\u2019At nineteen, Eward was at an age where his youthful vitality could keep him up at night.\u201cBy entertainment, do you mean he indulges in alcohol and women? If it\u2019s those sorts of things, isn\u2019t that rather normal for someone his age?\u201d Eugene asked skeptically.The guide hesitated, \u201cUm, no. It\u2019s not that kind of entertainment. This really is just a rumor, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf rumors are spreading, there must be a good reason for it. Stop dawdling and spit it out already. What\u2019s this all about?\u201d\u201c....Su\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said, it\u2019s a succubus,\u201d the guide finally revealed, blushing in embarrassment.\u201cThat crazy bastard,\u201d Eugene growled, his eyebrows shooting upwards in surprise.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 30.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30.1: The Red Tower of Magic (1)Succubi were a species of Night-Demons[1]\u00a0that were so famous almost no one was unfamiliar with them. Of course, Eugene was also well-acquainted with succubi. In his past life, when he and his companions were journeying through Helmuth, those damn Night-Demons would invade their dreams whenever they were tired and exhausted to pull all sorts of shit.\u201cThis isn\u2019t even fucking Helmuth, so why are there succubi here?\u201d Eugene demanded.\u201cPl-please calm down.\u201d Seeing Eugene burst out in a rage, the guide was greatly flustered and raised his hands to form a fragile barrier. \u201cThis might not be Helmuth, but there\u2019s still the Black Tower of Magic, remember? Apart from the human black wizards, there are quite a lot of demonfolk living in the tower as well.\u201d\u201cSo that means that bastard, Eward\u2014no, I mean my big brother, has been playing around with a succubus from the Black Tower of Magic?\u201dEven though it had come from his own lips, Eugene still couldn\u2019t believe what he was saying. That guy was a descendant of Vermouth, the eldest son of the main family\u2026 but he was playing around with demonfolk and a succubus at that?\u201c...That\u2019s\u2026. Strictly speaking, rather than playing around with them\u2026 he\u2019s just being entertained by them\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow is that any different?\u201d\u201cAlthough this might be true of any city, even Aroth has a certain street where illegal gatherings and \u2018those\u2019 sorts of shops operate in the open. To put it bluntly, it\u2019s a place purposely left unsupervised as a form of necessary evil\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo what about it?\u201d\u201cWhile that street is most famous for its black market, there are also a few shady shops that have hired succubi as their hostesses. I\u2019ve heard that Sir Eward visits those types of shops regularly\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat crazy bastard,\u201d Eugene\u2019s tone grew even harsher.Since the guide had mentioned the Black Tower of Magic, Eugene had suspected that Eward might have some kind of relationship with a black wizard to whom the succubus was contracted. But after hearing the full story from the guide, it only made Eugene despise Eward even more.To think that a descendant of Vermouth had gotten entangled in the skirt strings of a succubus and was freely offering himself as sustenance. That alone would have been shameful enough, but she wasn\u2019t just a succubus but\u00a0was actually a hostess.[2]Even calling her a hostess was actually putting it in exceedingly polite terms, as it was clear that the succubi who worked in those sorts of shops were the lowest of the low among the succubi. In human terms, they were no different from street corner whores.\u201cThat crazy, stupid bastard. What the fuck does that still-wet-behind-the-ears brat think he\u2019s doing?\u201dAt these scathing words, the guide couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely flustered once more, because the way Eugene was speaking sounded just like an adult scolding a foolish child.Eugene rounded on the guide, \u201cHas this been confirmed?\u201dThe guide cringed, \u201cNo, well, not really\u2026. It\u2019s just to the extent that there are rumors about it\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you know where that street is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called Bolero Street. Those shops don\u2019t open every day, so the street only shows its true, corrupted appearance once a month, on the night of the full moon.\u201d\u201cGot it,\u201d Eugene growled out a reply between gritted teeth.He had no desire to get all friendly with Eward upon coming to Aroth. He had planned to keep a reasonable distance and basically ignore his step-sibling while focusing on his own affairs.However, now that he had heard this news, he felt a fiery rage ignite inside of him. Eugene\u2019s anger wasn\u2019t because of his attachment to their shared family name of Lionheart. Instead, he just couldn\u2019t accept that a descendant of Vermouth was offering his life force to a petty demon.\u2018How dare he give in to scumbags like those.\u2019Eugene obviously hated the Demon Kings, but he also despised the demonfolk. And if he had to rank who among the demonfolk he hated the most, the succubi would be at the top of his list. There was a simple reason for this. When they were attacked for the first time by succubi in the Devildom, he had experienced a godawful embarrassment.\u2018Whether it\u2019s a succubus or an incubus, any sort of Night-Demon, they all need to be wiped out.\u2019He didn\u2019t even want to recall the embarrassing memories from back then. In any case, Eugene had torn apart countless succubi and incubi in his previous life as revenge for the shame he had been put through.Hesitantly, the guide spoke up, \u201c...Sir Eugene, would you please keep the fact that I shared this story with you a secret\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Didn\u2019t you hear me swear on my name? I\u2019m not going to say anything to anyone, especially not to that fucking big brother of mine.\u201dThey were drawing close to the Red Tower of Magic. Having been distracted by the guide\u2019s worried voice, Eugene gave a vague nod of reassurance before going back to grinding his teeth.\u2018If I could have my way, I\u2019d just grab him by the collar and slap the truth out of him.\u2019But for now, he had only heard rumors, and they were pretty unreliable rumors at that. If he slapped the shit out of Eward just because of some idle tales, Eugene would be the one in the wrong. So he needed to hold back his urge for violence until he had found some clear evidence.\u201c...You said that it opens on the night of the full moon and that it\u2019s called Bolero Street, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got it.\u201dThe aerial carriage landed in front of the Red Tower. Eugene was the first to fling open the carriage door.Turning back, he said, \u201cAh, there\u2019s no need to get off with me since we\u2019ll be parting ways here anyway. Take care, and let\u2019s grab something to drink if we happen to meet in the streets sometime.\u201dSurprised, the guide asked, \u201cW-would you like to take my business card? My name is\u2014\u201d\u201cNow, now, there\u2019s no need for that. I have a good memory. I\u2019ll definitely recognize you if we meet again, so we can each go our own ways from here, and I\u2019ll make sure to say hi the next time I see you.\u201dWaving goodbye, Eugene got off the carriage. The guide\u2019s intentions had been obvious. He had wanted to somehow establish a relationship with Eugene. Because by doing so, he would hopefully get the chance to have his name heard by Lovellian, the master of the Red Tower.But that wasn\u2019t any of Eugene\u2019s business.\u201cMight you be Sir Eugene Lionheart?\u201dA woman standing in front of the entrance to the tall, scarlet tower approached Eugene. Wearing a large, pointed, wide-brimmed hat on top of her magenta robes, she made for quite an impressive sight.\u2018Even three hundred years ago, no one went around dressed so stereotypically like a wizard\u2026.\u2019But trends came and went. Was something like that supposed to be an example of retro fashion? After glancing up at the pointed headwear, Eugene nodded in confirmation.\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cMy name is Hera, and I am a wizard of the Red Tower of Magic,\u201d Hera took off her hat and bowed her head as she introduced herself. \u201cThe Tower Master is waiting upstairs. He planned to be here to greet you personally, but a small problem cropped up that\u2019s keeping him occupied.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d Eugene asked.At this question, Hera revealed a helpless expression. Unable to answer right away, she hesitated momentarily before glancing back at the tower.Tching!A pulse of mana swept from the tower and sent shivers through the atmospheric mana. The sharp, ringing sound set Hera\u2019s shoulders trembling. Eugene also furrowed his brows slightly as he looked\u00a0up at the tower.\u201c...Hm\u2026 there seems to have been some sort of accident?\u201d Eugene observed.\u201c...This is actually rather common,\u201d Hera admitted defeatedly. With a low cough, Hera put her hat back on. \u201cAt the Red Tower of Magic\u2026 well\u2026 we have many wizards who study summoning magic. And among the various different types of magic, summoning magic\u2026 um\u2026 it has the highest risk of failure.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell him that, you should give him a proper explanation,\u201d a voice suddenly interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the risk of failure is high; it\u2019s that they\u2019re trying to fail on purpose. They\u2019re trying to summon something completely different by overloading the summoning circle with mana!\u201dThe owner of this annoyed-sounding voice was Lovellian.\u00a0He opened one of the windows in the tall tower and flew outside.Fwoosh!As soon as the window opened, black smoke started pouring out.\u201cHowever, this is just going too far. It looks like we really have a couple amazing geniuses on our hands. How, just how on earth, did you all manage to summon a Shadowbeast from a circle meant to summon a Lava Shark?\u201dHanging in the midair, Lovellian waved his hand. The Shadowbeast, which had already merged with the darkness of the night sky, was caught by the mana that Lovellian emitted.\u201cYour spirit of creative experimentation is alarmingly amazing. What were you planning to do by summoning a demonic beast that you couldn\u2019t even handle? What do you think would have happened had the Shadowbeast escaped because of your mistake? Thankfully we\u2019ll never know for sure, but over a hundred people could have died before it was caught!\u201d\u201cWe-we\u2019re sorry\u2026.\u201dThe young wizards who followed Lovellian out of the tower kept bowing their heads in apology. However, Lovellian\u2019s rage couldn\u2019t be appeased so easily.\u2018They must be insane,\u2019\u00a0agreed Eugene in disbelief.The Shadowbeast was a demonic beast that stalked the nights in Helmuth. Like most demonic beasts, the Shadowbeasts weren\u2019t fully sentient. Instead, they were equipped solely with an instinct for destruction. If that Shadowbeast had managed to escape into the night sky, it would have immediately started hunting down the capital\u2019s inhabitants.The wizards tried to make excuses, \u201cWe never meant to summon a demonic beast\u2026. We-we just\u2026.\u201d\u201cFrom now on,\u00a0you\u00a0guys can be the Tower Masters of the Red Tower,\u201d Lovellian suddenly declared.\u201cHuh?\u201d the wizards gaped in shock.\u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t be able to summon a Shadowbeast from a Lava Shark\u2019s summoning circle. That would absolutely never happen. So, doesn\u2019t this mean you managed to perform a feat of summoning that even I couldn\u2019t? Since that must mean you\u2019re better wizards than me, you should be the Tower Masters of the Red Tower instead.\u201d\u201cT-tower Master\u2014!\u201d\u201cDo you really think I have stones for eyes? Your summoning circle was flawed from the very start! Even if you make a mistake, you should at least try to get the basics right. This demonic beast could only be summoned if the very foundation of the summoning circle was screwed up!\u201d Lovellian suddenly roared even louder, \u201cPack your bags and leave immediately!\u201dThe\u00a0wizards continued to bow their heads in apology as tears dripped from their eyes. However, Lovellian didn\u2019t change his mind. Tearing his gaze away from the poor wizards,\u00a0Lovellian turned to face Eugene.\u201c...Ahem.\u201d1.

It had turned back into the appearance of the kind young man who had said \u2018Hello children\u2019 with a smile on his face during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony four years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Eugene,\u201d Lovellian nodded respectfully.Although his smiling face was the same as back then, the tone of his voice had changed. This was because Eugene\u2019s station had also changed over the years. Four years ago, Eugene was just one of the several children from common collateral branches. However, the current Eugene was now the adopted son of the Lionheart\u2019s direct line.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot,\u201d Lovellian observed. \u201cHaha, to be honest, I almost didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d\u201cMaster Lovellian hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Eugene complimented the man.\u201cWell, so what. It\u2019s just because I\u2019m holding onto my youth with my magic. After all, isn\u2019t it better to have a youthful appearance than an aged one?\u201dAs Lovellian descended to the ground, he gave Eugene a broad smile. From what Eugene had heard, Lovellian was close to a hundred years old. However, he looked like he was in his mid-twenties at most.\u2018Although he seems different from when I saw him four years ago.\u2019Even then, he had gotten a vague sort of threatening feeling from Lovellian. But because he hadn\u2019t started training his mana sensitivity yet, he hadn\u2019t been able to confirm anything as\u00a0he\u00a0was unable to sense the man\u2019s mana. However, now that Eugene had met Lovellian once more, he now knew for sure.Lovellian was strong.This was actually rather appropriate. As one of Aroth\u2019s five Tower Masters, he should at least have that level of strength.However, Eugene didn\u2019t feel any other sort of impression from Lovellian, just that he was strong. When Eugene recalled the strong men he had met in his previous life, the ones he immediately thought of were those who had given him a unique impression besides their strength.\u2018It looks like he has a long way to go before reaching Sienna\u2019s level,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.Lovellian also examined Eugene in turn,\u00a0\u2018...This is absurd.\u2019Lovellian was astonished at the amount of mana he sensed from Eugene.It was Lovellian who had suggested that Eugene be adopted. He had already noticed Eugene\u2019s potential during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Even after returning to Aroth, he had kept in touch with Gilead and had heard all about Eugene\u2019s accomplishments.He had heard about how Eugene could sense mana in less than ten minutes after entering the Leyline. That was an abnormal level of mana sensitivity. Not only that, but Eugene had also shown monstrous levels of mana affinity that had allowed him to control the mana as soon as he sensed it.Lovellian couldn\u2019t help but feel troubled whenever he heard these stories about Eugene. Of course, this was because of Eward.Eventually, Lovellian said, \u201c...I\u2019ve heard the news from Gilead. So, you are interested in magic?\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cMagic is an extremely engaging field of study. Although it\u2019s just as difficult to learn as it is interesting\u2026. But if it\u2019s you, Eugene, you should be able to do well,\u201d as he muttered this, Lovellian turned his head.He could feel a presence from behind the closed door that barred the entrance to the tower's first floor. He didn\u2019t feel comfortable with how this presence was just lingering there, not daring to open the door. With a click of his tongue, Lovellian shot the door a glance.Creak!The closed door swung open, immediately followed by a sound of gasp. It had come from a skinny young man who was visibly taken aback when the door suddenly opened.It was Eward Lionheart.Eugene wasn\u2019t able to recognize him immediately. After all, four years was an exceptionally long time for children.Eward had grown a lot taller. However, his physique hadn\u2019t grown to match his new height. Eugene glanced at Eward\u2019s barely muscled limbs. He also noted Eward\u2019s dull, spiritless eyes. As for his gray hair, which could be called a symbol of the Lionheart clan along with their sigil\u2026 it looked as dry and lifeless as withered blades of grass.\u2018That fucking bastard.\u2019\u00a0Eugene\u2019s eyes began to burn with an inner fire as he looked at Eward.\u00a0\u2018With an appearance like that, he\u2019s practically bragging about how he\u2019s regularly getting his life-force sucked away by succubi.\u2019Lovellian chided Eward, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least come out to greet your younger brother?\u201d\u201c...Ahem,\u201d with an awkward cough, Eward looked up at Eugene. \u201c...I\u2019m not quite sure what I should say\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, big brother,\u201d Eugene put some force into his voice as he glared at Eward. \u201cLet\u2019s get along well from now on.\u201d\u201cA-alright,\u201d Eward nodded in agreement as he avoided meeting Eugene\u2019s intense gaze. Then, being careful not to draw Lovellian\u2019s ire, Eward slowly began backing away.\u201c...What do you even think you\u2019re doing? If you have nothing else to do, go upstairs and at least read a book,\u201d Lovellian spat out this order as he turned his gaze away from Eward.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Eward was a scion of the Lionheart clan\u2019s direct line, and if it hadn\u2019t been a request from his old friend Gilead\u2026 Lovellian would have never allowed Eward to remain in his tower. It had already been several years since Lovellian had begun experiencing this internal conflict between his friendship with Gilead and his desire to expel Eward.\u201cYes, sir\u2026,\u201d Eward crept away with his shoulders slumped.Without looking at the wretched appearance of Eward\u2019s receding figure, Lovellian let out a long sigh.\u201c...Really now. Please accept my regrets for showing you such shameful sights as soon as you\u2019ve arrived,\u201d Lovellian apologized.Eugene accepted the apology, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cAs for that earlier commotion\u2026 well\u2026 as\u00a0Hera\u00a0has told you, it\u2019s quite a common incident for the Red Tower of Magic. Though a serious disturbance like today\u2019s is rare.\u201d As Lovellian smiled bitterly, he shot a glance at Hera and said, \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard from Gilead that you are unwilling to receive personal lessons in magic from me\u2026.\u201dEugene explained, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to burden you unnecessarily, Head Wizard.\u201d[1]\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. But I just hope that you live up to my expectations, Eugene,\u201d Lovellian admitted.Lovellian appreciated Eugene\u2019s explanation. Although he had already realized this four years ago, the boy in front of him showed a depth of consideration that belied his age.\u2018Though rather than consideration, would it be better to call it calculation\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Lovellian mused to himself. This wasn\u2019t an easy judgment to make. Lovellian didn\u2019t know much about Eugene, nor had they spent much time together.Well, it was fine either way. It was better to be overly considerate than to be shameless despite your lacking ability, and it was better to be calculating than to be greedy and stupid.\u201cI\u2019m not fully confident that I will be able to live up to your expectations,\u201d Eugene replied as he took a step back. \u201cWaving a sword. Thrusting a spear. Swinging an ax. These are the things that I\u2019m most confident in. From a young age, I was sure that I had a talent for these. But magic is a field of study that I have absolutely no experience with\u2026 so I don\u2019t dare to say that I have the talent for it.\u201dThese words also appealed to Lovellian. It showed that Eugene\u2019s mentality was much better than Eward\u2019s, who lacked both motivation and effort.Eugene continued his explanation, \u201cAlso, if I personally learn magic from Master Lovellian, many people will look at the Lionheart clan with dissatisfaction. So, for the time being, I would like to study the field of magic on my own.\u201d\u201c...Very well. Then let\u2019s do it like that,\u201d Lovellian nodded his agreement with a warm smile. \u201cUnless you ask me to, Eugene, I will not interfere with your studies. However, since it will be hard for a beginner to begin studying the field of magic all alone\u2026 if you ever need help, feel free to ask me for assistance at any time.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cHave you arranged for a place to stay?\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t found one yet.\u201d\u201cIn that case, just stay in the tower. It might not be as luxurious as the main family\u2019s mansion, but it\u2019s an adequate place to live.\u201d\u201cIs it okay for me to move in right away?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t.\u201dAt Lovellian\u2019s cheerful answer, Eugene also smiled broadly. Eugene had hoped that he would be able to stay in the tower. That was why he hadn\u2019t even gone looking for a place to stay beforehand.Eugene asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, would it be alright if I take a look at the library first?\u201d1. Tower Master and Head Wizard are both used for the same position of Tower Master. They are sometimes used alternately, specifically when addressing the person in question. Adding this note, in case any of you are confused why Eugene is addressing Lovellian as the Head Wizard.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From what I\u2019ve heard, even the main family has recognized his talent.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he just trying to attract attention by doing that?\u201d\u201cAs a young master of the Lionhearts, he can attract everyone\u2019s attention just by standing there. Why would he feel the need to put on a show like that?\u201d\u201cIt could be possible. After all, he\u2019s only from a collateral line, not a potential heir.\u201dThe young wizards who were currently gathered in the library disliked Eugene. Unlike them, who had entered the Red Tower of Magic after a difficult series of exams, Eugene had been granted entry into the tower just on the virtue of his name as a Lionheart.But they couldn\u2019t express their dissatisfaction directly. Openly criticizing Eugene was the same as criticizing Lovellian, the Tower Master.\u201c...Still, isn\u2019t he at least better than that fool, Eward?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think of comparing the two. Of course, he\u2019s better than Eward. At least this juvenile young master is actually working hard.\u201dEven among these young wizards, many were able to recognize the admirable qualities that a person possessed, despite disliking that person. As they puffed on their cigarettes, the wizards kept glancing at the library\u2019s top floor.On that floor, the seat facing the window was practically Eugene\u2019s exclusive spot, as he\u2019d been the only one using it for the past month. Of course, it wasn\u2019t actually reserved for him, but after Eugene had taken that seat, no one else had dared to sit there.At first, quite a few wizards had approached him with fake smiles. They had all been people who were interested in Eugene\u2019s family name, Lionheart. By getting close to the young seventeen-year-old boy, they were hoping to make connections with the Lionheart Clan.But of course, Eugene had disregarded such attempts.Isn\u2019t the weather today quite pleasant?Isn\u2019t that The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Magic! Man, I also began learning magic using that book when I was young.If it\u2019s alright with you, how about I teach you a bit of magic?Doesn\u2019t it get boring spending the whole day inside the library?Young Master.Since the weather\u2019s so nice, why don\u2019t we take a walk together? I know a really good restaurant\u2026.Whenever these sorts approached, Eugene always gave the same response.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dSince they were always met with the exact same reply no matter what, at some point, these wizards had stopped approaching Eugene, and he was perfectly okay with that.No one would sit near him, so his surroundings were always empty. And on top of the wide desk, the books that Eugene had selected formed several towers circling him. Inside this enclosed space, the only sound that could be heard was that of pages turning.Although there was a smoking area directly below him, only a few floors down, the cigarette smoke didn't rise this high thanks to the magic that partitioned each floor. Due to that, Eugene could concentrate on reading while breathing in the fresh air.It had already been a month since he had come to the Red Tower of Magic.Without skipping a single day, Eugene had visited the library daily. He was in the library from early in the morning and only returned to his room when it was late at night.He wasn\u2019t just spending all his time on magic. He woke up a few hours before he needed to head to the library each day to train his mana, and before going to sleep, he worked out until he was pouring with sweat.Although this reduced his time spent sleeping, Eugene\u2019s gifted body was able to shake off all his fatigue after just a few hours of sleep. With the assistance of mana on top of that, he wouldn\u2019t feel more than a little tired, even if he missed a few days of sleep.\u201c...Yawn.\u201dThe sun was slowly setting.Eugene glanced up at the last rays of sunset shining through the window. After staring out the window for a few moments, Eugene got up from his seat.He gathered the books strewn across the desk and returned them to their original places. There was no aimless wandering, as Eugene clearly remembered where each book had come from.Not only did he recall their original locations, but Eugene had also memorized the contents of each book he had read. Just by lightly retracing his memory, he was easily able to recall everything he had seen on their pages. Despite initially having a poor grasp of magic, Eugene had begun to increasingly understand the field of magic with each book he read.\u2018Even this head of mine proves innately talented.\u2019With a grin, Eugene headed down the stairs. In just a month, he had read all the introductory texts of magic that were stored in the Red Tower of Magic\u2019s library. At first, the books had been so confusing that it had even been painful to just turn the pages, but the more he had read, the more it all began to make sense; and later on, he had even been able to understand the contents of a book just by skimming over it.\u2018Although I\u2019m still only at the theory level for now.\u2019For the past month, Eugene had only been reading books. While this had filled in the holes in his knowledge, he had yet to properly begin practicing magic.He had his reasons. Although it was all lumped together as magic, magic actually came in an infinite variety of forms. The more books he had read in the library, the more Eugene had begun to worry about which method would best suit his body.That was why he had only focussed on reading books.\u2018But now I don\u2019t have anything more to read.\u2019It went without saying that any wizard who had joined the Red Tower had already achieved public recognition of their skills. So the introductory books on magic provided by the tower weren\u2019t meant to be actually used by any of the wizards in the tower and were instead prepared so that the wizards could use them for research and reference.In other words, they were all famous magical texts that had received public recognition for their reliability. Although there were countless introductory books on magic in the world, if you had read all the introductory texts in the tower, there was no need to read any other introductory text.\u2018Now then, shall I give it a go.\u2019As Eugene approached the library's front desk, he spoke up, \u201cI would like to make the attempt today.\u201dThe librarian sitting at the desk raised her head to look up at Eugene and said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201dThe librarian was Hera, the wizard Eugene had met on the first day he had arrived at the tower. While the wizards of the tower were usually immersed in the research that they were currently pursuing, Hera had recently finished a research project and was relaxing while working as a librarian.Lovellian had told Eugene to ask him for advice if he had any questions about magic, but it would be bothersome and awkward for Eugene to approach Lovellian with every trivial question he might have.\u2014If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.Perhaps Hera had also noticed this, as she was the first to approach Eugene and make this offer. Thanks to this, during the past month that Eugene had stayed at the tower, he had received help from her several times and had even gotten to know her quite well.\u201cWhere would you like to do it?\u201d Hera asked.\u201cI\u2019d like to use the basement laboratory,\u201d Eugene answered.\u201cPlease wait one moment. Another librarian should be arriving soon to take over,\u201d Hera said as she began tidying up her desk.While waiting for the replacement librarian, Eugene categorized the magical techniques floating around inside his head.Many wizards had purchased residences outside the tower, but most young wizards stayed within the rooms provided by the tower.This went for Eugene as well. Although he had access to a lot of money, living in the tower was much more convenient than buying or renting a residence. Perhaps because the tower had been used to research summoning magic for so long, there were many different types of familiars taking care of the daily chores inside the tower.The rooms were\u2026 a lot smaller than the annex\u2019s rooms at the main estate. Still, they were spacious enough to comfortably live in by yourself, and Eugene was satisfied with them. There was also no need to go to a restaurant; as long as you told them in advance, the familiars would bring the dishes that you ordered up to your room.If he was forced to pick something that he was dissatisfied with, it would be the lack of a gymnasium. But that still wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker, as one of the many laboratories could substitute for a gymnasium. The only annoying thing was that, since the laboratories on each of the tower floors were reserved for high-ranking wizards, he needed to take an elevator down to the basement to use\u00a0the laboratory there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had wondered if the style from three hundred years ago was back in fashion, but it had turned out that Hera\u2019s tastes were just a bit unusual. Hera was the only one in the tower who insisted on wearing such stereotypical wizard\u2019s clothing.\u201cIt looks like my brother hasn\u2019t shown up today either,\u201d Eugene noted.\u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s just how it is sometimes,\u201d Hera said with a bitter smile as she put on her large wizard\u2019s hat.For the first week following Eugene\u2019s arrival at the tower, Eward had also visited the library, but only for that first week. After that, Eugene rarely saw Eward in the library, and it was even rarer to see him in the hallways.He had heard that Eward had been like this for the past few years.No matter how friendly Lovellian was with Gilead, Eward\u2019s skill fell far too short of the standard for Lovellian to take him as his disciple. It was, of course, for the sake of fairness, but Lovellian also could not risk tarnishing his reputation as the Tower Master.As such, Lovellian had arranged for an idle high-ranking wizard who belonged to the tower to become Eward\u2019s teacher. Not only had he allowed Eward to enter the tower, but Lovellian had also managed to secure him a skilled teacher, so Lovellian had gone above and beyond what his friendship with Gilead accounted for.But Eward remained a problem. After coming to the Red Tower of Magic, Eward had worked hard for about half a year, but after a certain point, he had stopped frequenting the library or the laboratories and instead loitered in his room or outside the tower.\u2018Pathetic bastard.\u2019Eugene knew the reason for this. Three years ago, Eward had taken the recruitment test for the Towers of Magic at Lovellian\u2019s suggestion.The results hadn\u2019t been great. Although he got a pretty decent grade for his theoretical, Eward\u2019s results in the practicals were so terrible that they couldn\u2019t be excused. Due to this, the situation had become awkward and embarrassing, not just for Lovellian but also for all the other wizards who had taught Eward.\u2018If he\u2019s not good enough, he should work even harder. How long does he plan on playing around while living off his family\u2019s money? On top of that, he\u2019s even become a succubus\u2019s lifeforce[1]\u00a0meal ticket.\u2019If he had personally witnessed the scene of Eward being fed on by a succubus, Eugene would have beaten up Eward without any care for the fact that Eward was his older brother or that he was an heir of the Lionheart clan.Eward might be feeling cautious because of Eugene, as he had stayed quietly locked up in the tower on the previous night of the full moon. However, he wouldn't be able to keep this up for long.A few days ago, Eugene had run into Eward in one of the tower\u2019s many corridors. Although his pale skin and dry hair had appeared to be rejuvenated, he was constantly biting his fingernails, and his eyes were clouded. These were signs of withdrawal. It was apparent that Eward would probably go looking for his succubus on the next full moon.As they were heading down to the basement in the elevator, having offered to supply enough of the mana needed to move the elevator for the both of them, Hera spoke up, \u201cI expect that you\u2019re going to be attempting to use the Circles magic formula, correct?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d Eugene confirmed.One of the reasons why the Wise Sienna was so revered in Aroth was because she had systematically established a ranking for the different levels of magical aptitude.Three hundred years ago, the line that separated a good wizard from a great one was still very vague.Powerful and astonishing spells obviously required a lot of mana, so a good wizard must be one who knew how to freely handle enormous amounts of mana. But the way in which they cast their spells also needed to be appropriately difficult and complex.In other words, a good wizard must be someone who was able to control a lot of mana and cast many different spells. This wasn\u2019t incorrect. But if you wanted to be called an Archwizard, it was obvious that not only did you need to know how to cast many different types of magic, but you also needed to be proficient in casting spells so complex that no other wizard would be able to copy you.Three hundred years ago, Sienna created clear divisions between the different stages of magical aptitude. Strictly speaking, Sienna had only devised this system for her own use, but after she became the Green Tower Master, Aroth\u2019s numerous wizards began adopting her system of magic.Sienna\u2019s system was based on the Circles system of magic.This system\u00a0involved guiding the mana inside the body into a circular flow and then allowing this flow to draw out the mana from within the body when a spell was cast. As the amount of mana that a wizard could control increased, their Circle of mana became thicker and stronger.When the amount of mana controlled exceeded what a single Circle could handle, the number of circles increased, and these Circles were able to overlap with each other. Furthermore, each time the number of Circles increased, the amount of mana that could be incorporated into a spell multiplied exponentially, so even a simple spell could have different power levels depending on the number of Circles used to cast it.Three hundred years had passed since then, and now most wizards were first introduced to magic through the Circles magic formula. The only ones who weren\u2019t started on Circles were those who specialized in spirit magic and black magic, as these two forms of magic made use of different magical systems.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any other choice. Although there are other magic formulas besides the Circles magic formula, over these past three hundred years, the Circles have proven to be the most effective and logical system of magic,\u201d Hera said with a prideful expression on her face.Lovellian wasn\u2019t the only one who claimed to be a follower of Sienna. All wizards who used the Circles as their foundational magic formula claimed Sienna as their master.The Red Tower of Magic and the Green Tower of Magic were particularly proud of this heritage.\u201c...I\u2019m considering trying to change things up a bit.\u201d As the elevator arrived at the basement laboratory, Eugene was the first to step off as he admitted these words. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m unsure yet if it will work.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to make some changes? That\u2019s not really\u2026. It doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea,\u201d Hera commented with a worried expression as she followed Eugene out. \u201cCircle adaptation is a research topic that all wizards have tried to investigate at least once. However, Sir Eugene, you haven\u2019t even taken your first steps into magic yet\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to start with the orthodox method first and then study how to adapt the Circles after you\u2019ve reached a certain level?\u201dDespite all these objections, it wasn\u2019t because she thought he was a pretentious child. Hera was genuinely concerned for Eugene. Magic formulas were just as difficult to adapt as they were to create. If he ran out of mana during the attempt, then the magic formula could collapse within him.This could result in him being unable to use mana for the rest of his life or even death. Even if the consequences weren\u2019t that dire, he would still be bedridden for several days.Eugene attempted to reassure Hera, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to tear it apart and redo it from the very start. I promise that it won\u2019t be that dangerous.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, may I please hear what you\u2019re planning to do?\u201d Hera insisted.\u201cI\u2019m planning on combining the Circles with the Lionheart\u2019s mana formula,\u201d Eugene replied without any obfuscation.At these words, Hera was left blinking in shock for a few moments.\u2018...Could there be something off with his real age?\u2019\u00a0Hera couldn\u2019t help but give this thought some consideration.She was well aware that Eugene was so precocious that it was hard to believe he was only seventeen. However, after hearing what was just said, Hera felt a sense of incongruity when she thought about his age.\u201c...Sir Eugene. The mana system used for martial arts and the mana system used for magic are two different paths. Although I don\u2019t know much about the Lionheart clan\u2019s mana formula, does it at least incorporate any concepts related to magical operations or incantations?\u201d Hera questioned patiently.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Eugene admitted.Hera started to lecture him, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it should be impossible to use the Lionheart Clan\u2019s mana system to cast magic. Although you\u2019ll be able to draw out the mana for the spell, unless you shape it according to the principles of magic and trigger it with an incantation, you won\u2019t be able to produce any magical phenomena.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019d like to test combining the two systems,\u201d Eugene insisted despite obediently listening to Hera\u2019s advice.Eugene wasn\u2019t sure that it would definitely work as planned. He had actually asked himself several times, could this really work? But something was telling him that it was possible. To verify this hunch, he had first read all the introductory texts on magic that were stored in the library.\u201cIt won\u2019t be all that dangerous,\u201d Eugene repeated.Hera finally conceded, \u201c...Hah\u2026 for now, why don\u2019t you give it a shot. However, if the mana flow seems dangerous, I will be ready to intervene immediately. If you get injured, Sir Eugene, it won\u2019t just be me who gets in trouble; the Tower Master will also find himself in a precarious position.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dEugene nodded and came to a halt in front of a door. There were actually a lot of laboratories down here in the deep basement of the tower. Having picked the same laboratory that he\u2019d been using over the past month, Eugene opened the door.The inside of the laboratory was extremely spacious. Thanks to advanced space-distortion magic, this basement could contain dozens of laboratories of this size. Although he had felt quite surprised on his first day here, Eugene was now able to calmly stand in the center of the laboratory.1. His vitality is the energy that the succubus feeds on for nourishment.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 31.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31.3: The Red Tower of Magic (2)\u201cI\u2019ll be starting now,\u201d Eugene declared.\u201cAlright,\u201d Hera acknowledged.Hera couldn\u2019t hide the anxious look in her eyes. She quietly summoned her staff and gripped it with both hands. This was so that she could respond immediately in case of an emergency.Eugene was relaxed.\u2018It really is similar to the White Flame Formula.\u2019He was thinking about the Circles. As a system of magic created by Sienna, Eugene was indeed interested in it.Although the two were different systems, they shared the same essence.The White Flame Formula guided mana into the stars around his heart.The Circles guided mana into a circular flow.In the White Flame Formula, whenever there was enough growth, another star split off.With the Circles, whenever there was enough growth, another Circle was formed.\u2018I just have to try and apply them together.\u2019It all made sense to him. Eugene had a good understanding of both methods, and he was personally familiar with the White Flame Formula. As for the mana control that was needed? He\u2019d been continuously refining that ever since his previous life. Although he wasn\u2019t sure if it would work, Eugene felt that it was worth a try.\u2018The Circles can be replaced with the stars. The resonance between the stars can amplify the mana. Depending on the situation, I\u2019ll have to make instantaneous adjustments to the mana. It\u2019ll be a pain if I mispredict it and make a mistake.\u2019This was no ordinary magic formula. Within moments, he could end up drained of all his mana.However, Eugene didn\u2019t hesitate. The mana within his body gathered to his heart. The three stars began to shine and then resonate as they linked up with each other.\u201c...No way,\u201d Hera, who was holding on tightly to her staff, let out a noise of disbelief.Not only could she feel how pure the mana that Eugene had drawn out from his core was, but she could also tell how powerful it was.So this was the descendant of the Great Vermouth, the man known as the God of War and the Master-of-All. The whole world had heard of how impressive the Lionheart Clan\u2019s mana training scripture was. However, wasn\u2019t this going a bit too far? How could a seventeen-year-old youth like Eugene possibly draw out such pure and vast quantities of mana?\u2018Slowly,\u2019\u00a0Eugene reminded himself.Fwooosh!A pure white flame engulfed his entire body. Eugene focussed his concentration as he adjusted the flow of mana. He needed to be conscious of his current limits in controlling his mana, as he couldn\u2019t afford to overdo it. Eugene believed that this was possible because he felt something like this was no different from producing sword-light or sword-force.But now, how should he manifest this mana into a spell? From the depths of Eugene\u2019s memory, he recalled a specific method of processing the spell\u2019s form.\u00a0Incantations didn\u2019t necessarily need to be spoken out loud. The important thing was to have a clear will to trigger the effect of a spell.His mana surged up, but Eugene suppressed it. He continued to adjust the unruly strands of mana. The experience from his previous life gave Eugene as much mana control as he needed.\u2018He has such perfect mana control\u2026. It keeps looking like it\u2019s about to unravel, but it all stays together. Doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s controlling even the smallest particles of mana? Is that even possible at his age?\u2019\u00a0Hera asked herself.The more mana you attempt to control, the weaker your grip on it. That was just common sense.Mana control required not just talent but a lot of experience as well. It was only four years ago that Eugene Lionheart, as a collateral descendant, had first initiated his mana. But he was able to accumulate so much mana in just these four years and attain perfect control over his mana as well? That was just absurd.Right now, Eugene\u2019s mana was so pure and strong that Eward, who had initiated his mana when he was only five years old, couldn\u2019t even compare to him.\u2018...I did hear he was a monster,\u2019\u00a0Hera recalled what Lovellian had told her about Eugene.However, Lovellian wasn\u2019t her only source of rumors regarding Eugene. The Bloodline Continuation Ceremony was a famous tradition of the Lionheart clan. During the three hundred years of the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony\u2019s continued existence, there was only one occasion where a collateral descendant had defeated those from the direct line. Eugene was the only one who had ever qualified to be adopted into the main family through this method.As this incident became widely known, the world had begun to call the still-thirteen-year-old Eugene a monster.Fwooosh!A sphere of flames had appeared in front of Eugene. While staring into it, Eugene slowly began separating the sphere into strands in order to reform it into another spell. He could not allow the mana to completely dissipate and thus disappear, so all his focus was directed toward his mana.The scattered strands of flame began to coalesce once more. Sweat dripped from his forehead and ran down to the end of his chin before falling to the ground. The shape of the coalescing flames had completely changed from the previous sphere.From the 1st Circle\u2019s basic spell, the Fireball, it had been converted into another 1st Circle spell, the Magic Missile. Eugene stared at the completed magic missile floating in front of him.Honestly speaking, it was easier and stronger to just send out a ray of sword-light than it was to go through such trouble for a single magic missile. Or else, he could just summon a spirit of the wind. Either way, it would have been stronger than this clumsy first attempt and much more convenient and familiar to the current Eugene.However, Eugene smiled in satisfaction. Wasn't this a good result for his first attempt? Although the spell wasn\u2019t powerful enough to justify the effort put into it, being able to use magic like this was enough to make Eugene happy.\u2018Because I never got to learn magic in my previous life.\u2019The truth was that Sienna had actually suggested that he learn magic from her several times.\u2014If you really want to, I could teach you some magic.\u2014Don\u2019t need it.\u2014But Vermouth is great at magic. Don\u2019t you want to use magic like Vermouth does?\u2014I can\u2019t surpass Vermouth in the things that I already know how to do, so won\u2019t the difference between us just increase if I act like a know-it-all and start trying to learn magic as well? And also, do you have the confidence to teach me magic that will allow me to beat Vermouth ragged?\u2014...Ummm\u2026.\u2014And seriously, Sienna, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re better at magic than Vermouth, right?\u2014Do you want to die? Don\u2019t compare me to something like him! Does it really make sense to compare Vermouth, who\u2019s as good at fighting as he is at using magic, to me, who only knows how to use magic?\u2014I can\u2019t use magic, and I\u2019m good at fighting, but I\u2019m still not a better fighter than Vermouth.\u2014That\u2019s because you\u2019re an idiot\u2026! I am\u2026 I am better at using magic than Vermouth. It\u2019s just\u2026 well\u2026 we have different specialties. That\u2019s it.It would have been helpful if he had just obediently taken the lessons at that time.\u2018Well fuck, it\u2019s not like I knew that I would be reincarnated.\u2019If he had known that he would be reincarnated, he would definitely have worked hard to learn magic from Sienna. Eugene grinned and tried to move the magic missile around. Although it was slightly clumsy, it gave him a different feeling from when he used the pure mana generated by the White Flame Formula.\u2018It\u2019s also different from sword-light\u2026.\u2019As he considered this, Eugene began to restore his mana through the breathing method.Hera, who had been watching all this with dazed eyes, said, \u201cYou\u2026 you really are amazing.\u201dEven though she had seen it all with her own eyes, she still couldn\u2019t quite believe it. Hera alternated between staring at the sweat-drenched Eugene and the Magic Missile held in front of him.\u2018For a month, he only read the introductory texts on magic\u2026 and this is his first time actually casting a spell. Even if he had learned mana control before this, the mana used in martial arts should be different from the mana used in spells\u2026,\u2019\u00a0Hera trailed off, still in disbelief.What was even more surprising was that Eugene hadn\u2019t verbally let out an incantation. An incantation was the trigger to activate a spell. Although high-ranking wizards could cast magic without incantations, you would need to verbalize it to trigger your magic if you hadn't reached that level.\u2018He was able to silently cast his first attempt at magic. Then, without dispelling it, he changed the mana into a different form.\u2019\u201cSir Eugene,\u201d Hera said with a gulp, \u201cIs this really your first time using magic?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking something like that all of a sudden?\u201d Eugene asked in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019ve arranged all this to surprise me, right? Have you been secretly practicing magic in your room?\u201d\u201cToday is my first time trying it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy would I come up with that sort of lie?\u201dAs he said this, Eugene began moving the magic missile back and forth. It might not be as strong as sword-light, but he liked that it was able to move without any physical actions on his part.\u201cPlease summon a monster for me,\u201d Eugene requested.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hera mumbled in incomprehension.\u201cI\u2019d like to check the power of my spell,\u201d Eugene offered in explanation.Hera hesitated before accepting, \u201cAh\u2026 um\u2026 okay. What type of monster do you need?\u201d\u201cA tough guy, please.\u201d\u201cThen are you fine with a golem? There\u2019s a golem that I\u2019ve just created, so I can summon it immediately without going to get a catalyst.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dWhile chanting her summons, Hera raised her staff. A magic circle was created a little ways away, and mana began to flow into the circle. Before too long had passed, a large golem was summoned from the circle.Hera introduced it, \u201cThe golem is made from\u00a0carbrium. Even without it using any defensive techniques, any attacks against it will have their force scattered on impact.\u201d\u201cSounds great,\u201d Eugene said with a grin.After walking the golem over to stand in front of Eugene, Hera drew back.\u201cPlease attack it,\u201d she called out.\u201cAlright,\u201d as soon as he finished his reply, Eugene threw the magic missile.Bang bang bang!The golem collapsed backward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Indeed, there was a crater there that had been left from the impact.Lovellian looked at it for a moment before chuckling, \u201c...Ho ho. That sure looks like quite a hit.\u201d\u201cIt was his first time casting magic, but it hit dead center,\u201d Hera remarked in amazement.\u201cHow pure was the carbium?\u201d\u201cThe outer surface was completely made of carbium, sir.\u201d\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t cast a defensive enchantment on top of that?\u201d\u201cI hadn\u2019t gotten to it yet.\u201d\u201cIs this really possible?\u201d Lovellian murmured as he traced the scars on the golem with his hand.Although a defensive enchantment hadn\u2019t been cast on it, carbium was a flexible metal that was even able to shed attacks of considerable power. It should be impossible for the offensive spell of a young wizard hatchling, who had just learned magic, to pierce the carbium shell.\u201c...The purity and density of his mana was absurd.\u201d As she recalled the amazement that she had felt at the time, Hera continued speaking, \u201cSo much so that it was hard to believe that he was just a novice wizard. No matter what type of magic he could have chosen to cast, the power of his offensive spell would probably be greater than that of a Third Circle wizard.\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d Lovellian\u2019s brows rose as he gave a low hum.\u00a0\u2018I did hear that Eugene was at the Third Star of the White Flame Formula.\u2019For him to have reached the Third Star at the age of seventeen was unprecedented. If Eugene had ended up not showing any great talent for magic, Gilead had requested that Lovellian persuade Eugene to return to the main estate for further training.\u2018The White Flame Formula creates stars around the heart as a form of Core. The Cores of martial arts and the Circles of magic are different\u2026 but he was able to substitute the mana from a Circle with that of the White Flame Formula all on his own?\u2019That was a monstrous level of talent, to the point where he might actually feel fear instead of admiration. A seventeen-year child had actually been able to showcase such mana control without making any errors and had substituted the mana system from a martial art for that of the Circles.Could a Core really be used for magic? It theoretically wasn\u2019t impossible. Among those rare magic swordsmen whose names were renowned, a few could cast magic using their own unique methods. However, he had never heard of someone using a Core in place of a Circle.In the first place, was there any need for that? A Circle was a Circle, and a Core was a Core. If you wanted to increase your mana control, it was overwhelmingly more efficient to just create a new Circle.\u2018Is the White Flame Formula just that special?\u2019He couldn\u2019t ignore such a possibility. After all, the creator of the White Flame Formula was the Great Vermouth. Vermouth had been known as the Master-of-All as he was equally skilled in magic as he was in martial arts. However, in the present, it was impossible to know for sure whether Vermouth had used Circles to cast magic or a different method entirely.However, following Vermouth, there had never been any other wizard born to the main family who could be called an Archwizard.\u2018At a guess, does the Third Star of the White Flame Formula correspond to a Third Circle wizard?\u2019The\u00a0Wise Sienna had divided the various different spells according to the number of Circles needed to cast them. First Circle wizards could not use Third Circle spells. This was because the mana generated by a First Circle fell far short of the mana needed to cast a Third Circle spell.Of course, this wasn\u2019t an absolute standard. Sometimes, there were a few rare geniuses who could cast high-level magic that exceeded the limits of their own Circle. Lovellian was one such example. When he had reached the Third Circle, he had been able to cast all sorts of magic up to the Fifth Circle.\u201c...Did you say that Eugene has gone out?\u201d Lovellian eventually asked.\u201cYes. He said he had an appointment and left before noon,\u201d Hera replied.\u201cThat\u2019s fortunate,\u201d Lovellian said as he stepped away from the golem.Sitting down at his desk, he looked up at Hera and called, \u201cHera.\u201d\u201cYes, Head Wizard,\u201d she responded.\u201cDo you think it would seem absurd for me to write a letter of recommendation requesting Eugene\u2019s entry into\u00a0Akron?\u201d\u201c...Huh?\u201d Hera\u2019s eyes widened into circles.Akron was the name of Aroth\u2019s Royal Library. Only a few high-ranking wizards of the Towers of Magic, nobles of high status, and members of royalty were allowed entry into that place.As deserving of such a famous library, Akron was filled with magic texts far superior to those found in all the Towers of Magic. Even taking into account the whole of the Red Tower of Magic, fewer than ten wizards were allowed entry in Akron.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026,\u201d Hera hesitated.\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be too unreasonable,\u201d Lovellian murmured as he crossed his arms in thought. \u201cI believe that he deserves the opportunity. At the young age of seventeen, he was able to cast magic with a Core in place of a Circle, and this was as soon as he started learning magic. Furthermore, there wasn\u2019t anyone who taught him any magic, right? Hera, would you happen to have taught Eugene anything?\u201d\u201c...I did answer a few of his questions,\u201d Hera admitted.\u201cWhat sort of questions?\u201d\u201cThey were just questions about the\u00a0basic structures of spells.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you haven\u2019t taught him anything else about magic, correct?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dLovellian unconsciously burst into laughter.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, that means Eugene was able to use magic after only reading introductory texts on magic for a month, and then he was even able to use a Core in place of a Circle. Without any advice from a high-ranking wizard, he was able to do so based purely on his own judgment and knowledge. And the spell that he cast through this method was able to bore a hole through the armor of a\u00a0carbium\u00a0golem,\u201d Lovellian summed up the situation.\u201c...Yes, that\u2019s right, sir,\u201d Hera agreed, still in disbelief.\u201cHera, do you know what we call someone capable of doing such things?\u201d\u201cA genius.\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s a monster,\u201d as he said this, Lovellian waved a finger. A desk drawer popped open, and a blank sheet of paper flew towards Lovellian. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to write Eugene a letter of recommendation. It\u2019s definitely not unreasonable. If he really is a monster of such talent, he should receive the appropriate treatment.\u201d\u201c...I\u2019m afraid that the other wizards might be dissatisfied by this,\u201d Hera brought up hesitantly.\u201cAnd you?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. Because I saw what Master Eugene was capable of firsthand.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t feel dissatisfied because you saw Eugene\u2019s talent. That means that what Eugene has accomplished is just that amazing,\u201d as he said this, Lovellian grabbed a pen and began writing his letter of recommendation on the blank sheet of paper. \u201cIf they\u2019re still dissatisfied once they know the truth, that just means that they\u2019re refusing to acknowledge the facts and are blinded by their jealousy.\u201dOf course, permission to enter Akron could not be guaranteed with Lovellian\u2019s letter of recommendation alone, but that didn\u2019t matter much. If he needed to, Lovellian was prepared to argue with the other Tower Masters; if that didn\u2019t resolve the issue, Lovellian could just personally retrieve any magical texts and lend them to Eugene.\u2018Or else I could have him enter on my behalf as my disciple.\u2019Wouldn\u2019t that actually be the better option? Lovellian considered this seriously as he looked over the letter of recommendation that he had just written.Lovellian suddenly recalled something, \u201c...By the way, what sort of appointment did Eugene leave to attend? There shouldn\u2019t be anyone he\u2019s familiar with in Aroth.\u201d\u201cHe said he was going out to meet a friend,\u201d Hera answered.\u201cA friend?\u201d Lovellian asked.When did Eugene make a friend in Aroth? Lovellian tilted his head in curiosity as he stamped his seal onto the letter of recommendation.* * *Meriden Square, in front of the Green Tower of Magic.A tall statue stood in the center of this square, named after Sienna\u2019s last name. It was a statue of Sienna holding a staff in her right hand and a grimoire in her left.\u2018This one also looks better than the real thing,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought as he looked up at the statue.Just like the portrait, the face of the statue seemed a little more beautiful than the image of Sienna that Eugene recalled. No, maybe it was actually identical to its real-life inspiration? Eugene wondered as he gazed up at the statue\u2019s face.In his memories, Sienna\u2019s face was often showing annoyance. After all, Helmuth was a place filled with all sorts of bullshit, and their journey was also arduous. That damned place was a hell where you couldn\u2019t help but get frustrated.\u2014Please, I\u2019m begging you.\u2014That\u2019s why\u2026 that\u2019s why I told you to just go back. Why did you have to follow us so stubbornly\u2026?But rather than her annoyed expression, the most vivid memory that Eugene had of her was of her crying as tears fell from her reddened eyes\u2026.\u2014Please, you can\u2019t die.\u2014You can\u2019t\u2026 you just can\u2019t. Please, Hamel.The memories at the moment he died were a bit hazy and he hadn\u2019t been able to clearly hear what had been happening around him\u2026. In any case, that was what he believed Sienna had said. Eugene scratched his hand in frustration before venting with a sigh.The statue\u2019s face wasn\u2019t tearful. Instead, it had a confident smile. Eugene recognized that face. The easily-annoyed Sienna used to put on such an expression whenever she had managed to accomplish something great with her magic and turned to look at him smugly.\u201c...I guess it isn\u2019t that different from the real person,\u201d Eugene mumbled as he turned around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So there wasn\u2019t a crazy amount of people packed into the square. Although this was partly because of the extortionate entrance fee, it was also partly because of the fact that such a large statue was easily visible from a distance even if you didn\u2019t enter the square.Eugene sat down on a bench and kept an eye on the entrance to the square. He glanced up at a clock tower in the distance. It was currently noon.\u2018It\u2019s about time he got here,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought.They had promised to meet at noon. There was no way he wouldn\u2019t be able to enter just because he couldn\u2019t pay the entrance fee, right? Could it be that the road was blocked because there were too many people?\u2018I guess not,\u2019\u00a0Eugene realized as he spotted something.Eugene had just noticed a large figure towering over the rest of the crowd. Despite his size, there was no need for the figure to push people out of his way. The people in front of him were intimidated by his large size and got out of his way of their own volition. Thanks to this, the giant was able to enter the square before too long.Eugene got up from his bench. The giant slowly drew closer.\u201cI almost can\u2019t believe it\u2019s really him,\u201d Eugene sincerely muttered to himself.The giant figure was Gargith Lionheart. It was the first time they had seen each other since the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony four years ago, but this guy\u2019s growth was unbelievable.\u201cEugene?\u201d Gargith called out.\u201cIs that really you, Gargith?\u201d Eugene asked as he looked up at Gargith.It seemed like Gargith\u2019s height was now over two meters. Although his body had already been quite large when they had last met. Gargith had now grown tall enough to completely tower over Eugene. The button stretched tight over his bulging pectoral muscles was trembling dangerously.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Gargith confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Gargith Lionheart. Have you already forgotten my name?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s not that I\u2019ve forgotten it, but\u2026 you\u2026 are you really eighteen?\u201d Eugene felt the need to ask.Although Gargith\u2019s build was already shocking enough, the most surprising thing was that shaggy beard of his. Was it really possible for him to grow such a beard when Gargith was only eighteen? Eugene stroked his own cheeks, which were still smooth and silky.\u201cI\u2019ve heard many people say that I look older than my real age,\u201d Gargith admitted.\u201cYou don\u2019t look that old, but\u2026 why is your beard so shaggy? You should trim it a bit. It looks scruffy,\u201d advised Eugene.\u201cIt\u2019s not scruffy. It\u2019s manly.\u201d\u201cEven without a beard, you already look pretty manly.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment,\u201d Gargith said with a grin.He reached out to Eugene with one of his large hands, offering a handshake. When Eugene accepted the handshake, Gargith gripped Eugene\u2019s hand and vigorously shook his arm up and down as if he\u2019d been looking forward to doing so for quite some time.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not as much as I have, you\u2019ve also grown a lot,\u201d Gargith observed.\u201c...It\u2019s just that you\u2019ve grown stupidly big,\u201d Eugene retorted.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s slightly disappointing\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cI could tell from holding your hand just how much you\u2019ve trained your body during these past four years\u2026. However, that still isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cWell, for now, why don\u2019t you let go of my hand.\u201dShaking their clasped fists, Eugene pulled his hand free.However, Gargith didn\u2019t stop talking, \u201cAlthough your physique has greatly improved compared to four years ago, it still isn\u2019t good enough. Have you been neglecting your training?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Eugene demanded.\u201cI only sleep four hours a day,\u201d Gargith bragged proudly.What was this bastard suddenly talking about? Eugene narrowed his eyes, having forgotten their previous conversation from four years ago.Gargith threw back his shoulders and continued speaking, \u201cExcept for the time spent sleeping, all my time goes to training. My own personal tableware has had its weight increased by magic, as well as everything else I use, and even my clothes have had their weight increased.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 is that so,\u201d reacted Eugene blandly.\u201cThe same goes for my underwear.\u201d\u201cHow impressive of you.\u201d\u201cThis body of mine has been created through constant discipline and hard work. Of course, just because you increase the amount of weight you can hold doesn\u2019t guarantee that your muscles will get bigger. You need sufficient training, proper rest, as well as\u00a0this,\u201d Gargith placed a hand into the inner pocket of his coat. \u201cOur family\u2019s revolutionary muscle growth agent.\u201dHe pulled out what looked like a small potion. After looking down at the potion with proud eyes, Gargith offered it to Eugene, \u201cI\u2019ve brought some here for you.\u201dEugene bluntly rejected the offer, \u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cWhy not? Lord Gerhard\u2019s weight loss and muscle growth are all thanks to receiving help from our family. Weren\u2019t you aware of that already?\u201d\u201cNow that you\u2019ve brought it up, please stop trying to send me those strange drugs through my father.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to give them to you personally. It doesn\u2019t matter if you drink it before a meal, so have it.\u201d\u201cI told you, I\u2019m not going to drink it.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you just don\u2019t understand\u2026. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve reached the Third Star of the White Flame Formula. Although that\u2019s an impressive achievement, in addition to training your mana, you shouldn\u2019t neglect training your body.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take your advice into consideration, so just keep your shady drugs to yourself.\u201dEugene ultimately managed to refuse the potion.Unwilling to keep listening to Gargith prattle on about his muscles, Eugene prompted Gargith, \u201cSo why did you ask to meet? You can\u2019t really have come all this way to Aroth just to try and force that drug of yours onto me.\u201dHe had received a letter from Gargith a few days ago. It had said that, since Gargith was heading to Aroth for specific reasons, they should meet in person after so long.\u201cThere is something else that I have to do,\u201d Gargith confirmed.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cRemember what I told you a long time ago? Our family\u2019s revolutionary muscle growth agent was created by a famous alchemist of Aroth,\u201d Gargith said as he returned the potion to his inner pocket with a reluctant heart. \u201cHowever, now that my body has grown, the current mixture can no longer meet my requirements. When I informed the alchemist of this, he told me that he would adjust a new mixture to suit my body\u2019s needs.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re here to meet the alchemist?\u201d Eugene checked.\u201cThat\u2019s my main task, but there are a few other things as well.\u201d\u201cLooks like you have a lot on your plate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Aroth is so far away. Since I\u2019m already here, I might as well make sure that the time spent traveling here and back isn\u2019t wasted.\u201dEvery time Gargith took a step, the ground seemed to shake slightly. When Gargith approached him, Eugene backed away slightly.\u201cWhy are you avoiding me?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cYou\u2019re giving off body odor,\u201d Eugene complained.\u201cThis isn\u2019t body odor. It\u2019s the scent of a man.\u201d\u201cJust put on some cologne.\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying the same thing as Dezra\u2026?\u201dEugene changed the subject, \u201cIn any case, what other tasks do you have?\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Gargith didn\u2019t reply immediately, instead glanced at his surroundings.The other people in the square were looking in their direction. Although he wasn\u2019t wearing the formal dress of the Lionheart Clan, Gagith was so gigantic that the crowd\u2019s gazes couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to him.Gargith lowered his voice and asked, \u201c...Do you know anything about Bolero Street?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d Eugene answered.It was the place where that spoiled bastard, Eward, went to play around.\u201cHave you also heard that there\u2019s an auction house there?\u201d Gargith continued.Eugene hesitated, \u201cRoughly speaking, yes. Is there something that you want to buy from there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that the testicles of a giant will be revealed at the latest auction.\u201d\u201cTest\u2026 What?\u201d\u201cA giant\u2019s testicles.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to buy a fucking thing like that?\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you aware? The testicles of a giant have great magical value.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not the type who would want to buy those testicles for fucking magic, no?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m thinking of handing those testicles to the alchemist.\u201dIf it was giants that they were talking about, Eugene was also well aware of them. They were just as rare as elves, but their inclinations ran the exact opposite to the elves. Three hundred years ago, their entire species had sworn allegiance to the Demon King of Destruction.Although their journey hadn\u2019t been able to reach the Demon King of Destruction in the end\u2026\u00a0while\u00a0they were wandering around Helmuth, Hamel and his party clashed with the giants a few times. The giants were able to resist any amount of magic with just their bare bodies and could even collapse mountains by merely shouting.\u201cLet\u2019s go there together,\u201d Gargith suggested.\u201cGo where?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about the auction house. Although I\u2019ve brought a lot of money, it still might not be enough to win the bid.\u201d\u201cSo you want me to lend you money?\u201d\u201cI swear on my name that I\u2019ll pay you back with interest.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t wanna.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m even willing to beg you on my knees.\u201dGargith\u2019s body started to bend down. Eugene paled and quickly grabbed him by his shoulders.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve got it, so don\u2019t do something so eye-catching. Moreover, what\u2019s with a big-boned bastard like you kneeling so easily,\u201d Eugene demanded in a fluster.\u201cThanks,\u201d Garghith said calmly.\u201cWhat are you thanking me for? For agreeing to lend you money?\u201d\u201cIt was for calling me big-boned. Wasn\u2019t that a compliment?\u201dNo matter which angle you looked at him from, Gargith really did seem like a descendant of Molon.\u201cApart from the giant\u2019s testicles, I\u2019ve heard that many other items will be revealed,\u201d Gargith shared.\u201cOh, is that so,\u201d remarked Eugene disinterestedly.\u201cAren\u2019t you at all interested in it? Then again, you do have Wynnyd already, so you probably can\u2019t lower yourself to look at ordinary weapons.\u201d\u201cApart from the Auction House, there is someplace else in Bolero Street that interests me,\u201d Eugene said as he walked ahead of Gargith.It wasn\u2019t because he thought any further conversation was pointless; it was just that Gargith\u2019s body odor was far too strong.Openbookworm's ThoughtsGargith:\u00a0\u201cThis body of mine has been created through constant discipline and hard work. Of course, just because you increase the amount of weight you can hold doesn\u2019t guarantee that your muscles will get bigger. You need sufficient training, proper rest, as well as this.\u201dEuguene: \u201cI\u2019ll take your advice into consideration, so just keep your shady drugs to yourself.\u201dOBW: Oh no, here comes the mlm pitch.dMomo: Gargith and Eugene's interactions are pure goldYojj: note to self: never drink water while reading this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The next full moon would be in one week.Eugene gave up on trying to understand Gargith. He was already so big that it seemed like overkill, but to think that he still wasn\u2019t satisfied with that and was planning to buy some giant\u2019s testicles to chow down on.\u201cI\u2019m not going to chow down on them,\u201d Gargith insisted earnestly.\u201cThen how are you going to eat them?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cRather than eating them directly, they have a much better effect after being made into a medicine.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re planning to grind them up and drink them.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you some as well.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want any.\u201d\u201cWhy not? According to what I\u2019ve heard, the testicles of the giant species are very beneficial for increasing stamina, as well as muscle growth.\u201d Gargith\u2019s sincere eyes showed how seriously he had done his research. As he cut into his plate of lean meat, he continued speaking, \u201cThey also contain plenty of mana. All of this means that the testicles are a precious supplement that you might not be able to buy even if you wanted to.\u201d\u201cYou should take the whole lot,\u201d Eugene offered generously.Although he knew that they were a supplement that would greatly benefit his body, Eugene absolutely rejected the idea of eating a giant\u2019s testicles. Even though you wouldn\u2019t be able to detect its unsightly original appearance once it was made into a potion, it wasn\u2019t so easy to change your perception of it.Gargith sighed, \u201cI just can\u2019t understand you. Even the popular healing potion uses the heart and blood of a troll as its ingredients. Mana potions also use mana stones and other monster materials as their ingredients.\u201d\u201cBut those aren\u2019t testicles,\u201d Eugene pointed out.\u201cThe testicles of animals are often used as high-quality ingredients.\u201d\u201cSince you like them so much, you can have them all.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t regret this later,\u201d Gargith warned.\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Eugene muttered as he sipped his tea.\u201c...But why do you need to disguise yourself?\u201dHaving finished eating, Gargith asked this question as he sipped on a cup of egg whites like it was just an ordinary drink.Eugene resisted the urge to comment on this and explained, \u201c...It will draw a bit of attention if a scion of the main family is seen wandering into such a shady street.\u201d\u201cHm, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cWell, even if the street has received tacit approval from the officials, nothing can be gained from pointlessly getting into a scandal.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got the right idea,\u201d Gargith said admiringly as he nodded in agreement. \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t intend to participate in anything shameful by going down that street, there\u2019s no need to create an unnecessary scandal. Especially since such a scandal will affect the dignity of your house.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; our dignity,\u201d Eugene slightly drew his head back as he agreed with Gargith.Although Eugene also had a good appetite, it was nothing compared to Gargith. Having devoured several chunks of lean meat, Gargith was currently downing several glasses of completely unseasoned egg whites. Thanks to that, the fishy smell of raw eggs was wafting uncontrollably from his mouth.\u201c...Brush your teeth after you\u2019re done eating,\u201d Eugene requested.\u201cDon\u2019t insult my sense of hygiene,\u201d Gargith protested defensively.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Just make sure to brush your teeth. And spray some cologne as well.\u201d\u201cI am not ashamed of my body odor,\u201d Gargith insisted. \u201cBy the way, do I need to put on a disguise as well?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026,\u201d Eugene\u2019s expression twisted as he considered this.He had been planning to just cover himself up with a robe, but with how burly Gargith was, that wouldn\u2019t be enough to solve the issue.Eventually, he decided, \u201c...You probably don\u2019t need a disguise.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cBecause that big bulk of yours is impossible to hide, no matter what we do.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Gargith replied with a smile.It seemed that he had once again taken the observation of his large frame as a compliment.\u2018It won\u2019t matter since he\u2019ll be stuck in the auction house anyway,\u2019\u00a0Eugene comforted himself.Eugene was the only one who needed a disguise. He was certain that Eward would be heading to Bolero Street on the night of the next full moon. Since he already seemed to be suffering from nervous anxiety due to his succubus addiction, it was obvious that Eward didn\u2019t have the\u00a0strength of will\u00a0to overcome the withdrawal symptoms.\u2018If he had had that kind of strong will in the first place, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up in such a state.\u2019But something was bothering Eugene.With the signs of lifeforce drainage being so obvious, and since there were even rumors flying around about it, there was no way that Lovellian was ignorant of Eward\u2019s behavior. Could it be purposeful neglect? No, there didn\u2019t seem to be any reason for that. For now, he should try to hear Lovellian\u2019s side of the story. With this thought, Eugene got up to leave.\u201cI\u2019m heading back,\u201d he informed Gargith.\u201cAlready? I\u2019ll be working out soon, so how about we train together? If we visibly compare our bodies, you\u2019ll be able to clearly see the difference between you and me,\u201d Gargith suggested.Eugene waved him off, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cHold on,\u201d Gargith barked out forcefully.Pushing the dishes on the table to one side, he drew himself to his full gigantic height. Then, placing both hands on his waist, he took a deep breath, threw his shoulders back, and pumped up his chest muscles.Pop pop pop!The buttons on his shirt, which had already been straining, were sent flying off like bullets. Having torn his shirt into shreds, Gargith flexed his upper body muscles as he sat down.\u201cLet\u2019s arm-wrestle,\u201d Gargith challenged Eugene.After getting over his surprise, Eugene eventually asked, \u201c...Why?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to arm-wrestle with you since four years ago,\u201d Gargith said, his eyes sparkling. Then, placing one of his giant arms on the table, he took up an arm-wrestling pose. \u201cWithout using any mana, let\u2019s compete purely with the strength of our muscles.\u201dHis words sounded absurd. However, Eugene didn\u2019t refuse and took the seat across from Gargith.\u201cSince it\u2019s boring to just do it like this, let\u2019s place a bet on it,\u201d Eugene suggested.\u201cWhat kind of bet?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cIf I win, you need to put on some cologne whenever you head out. And you also need to stop peddling your muscle-growth drug to me.\u201d\u201cFine. But if I win, you need to do me a favor without asking any questions.\u201dGargith bared his teeth in a challenging grin. When Eugene took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves, Gargith glanced at Eugene\u2019s bare forearms.\u2018Quite impressive\u2026. However, it\u2019s still not enough,\u2019\u00a0Gargith thought, sure of his victory.Two hands, which had an overwhelming difference in size, met across the table.Gargith clarified the rules, \u201cLet\u2019s start on the count of three.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Eugene agreed readily.\u201cAre you okay with me calling out the count?\u201d\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\u201cThen one, two\u2014\u201dCreak.Gargith began tensing up his muscles. Eugene immediately began sharpening his senses while keeping his own muscles relaxed.\u201cThree.\u201dBang!The results were decided in an instant. Gargith looked down at his hand in disbelief. His tensed and bulging muscles had been pushed down before they could even properly release their strength. From the moment that the count had ended, the speed of Eugene\u2019s reaction had rendered his strength useless. Instead, his overly large muscles had only contributed to the speed with which his arm hit the table.\u201cIt\u2019s my win,\u201d Eugene declared as he immediately stood up and began pulling on his coat.\u201c...How did you win?\u201d Gargith asked, dumbfounded.\u201cTechnique, timing, and sense.\u201dEugene patted Gargith\u2019s shoulder as he passed him on the way out.\u201cNext time, remember to spray on some cologne before arriving.\u201dWith this parting shot, Eugene immediately left the restaurant\u00a0without looking back.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since he intended to ask about Eward, this worked out perfectly for Eugene.\u2018Now that I think about it, this will be my first time visiting the Head Wizard\u2019s room.\u2019As befitting his position as the Tower Master, Lovellian was allowed to occupy the entire top floor of the tower. Without an invitation from the Tower Master, no matter how much mana you poured into the elevator, it would be impossible to rise to the top floor.\u2018I can probably guess why he\u2019s calling me,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought.It should be because of the spell that he had cast in front of Hera. At that time, Hera had been about to faint in astonishment at the sight of the golem that she\u2019d been so proud of collapsing onto its back.Although it wasn\u2019t as much as her, Eugene had also been alarmed. Even though he\u2019d never heard of a metal like carbium in his previous life, in any case, he knew that he\u2019d managed to knock over a golem that had been constructed from such a sturdy material with the first spell that he had ever cast.This meant that the power of his spell was stronger than Eugene had expected. Truthfully speaking, he hadn\u2019t held high expectations for it, as it was his first time trying it out, but with a power like that, it felt like his spells were ready to be used in actual combat. As long as he became more accustomed to casting magic and the number of spells he could cast increased, Eugene felt like he\u2019d be able to do a lot of fun things.\u2018But it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll call me up just to compliment me,\u2019\u00a0Eugene continued his guesswork.It felt like he was about to receive some sort of present. Eugene trusted his gut instinct, and such a foreshadowing left him grinning widely.Eugene stepped out of the elevator and took a few steps down a corridor. Through the wide-open doorway at the end of the corridor, he could see Lovellian getting up from his desk. The man greeted Eugene with a friendly smile.\u201cDid you have any difficulties getting here?\u201d Lovellian asked politely.\u201cIf I had known that you were looking for me, I wouldn\u2019t have gone out in the first place. My apologies,\u201d Eugene returned the pleasantries.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say something like that. After all, I\u2019m the one who called for you so suddenly. To start with, please feel free to take a seat.\u201dNow it wasn\u2019t just a feeling; Eugene was confident in his hunch. Lovellian\u2019s voice was overflowing with appreciation.\u2018Let\u2019s ask about Eward after receiving whatever the gift is,\u2019\u00a0Eugene decided.Although it wasn\u2019t Eugene\u2019s intention to do so, Lovellian might feel like he was being interrogated upon listening to such questions. He might be a member of the Lionheart clan\u2019s main family, but it was still disrespectful of Eugene, who was many years younger than Lovellian, to question the man about this and that.\u2018...How old was he again?\u2019\u00a0Eugene tried to recall.\u00a0\u2018I think I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s close to a hundred\u2026.\u2019Even after adding the years from his previous life to his current age, Eugene was still younger than Lovellian. Just thinking about it that way gave Eugene a strange feeling. Of all the people that Eugene had met so far, Lovellian was the only one who was truly older than him.\u201cUm\u2026. By the way, may I ask why I was summoned?\u201d Eugene decided to stick to this question for now.He believed that there was no need for him to pointlessly report on how he was adapting to life in the tower. Since, in any case, everything that happened within the tower was already reported to Lovellian.\u201cFirst of all, please take a look at this,\u201d with a flick of Lovellian\u2019s finger, the letter of recommendation popped out of the drawer and flew over to Eugene.\u201c...A letter of recommendation?\u201d Eugene\u2019s eyes widened into circles as his gaze fell to the letter.\u2018It\u2019s for Akron? No way,\u2019\u00a0Eugene struggled to contain his surprise.Even Eugene was familiar with that name. The prestigious Royal Library had already been famous three hundred years ago. It was the place where the essence of Aroth\u2019s prided magic was stored. No matter how vast the array of magical books possessed by the Towers of Magic was, in terms of quality, it couldn\u2019t compare to the collection in Akron.\u201c...I think this is too much of an honor for me to accept at the moment,\u201d although Eugene wanted to jump into the air and cheer in joy, for now, he decided to hold back and check the situation.And these words weren\u2019t completely insincere. Even three hundred years ago, Akron had enjoyed a high status, so it wasn\u2019t a place that anyone could just enter.\u201cI don\u2019t share your thoughts.\u201d Lovellian continued speaking with a shake of his head, \u201cInstead, I believe that now is exactly the right time for you to enter Akron, Eugene.\u201d\u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cBecause you have yet to venture deeply into learning magic, young Eugene,\u201d Lovellian explained.\u201cIsn\u2019t that more reason why entry into Akron should be out of my reach?\u201d\u201cNot at all. Since you haven\u2019t ventured deeply into learning magic, you still have a lot of possibilities lying ahead of you. Replacing a Circle with a Core\u00a0\u2014\u00a0although it\u2019s easy to put into words, it should still be impossible for someone your age. However, you, Eugene, managed to accomplish it.\u201dEugene was worried about what kind of expression he should show. Should he smile and show confidence? Or should he be humble instead?\u201c...Thank you very much,\u201d Eugene said, eventually deciding on both.Eugene bowed his head respectfully but still revealed his excitement through his twitching fingers and made a show of hiding his proud smile.Lovellian gave Eugene some advice, \u201cThere are many exceptional magical books in Akron. Although it might be impossible for you to benefit from them immediately, as long as you keep reading them and storing their contents in your head, you will be able to broaden your knowledge base. That knowledge will one day become the foundation that will allow your magic to truly shine, Eugene.\u201dCalling Akron\u2019s collection of magical books exceptional was actually downplaying it. In the halls of Akron, ancient magic passed down from the mythical era was stored along with the writings of the sages whose names had received the highest of acclaims throughout Aroth\u2019s long history.\u201c...There is something I\u2019m curious about.\u201d After some hesitation, Eugene continued speaking, \u201cDoes Akron also have books written by Lady Sienna?\u201d\u201cOf course it does,\u201d Lovellian confirmed with a proud smile. \u201cAlthough there are books authored by Sienna in both the Red Tower of Magic and the Green Tower of Magic, one of the original three volumes of\u00a0\u2018Witch Craft,\u2019\u00a0which Sienna wrote in her later years, is stored in Akron.\u201d\u2018Witch Craft\u2019\u00a0was considered one of the most significant series of books in all of Aroth\u2019s history. The wise Sienna had summed up all of her magical knowledge and divided the essence of her wisdom into these three volumes. As a result,\u00a0\u2018Witch Craft\u2019\u00a0was considered a national treasure of Aroth, and no other copies were allowed to exist.Lovellian reflected on the books, \u201cAlthough the only volume available for public viewing is the first book in the trilogy, that volume alone will impart knowledge that you won\u2019t be able to find in any other magical text. In my case\u2026. Haha. When I first read the first volume of\u00a0\u2018Witch Craft,\u2019\u00a0I realized that all the magic that I had learned in my life up until that moment was all just child\u2019s play.\u201d\u201c...Ah\u2026!\u201d Eugene breathed in surprise.\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t guarantee that this letter of recommendation can be exchanged for an entry pass into Akron, I first wanted to hear your opinion, Eugene. Are you alright with me submitting a letter of recommendation on your behalf?\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s fine with me. However, I\u2019m still a bit concerned that my own inadequacies will cause trouble for the Tower Master.\u201d\u2018Of course, it\u2019s fine with me, you bastard. Why ask such an obvious question?\u2019\u00a0Eugene kept bowing his head deeply without allowing his true thoughts to escape his lips.\u201c\u2018Cause trouble\u2019 you say\u2026. Haha! Don\u2019t worry about that. Something like this won\u2019t cause me any trouble at all,\u201d Lovellian said with a wry smile.There were some unidentified emotions lingering behind Lovellian\u2019s voice, and he seemed to be holding back a sigh. Eugene lifted his head slightly to glance up at Lovellian\u2019s expression.\u201c...Master Lovellian,\u201d Eugene called out hesitantly.\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d Lovellian responded.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 I have something that I need to talk to you about concerning my older brother, Eward.\u201dEugene had checked the letter of recommendation and received Lovellian\u2019s promise that he would submit it for Eugene. At this point, it didn\u2019t seem like Lovellian would go back on his words just because he got a little offended. The man sitting in the Tower Master's seat wouldn\u2019t be that petty.Eugene continued speaking, \u201cFrom the first day I came to Aroth\u2026 I happened to hear a certain story. It was about how Eward hasn\u2019t been focussing on practicing magic and is instead going into some shady street to partake in the nightlife.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026,\u201d Lovellian sighed.As expected, Lovellian was already aware of Eward\u2019s misdeeds.\u201cAlthough I might not be a true sibling of Eward, as a relative who shares the same last name as him, I am worried about Eward. Even those back at the main estate\u2026 the Patriarch and his wife, are also extremely concerned about Eward,\u201d persuaded Eugene.\u201cThis is\u2026 I\u2019m not sure how to put it into words,\u201d Lovellian wasn\u2019t able to continue speaking immediately and instead scratched his head in frustration. \u201cEugene. How much do you know about Eward\u2019s affairs?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s become acquainted with the succubi who\u00a0work\u00a0in Bolero Street.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, that is the truth,\u201d Lovellian admitted with a short sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve also known about it, and I\u2019ve even warned him a few times. But I\u2019ve been unable to prevent Eward from indulging in that debauchery.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene waited for an explanation.\u201cSuccubi\u2026 are a famous breed of Night Demons. In the past, before Helmuth was opened up, many people had died because the succubi drained all their lifeforce.\u201dEugene was already very familiar with these facts.\u201cHowever, with the opening up of Helmuth, the attitudes of the Demon Kings and their demonfolk subjects underwent a lot of changes. The same goes for the succubi. While they still absorb lifeforce, they don\u2019t kill people like they used to. It has been strictly forbidden by the Queen of the Night Demons who resides in Helmuth.\u201d\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make my brother\u2019s lustful affairs appropriate,\u201d argued Eugene.\u201cYes, you\u2019re right, of course,\u201d Lovellian halted his words for a moment. He stared at Eugene with a bitter expression before continuing, \u201cPlease have a little sympathy for Eward.\u201dStunned, Eugene responded, \u201c...Huh?\u201dLovellian reminisced, \u201cFour years ago, Eward left the main estate to arrive in Aroth. He came to Aroth with a lot of expectations, but\u2026. Unfortunately, Eward\u2019s talent failed to live up to his own\u00a0hopes and\u00a0expectations.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene listened patiently.\u201cEward experienced a lot of setbacks. Samuel and I\u2014ah, Samuel is the wizard who taught Eward\u2014in any case, Samuel and I did our best to help Eward overcome the frustration from these setbacks but\u2026 unfortunately, it didn\u2019t go so well.\u201dEven though he lacked the necessary talent, they made it possible for Eward to stay in the tower. Moreover, they didn\u2019t spare him any advice on magic, and he had even received their personal instruction, along with recommendations to several useful magical texts.\u201cDiscipline is something that needs to be cultivated on one\u2019s own. Relying on the\u00a0urgings\u00a0of those around you is not enough to keep you focused on what you should be doing. Moreover, with his status, Eward couldn\u2019t help but be weighed down by many expectations.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene\u00a0continued to hold his tongue.\u201c\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to give him some time to catch his breath\u2026.\u2019 That\u2019s what we thought at the time. We were trying to be careful not to overdo his instruction. Without such care, Eward may have already collapsed.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t comprehend what Lovellian was saying. Eugene had also lived in the main estate for the past four years. So he knew just how high-strung Tanis was and was also well aware of how sly Ancilla could be.Cyan and Ciel had been born with both talent and ambition. Those two wished to become the next Patriarch or Matriarch because they wanted to meet the expectations of those around them and also fulfill their own desires.But what about Eward? He had heard that Eward had lacked initiative from a young age, and he was more interested in magic than he was in training his martial arts. Ever since the birth of Cyan and Ciel, Tanis had constantly been reminding her son of his position as the eldest heir. Upon having his hopes for Aroth betrayed, Eward had decided not to return to the main estate, probably because he felt it was still better to live in Aroth than to return to that suffocating main estate.Eugene still couldn\u2019t accept Eward\u2019s actions,\u00a0\u2018No matter what, a succubus is still a bit too much.\u2019Although he understood that Eward\u2019s situation was pitiful, getting involved with a succubus was going too far. Demonfolk, who had changed their attitudes and put smiles on their faces, were still demonfolk. They would never be able to peacefully coexist with humans. Eugene\u2014no, Hamel was all too aware of this fact.\u201cI understand,\u201d Eugene said, nodding his head.\u00a0\u2018For now, I\u2019ll need to take a look personally.\u201dDespite understanding that Eward\u2019s situation was pitiful, Eugene still couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to the means he used to release his tension.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 34.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34.1: Bolero Street (1)Night Demons liked to invade the dreams of humans.Unlike reality, anything was possible within dreams. No matter how miserable your reality was, in your dreams, you could achieve whatever happiness you desired.Even if you aren\u2019t able to eat anything right now, in your dreams, you were able to taste all of the world\u2019s delicacies. Even if you didn\u2019t have a penny in your pockets, in your dreams, you could live in a mansion full of gold and silver treasure. Whether it\u2019s dead family members, friends, or lovers, even if you couldn\u2019t meet them in reality, in your dreams, you could even make new memories with them.You could do anything you wanted in your dreams.Your dreams could be filled with eternal happiness and joy.That was why they were called dreams.Even among the demonfolk, the Night Demons were particularly nasty. They dug into the weak spots of the heart that their victims, as humans, could do nothing about. They showed humans things that they couldn\u2019t achieve in reality, things that were only possible in their dreams. By doing this, they created a false sense of happiness that they used to ensnare their victims.Lovellian had mentioned the Queen of the Night Demons. In Eugene\u2019s previous life, she was one of the demons that Hamel had most wished to kill. That damned demonfolk had attacked Hamel and his colleagues several times during their journey through Helmuth.The Night Demons who served the Queen had invaded their dreams whenever they got a chance and had forced Hamel to recall his greatest regrets \u2014 the family he had lost in a monster raid, his helplessness as he hadn\u2019t been able to do anything, and the constant feelings of rivalry and inferiority that marked his relationship with Vermouth. All of these ended up being highlighted in his dreams.In his dreams, Hamel didn\u2019t lose his family. Instead, the young Hamel\u2019s innate talents had miraculously blossomed, allowing him to slaughter the monsters. His parents and the other villagers had celebrated Hamel as a hero.In his dreams, Hamel was simply greater than Vermouth. No matter how hard he tried, Vermouth just could not defeat Hamel.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s because you\u2019re an idiot,\u2019\u00a0Hamel had mocked Vermouth.In his dreams, Hamel had stood at the forefront of the subjugation effort. The thousands of people who had been lost in the process of crossing into Helmuth, all those who hadn\u2019t been able to keep up with the hero and his companions and had perished along the way without even leaving their names behind, none of them had died in his dream. Forging ahead, he had defeated all the threats that stood in their way, and Hamel managed to save all those countless lives.Then he had finally defeated the last of the Demon Kings.But only in his dreams.\u2018Something like that can\u2019t replace reality.\u2019Hamel\u2014no, Eugene was bitterly aware of this fact.No matter how sweet the dream that a Night Demon showed you, it could never become a reality. After waking up from the dream, the sweetness left over from this illusion was contrasted against reality and only bred bitter self-hatred.Although you might find happiness from such a dream, this only made reality feel even more shitty. In order to change your shitty reality, the last thing that you needed to do was to dive back into your dreams.You needed to tear the illusion apart. You needed to kill the Night Demon, who was trying to sway your heart by showing you such a damned illusion and eventually lead you into losing yourself in an empty dream.Three hundred years had passed since then. The Demon Kings, the demonfolk, and the Night Demons had all changed over time.Eugene could understand what Lovellian was trying to say. There was nothing particularly wrong with his words. He wanted Eward, who was crushed by his damning reality, to at least catch his breath in his dreams.\u201cI\u2019m too old for this,\u201d Eugene muttered as he massaged his temples.Although he might be able to understand, at the same time, he just couldn\u2019t understand. Because he knew the horror of the Night-Demons and the futility of the dreams that they showed. Eugene could not consider Eward\u2019s shameful conduct to be a light matter.As long as Eward was addicted to the dreams, he would continue to turn away from reality. He would just end up becoming a fool.Although he didn\u2019t hold any brotherly affection towards Eward, he had received a lot of favor from Gilead.\u201c\u2018Old?\u2019 What are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d came a surprised question.\u201cI\u2019m saying that your outfit is really old-fashioned,\u201d Eugene said as he turned his head to face the questioner.He was currently sitting in one of the aerial carriages. Gargith was seated across from him. Though the inside of the carriage was quite spacious, Gargith, whose body was pointlessly large, had to hunch his shoulders slightly to fit inside.\u201cWhy are you calling my clothes old-fashioned?\u201d Gargith asked.Eugene critiqued, \u201cIsn\u2019t it because of those stupid-looking frills hanging off you. Who on earth dressed you in that outfit?\u201d\u201cMy mother picked my clothes, and she said that I looked very handsome in them.\u201d\u201cNow that I take a closer look, it really does look good on you. When you add frills to your looks, which are practically overflowing with ferocity, you look just like a wild beast hiding its fangs.\u201dAt these hastily amended words, Gargith smiled in happiness, \u201cThat\u2019s just what I thought.\u201dAlthough Eugene desperately wanted to take back the words he had just uttered, Gargith\u2019s previous look of pitiful dismay had been painful to even look at. Gargith was currently wearing a formal suit with frills sewn onto its arms and chest. Although the scent of perfume thankfully covered up the smell of Gargith\u2019s body odor, it actually felt more disturbing when the smell of cologne was added to his already unusual appearance.\u201c...You don\u2019t need to put on any cologne,\u201d Eugene grudgingly allowed.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cWith your looks, the smell of body odor feels more natural, and it suits you better than cologne.\u201d\u201cI had the same feeling as well.\u201dEugene turned his head to stare out the window once again.It was the night of the full moon. The night when Bolero Street would finally open.Eward had left the tower this morning. He had heard from Hera that Eward had said he was going out to buy some materials for magical experiments. Although Eugene didn\u2019t know if this excuse was true or not, there was no way that a guy who\u2019d been staying in his room for all this time would just happen to go out on today of all days.\u2018Idiot,\u2019\u00a0Eugene scoffed as he looked at his reflection in the window.His face and hair color had been altered. It was still too early for him to be able to use the high-level spell Polymorph, even if he had wanted to. However, he was able to use some lower-ranking spells to change his facial features and hair color.Right now, Eugene had only learned spells up to the Second Circle. Although there had yet to be a reply to the letter of recommendation Lovellian had sent, he had decided to listen to Lovellian\u2019s advice. He might not be certain that an entry pass to Akron would be handed to him, but until he knew for sure, Eugene had decided to not learn any more spells.Instead, Eugene went over the magic already stored in his head. He organized the First and Second Circle spells that he had learned from the introductory books on magic. He had gotten practice with substituting a Core for a Circle and had gotten more familiar with casting spells.As a result, Eugene was able to cast any spell from the First and\u00a0Second Circle, without difficulty. The spell he had currently cast on himself was also a Second Circle spell. It was a rudimentary transformation spell that could be disrupted even by a low-ranking dispel, but it was adequate for a place like Bolero Street.Although it maintained tacit approval from the authorities, most of the business done on Bolero Street was still against the law.Among those who came and went down Bolero Street, many chose to hide their identities. Since Polymorph was a high-ranking spell, it wasn\u2019t so easy to use, so most used rudimentary transformation spells. As such, dispelling the transformation magic cast on visitors to Bolero Street was strictly prohibited.\u2018Although that doesn\u2019t mean it's impossible to recognize someone by their looks,\u2019\u00a0Eugene noted.Dispels weren\u2019t absolutely necessary to see the truth behind a disguise. High-level wizards could easily see through low-level magic. In the end, using such a spell in front of a powerful wizard was just like putting your hands over your eyes and playing dumb.But isn\u2019t that still better than not doing anything at all?As he flipped up the hood of his robe, Eugene opened the carriage\u2019s door. They had arrived at\u00a0Bolero Street.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 34.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34.2: Bolero Street (1)\u201c...This is different from what I expected,\u201d Eugene muttered as he looked around at the bustling crowd.Although it couldn\u2019t compare to any of the previous tourist attractions he had visited, it was still quite crowded. Since it was already a tacitly approved black market, at this point, wouldn\u2019t it be better to just develop it fully into a tourist attraction?\u201cThe entry pass is two million sals,\u201d someone said to them as they were caught looking around.\u201cWhat?\u201d Eugene asked, still distracted.\u201cTwo million sals,\u201d the voice repeated.The large figure blocking the entrance to the street was scowling at them fiercely. He didn\u2019t back down even in the face of Gargith, who was bigger than him. If he didn\u2019t have that level of guts and skills, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to work as Bolero Street\u2019s gatekeeper in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s three million sals for two people,\u201d the bouncer added.Eugene opened his wallet. He counted out four cheques and handed them over to the bouncer. Soon, the gatekeeper wrapped a paper bracelet around Eugene and Gargith\u2019s arms.\u201cThe entrance fee alone is two million sals. That\u2019s way too expensive,\u201d Gargith complained.\u201cThe two million per person is just the cost of entering the street. Each store also sets its own entry fee,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cThat\u2019s insane.\u201dAlthough there had been an expensive entrance fee for every tourist attraction he\u2019d seen in Aroth, the entrance fee for Bolero Street was still more than Gargith had expected.\u201cThey say that just entering a cheap tavern can cost at least a few million sals. For the auction house, you have to pay five million more sals just to get in,\u201d Eugene elaborated further.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that this would also be your first time coming here, Eugene?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cI did my research before coming here.\u201dAs Eugene shook his head in disappointment at Gargith, he glanced down at the bracelet on his wrist. It was a paper bracelet worth two million sals. He tugged on it gently, but it didn\u2019t break.This bracelet acted as your proof of identity in Bolero Street. Official identity cards weren\u2019t used here. This bracelet and money, all you needed were these two things.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Eugene said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you had something else you needed to do?\u201d Gargith asked.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that when the time comes. For now, let\u2019s go to the auction house and get ourselves some seats inside.\u201dEugene placed one hand in an inner pocket of his robes. He had placed a small, magical communication terminal there. He had bought this communication terminal to keep in touch with an accomplice that was somewhere down this long and shady Bolero Street.[Have you arrived, sir?] a voice asked.[How did you know?] Eugene returned the question.[The max range of this terminal\u2019s connection is about the same as the length of Bolero Street. I knew you were here when the signal came in.]The hoarse voice that could be heard from the terminal belonged to the guide that Eugene had met on the first day he arrived in Aroth. Eugene had found him the previous day and persuaded him to act as a spy by offering him a large sum of money.His task was simple. The guide only needed to loiter around the succubi den and signal Eugene when he saw Eward. Eugene had been worried that Eward might also be using transformation magic when he arrived, but\u2026.\u2014There\u2019s no need for that concern. Eward doesn\u2019t use transformation magic.\u2014Huh?\u2014That guy\u2026 um\u2026 I\u2019ve heard that he wears the same robe every time he goes there. And while he might not wear anything that carries your family\u2019s sigil, the hood of his robe often slips to show glimpses of his gray hair\u2026.\u2014He really is a crazy fool.Eward seemed to be enjoying the attention he received from secretly revealing his identity. For someone who had always had a dazed look on his face back at the main estate and had even kept his eyes down and his shoulders slouched at the tower\u2026 was he really taking the chance to loosen up and show off his identity on a street where anyone would be ashamed to be seen?\u2018If he was my son, I\u2019d beat him up to get him to fix his bad habits.\u2019Although he had never had a son, Eugene still had this thought.\u201cYou\u2019ll be paying the entrance fee for the auction house,\u201d Eugene told Gargith.\u201cFine with me,\u201d Gargith agreed.\u201cAbout those\u2026 giant\u2019s testicles\u2026. If they\u2019re too expensive, I won\u2019t lend you the money.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that when we\u2019ve already come all the way here?\u201d\u201cThink about it from my perspective. Although the Patriarch did gift me with this black card, he's sure to be alarmed if I end up spending too much money.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s probably true.\u201d\u201cIf the Patriarch asks me what I spent so much money on\u2026 what the hell am I supposed to say to that? Do you think I can just say I bought some giant testicles? I\u2019d rather die than admit those words.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d\u201c...No, who cares about that. I\u2019m telling you that I refuse to confess with my own lips that I bought giant testicles\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re that worried about it, I\u2019ll just explain in your stead.\u201dJust how much did he want to buy those giant testicles? Eugene snorted as he looked into Gargith\u2019s eyes, which were full of anticipation.As they entered the auction house, they were informed, \u201cIt is forbidden to intrude into other guests\u2019 rooms, and any conversation should be kept between the two of you.\u201dAlthough Bolero Street held more than a few auction houses, all auction houses shared the same rule of keeping the bidding private. Except for companions, everyone was guided to a different room, keeping the bidding anonymous.After paying the entry fee of five million sals each, the gatekeeper of the auction house led them down to the basement as he continued his explanations, \u201cThere will be three buttons in the room that you are led to. If you would like to bid, please press the button in the center. If you would like to increase the price, please click the button on the right. And if you need any other assistance, please press the button on the left.\u201dEugene and Gargith were ushered into a spacious room. There was an opaque glass window covering the front of the room, and no sounds could be heard from the outside. Once they were seated, staff wearing masks brought them some water.\u201cDo you wish to partake in any alcohol?\u201d the employee asked.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Gargith replied in a deep voice.Based on his appearance, it might be impossible to believe, but Gargith was still only eighteen years old.[1]\u00a0Of course, age didn\u2019t matter on Bolero Street. This was a place where even a ten-year-old child could be sold alcohol, as long as they had the money for it.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t be interested in spectating the auction,\u201d commented Gargith.\u201cI need to do something to pass some time, and I\u2019m a little curious about what might come out,\u201d Eugene replied as he tilted his chair back.The front window wavered, and suddenly the figure of a man was reflected within the glass where previously nothing could be seen. It was a man wearing a fancy tailcoat and a mask.\u201cOn this truly beautiful night of the full moon, we thank you for finding your way to our auction house.\u201d The man continued speaking with a bow of his head, \u201cOur auction house mainly deals in rare magical materials sourced from Helmuth. As you may know, there are many auction houses situated on this street. However, I am confident that our auction house is unparalleled when it comes to magical materials sourced from \u2018Helmuth.\u201d\u201c...Unexpectedly, I\u2019ve heard that this street even has a slave auction house,\u201d Gargith mentioned.\u201cReally,\u201d Eugene reacted in surprise.Slavery was an outdated and evil criminal offense that had already been abolished during his previous life.\u201cThe alchemist told me about it,\u201d Gargith revealed. \u201cAlthough slavery is still strictly forbidden\u2026 they said that illegal slaves are still being traded in secret. They also said that the traded slaves are mostly demonfolk.\u201d\u2018The world really has gone crazy,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought as he shook his head.The demonfolk were truly being taken as slaves and sold to humans? Eugene just couldn\u2019t accept such a reality. Of course, he had seen quite a few illegal slaves in his previous life. Elves who had lost their homes to the Demon Kings, skillful dwarven craftsmen, and the primitive beast-like centaurs\u2026. The closer they got to Helmuth, the more slaves he had seen.However, this was Aroth, not Helmuth. And instead of the demihumans, it was the demonfolk who were sold as slaves? To humans, at that?\u201cOur first item is the horn of the Valarex. Let\u2019s start the bidding at ten million sals.\u201dWith this announcement, the auction began. When it came to the magic materials sourced from Helmuth, Eugene was confident that he could be considered a specialist.\u2018Valarex meat was really tough,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled a slightly unpleasant memory.As he balanced on the back two legs of his chair, Eugene continued to survey the auction.\u201cThe fruit of a Prosia.\u201d\u201cThe roots of a Mandragora.\u201d\u201cThe flower buds of a Yuzerak.\u201d\u201cOh my, there\u2019s even a living Turas Spider. This little guy\u2019s poison\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that the giant\u2019s testicles will come out tonight?\u201d Eugene eventually asked.All of the things being shown were rare magical materials, but there was nothing that attracted Eugene\u2019s attention. Turning his gaze to the side, he saw that Gargith was half-asleep.\u201cIt will\u2026 it will come out,\u201d Gargith asserted between yawns. \u201cI heard it would be in the auction tonight.\u201d\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what the rumor said.\u201d\u201cIt would be good if it doesn\u2019t come out, coz\u2019 that would mean I don\u2019t need to waste any money on it,\u201d Eugene muttered as he sipped his water.\u201cThe next item is\u2026 a metal object made from an unappraisable mineral. It\u2019s a rather troubling item as it has remained unsold for quite some time. Our auction has been unable to see through the true value of this material, but perhaps one of the guests visiting us today may have some insight into this metal object\u2019s true value.\u201dUnlike the previous times, his current spiel was rather lengthy.\u201cThis metal object was found in Helmuth\u2019s Kazard Hills. If it\u2019s placed in moonlight, it gives off an extremely beautiful light, but\u2026 frankly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be of any use apart from that. Although it\u2019s too hard to be machined, it doesn\u2019t seem to react to mana either.\u201dThey had said that they\u2019d been unable to sell it for a long time, so that was why it had such an explanation. Since the other items had received bids as soon as their names were called out, there was no need for lengthy explanations.\u201cIt might be a good option as an ornament to place by your bedroom window, as it shines quite beautifully under the light of the moon\u2026.\u201dThe guests who had arrived here tonight had not come to bid on such things. What use could you have for a hard piece of metal that was impossible to reforge and didn\u2019t even accept mana?However, Eugene looked at that metal object with a possessive gaze. The piece of the metal was only the size of a thumb, but he recognized it as a fragment of something else.\u201c...We will start the bidding at a million sals.\u201dThe items revealed up until now all had a base price of at least ten million sals. Thus this metal object had an exceptionally low price.Eugene immediately pressed the button.\u201cEugene?\u201d Gargith turned to Eugene with a look of alarm.[Ah\u2026. Would you like to place a bid?]\u201cA million sals,\u201d Eugene called out without any hesitation.He knew what that piece of metal was.A dim blade that barely shone when out of the moonlight.Destruction in the form of a sword.The sword that had rendered the Holy Sword obsolete.A sword that had been erased from history.The Moonlight Sword.1. The legal drinking age in Korea is 19 years old.\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 35.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35.1: Bolero Street (2)\u201cWhy did you bid on such a useless item?\u201d Gargith asked with a confused expression.It was just an unknown piece of metal that had gone unsold for such a long time. As someone unfamiliar with magic, Gargith couldn\u2019t seem to detect any value from this metal object.It was small, about the size of a finger at most, and it couldn\u2019t be reforged or even manipulated with mana. Although the starting price might have been the lowest of all the items that the auction house had unveiled so far, in Gargith\u2019s opinion, that metal object wasn\u2019t even worth a million sals.Eugene didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he clenched his fists as he tried to bring an order to the dizzying flood of thoughts rushing through his head.Vermouth had wielded numerous weapons in his life, and among them, there were quite a few powerful relics capable of turning the world on its head.The Storm Sword Wynnyd that Eugene currently possessed, for one; and then there was the Devouring Sword Asphel, the Dragon Spear Kharbos, Thunderbolt Pernoa, Phantom Rain Sword Javel, Gedon\u2019s Shield, etc.The most famous of his weapons was the Holy Sword. Although it hadn\u2019t seen much use, these days, it was seen as the weapon that best represented Vermouth.Apart from those, there was also the Demon Spear Luentos previously used by the Demon King of Cruelty and the Annihilation Hammer Jigollath that had once belonged to the Demon King of Carnage.While not to the same extent as the Holy Sword, all of these weapons had left their marks on history, but strangely enough, there was no record of the \u2018Moonlight Sword.\u2019From what Eugene could recall, it was the Moonlight Sword that had allowed them to break through in the face of Luentos\u2019s fierce assault and finally defeat the Demon King of Cruelty. However, in the fairy tales and other historical records, the Holy Sword received the credit for the downfall of the Demon King of Cruelty.The Demon King of Cruelty wasn\u2019t the only victim of the Moonlight Sword. Three hundred years ago, there had been many powerful enemies in Helmuth besides the Demon Kings. They were the high-ranking\u00a0demonfolk\u00a0who fell just short of becoming a Demon King. Enemies like the Vampire Lord and the Tribal Chief of the Giants. And it wasn\u2019t the brilliant light of the Holy Sword that had allowed them to clash with these powerful enemies and paved the way forward.Instead, it was a terrifying beam of moonlight that had forcibly torn open a path forward with the power of destruction.\u2018And that seems to be a fragment of the Moonlight Sword,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought.This meant that the sword might no longer be intact. However, he wasn\u2019t sure what could have caused the blade to shatter into fragments. He also couldn\u2019t be sure that his eyes weren\u2019t fooling him. No matter how clear the memories from his previous life were, he couldn\u2019t come to any definite conclusions based on a single glimpse of such a small fragment.After a while, someone knocked on the door. As the item he had bid on wasn\u2019t that large, it had been brought to him right after he won the bid. Eugene immediately got up and opened the door.\u2018...I was right,\u2019\u00a0Eugene decided as he stared down at the fragment that had just been delivered.The unique dim shade of the metal was just as he remembered. This was definitely a fragment of the Moonlight Sword. But how on earth did a fragment of the Moonlight Sword end up in this auction house?\u2018The Kazard Hills\u2026.\u2019The place where this fragment had been found was further proof of its true identity. The location of the Kazard Hills was a little ways away from the castle of the Demon King of Carnage. It had originally been a plain, but in the aftermath of the fierce battle that took place at the Demon King\u2019s castle, the whole place had undergone a massive upheaval to become a hilly area.It occurred right after they had defeated the Demon King of Carnage, just as they were leaving that Demon King\u2019s castle.They had discovered a dungeon that had been hidden deep underground. Suspecting that the demonfolk may have hidden it deliberately, they had explored the dungeon and found the Moonlight Sword at its very heart.\u2018...The only possibility that I can think of is that\u2026 as Vermouth was leaving Helmuth, he took the Moonlight Sword back to its original resting place and sealed it there.\u2019Then why had the Moonlight Sword shattered into fragments? But if Vermouth really had decided to reseal the Moonlight Sword, Eugene suspected that he knew the reason why the sword had ended up as fragments.The Moonlight Sword was simply far too dangerous. Although the Demon Spear and the Annihilation Hammer were also deadly, the Moonlight Sword exceeded them both.That ominous sword had acknowledged Vermouth alone as its master, and it had always caused terrible destruction whenever it was drawn from its sheath. Vermouth couldn\u2019t have felt reassured with just sealing such a horrible and dangerous sword.\u2018...It\u2019s too quiet,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.The fragment of the Moonlight Sword was perfectly still. It didn\u2019t give off any sense of danger. Well, if it had shown off even a trace of the terrible power that it had held three hundred years ago, it wouldn\u2019t have been left on auction for so long without any bidders.With a bitter feeling, Eugene placed the fragment of the Moonlight Sword back into the wooden box. It was now just a fragment that held none of its previous power. He would be lying if he said that he hadn\u2019t held any expectations for it. He had hoped that a trace of its power might still remain.But even if it was just an ordinary piece of metal now, he didn\u2019t feel too disappointed. Just having such\u00a0a worrisome object\u00a0remain safely in his hands\u00a0put\u00a0his mind at ease.[Sir Eugene,] the communication terminal buzzed. [Sir Eward has arrived.]It was the guide\u2019s voice. Eugene slipped the wooden box into his vest and stood up.\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he told Gargith.\u201cHm? Don\u2019t you want to keep watching?\u201d Gargith asked him.\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019ll leave my card with you before I go, so tell them that I\u2019ll pay for your bid afterward.\u201dIt was impossible to charge a black card without the owner present to provide authentication. But since the black card was so famous, it should be acceptable for them to allow Eugene to pay for the bid after a slight delay.And if they said it wasn\u2019t acceptable? Eugene couldn\u2019t really care about it. Instead, it would actually be a good thing for him, as that meant he wouldn\u2019t need to pay the large sums of money required to purchase those balls.After summoning one of the staff members with a press of the left button, Eugene was led outside the auction house. A lot of time seemed to have passed while they were inside, as the air now had that late-night chill. However, the street was still brightly lit. It appeared that the street lights here didn\u2019t go out until dawn.[Where do I need to go?] Eugene asked.[Um\u2026 If you head up to the north end of the street, you will be able to find a store called \u2018Rafflesia.\u2019 That\u2019s where you need to go,] the guide explained.Eugene began walking.[By the way, just what on earth are you planning to do? This type of shop strictly ensures the security of its customers, so\u2026.]Eugene didn\u2019t answer right away. He had just decided to head over there first, without having a clear idea of what he would do. He just needed to \u2014 no, he wanted to, first of all, look Eward in the eye. How would the eldest son of the main family react when confronted with the fact that someone knew of his ugly little secret?Would Eward be angered by his exposed shame? Or, instead of getting angry, would he just stay silent? Would he spout excuses? Eugene wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. To be honest, he just wanted to grab Eward by the collar and slap both of his cheeks to teach him a lesson.\u2018...But since he\u2019s so pitiful, I\u2019ll give him a chance.\u2019If Eugene didn\u2019t get to slap Eward\u2019s cheeks red, he at least wanted to know what the hell Eward was thinking.As he headed north, the atmosphere of the stores he passed began to change. By the time he reached his destination, the lights that were previously only used to illuminate the darkness had turned a sultry red, and the appearance of the greeters had also changed dramatically. Handsome men were attempting to seduce the passing women, and beautiful women were throwing smiles at the men.\u2018So there\u2019s Incubi, Succubi, as well as Vampires working here. I can even see a few beastfolk.\u2019So it wasn\u2019t just demonfolk working here.\u00a0There were quite a few beastfolk, who looked like a cross between humans and animals, and plain humans\u00a0as well. Without sparing these greeters a single glance, Eugene looked up at the name of the store.The sign read, \u2018Rafflesia.\u2019That meant he had finally found the store after walking down the street for quite some time. The exterior of the store looked fancier than he expected. Without any hesitation, Eugene approached the store entrance.As he drew closer, he was met with a challenge, \u201cAre you here for our services?\u201dFive burly men hanging around the front of the store stepped forward to block his way as if they had been waiting to do so. Eugene stared at the young man standing in the center of their group. He had pale skin, red eyes, pointy ears\u2026 and tiny horns.Demonfolk came in various different types. The night demons were just one category of demonfolk, and starting from three hundred years ago, the giants had also been counted as one of the tribes of the demonfolk. Corrupted dark elves and vampires were also mixed in with their number. So the term demonfolk didn\u2019t refer to a single race but instead referred to all the races ruled by the Demon Kings.But among all these races, the horned race, also known as the \u2018daemons,\u2019 made up the greatest percentage of the population. In fact, the daemons could even be called the orthodox race of the demonfolk. Three hundred years ago, all five of the existing Demon Kings had been daemons.\u201c...I do want to head inside,\u201d Eugene said as he looked straight at the young daemon.Since his reincarnation, this was his first time encountering a group of demonfolk, and with a daemon among them at that. If he was still in his previous life, the daemon would already have been dead before their eyes had even met, but Eugene didn\u2019t reveal a single trace of his murderous intent.The daemon asked, \u201c...Is this your first time visiting our store?\u201d\u201cWhat, am I not allowed if it\u2019s my first time here?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cOf course not. As long as you pay the entrance fee, you're free to head on in for as long as you like.\u201d\u201cHow much is this fee?\u201d\u201cThe base entrance fee is two million sals. After that, any further cost is calculated according to the contents and length of your requested dream. Would you still like to enter?\u201d the daemon asked with a faint smile.Without replying, Eugene pulled out his wallet and handed the daemon two cheques.Upon receiving the entrance fee, the daemon immediately stepped away from the door with the parting words, \u201cPlease enjoy your time here.\u201dIgnoring his words, Eugene walked into the store.He was immediately greeted with red lights and the sight of a raucous bar. The entire first floor appeared to be used as a pub. He could also spot various succubi and incubi wearing suggestive clothing as they went around delivering trays of alcohol and playing coy with the guests. Eugene paused for a moment as he took in this scene.\u201cAllow me to lead you to a seat,\u201d a beautiful succubus offered as she approached him and entwined her arms around his.Ignoring her, Eugene panned his gaze upwards. It seemed that both the second and third floors were also used for drinking. He couldn\u2019t spot any rooms that looked like they could be used by the customers here to enjoy the dreams.\u2018They must be in the basement,\u2019\u00a0Eugene concluded.He could see a few succubi and incubi leading customers down into the basement. So where was Eward now? Was he having a drink somewhere, or was he already caught in his dreams?But before anything else, he needed to deal with this smell. The perfume scent coming from the succubus sticking to his side was overpowering.FavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is this your first time visiting our store? Why don\u2019t we get some drinks first?\u201dThe succubus\u2019s smile widened as she casually brushed her body against Eugene\u2019s arm and whispered, \u201cIf you drink something beforehand, it relaxes your body and allows you to fall into a deeper state of sleep.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s no bed, I can\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d Eugene insisted.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. As long as you drink in moderation, I\u2019ll be sure to lead you down to the basement before it\u2019s time to sleep. But, more importantly, what kind of dream would you like us to arrange for you?\u201d The succubus lowered her voice as she led Eugene to an empty seat with a sense of familiarity. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy and tell me everything. We need you to be precise and specific with your desires if you want to enjoy your best dream experience.\u201dFrom these words, Eugene was able to estimate the levels of the succubi who worked in this store. High-level night demons were able to cause their victims to fall asleep regardless of their wishes and create a dream for them based on their subconscious desires. Considering that these ones needed to ply their guests with alcohol to make them sleepy and had even asked him to detail his intended dream's contents, there were only low-level night demons here.\u201c...I don\u2019t feel comfortable saying anything yet,\u201d Eugene said after some thought.\u201cThen, it looks like you\u2019ll need to have a drink first,\u201d the succubus smiled brightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, our drinks are both delicious and strong. After you\u2019ve had a few glasses, you\u2019ll be sure to speak your desires without feeling any shame.\u201dHaving just sat down with him, the succubus got up again and left. Before long, the succubus returned holding two glasses of wine.\u201cIs it okay if this big sis drinks with you?\u201d the succubus asked.\u2018Who said that you could call yourself my big sis?\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought as he took the glass.This would be his first time trying alcohol in his new body, but was he a good drinker as well? His talented body rarely suffered from minor illnesses and was strong against fatigue, so there was no reason why it should be weak to alcohol. With that thought in mind, Eugene brought the glass to his lips.\u2018...They\u2019ve even gone so far as to spike this drink,\u2019\u00a0Eugene soon realized.A sweet scent had been subtly mixed in with the smell of the alcohol. It was the scent of a hallucinogenic herb that only grew in Helmuth. Since the levels of these succubi were insufficient, it seemed that they were even making use of such a hallucinogen to make up for their lack of power.\u2018Well, it makes sense. There\u2019s no way that a high-ranking succubus would come to a street like this just to peddle dreams.\u2019As the smell was faint, the drug didn\u2019t seem too potent. Eugene took a sip of the drink with an urge to test his body\u2019s tolerance. His throat burned as the alcohol went down. For the first drink he had had since his reincarnation, it tasted pretty good. However, due to the location in which he was consuming the drink, the aftertaste was just foul.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re a good drinker,\u201d the succubus hummed thoughtfully.Having taken a sip, Eugene put the drink down. Then he focussed on observing the reactions taking place in his body. The heat of the alcohol warmed his stomach and then sent a rush of sensation up to his head, causing him to feel a little woozy.\u2018Looks like I have quite the innate tolerance.\u2019\u00a0He decided to risk drinking the rest of his glass. As he did so, Eugene scanned the inside of the store,\u00a0\u2018There are people going down, but none are coming back up.\u2019Eugene lowered his empty glass.\u201cLet\u2019s head down,\u201d Eugene demanded.\u201cHm?\u201d the succubus hummed in confusion.\u201cThe drinks here don\u2019t match my tastes.\u201d\u201cAhah\u2026. Are you feeling embarrassed to say anything up here? You don\u2019t need to worry about that, but\u2026 in that case, shall we head down to the bedrooms now?\u201d the succubus asked, concealing her disappointment.She had intended to persuade him to drink a few more glasses so that she could make more off of him from the alcohol. However, it was impossible to ignore the demands of her customer. Eugene and the succubus got up and headed down to the basement together.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit scary,\u201d Eugene confessed.\u201cWhat is?\u201d the succubus asked.\u201cIt\u2019s actually my first time doing something like this,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for concern.\u201d The succubus explained, \u201cAlthough we do drain a bit of lifeforce, it\u2019s only to the extent where you\u2019ll feel a little tired the next day.\u201d\u201cWhy do you feel the need to charge us when you\u2019re already taking away our lifeforce?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re feeding on our lifeforce, shouldn\u2019t you at least make it a free service?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 um\u2026 in exchange for the money, don\u2019t we offer you pleasant dreams?\u201d\u201cOn second thought, I feel like I\u2019m getting ripped off, so I don\u2019t think I can do this. If it\u2019s a dream, I can get one just by going to sleep myself, so why do I need to hand over both money and my lifeforce?\u201dInstead of heading into one of the bedrooms, Eugene just checked out the length of the basement hallway. Then he shook off the succubus\u2019 arm and pulled out his wallet.\u201cI\u2019ve decided to go back and sleep in my own bed, so I\u2019ll leave after paying the bill for the drinks,\u201d Eugene insisted.The succubus sneered,\u00a0\u201cHow does a cowardly guy like you have the guts to show his face at a place like this?\u201d[1]\u201cAnything is possible. Since I\u2019m scared and feeling reluctant, what else am I supposed to do?\u201dTaking out a cheque for a million sals from his wallet, Eugene handed it to the succubus. Even though this amount confused the succubus, she still accepted the money.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to give me any change,\u201d Eugene offered generously.\u201cOh\u2026 um, well, fine then,\u201d the succubus replied, thrown off-balance.Was this guy an idiot? Or maybe just a sucker? In any case, this wasn\u2019t a bad deal for the succubus. A million sals were much more than the cost of those two cheap drinks.The succubus resumed her professional attitude, \u201cGoodbye then\u2026. Next time\u2026 please come to us after you\u2019ve prepared yourself. I\u2019ll be sure to take care of you once more. My name is\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. Where do I need to go to get out of here?\u201d Eugene demanded.\u201c...Allow me to show you the way.\u201dThey walked down to a room at the end of the hallway. The interior looked like it had been a storeroom, but there was a staircase heading upstairs. Eugene left the succubus behind and climbed up the stairs.He was greeted by a man\u2019s voice, \u201cDid you have a pleasant dream?\u201dThe next floor was a restaurant. It looked like it was intended for their guests, who had had a few drinks and then gotten their lifeforce sucked in their dreams, to have a meal in the restaurant before they left. Eugene opened up the wallet he was still holding and handed the man who had greeted him some money.The man seemed surprised, \u201cYou\u2019ve already paid your bill\u2014\u201dEugene interrupted him, \u201cI want a quiet seat in a corner.\u201dThe man hesitated, \u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s good here?\u201d Eugene asked brusquely.Although he was secretly put off by the young man\u2019s abrupt rudeness, the man politely accepted the money with a pleasant smile.\u201cThe specialty of our restaurant is the magma stew. Its spicy taste has a real kick to it, and it\u2019s packed with plenty of meat,\u201d the man gave his recommendation.Eugene\u2019s only response was, \u201cI want extra servings of meat.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThis restaurant, whose name he didn\u2019t know, was just as noisy as the first floor of Rafflesia. Apart from the customers who had woken up from their dreams, the restaurant also accepted ordinary customers. Although this was a black market, that didn\u2019t mean that all the shops here sold illegal goods and services. Even in a place like this, there could still be restaurants.Eugen sat down in an out-of-the-way corner and pulled up his hood, but he wasn\u2019t the only customer doing something similar to protect their identity. Thanks to that, Eugene could quietly eat his food without attracting attention from anyone else.How long would he end up waiting? There had already been quite a few customers coming up from the basement, but Eward was nowhere to be seen. As the time passed, Eugene continued to order a few more dishes. The food here was quite palatable.\u2018There\u2019s the bastard.\u2019Just as he was done wiping his fourth plane clean, Eugene spotted his target.Eward was climbing up the stairs. He had his hood up, so it was impossible to see his face, but Eugene had a clear recollection of Eward\u2019s physique. On top of that, his hand could be seen below the cuff. That callous-free hand could be none other than Eward\u2019s.He didn\u2019t know how much Eward had drunk, but he was stumbling up the stairs. That alone would have been enough to piss Eugene off, but Eward wasn\u2019t alone in his climb. A few others were supporting Eward as they followed him up from the basement, and they weren\u2019t succubi either. They were unmistakably daemons with those horns on their heads; two men and one woman. A burning rage rose in Eugene\u2019s chest as he caught sight of them.\u2018He\u2019s not just playing around with night demons. He\u2019s even getting carried by daemons?\u2019\u00a0Eugene questioned in disbelief.As soon as Eward reached the second floor, two men who had been sitting in the restaurant got up from their seats. The two then casually paid their bills and made their way out of the restaurant, exchanging eye contact with the daemons as they did so.They nodded their hooded heads to the daemons, and Eward and the daemons followed them out. After confirming that they had all left, Eugene also got up.As quite some time had passed, the number of people walking the street had decreased. Eugene checked the direction Eward and his unknown companions were heading in, then he turned and walked in the opposite direction. It was only after he had walked around the first building in sight that he turned around and started following Eward.\u2018But where are they going?\u2019\u00a0Eugene asked himself.After they had passed several blocks, still supporting Eward on their shoulders, the group entered a particular building that didn\u2019t have any signage. After confirming that everyone had entered without leaving anyone outside, Eugene walked closer to the building.Right when he was about to push open the closed door, someone called out to him, \u201cHey kid. You\u2019re in the wrong neighborhood.\u201dThree burly men walked out of the alley next to the building. While screwing up their ugly faces into a scowl, they glared at Eugene.\u201cThis isn\u2019t some kind of store, so get lost,\u201d one demanded.Eugene ignored the demand and asked, \u201cThen what kind of place is this?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to get lost?\u201d he demanded again.Eugene put on a friendly tone, \u201cHey friend, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re trying to cut our conversation a bit too short.\u201d\u201cI said, get lost, you motherfucker.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go inside and have a talk instead of standing out here?\u201d\u201cThis crazy bastard.\u00a0Do you think that we have the time to joke with a brat like you?\u201dOne of the men stomped over and grabbed Eugene\u2019s collar.Despite the hold on his neck, Eugene admitted, \u201cIt does sound a bit like a joke.\u201d\u201cYou, you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d the oaf demanded.The man could smell the scent of alcohol coming from Eugene.As he dragged Eugene into the alley, he spat out, \u201cIf you\u2019re drunk, you should just go home to sleep it off. Looks like I\u2019ll need to teach a brat like you that the world is a scary place.\u201dAfter giving him a moderate beating, they\u2019d take Eugene\u2019s money as a teaching expense and then chase him away. The three men came up with this simple plan as they exchanged glances. Eugene was easily able to read their thoughts from their faces as he quietly followed them into the alley.One of the men began ordering Eugene, \u201cFirst of all, take out your wallet\u2014\u201dSince they had entered the alleyway, thus blocking the view of any watchers, there was no need for Eugene to keep playing along.Eugene pulled on the arm that was clutching his collar; this pulled the man\u2019s chin forward slightly, bringing it in reach for a swing of Eugene\u2019s fist. Before the man could even finish speaking, he had already lost consciousness.\u201cYou crazy bastard, what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dWith a scream, the remaining two thugs rushed Eugene.\u201cCome now, friends,\u201d Eugene chided the men.The two thugs soon fell to the floor, unable to even lift their fists.As Eugene kicked them idly with his foot, he continued speaking, \u201cNow then, why don\u2019t you tell me what goes on in there?\u201d\u201cW-we don\u2019t know,\u201d the men stammered out.Eugene shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. It really doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t tell me.\u201dBam!Kicking the men in their chins, Eugene turned around and left, \u201cInstead of listening to you, it should be faster and simpler to just take a look inside by myself.\u201d1. A more literal translation of this line would be: \u201cHow can there be guys like this as well?\u201d It\u2019s quite a common Korean expression, a similar Western expression might be: \u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d But as this doesn\u2019t quite fit the context of the conversation, seeing as there are only two participants without any observers, something similar has been substituted.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Accompanied by a group of suspicious people, he had headed into a building without any signage up front. That alone would have been suspicious enough, but a few burly and vicious thugs were even hanging around to intimidate anyone who got near.This was definitely a shady location.Eugene grabbed the doorknob and tried to turn it a few times, but the locked door refused to open. It looked like some kind of magic had been cast on top of the physical locking mechanism. Someone else might have asked themself, should I smash it? But Eugene didn\u2019t even pause to consider.The stars around his heart shone as Eugene checked the flow of mana that he could feel from the doorknob.Eugene felt lucky he had started learning magic. If it were in the past, he would have just tried to break through by force, but now he was even able to figure out the structure of the mana that formed this locking spell.However, just because this was true, it didn\u2019t mean that Eugene felt the need to change his method. It just meant that his usual fallback didn\u2019t require as much power as before. In the end, he was still going to forcefully break through the door.If Eugene\u2019s accomplishments in magic were higher, that might not have been the case, but at present, Eugene couldn't possibly unlock the spell cast on the door using his own magic.A visible shroud of mana covered Eugene\u2019s hand, and he then pushed this mana into the locking spell. Thanks to the fact that he was already aware of the structure that the locking spell had taken, it didn\u2019t take much effort to overpower the spell\u2019s weak-point.Although it might seem obvious to say this, to dismantle a spell using this method, one needs to be able to control their mana as if it were their own hands and feet. Even a master wizard with quite some skill in magic would find this task impossible, but Eugene accomplished it with ease.Creak.Although the method might seem crude, the results were undeniable. The doorknob that was twisted open forcefully had completely shattered internally. After confirming that the locking spell had also been broken, Eugene lifted one foot.Bang.With a sharp kick, Eugene broke the lock off the door. While this caused the door to swing open and Eugene entered without any hesitation, he still kept his guard up. One of his hands was resting on the hilt of Wynnyd, which Eugene had hanging from his hip.Just by doing this, his vigilance\u00a0jumped from merely adequate to almost excessive. As long as his hand was resting on his weapon, he could instantly draw it and have it ready for any situation. Eugene was assured by this.\u201c...Haaah.\u201dIt was hard to see in front of him as the whole floor had been filled with a thick cloud of smoke. The very air felt sticky and clung to the back of his throat, the smoke having a sweet yet savory taste to it. It numbed his senses and caused his vision to go slightly dizzy. Eugene circulated the mana from the White Flame Formula throughout his body, and the mild dizziness went away immediately.\u201cSo it\u2019s an\u00a0opium den[1],\u201d Eugene muttered with a snort of disdain.Strange sounds were leaking out from the closed rooms around him. It made sense to find such a place on a street like this, but to think that Eward would immediately come here as soon as he was done with his succubus dream had Eugene\u2019s eyes turn cold.\u201cI can understand needing a place where he could catch his breath, but this is going way too far.\u201dHow could anyone even breathe properly in a place like this? Just the dreams from a succubus alone were enough to weaken and ruin his mind, but if he was huffing drugs in an opium den on top of that, he was practically drilling holes in his own brain.While clearing the smoke out of his way, Eugene kept moving forward.\u201cWho are you? How did you get in here?\u201d\u201cClose the door!\u201dMen puffing on their drug pipes rose to confront him as he passed by their alcoves. There were humans, beastfolk, and demonfolk \u2014 this opium den was practically a forum for racial inclusivity. Eugene gave his heartfelt applause to the men who came staggering towards him.\u201cIf guys like you were born three hundred years ago, the world might have been able to hold our hands together in love and peace,\u201d Eugene praised sarcastically.One of the men shouted, \u201cWhat the hell is this bastard talking about?\u201dEugene continued, \u201cBut don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let you off because of that, you rotten bastards.\u201dEugene didn\u2019t draw Wynnyd, nor did he run directly past them. Instead, the stars circling around his heart went into action.Bambambam!He instantly created a few magic missiles and sent them piercing through the smoke.Although they might be high on drugs, the addicts who had risen to confront the intruder were those who were quite confident in their own skills.Magic missile was just a First-Circle offensive spell. It wasn\u2019t that fast or that strong. So Eugene\u2019s targets dodged the spell with a snort of disdain.Or at least they\u00a0tried\u00a0to dodge it. Although they had immediately reacted to the projectiles with their attempts to evade, the chaotic trajectory of the missiles made it impossible for them to avoid the attacks.\u2018They\u2019re way too obvious,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed with disdain.There was no way that Eugene would get fooled by the evasive movements of guys like these. Truthfully speaking, he was sure he could have hit them even if he cast the spell with his eyes shut.\u201cWhere is Eward?\u201d\u201cGaaah\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me. I can just look for him myself,\u201d muttering this, Eugene drew Wynnyd from its sheath.With a chilling hiss, the silvery-blue blade made its appearance. The men who had been sent flying felt their breaths being taken away by this\u00a0sight. They knew they were going to die. Although Eugene didn\u2019t exude any obvious killing intent, their instincts sensed inevitable doom. They gave up any resistance and just curled up into balls, burying their heads in their arms.However, Eugene didn\u2019t swing his sword in their direction and instead raised the blade towards the ceiling.Whoosh!A fierce breeze engulfed Wynnyd. It was the form of a lesser spirit of the wind, a sylph. But a sylph summoned by Eugene was actually able to create a gust so strong that it was impossible to believe that it was merely a low-ranking spirit.This was all because he was at the Third Star of the White Flame Formula. Although he was even able to summon intermediate spirits with his current amount of mana, Eugene wasn\u2019t inclined to do so.He had calculated that it was much better to increase the amount of low-mana-consumption sylphs he summoned, as he had much better control over them, than draining all his mana to summon an intermediate spirit. Eugene had far too much combat ability to put himself in a position where he needed to depend solely on a spirit's power for his own protection.\u201cAhhhh\u2026!\u201dThe addicts still scattered on the floor around Eugene stared at him with fearful eyes. Eugene was now standing in the center of a fierce wind storm as he kept Wynnyd in the air.Roooar!The storm suddenly scattered. The gusts of wind it sent blowing in all directions scattered the smoke and smashed open all the walls and tightly locked doors on this floor.\u201cWh-what the?!\u201dThe drug addicts found in all of the formerly closed rooms let out screams. Eugene swept his eyes over all of these rooms in a single pass. There were a lot of disturbing, lascivious, and just plain disgusting sights, but Eward wasn\u2019t one of them.There was no need for Eugene to continue searching for Eward all by himself. He had scattered a number of sylphs along with the gusts of wind, and they were now blowing through the entire building. They soon told him where he needed to go. Even as he continued to bottle up his boiling irritation, Eugene headed upwards.Baaang!A number of magic missiles were combined together to blow a hole through the ceiling. Then Eugene used the wind to lift his body up through the hole.Repeating\u00a0this process,\u00a0he arrived on the third floor.1.\u00a0The original text calls it a raccoon den. Opium dens were called that because they used to smoke out raccoon dens when they were being hunted. I used opium den to make it easier to understand.\u00a0\u261cFavoritePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a buzzing sound, the sylphs that had followed him started to generate some wind. Using this to scatter the smoke, Eugene strode purposefully down the hallway.There was only one room at the end of this hallway, which meant Eward had to be in that room. Even as he continued to stare straight ahead at the locked door to the room, Eugene\u2019s feet suddenly slid sideways.Hiss.A spine-chilling noise swept past as something brushed the side of his head. Without panicking, Eugene manipulated the wind around him.Boom!The wind gathered into one spot above him before exploding like a bomb. Falling from the ceiling, the man who had tried to attack him was forcefully embedded into the wall as his mouth sprayed out blood. It was one of the two men who had been waiting for Eward in the restaurant.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to backstab me, then you should at least aim properly, cheeky bastard,\u201d Eugene clicked his tongue at the man before reaching into his vest with his left hand.The ambush wasn\u2019t over just yet. Without even opening the door, someone inside the room attacked Eugene by casting a spell that burst through the door.With a snort, Eugene pulled out the item he had been reaching for. He then casually threw the luxurious wooden box that he had obtained from the auction house in the way of the attack.Contained within the box was the fragment of the Moonlight Sword that he had bought at the auction house.Gwaaah!The spell was split into dozens of strands that swept across the surrounding walls. The fragment didn\u2019t break or show any other reaction to the spell's mana.\u201cWhat astounding performance,\u201d Eugene muttered as he grabbed the fragment that had fallen to the floor.Although none of the original sword\u2019s appearance had been retained, the Moonlight Sword\u2019s characteristics could still be seen from this small fragment.Eugene continued speaking while looking straight ahead, \u201cIf you had hit me with that attack just now, the power could have killed me.\u201dBehind the door that had been shredded by the attack, a man in a black robe was standing there. It was made even more obvious from his attire, but the spell he had cast had already revealed his identity as a black wizard.Panicked by the failure of his attack spell, the black wizard shrieked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dHe had cast that spell with a resolve to kill, but it had somehow been blocked using some unknown method. Had this intruder used magic just now? But how had he never heard of a defensive spell with such an effect?\u201cWhy are you raising such an uproar here?\u201d the black wizard also demanded.It was true that Eugene had been the one to start attacking unilaterally. After beating up the guards outside, he had barged in through the front door and smashed through the ceilings of the first and second floors to reach the third floor. So the wizard had reason to feel wronged.However, Eugene didn\u2019t care about that. He didn\u2019t feel the need to explain the situation or even reveal his name.Escaping from reality through a dream made by a succubus was pathetic but understandable. However, Eward had crossed the line this time. Drugs were already a step too far, but he was even consorting with a fucking bastard who used black magic.\u2014Don\u2019t get involved with black magic.Gilead had even given Eugene a stern warning about such conduct before he left for Aroth. But what did Gilead\u2019s real son think he was doing, palling around with someone who could even be called Vermouth\u2019s enemy?\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d Eugene spat out an order as he put the fragment of the Moonlight Sword back inside his vest. \u201cIf you run away now, I won\u2019t have to try and catch you.\u201d\u201cI already thought you were a cheeky brat, but that\u2019s\u2014!\u201d The black wizard snarled, \u201cDo you even realize where you are now and in whose presence you\u2019re behaving so rudely?\u201dEugene coldly replied, \u201cI know exactly who I\u2019m behaving so rudely to. That\u2019s Eward Lionheart, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe thing that made Eugene feel even more furious and scornful was that, despite all the commotion, Eward had yet to raise his head, let alone make a sound. Eward was so high on alcohol and drugs that he was still buried in the sheets of his large bed, giggling to himself.\u201cIt seems like your distinguished young master still doesn\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Eugene observed sarcastically.The black wizard suddenly screamed, \u201cKill him!\u201dThe demonfolk who had been sticking close to Eward sprang into action. They were the ones supporting Eward on the way here from the restaurant. The three daemons directly threw themselves at Eugene.\u2018So they\u2019re all here,\u2019\u00a0Eugene noted to himself.With these three, Eugene had finally met all the five people who had escorted Eward to this opium den. One of them was still embedded in the wall outside, and the other had started trying to cast a spell right in front of him.Fwoosh.The stars around his heart began to resonate as white flames flared up to cover Eugene\u2019s body. As he started to charge forward, wisps of flame scattered from him. Eugene lowered his body and drew Wynnyd back behind him.A lion with a white mane hides its claws, not needing to make the first move.It was only when the daemons got into range that Wynnyd made its move.Phwoosh!The lion\u2019s claws swung forward, tearing apart everything in its path.\u201cAaaargh!\u201dBlood spurted out from the chest of the daemon who had rushed closest to Eugene.In the next moment, Eugene took a step forward. The wind wrapped around his sword exploded, and the body of the second daemon, who had been slowed by fear, was thrown backward by the wind.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe daemon who was right behind the second one was startled by this\u00a0sight\u00a0and tried to back away. However, it was much faster for Eugene to dive forward than for the daemon to retreat. Although the daemon lengthened its fingernails into blade-like claws and swiftly slashed at Eugene, the daemon\u2019s arm was completely severed at the wrist before it could even complete its swing.The daemon didn\u2019t even get a chance to scream in pain. Having already gotten into reach, Eugene\u2019s hand grabbed the daemon by its face.Crack!With this grip, Eugene smashed the daemon\u2019s head through the floor.\u201cTh-this is insane,\u201d the black wizard muttered as his face turned pale.Although Eugene\u2019s skills were undeniably amazing, it was the white flames covering Eugene\u2019s body that truly shocked the black wizard. Those scattered wisps of fire that looked like the mane of a lion \u2014 only one mana training scripture in the whole world could cause such a unique phenomenon.That was the Lionheart main family\u2019s White Flame Formula.The black wizard stammered, \u201cM-might you be\u2026 Sir Eugene Lionheart?\u201dHe stopped trying to cast his spell. Instead, he stepped backward, all the while sweating profusely, and laid down his staff. Eugene shook the blood off of his hand after getting up.\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d Eugene repeated.For a moment, the black wizard considered whether he should continue to resist or just submit. Neither choice would prevent this from turning into the worst-case scenario, so instead\u2026.The black wizard hid the murderous intent in his eyes, and he subtly shuffled over to the staff that he had laid down.\u201c...N-now hold on a moment\u2026. Allow me to explain the situation\u2026,\u201d the black wizard drew out his words, trying to buy even a few more seconds of precious time.However, Eugene had no intention of listening to his story. He had told the black wizard to get out of the way, but the black wizard hadn\u2019t. As such, Eugene was now\u00a0decided\u00a0on what to do next.Eugene narrowed the distance between them in an instant and reached out to grab the black wizard. Unfortunately for him, there was far too little time for the black wizard to properly cast a spell, so he recklessly burst out his mana. Although it wasn\u2019t as powerful or as effective as a proper spell, he was just trying to stop Eugene from getting any nearer by blindly expelling his mana.However, this still failed to cause Eugene any hindrance. Eugen just added sword-light to his sword that was already covered by a blade of wind. The blast of mana could not stop Eugene\u2019s slash without any refinement.\u2018How insane\u2014!\u2019\u00a0the black wizard cursed.How could he have imagined that his last-ditch effort could be cut through so easily? He couldn\u2019t believe that Eugene was currently only seventeen.\u2018I\u2019m going to die\u2026,\u2019\u00a0or at least, that\u2019s what the black wizard thought.Eugene\u2019s sword stopped right in front of the black wizard\u2019s throat. The black wizard trembled nervously, unable to gulp out of fear that this would cause his throat to be sliced open.\u201cStay still,\u201d Eugene spat out this order as he walked past the black wizard.Eward was still intoxicated from all the alcohol and drugs he had taken. However, Eugene didn\u2019t draw any closer to Eward and instead slowly turned his gaze to the spot on the bed beside the disappointing heir.There laid a bowl containing a grotesquely jiggling mass of flesh.\u201cCould that be what I think it is?\u201d Eugene asked as he pointed to the mass of flesh.This wasn\u2019t just a simple chunk of meat. This was a \u2018cup\u2019 used for certain ceremonies.Eugene promised, \u201cIf it turns out that there\u2019s a human heart in that bowl, you can be sure that I will skin you alive and cut you to pieces, starting from your toes.\u201d\u201cIt-it really isn't,\u201d the black wizard pleaded as he immediately knelt on the spot. \u201cThat thing inside there really isn\u2019t a human heart. It\u2019s a m-monster\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of monster?\u201d\u201cA unicorn\u2019s\u2026.\u201dInstead of listening any further, Eugene checked the inside of the bowl for himself. Indeed, he could see that the heart was too big to be a human\u2019s, and it also had a slightly bluish tint to it. Unicorns were monsters with such strong mana and divine power that they were called divine beasts.If it was meant to be used as a \u2018sacrifice,\u2019 then a unicorn\u2019s heart was much more valuable than a human\u2019s.\u201c...Is the other party a Demon King?\u201d Eugene eventually asked.The black wizard reacted with shock, \u201cHow dare\u2026. I-I mean, how could someone like myself arrange a contract with one of the Demon Kings?\u201d\u201cThen who is it?\u201d Eugene prompted,\u201c...It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s Baron Olpher of Helmuth\u2026,\u201d the black wizard finally answered with his head bowed low.Eugene was unfamiliar with that name. His brow furrowed as he turned back to look at the black wizard.\u201cAnd just who is that bastard?\u201d Eugene asked.The black wizard explained, \u201cHe is an incubus who serves under Duchess Giabella.\u201d\u201cDuchess Giabella? Are you talking about Noir Giabella?\u201d\u201cYes, sir\u2026.\u201dNoir Giabella was the queen of the Night Demons. Eugene snorted and shook his head. It wasn\u2019t surprising that that damn succubus was still alive after three hundred years. Although the Helmuth of the distant past was nothing more than a hell ruled by the five Demon Kings, with none of the trappings of a real nation, the current Helmuth was now a genuine country ruled over jointly by the Demon Kings of Incarceration and Destruction.Although it wasn\u2019t possible for her to stand on the same level as the Demon Kings, if it was the queen who ruled over all the Night Demons, it made sense for Noir Giabella to be called a Duchess.Struggling to hold in his irritation, Eugene said, \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is\u2026 this damned bastard\u2026 was about to sign a contract with a mere servant of Noir Giabella, an incubus who is nothing more than a baron\u2026. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cS-sir Eugene,\u201d the black wizard stammered, unsure what to say.\u201cSo he was planning to offer up the heart of a unicorn, while out of his mind on drugs and alcohol, in exchange for a contract with a\u00a0mere\u00a0incubus baron. Have I got all that right?\u201d\u201cIt was Sir Eward\u2019s own desire\u2026!\u201d The black wizard hastily made his excuses as he banged his head against the floor in apology, \u201cI was only listening to Sir Eward\u2019s request. Sir Eward was also the one who gave me the money to purchase the heart of a unicorn. I-I just listened to Sir Eward\u2019s request\u2026 and I just couldn\u2019t refuse his\u00a0o-order.\u201d\u201cOf course, you couldn\u2019t refuse him,\u201d Eugene drawled sarcastically. \u201cAfter all, you must have been so excited. That idiot is still the eldest son of the Lionheart clan\u2019s direct line. On top of giving you money, he even wanted to make a contract with your master. If it had all worked out as planned, your strength would have increased greatly thanks\u00a0to that\u00a0fucking bastard named Olpher.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d the black wizard stayed silent.\u201cNo, on second thought, it wouldn\u2019t just end with you getting stronger. If the deal had been struck, you might even have been able to negotiate a contract with that bitch Noir.\u201dThis was why he had been so eager to arrange for Eward to sign a contract with the enemy of Vermouth and the Lionheart clan.\u201cYou were willing to arrange this contract because you were also greedy for the results. So don\u2019t push all the blame onto others and keep your mouth shut if you don\u2019t want me to beat you up,\u201d threatened Eugene.The black wizard was unable to come up with any more excuses. The killing intent that Eugene was exuding was far too ferocious and frightening for him to dare open his mouth any time soon. Eugene turned his gaze away from the\u00a0black wizard\u00a0to look at Eward, who was still lying on his back, eyes half-open, and with drool dripping from his slack-jawed mouth.First of all, he needed to calm himself down. Eugene took a deep breath before taking another look at Eward\u2019s face.\u201cThis son of a bitch.\u201dIn the end, he still couldn\u2019t contain his temper. Spitting out a vile curse, Eugene slapped Eward\u00a0on the cheek.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The heavy blow, which was loaded with all of Eugene\u2019s emotions, woke Eward up from the haze of alcohol and drugs that had been clouding his mind.\u201cAaargh!\u201d Eward let out a scream.Although he had woken up, he still hadn\u2019t grasped the situation. After first clutching at his sore cheek, Eward lifted his head, only for Eugene to push Eward\u2019s hands aside.\u201cHave you come to your senses yet?\u201d Eugene asked as he slapped Eward once more.Though, rather than a slap, it would be more accurate to call it a full-on assault. The force of the blow even collapsed the legs of the bed, sending Eward sprawling backward with his legs up in the air.\u201cAaargh!\u201d Eward screamed once again.\u201cGeez, big brother,\u201d Eugene sighed.He raised his hands to deliver another blow, but Eward managed to react in time by covering his head with his arms.Eward had only been slapped twice, but thick streams of tears were already dripping down his face. Considering that the insides of his cheeks had been torn, filling his mouth with blood, and his teeth had definitely been knocked loose, it was only natural that Eward was in a great deal of pain.But for him to cry because of that? He wasn\u2019t just some nineteen-year-old man from any ordinary family. No \u2014 he was the eldest son of the Lionheart clan\u2019s direct line, a descendant of Vermouth! And he was crying just because he got slapped twice on the cheek? Eward\u2019s\u00a0tears\u00a0did nothing to cool Eugene\u2019s rage. Instead, the sight of his whimpering only made his anger rise even higher.\u201cDo you really think you deserve any sympathy?\u201d Eugene sneered.Disoriented, Eward babbled, \u201cWh-who are you? Why am I\u2014? Wh-where is this?\u201d\u201cAre you playing dumb, or do you really not know what\u2019s going on? The latter is definitely a possibility, considering that you took drugs while already drunk on alcohol. But, having gone that far, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if you had difficulty recognizing your own parents,\u201d as Eugene said all this in a calm voice, he reached out with his hand.Eward trembled and flinched backward. The sight of him then grabbing the blood-stained sheets and pulling them over his head was both absurd and pathetic.Eugene took a moment to calm himself before continuing, \u201c...That\u2019s why I need you to come to your senses first.\u00a0Now, turn your other cheek towards me.\u201d\u201cWho-who on earth are you?\u201d Eward repeated his question.Eugene tsked in disapproval, \u201cYou really are out of it. Do you still not recognize me? It can\u2019t be helped. It looks like I\u2019ll need to keep hitting you. If you haven\u2019t come to your senses yet, it just means you\u2019re not in enough pain. If I hit you a few more times, you\u2019ll have to come to your senses even if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dEward begged, \u201cSt-stop! Please don\u2019t hit me\u2014.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, get that blanket out of the way. Don\u2019t try to block it. If you pointlessly try to block it, I might just hit somewhere else by mistake, and that\u2019ll be bad news for you.\u201dAlthough he said this, Eugene didn\u2019t wait for Eward to move on his own accord. He pulled down the blanket and pushed away Eward\u2019s hands covering his head.The side of Eward\u2019s face that had been slapped twice was already swollen, and blood was dripping from his cracked lips. Eugene grabbed Eward\u2019s nose and turned his head so that the other side was facing him.\u201cAaaaargh!\u201dIgnoring Eward\u2019s screams, Eugene slapped him twice on the remaining cheek so that the two sides appeared equal. Then he grabbed Eward\u2019s head and held him in place with both hands.Eugene asked once more, \u201cNow, have you come to your senses?\u201d\u201cUuu\u2026. Uwahhh\u2026,\u201d Eward could only sob in reply.\u201cAh, sorry,\u201d Eugene belatedly realized something. \u201cYou might not be able to recognize me because I currently have my appearance tweaked a bit.\u201dEugene immediately removed the transformation spell and returned to his original appearance. Eward\u2019s eyes finally widened in recognition. His tear-filled eyes wavered, looking around desperately for help as he stammered, \u201cEu-Eu-Eugene.\u201d\u201cHey, big brother,\u201d Eugene casually greeted him.\u201cYou\u2014 Wh-what are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI followed you here, big brother.\u201dIn his heart, he would much rather curse Eward out, but, for now, Eugene decided to address Eward as his big brother in a friendly tone.\u201cJust what were you thinking?\u201d he asked.\u201c...Umm\u2026 Wha\u2014?\u201d Eward mumbled uncomprehendingly.\u201cI\u2019m asking you, just what on earth were you thinking, big brother? I mean, I really have tried to sympathize with your situation, and I get that you\u2019re under a lot of stress, you know? Since your reality stinks like shit, I get that you might want to play around in the sweet depths of a succubus dream.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I was just\u2014\u201d\u201cI thought that it was pathetic and stupid of you, but it wasn\u2019t like I couldn\u2019t understand why you were doing it. And the lifeforce that you were offering to the succubus belonged to you in the first place, right, big brother? So it\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to escape from reality by getting satisfaction from your dreams. However, this is just going too far.\u201dGrind.Eugene pressed down on Eward\u2019s temples with both hands. The vice-like pressure caused Eward\u2019s eyes to become red and bloodshot. He tried to twist himself free of Eugene\u2019s hands, but Eugene refused to let go of Eward.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to get involved with black magic,\u201d Eugene solemnly stated, keeping up the pressure.Eward groaned, \u201cAaah\u2026. Ughhh\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs the eldest son of the Lionheart\u2019s direct line, the man next in line to become the Patriarch\u2026 how could you try and make a contract with a demonfolk? And with something like an incubus at that?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026. I-I just couldn\u2019t help it\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, you couldn\u2019t help it? You crazy bastard!\u201d Eugene suddenly roared. \u201cDo you even know what happens if you get into black magic with a contract instead of at least learning how to use it with the proper method? Your soul becomes the property of the demonfolk. You become a slave who kills when told to kill and dies when told to die.\u201dThere were two methods to start learning black magic.One method was to slowly learn how to control demonic power. However, it wasn\u2019t really a method that just anyone could pull off. Unless you were\u00a0a truly exceptional wizard, you wouldn\u2019t be able to learn how to control demonic power all on your own.As such, most black wizards used the other method. Which was to make a contract with a demonfolk. Even if you were lacking in skill, you could still at least make a contract; and even if you couldn\u2019t control demonic power on their own, you could still receive demonic power from the demonfolk you had contracted with.Most black wizards raised their strength using the demonic power they received from the demonfolk they were contracted to. Thus, even with pitiful talents, they could quickly raise their levels, but no matter how strong they became, they could no longer escape their ties to the demonfolk.Eugene unleashed a storm of questions, \u201cDo you really think that this is a problem that will affect only you? Do you truly understand what will happen if you become a black wizard?\u201cLet\u2019s see, the first thing to fall into the gutter because of you would probably be the family\u2019s honor. But that\u2019s only the start of it. What if the demonfolk you contracted with told you to kill your mother? Then your father, and finally your siblings. What would you do if he asked you to bring him the main family\u2019s White Flame Formula and all the treasures in the treasure vault?\u201d\u201cH-he said that I wouldn\u2019t need to show him unconditional obedience,\u201d Eward protested with a disgruntled expression. \u201cHe said that he would treat me with proper consideration\u2014! That he wouldn\u2019t give me any impossible or irrational orders\u2026. Th-that\u2019s what he promised.\u201d\u201cWho promised that?\u201d Eugene sneered. \u201cWas it that fucking incubus bastard? You idiot, do you really think that the demonfolk are like the dragons or the elves? To them, breaking a promise is as easy as a flick of the wrist.\u201dEward tried to argue, \u201cB-but\u2026 our ancestor and the Demon Kings\u2014\u201d\u201cThat fucking oath was made with a Demon King! Do you really think that a promise made with a smallfry incubus will have the same power?\u201d With this cry, Eugene tightened the hold he had on Eward\u2019s head instead of releasing it. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to show him unconditional obedience? That\u2019s right, you won\u2019t need to. You\u00a0can\u00a0refuse to obey his orders; as long as you\u2019re prepared to die that is. But you, do you really have the guts to do that? Could you really disobey him if it meant that you would die instead?\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eward couldn\u2019t say anything in his defense.Eugene sneered, \u201cAs if you could do something like that. You\u2019re just a bastard who can\u2019t even defend yourself and instead escapes into alcohol and dreams.\u201d\u201cY-you\u2026.\u201d As tears fell from his eyes, Eward\u2019s voice found some strength, \u201cYou\u2026 what the hell gives you the right to judge me?\u201d\u201cHah, fine then,\u201d with a snort, Eugene nodded his head in\u00a0challenge. \u201cYou think there\u2019s something wrong with what I just said? Then why don\u2019t you have a go at defending yourself, big brother?\u201d\u201cYou, you have no idea. You\u2014! Ever since four years ago, everyone has been paying attention to you. Since you were adopted into the main family, fa\u2014fath\u2014the Patriarch has been raining down support on you, so how could you\u2014?!\u201d\u201cIf someone else was listening to you, they might think you were being discriminated against. But you\u2019ve also received a lot of support, haven\u2019t you, big brother? Weren\u2019t you also granted access to the leyline? And haven\u2019t you also inherited the White Flame Formula? Then, because you wanted to learn magic, they even sent you off to Aroth, and you were even given a chance to become the disciple of a Tower Master. Am I wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been getting the same amount of support as you, big brother. I\u2019m not this great because the Patriarch favored me over you, but it\u2019s just because\u00a0I was born this amazing.\u201dThese words caused Eward\u2019s shoulders to tremble in anger.Eugene continued, \u201cNot only was I born with great talent, but I also put in just as much effort to become great. I bet I\u2019ve worked a lot harder than you, right, big brother?\u201d\u201cJust because\u2026 you\u2019re innately talented\u2026 it\u2019s impossible for me to compare to you\u2026!\u201d Eward squeezed out these bitter words.\u201cSo that's why you tried to get into black magic?\u201d Eugene asked. \u201cThat's why you would sign a contract with an incubus, drag your family\u2019s name through the mud, and give up everything you have? And just how far do you think you\u2019d get by doing that?\u201dEugene let go of Eward\u2019s head. He lifted a finger to draw Eward\u2019s attention and pointed to the black wizard kneeling on the floor beside them.\u201cEven if I fought a bastard like that with my eyes closed, I could still kill him within ten seconds,\u201d Eugene confidently stated.\u201c...,\u201d Eward bit his lip in silence.\u201cWith the help of black magic, that\u2019s about as far as you could go. Did you really think that the strength you would get from signing a contract with an incubus would be all that amazing? Ah, right. You might have been able to somehow use him as an intermediary so that you could sign a contract with the Queen of the Night Demons. Was that what you were hoping for, big brother?\u201dEward\u2019s cheeks trembled as he clenched his teeth. Bullseye!\u00a0Eugene snorted and shook his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you really think that you\u2019d be able to become the Patriarch with the power of black magic?\u201d\u201cI-I never,\u201d Eward\u2019s eyes twisted into a glare as he struggled to continue speaking. \u201cI never wanted\u2026 to become the Lionheart clan\u2019s Patriarch\u2026!\u201d\u201cThen what were you planning to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to become a bl-black wizard and go to Helmuth. In a place like that, I\u2019d be free\u2026, and my worth would be recognized\u2026!\u201d\u201cHah, this son of a bitch,\u201d Eugene\u2019s face twisted into a grimace as he knocked Eward on the head. \u201cWhy would you want to receive the approval of demonfolk? Which do you think is better, being recognized by your family or being recognized by the demonfolk? And do you really think they would respect you? I think you\u2019ve got something mixed up, big brother. Without your background as the eldest son of the main family, you really don\u2019t have any value to them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why, even more so, I want to get rid of that title! I never wanted to become the next Patriarch, and I never asked to be born as the eldest son of the direct line! I want to be free, to be able to do what I want to do\u2014.\u201d\u201cHow greedy can you get?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWith your current background, aren\u2019t you already free to do as you please while receiving support for your goals as well? What more do you want?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. There\u2019s a lot of things I can\u2019t\u2014.\u201d\u201cEnough, I don\u2019t need to hear anymore. For now, just know this, big brother. I can\u2019t understand why you did this, and I don\u2019t want to understand. What is there to talk about with a bastard who thinks he\u2019s the only one who's got it unfair and challenging? A bastard who has had so many things granted to him from birth that others can only wish for, who makes up all sorts of excuses while whining about this and that,\u201d Eugene grumbled as he pulled away from Eward. \u201cWhile you were in Aroth, drinking, doing drugs, and getting lost in your dreams, Cyan and Ciel, who stayed at the main estate, were truly giving it their best effort to improve themselves. Not to mention me.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eward had run out of excuses.\u201cThat\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d Eugene dismissed his excuses.There was no value in continuing the conversation. Eugene spun around like a whirlwind and kicked the back of the black wizard, who was still quietly kneeling down.The black wizard grunted, \u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cJust stay still and don\u2019t come up with any nonsense,\u201d Eugene warned him.The black wizard protested, \u201cI-I wasn\u2019t doing anything\u2026!\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d said Eugene. \u201cBut you probably were thinking of doing something stupid, right?\u201dThe black wizard\u2019s body shook slightly. Was this monstrous brat even able to read other people\u2019s minds?But of course, Eugene wasn\u2019t a mindreader. He had just given the guy a kick to relieve his own mounting irritation.Eugene didn\u2019t miss the fact that the black wizard had flinched, \u201cSo you really were thinking of doing something stupid? Okay then, you were asking for this.\u201dHe kicked the black wizard once more, sending him rolling across the floor with a cry of pain.* * *Laws existed even in this chaotic street. While the guards in charge of this street might close their eyes to the usual commotions occurring because of corruption and the unwritten rules, the current uproar had gotten out of hand.Buildings along the center of the street were shaking, walls were collapsing, and other such chaos ensued. Even the guards killing time while enjoying the pleasures of the street couldn\u2019t ignore such an uproar.\u201cSir\u2026 Eugene\u2026 Lionheart\u2026,\u201d the red-faced captain of the guards, who had just arrived, mouthed these words.These three words kept flashing through the captain\u2019s wine-soaked head as he realized that things were fucked. Although it was common for incidents to occur on Bolero Street, this was the first time that such an influential figure had been involved. In the first place, such public figures rarely caused such a huge uproar, even if they did get involved with some incident.\u201cIt was self-defense,\u201d Eugene said as he spread his arms, gesturing to his surroundings. \u201cMy drunk older brother was half-carried to this location, so I was just following him to check if he was being kidnapped. When I tried to go in after him, I was stopped, so I asked them what kind of place this was. But what was I supposed to do when they started threatening me and trying to steal my wallet?\u201d\u201c...,\u201d the captain played dumb.\u201cSo to protect myself and my wallet, I fought with them. As for what happened inside\u2014\u201d\u201cI-I think we\u2019ve got a good idea of what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d the guard captain interrupted Eugene with a desperate laugh, sweat pouring profusely down his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to handle the clean-up, so if the good Sir Eugene could please leave this scene to us\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just leave and take my big brother with me. Along with that bastard,\u201d Eugene said, pointing to the black wizard.At this, the black wizard turned to look at the guard captain with a desperate look on his face.This was an unbearably embarrassing incident for the city. Drugs were supposedly forbidden in Aroth. Although they might only pay lip-service to this rule, turning a blind eye to its distribution and use of drugs, the fact that a drug den had been revealed in the middle of the street wasn\u2019t something that could be covered up by the unwritten rules.Moreover, both the black wizards and the Lionheart clan were caught up in this mess. If he just let them go like this, the guard captain\u2019s own head might be sent flying. The number of prominent figures who had ties to this street was too many to count, so if things went on as they were, even if the guard captain didn\u2019t have anything to do with all this, they might just cut off his head as part of a cover-up.Coming to a decision, the guard captain said, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. My apologies, but I don\u2019t think we can allow you to do that. We\u2019ll perform our own interrogation on that black wizard\u2014\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d a cold voice descended from the sky.Eugene, who had been looking at the captain of the guards with a pitying gaze, lifted his head to look up into the sky.Lovellian was standing high up in the air.\u201cHow am I supposed to trust you to interrogate the suspect when you\u2019ve been keeping your eyes shut to the things going on under your jurisdiction?\u201d Lovellian demanded.\u201cH-head wizard,\u201d the guard captain stammered.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this incident myself. If you have any complaints, you can call for the commander of the guards. Although I have to say, I don\u2019t believe that he will oppose me and be a stickler on this issue.\u201dLovellian descended to the ground. The guard captain gave in and speechlessly bowed his head low. Though, he wasn\u2019t the only one to do so.\u2018Damn it, he got here so quickly,\u2019\u00a0the black wizard thought as his face twisted into a terrible scowl.But there was no way that the news should have been able to reach the far-off Red Tower of Magic so quickly? He couldn\u2019t understand how the Tower Master, who held little interest in anything other than magic, could have arrived here so soon.\u201cI'm sorry to have called you when you\u2019re already so busy,\u201d Eugene apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Lovellian replied as he took a calming breath.Eugene was the one who had summoned Lovellian. He had ordered the guide to do so through the communication terminal. Although he could have chosen to rely on the Lionheart name to purchase his way out, looking at the broader picture, he thought it would make for a neater ending if he got Lovellian\u2019s assistance rather than relying on his family\u2019s name.Eugene began to explain, \u201cIf you would like to know what happened\u2014\u201d\u201cI can roughly understand the situation,\u201d Lovellian said as he shook his head. \u201c...It\u2019s because of my negligence that such an unfortunate incident has occurred.\u201dEward\u2019s body trembled in fear.Lovellian sighed, \u201c...Playing around with succubi, forgetting the worries of reality through your dreams. Although I thought it was a much-needed method of relaxation\u2026 it appears that I made the wrong decision. My apologies, Eugene.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize to me,\u201d Eugene attempted to wave it off.\u201cNo, I do need to apologize to you. Of course, I will be apologizing to Sir Gilead and Lady Tanis as well, but I\u2019m also guilty for allowing you to witness such an ugly scene, Eugene. Furthermore, you performed the duties that I should have taken care of.\u201dLovellian was also similar to Eugene in his disdain for black wizards. Just like his revered great master, the Wise Sienna, her disciples also despised black wizards.Lovellian, in particular, as Gilead\u2019s long-time friend, was well aware of just how absurd it was for a member of the Lionheart clan to get involved with black magic.\u201cH-head Wizard,\u201d Eward attempted to speak even as his body continued trembling. \u201cThis is\u2026 I was just\u2026 I-I didn\u2019t do it. I haven\u2019t started learning black magic.\u201d\u201cBut you tried to, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Lovellian stared at Eward with cold eyes, \u201cEward. You have\u2026 tarnished the name of the Lionheart clan. You have insulted Sir Gilead, who trusted you and left you to my care. Also, you have insulted Samuel, who chose to teach you, and you have insulted me, who chose to overlook all your foibles.\u201dEward stammered, \u201cN-no, I didn\u2019t intend to do any of that. I was just\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you continue to make any more excuses, I will\u2026 I will just have to show you the cost of your insults immediately. And I really am tempted to do so,\u201d Lovellian interrupted, unwilling to listen to Eward\u2019s words. \u201cSo please, don\u2019t say another word. If you want to continue making excuses, don\u2019t spout them to me. Tell them to Samuel, who taught you, Gilead, who sent you here, and Tanis.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 uwaaah\u2026,\u201d Eward buried his head in his hands and burst into tears.Lovellian looked down at this sight with a pitying gaze before letting out a long sigh.\u201c...Let us return,\u201d with these words, Lovellian turned away from Eward, and Eugene also didn\u2019t spare him another glance.Still, at the center of everyone else\u2019s gazes, Eward bowed his head to hide his face.As tears continued to wring themselves from his trembling frame, the light in Eward\u2019s eyes flickered and died.The night air was cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had held a pure passion and interest for magic. Born as the eldest son of the Lionheart clan\u2019s direct line with an excessive amount of expectations placed on him, Eward had held a much greater interest in reading books and learning magic than he had in learning how to swing a sword and move his body.However, just because he was interested in it didn\u2019t mean he had a talent for it. This was\u00a0actually pretty\u00a0common. Most people unfortunately didn\u2019t have a lot of talent for the things they really liked and wanted to do.But Eward had felt betrayed by this. To the same extent that he had once felt love and hope for learning magic, Eward felt frustrated by how different his reality was from his ideal.Eward\u2019s suffering wasn\u2019t particularly cruel or uncommon. It was something that had happened to a lot of people.Although Eward held a great passion and interest in magic, even going so far as to harbor love for it, magic didn\u2019t return Eward\u2019s affections.* * *Gilead hadn't waited for dawn, though it was already late at night. A few minutes past midnight, Gilead arrived at the capital of Aroth. Then he immediately headed to the Red Tower of Magic.And Gilead wasn\u2019t the only one to come to the Red Tower of Magic at this midnight hour.On the top floor of the Red Tower of Magic, along with Lovellian and Eugene, a man wearing a pair of black-framed glasses was waiting in his seat.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d the man greeted them politely.His name was Balzac Ludbeth.He was a powerful black wizard who had been occupying the seat of Black Tower Master for the past few decades. He got up from his chair and bowed his head deeply to Gilead.\u201cMy name is Balzac Ludbeth,\u201d he introduced himself.\u201c...I am Gilead Lionheart,\u201d Gilead reluctantly returned the greeting.Glaring at Balzac, Gilead gave the man a slight bow of the head, then exchanged a short glance with Eugene.Tanis, who had accompanied Gilead, absolutely refused to bow her head to the man. Biting on her bottom lip, she glared at both Eugene and Balzac.\u201c...What are\u00a0you\u00a0doing here?\u201d she demanded harshly.Tanis couldn\u2019t contain her surging emotions. Eward was her only son, the one who was meant to become the next Patriarch of the main family. But because he was more interested in magic than martial arts, she had reluctantly released him from her watchful eye so he could go and cultivate himself. But her beloved son had actually attempted to learn black magic. Tanis absolutely refused to accept such a terrible reality.\u201cPlease calm yourself,\u201d Lovellian requested in a gloomy voice. \u201c...This incident has nothing to do with the Black Tower Master.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is that!\u201d Tanis cried out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Eward was tempted into dabbling with black magic?! But are you really going to look me in the eye and expect me to believe that the Black Tower Master had nothing to do with it?!\u201d\u201cThe Black Tower of Magic does not hold authority over all the black wizards in Aroth.\u201d As he sat back down, Balzac continued to speak, \u201cAs for the black wizard responsible for this unfortunate affair\u2026. Although we now know that his name is Gavid, he is not a member of the Black Tower of Magic. He is only a member of the Wizards Guild.\u201dThe Wizards Guild was known as the largest community of wizards in the world. However, it didn\u2019t have as much prestige as it had scale. Unlike the guild, which allowed anyone to join as long as they could use magic, the Towers of Magic were far more exclusive and would only accept those with genuinely exceptional skills.\u201cAlthough strictly speaking, I might also be a member of the Wizards Guild, that does not make me consider Gavid to even merit being an associate. Wouldn\u2019t you agree that that is the case?\u201d While pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose, he gave Lovellian a glance, \u201cFor example, while we both might be wizards belonging to the guild, I\u2019m afraid that the Red Tower Master and I don\u2019t consider ourselves as part of the same fraternity.\u201dThough he remained silent, Lovellian nodded in agreement. Still furious, Tanis attempted to continue speaking, but Gilead raised his hand to prevent her from doing so.\u201cBut you still haven\u2019t explained why you\u2019re here,\u201d Gilead pointed out in a cold voice.If he claimed that the Black Tower of Magic wasn\u2019t involved in this incident, why had Balzac insisted on being here? Gilead\u2019s concealed rage made the air in the room grow cold.However, Balzac wasn\u2019t overwhelmed by Gilead\u2019s hostility and instead calmly admitted, \u201cThe reason I\u2019m here is to take responsibility for this matter.\u201dAs the Patriarch of the Lionheart Clan\u2019s main family, Gilead was one of a handful of the strongest people on the continent.But so was Balzac. Decades ago, he had originally been in line to become the next Tower Master of the\u00a0Blue\u00a0Tower\u00a0of Magic. Now he was one of only three legendary black wizards to have signed a personal contract with the Demon King of Incarceration.Balzac continued, \u201cAlthough Gavid isn\u2019t a member of the Black Tower of Magic, as the Black Tower Master, I intend to take responsibility for the problems that Gavid has caused.\u201d\u201cResponsibility?\u201d Gilead questioned.\u201cYes, for tempting Eward into learning black magic and arranging such a contract,\u201d Balzac confirmed. \u201cStrictly speaking, these cannot be considered \u2018crimes.\u2019\u201dHundreds of years ago, just learning black magic would cause one to be sentenced as a criminal and executed. However, after the treaty agreed upon between the Great Vermouth and the Demon Kings was signed, learning black magic had become a personal right.Balzac elaborated, \u201cThough that might be the case\u2026. I hope to show proper regard to the Lionheart clan\u2019s stance on this matter.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really like the sound of your words,\u201d Gilead spat out. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re saying that, for the sake of the Lionheart clan\u2019s prestige, you\u2019re willing to bow your head in apology even though you don\u2019t really need to. Have I got that right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Balzac immediately responded without any attempt at denying it.Pop.Gilead\u2019s knuckles clenched. His killing intent ratcheted up a level, causing space itself to tremble. As Eugene assessed the killing intent in the air, he glanced down at the goosebumps being raised on his forearms. He had felt such levels of killing intent countless times in his past life. But the body he had been reincarnated into, which had only ever experienced this life, was trembling in the face of the killing intent.\u201cIt isn\u2019t something I strictly need to take responsibility for, and I hope you understand that.\u201d A ghastly wave of killing intent had engulfed Balzac. Still, even in the midst of this, his face remained calm as he continued, \u201cHowever, I wish to take responsibility anyway, as a fellow black wizard. Because I have no desire to lose the current amicable peace that we have maintained with the Lionheart Clan because of this incident.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s how you really feel, how about getting down on your knees?\u201d Tanis demanded in a sharp tone.Balzac immediately got up from his seat and, without any hesitation, said, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you desire.\u201dAs Balzac was about to kneel down, Gilead shook his head violently and shouted, \u201cStop, there\u2019s no need for that.\u201dReluctantly, Gilead continued, \u201c...I will gratefully accept your offer of nonobligatory responsibility. But there is one thing that concerns me. I fear that you may be attempting to cover up this incident in the name of taking responsibility.\u201d\u201cCrimes involving drugs are governed by the law of Aroth. Everyone caught in the drug den will be confined in Aroth\u2019s prison, leaving me unable to conceal anything,\u201d Balzac paused for a moment to give Gilead a look. \u201cUnless you would like to behead them yourself?\u201d\u201c...Such words seem like an insult to my honor,\u201d Gilead growled. \u201cAll I ask is that the laws of Aroth be applied fairly. By what right should I, as a foreigner, attempt to pass judgment over the laws of Aroth?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve done you a discourtesy,\u201d Balzac said as an apology.Gilead changed the subject, \u201cWhat will happen to the succubi?\u201d\u201cThe business they\u2019re operating isn\u2019t illegal. Even the hallucinogens they make use of in their store aren\u2019t considered drugs, but\u2026 there will be sanctions placed on them for allowing mistreatment of their patrons.\u201d\u201cThen how exactly are you supposed to be taking responsibility?\u201d Tanis hissed.As Balzac sat down once more, he replied, \u201cI have arranged for the incubus with whom Gavid is currently contracted and who attempted to sign a contract with Sir Eward to be beheaded.\u201d\u201c...I beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cBaron Eoin Olpher, an incubus who serves under Duke Giabella. As Duke Giabella was not involved in this scheme, she cannot claim any responsibility for it, but\u2026 the one who was directly involved with Gavid, Baron Olpher, will lose his head.\u201dBalzac raised his hand. At this movement, Gilead leaned his body slightly closer to Tanis. This was to protect her should something unexpected occur.Although Gilead\u2019s actions and attitude blatantly showed his caution and distrust of Balzac, Balzac did not feel offended by this. With a completely serene expression, he just drew his finger down through the air.Fwoosh.A black burst of flame ignited in mid-air and a scroll appeared.After waiting for the fire to die down, Balzac took the scroll and declared, \u201c...The Demon King of Incarceration has sent a personal message.\u201dEugene took firm hold of his body that was about to react unconsciously. He held back his rage. Nothing good would happen from pointlessly showing a reaction in this situation. His mind began to race in the place of his frozen body.The Demon King of Incarceration was one of Helmuth\u2019s two remaining Demon Kings. In his past life, Eugene hadn\u2019t been able to storm into the Demon King of Incarceration\u2019s castle.\u201cThe Demon King of Incarceration would like to convey his immense disappointment over causing such distress to the family of his good friend Vermouth,\u201d Balzac read out.His good friend Vermouth?!These words caused Eugene\u2019s stomach to turn. He wanted to immediately jump up from his seat and grab Balzac by the collar. He wanted to snap at the man to go and tell that Demon King he served to stop spouting such bullshit and just keep his trap shut.Eugene wasn\u2019t the only one whose expression twisted at these words. Gilead also began glaring at Balzac while biting down on his lips.Even as he ignored these looks, Balzac continued speaking, \u201cAs such, he declares that he will personally behead Eoin Olpher, and if desired, he can have the head delivered directly to the Lionheart clan.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Gilead ground out these words with a grimace.\u201c...If that\u2019s the case, I will inform him that just beheading the baron will be sufficient,\u201d Balzac said as he stood up once more. \u201cOnce again, allow me to bow my head in apology to you. While this arrangement may not be enough to appease your anger, Lord Patriarch, please know that neither the Demon King of Incarceration nor the Black Tower of Magic have any desire to offend the Lionheart Clan.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Gilead stayed grimly silent.\u201cWell then\u2026 I look forward to meeting you again under more pleasurable circumstances,\u201d with this farewell, Balzac made to leave.Before he exited the room, he shot a glance at Eugene. Eugene felt this gaze, but he didn\u2019t immediately return Balzac\u2019s look.There was a short silence.\u201c...I will take Eward back with me to the main estate when I return,\u201d Gilead was the first to speak. As he rubbed his stiff cheeks, he let out a long sigh and said, \u201cMaster Lovellian\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve made a grave error. All of this is my fault.\u201d\u201cNot at all. If I had only been more strict with Eward, something like this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Lovellian confessed with a similarly long sigh. He shook his head from side to side before bowing his head towards Tanis, \u201cMy sincere apologies.\u201d\u201c...Eward\u2026 what is that child doing now?\u201d Tanis asked, her eyes overflowing with resentment.She truly believed that Lovellian was at fault for Eward\u2019s error. If he had only accepted Eward as his disciple and had taught Eward with a whole-hearted zeal, then there was no way that her son would have gone out and done something like this.Eward didn\u2019t have enough talent to be his disciple? What did that even mean? There was no way her son, Eward, could be lacking in any form.\u201cI told him to rest in his room,\u201d\u00a0Lovellian replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Eward isn\u2019t\u2026 he hasn\u2019t truly dabbled in black magic. He just made an attempt, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Gilead remained stonily silent.Tanis pleaded, \u201cSince he knows that he\u2019s made a mistake, he won\u2019t do something like that again. If we treat this as a lesson, then he might even work harder from now on. So can\u2019t we just\u2026?\u201dTanis couldn\u2019t help but feel desperate. Cyan and Ciel were waiting for them at the main estate. While Eward was off in Aroth, Cyan and Ciel were busy winning the approval of the members of the main family. It was impossible for the eldest son, who had returned after causing a scandal, to obtain the main family members\u2019 approval at this point.That was why Eward had been sent to Aroth in the first place. Since he couldn\u2019t receive any recognition by staying at the main estate, Tanis had wanted him to win the approval of others in Aroth. She had hoped that by becoming the disciple of the Red Tower Master and interacting with other outstanding wizards, he would be able to form bonds and obtain power that wouldn\u2019t be available to him at the main estate.She needed\u00a0for Eward\u00a0to somehow remain in Aroth. If he were to become Lovellian\u2019s disciple, he could use the\u00a0Archwizard\u2019s\u00a0support to further develop himself. This scandal would also become just a trivial matter to be overlooked.Tanis attempted to persuade Gilead, \u201cIf he has the right conditions, Eward can do better. He has the talent for it. You know that too, right dear? Eward has always been fond of books and magic ever since he was young\u2014\u201d\u201cEnough,\u201d Gilead was tired of listening to such talk.He was well aware of how Eward had spent his days in Aroth. The results of Eward\u2019s four years here were futile and worthless. Although he had been granted every convenience and received plenty of support, Eward\u2019s magical abilities hadn\u2019t surpassed the Third Circle.Considering that he had been trained in controlling mana ever since he was young, this was an appalling level of skill. He could barely even be called a Third Circle wizard; in terms of both his understanding and his skills in magic, he was actually much worse than that.In a pained voice, Gilead remarked, \u201c...In over three hundred years of the Lionheart clan\u2019s history, there has never been a single member of the main family who became a black wizard.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026 it\u2019s just a folly of youth,\u201d Tanis\u2019s eyes wavered as she feebly tried to convince herself and others.Instead of answering immediately, Gilead exchanged looks with Eugene, \u00a0\u201c...I\u2019m sorry, Eugene. Could I ask you to step outside for a minute?\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene was just as reluctant to keep listening to such a difficult conversation.As Eugene got up, Tanis turned to glare at him, \u201c...I told you to get along with Eward. Even though I asked to take care of your big brother\u2014!\u201d\u201cTanis,\u201d Gilead\u2019s eyes snapped open to glare at Tanis. \u201cEugene has done nothing wrong. So why are you taking this out on him?\u201dTanis argued, \u201cThat brat could have just stopped Eward\u2026! But instead of taking care of the issue before then, he just quietly waited and allowed things to get to\u2014!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say another word!\u201d Gilead suddenly roared.Although Eugene, who had been standing there patiently, wondered whether or not he should say something to Tanis, in the end, he didn\u2019t dare to do so and just bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave now,\u201d Eugene said as he turned to leave.Staying here just to act as the target of Tanis\u2019 hatred would be an exhausting affair. After Eugene had left, Tanis glared at the closed door and took a deep breath.\u201c...I may have made an improper remark,\u201d Tanis admitted. \u201cBut Gilead, please reconsider.\u201d\u201cI will not change my decision. Even though Eward is my son, what that child has done has tarnished the clan\u2019s name. I cannot possibly allow the boy to remain in Aroth,\u201d Gilead stated.\u201cBut what place is left for our child at the main estate?!\u201d Tanis no longer begged her husband and instead vented all her feelings of resentment and frustration at him, \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing to secure Eward\u2019s position. Instead, you\u2019ve only listened to every demand of that damned Ancilla and her children, as well as that adopted child who doesn\u2019t even share a single drop of blood with you\u2026!\u201d\u201c...Do you really believe that?\u201d Gilead asked quietly, losing his anger. He looked at Tanis with disappointed eyes and said, \u201cI have given my children everything they have asked for. I sent Eward to Aroth because he wanted to learn magic\u2014\u201d\u201cIf that really was for Eward\u2019s sake!\u201d Tanis leaped out of her seat with this loud outburst. As she gasped for breath, she alternately glared at Lovellian and Gilead. \u201cThen you should have made sure that Eward became Lovellian\u2019s disciple, no matter what\u2026! And if you were truly worried about Eward going wrong, you should have sent someone to monitor and control that child\u2026!\u201d\u201cPlease, just stop,\u201d Gilead let out a long sigh and dropped his face into his hands.Monitor and control? Wasn\u2019t it because Eward had hated such restrictions that he had left the main estate and gone to Aroth in the first place?\u00a0Gilead had placed his trust in his eldest son. Since Eward had been constantly monitored and burdened with expectations all his life, Gilead had believed that once he got to Aroth, he would be able to enjoy a better life, living by himself.The rumors about Eward getting close to succubi and demonfolk \u2014 Gilead had already been aware of them. But if that was all there was to it\u2026 Gilead could still allow it.However, black magic and drugs were going too far.\u201cPlease don\u2019t bring any more shame onto the Lionheart clan\u2026 and to myself,\u201d Gilead pleaded.Tanis shrieked, \u201cShame? Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If he returns to the main estate like this, I\u2019ll be the one who can\u2019t bear the shame of it all. I would much rather die than see that happen.\u201dGilead attempted to persuade her, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that remaining in Aroth will be good for Eward either. If he still has any desire left to learn magic, then at the main estate, we can\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re determined to take Eward back with you, then I will take Eward back to my family\u2019s estate,\u201d Tanis refused to give in.If they returned to the main estate like this, all of her plans would be messed up. Eward would be pushed out of his position by the twins, and Tanis by Ancilla, turning them into a pair of figureheads.\u201cI will definitely never allow Eward to remain trapped at the main estate. I would rather have him stay at my family\u2019s home, where he can learn magic without fear of being oppressed,\u201d Tanis said, her words showing utter sincerity.Tanis had no desire to receive Ancilla\u2019s ridicule, and there was still time to decide who the next Patriarch would be. As such, no matter how, Eward needed to develop enough strength to solidify his bid for the position. If he just returned to the main family like this, it would be impossible for him to turn the tables on his siblings.\u201c...If that\u2019s what you desire,\u201d Gilead sighed as he closed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t decide which course of action was correct, so he gave in, \u201c...As long as Eward agrees, you may do as you please.\u201dThat was the only thing he could say.* * *\u201cSir Eugene Lionheart,\u201d Balzac greeted Eugene from where he was standing on the other side of the corridor.Although the man had left the room first, he hadn\u2019t departed immediately and had instead chosen to wait for Eugene.\u201cUnder the circumstances, we weren\u2019t able to speak comfortably despite this being our first meeting,\u201d Balzac observed.Eugene bluntly replied, \u201cI have no desire to have a comfortable conversation with you, Tower Master.\u201dInstead of bowing his head in greeting, Eugene tilted his head away at an angle as a way to overtly show his displeasure. Seeing this reaction, Balzac just grinned.\u201cIt looks like you don\u2019t like me very much,\u201d Balzac pointed out.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Black Tower Master I dislike; I despise all black wizards,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cIs that so? I can understand why. Although three hundred years may have passed, the public\u2019s perception of black magic still isn\u2019t very pleasant,\u201d as he said this, Balzac shrugged. \u201cAs a black wizard myself, I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s unfortunate. Although it might seem unreliable coming from my own lips, I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201dEugene countered, \u201cEven if the Black Tower Master himself hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, aren\u2019t there a lot of black wizards going around doing evil deeds?\u201dThis was an undeniable fact. Unfortunately, there were still a lot of black wizards freely wandering the world, violating the ban on human experimentation. Though the laws of Aroth and the Black Tower of Magic severely enforced this ban, there were plenty of places for black wizards to escape from these strict laws in this wide world.\u201cBut the black wizards aren\u2019t the only ones, are they?\u201d Balzac pointed out as he bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cPeople like wizards can easily sacrifice something like morals for the sake of satisfying their own curiosity and desire. Or, to put it in simple terms, there are many times more aberrant \u2018wizards\u2019\u00a0than there are aberrant black wizards.\u201d\u201cWell, you might be right about that, but\u2026.\u201d Eugene hesitantly agreed.\u201cIsn\u2019t Eward one such example? He is just a \u2018wizard,\u2019 not a black wizard. He was only trying to use black magic as a means to achieve his own ends. Although it might not have worked out\u2026 this affair with Eward didn\u2019t begin because of black magic, but because of his own desires.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is it that you want to hear from me?\u201d Eugene asked impatiently.\u201cI just hope that you\u2019ll agree to not transfer your dislike of black magic onto me,\u201d with a chuckle, Balzac walked over to Eugene and offered his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, Sir Eugene. Your performance in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony has been famous for several years now\u2026 and I\u2019ve also heard that recently you\u2019ve shown a few great accomplishments in magic as well.\u201dEugene frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything that can be considered \u2018a great accomplishment.\u2019\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you get the Red Tower Master to write you a letter of recommendation for Akron?\u201d Balzac raised a brow. \u201cThat alone must mean your achievements were great enough to deserve such recognition, Sir Eugene.\u201dEugene refused to take Balzac\u2019s extended hand. While casually lowering his hand back down, Balzac stared at Eugene. He then changed the subject, \u201cAlthough I wasn\u2019t able to tell you this inside the room, part of the \u2018responsibility\u2019 that I\u2019ve decided to take for this incident also involves you, Sir Eugene.\u201d\u201c...What do you mean by that?\u201d Eugene asked cautiously.\u201cIt will be difficult for you to qualify for admission into Akron with just a letter of recommendation from the Red Tower Master. Because unfortunately for you, Sir Eugene, the other tower masters and wizards involved in making the decision will reject you on the grounds that you lack the necessary qualifications.\u201d\u201cSo what? Are you saying that you will write me a letter of recommendation as well, Head Wizard Balzac?\u201d\u201cI hold a great interest in your talent Eugene. And, well, that\u2019s not the only factor\u2026.\u201d Balzac glanced at the closed door before continuing to speak, \u201cAnother factor is that I don\u2019t have the best of relationships with Head Wizard Lovellian. While I don\u2019t hold any bad feelings towards him, the Red Tower Master dislikes me just because I am a Black Wizard. On top of that, I feel like I may receive the Lionheart clan\u2019s enmity because of this incident\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo because of that, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ll write me a letter of recommendation?\u201d\u201cYes. Honestly speaking, even if I do write you a letter of recommendation that supports Head Wizard Lovellian\u2019s proposal\u2026. Well, I don\u2019t expect that alone will be enough to make you like me, but won\u2019t it at least reduce your dislike of me? It will also show my sincerity to get along with the Lionheart clan.\u201d\u201cIf you are offering to write one for me, I will gladly accept your help,\u201d Eugene replied with a frown.Although he disliked black wizards, that didn\u2019t mean he believed that his dislike should extend to the gifts that they offered.\u201cBut even if I do, I can\u2019t promise to be friends with you, Head Wizard Balzac,\u201d Eugene warned.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t dislike me as much as you do now, that will be enough.\u201d With a broad smile, Balzac stepped back, allowing Eugene to leave, \u201cThat\u2019s all that I wanted to say. My apologies for keeping you here.\u201d\u201cDid you really have nothing to do with my older brother\u2019s issue?\u201d as he passed Balzac, Eugene decided to openly ask this question.At these words, Balzac burst into laughter.\u201cI take great pride in being a black wizard,\u201d he said, the eyes hidden behind his glasses sparking. \u201cThe existence of an incompetent black wizard is just a disgrace to black magic. Even if he is the eldest son of the Lionheart family, as long as he doesn't possess astounding talent, I would never consider offering him a chance to join us. Is that enough to answer your question?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201dEugene clicked his tongue as he recalled the sight of Eward trembling as tears poured down his face.Pathetic bastard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It might be just because of his current mood, but he looked like he had aged by a few years since Eugene had last seen him.Hesitantly, Gilead revealed, \u201c...Eward is\u2026. It\u2019s been decided that he\u2019ll be accompanying Tanis to her family\u2019s estate.\u201d\u201cSo he won\u2019t be returning to the main estate?\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cHe\u2019ll be returning for a short while, but he\u2019ll be leaving immediately afterward to go to his maternal relatives. It\u2019s\u2026 understandable why she\u2019s doing this. If he just stays at the main estate, it will be difficult for him in many ways,\u201d Gilead muttered as he looked out the window. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t even have the slightest intention of blaming you since you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d\u201cI think I might be considered to have done wrong by beating up my older brother,\u201d Eugene confessed.\u201cIf all you did was hit him, then he got off lightly,\u201d though Gilead said this as if it was a joke, he didn\u2019t sound as amused as one might expect. \u201c...Tanis\u2019 family resides in Kiehl Empire\u2019s Bossar Fief. The ruler of that fief, Count Bossar, is my father-in-law. Since it\u2019s a quiet and peaceful place\u2026 it will be a good place for Tanis and Eward\u2019s hearts to recover.\u201d\u201cAre you worried that they might bear a grudge?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cI\u2019m only human after all, so of course I am,\u201d Gilead admitted with a bitter laugh. \u201cWhen I brought Ancilla into the main family for the clan's sake, I was already prepared to bear a lot of resentment for it. I don\u2019t\u2026 regret doing it. The Lionheart name is far too heavy to be borne by a single child. While I didn\u2019t want my children to be enemies, I did believe that some fraternal rivalry was necessary.\u201dEugene stayed silent, \u201c....\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I have no regrets,\u201d Gilead continued. \u201cAlthough Eward might be my eldest son\u2026 as a future Patriarch, his abilities were proving insufficient. So he needed siblings. He needed to be stimulated by a competitive rivalry to shore up his weaknesses and thus become someone suitable to be the next Patriarch\u2026. But it looks like I\u2019ve ultimately failed, both as a Patriarch and a father.\u201d\u201cSir Patriarch, you\u2019re a good man,\u201d Eugene said as he clicked his tongue in sympathy.Gilead wasn\u2019t someone who deserved such self-criticism. At least in Eugene\u2019s view, Gilead was a great Patriarch.\u201cThank you for saying that,\u201d Gilead rested his hand on Eugene\u2019s shoulder with a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019ve come to your room at such an early hour because I was worried that you might be feeling guilty because of this affair.\u201dEugene denied this, \u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be. Because you did the right thing. As for Eward and Tanis\u2026 don\u2019t worry about them. You don\u2019t need to worry about Gerhard while he\u2019s staying at the main estate either.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dEugene felt grateful for these words. Although Eugene had no reason to fear Tanis\u2019 resentment, he did feel a slight concern that Tanis might use this scandal as an excuse to oppress Gerhard. But now that Gilead had reassured him, there wasn\u2019t any need to feel concerned.\u2018On the other hand, Ancilla must be bursting with happiness right now, so she should take good care of my father.\u2019This was inarguable as Ancilla had been able to get rid of her two greatest obstacles, Tanis and Eward, without needing to do anything. Although it was unknown how long those two would be staying with their maternal relatives, during this time, Ancilla was sure to establish herself in her position as the Madam of the main estate.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from Lovellian how great you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Gilead said, his expression softening as he looked at Eugene. \u201cIt turns out that you possess amazing talent not just for martial arts but also for magic. And you haven\u2019t neglected your training for even a day since you\u2019ve arrived in Aroth. I really am so proud of how dedicated you are.\u201dEugene tried to downplay his achievements, \u201cIt\u2019s only because I\u2019m excited to learn something new.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\u00a0\u2018If only you weren\u2019t adopted.\u2019Gilead swallowed these words before they could spill out of his throat.Instead, he said, \u201c...Cyan and Ciel miss you greatly.\u201dEugene accepted the change of subject, \u201cAre they still working hard?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re working so hard, it\u2019s almost excessive. Cyan trains against Gion and me while saying that he will become stronger than you, and Ciel also regularly comes out of her room to spar with Cyan.\u201d\u201cEven though she wouldn\u2019t come out while I was there because she said that she hated the smell of sweat?\u201d\u201cWell, she\u2019s at a sensitive age, isn\u2019t she? Even though she always smiled at me and showed off her cute side when she was young\u2026. Talking about this makes me feel that time really has gone by pretty fast.\u201dGilead smiled as he reminisced on the young Ciel. Though he understood that Ciel was just growing up, he still sometimes missed his daughter\u2019s displays of cuteness.\u201cUm, Patriarch\u2026 there\u2019s also something else,\u201d Eugene reluctantly began to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s about how I\u2019ve recently needed to spend a lot of money.\u201d\u201cA lot of money?\u201d Gilead repeated curiously.Although he didn\u2019t know for sure yet whether Gargith had managed to win the bid for the giant\u2019s balls, it might come up as a surprise later, so Eugene had decided to bring it up in advance. Eugene coughed and began to explain about Gargith and his giant balls.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that he\u2019s bought some giant\u2019s testicles?\u201d Gilead\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.Just like Eugene, he couldn\u2019t understand how someone would want to purchase a giant\u2019s balls at such a high price.\u2018Is it really that good for your body?\u2019\u00a0Gilead wondered in disbelief.Well, even if it was truly that beneficial for his body, he wouldn\u2019t want to eat it. Since the giants are already so large, their testicles must be incredibly huge, so how could you eat something like that without going crazy?\u201cThat should be the case,\u201d Eugene confirmed.Still somewhat perturbed, Gilead hesitantly began to speak, \u201c...There\u2019s no\u2026 issue with that. If he truly needs it then\u2026 ahem\u2026 and I also have an acquaintance with Viscount Stellord\u2026.\u201dViscount Stellord was Gargith\u2019s father.As he recalled that bulging, muscle-bound relative of his, Gilead nodded and said, \u201c...Don\u2019t be concerned about spending money. No matter how expensive it might be, if you need something, feel free to buy it no matter what. However, just\u2026 please don\u2019t buy anything related to black magic.\u201d\u201cIs it okay for me to have something like that?\u201d Eugene asked as he pointed to a table in the corner of his room.On top of the table was the unicorn heart he had brought back from the drug den.\u201cIt\u2019s already been checked out by Master Lovellian,\u201d Eugene reassured him. \u201cAlthough it was intended to be used as a sacrifice, they didn\u2019t get around to truly offering it, so the Head Wizard said that it doesn\u2019t have any traces of black magic on it.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t have any problems with it,\u201d Gilead replied.\u201cIs it really okay for me to keep it?\u201d\u201cYou won it in battle, so I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\u201cBut the one who truly bought it was Eward\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Since you\u2019ve gone through a lot of trouble because of Eward, shouldn\u2019t you at least take something like that as compensation?\u201d As he said this, Gilead got up and continued, \u201cOf course, apart from that, if there\u2019s anything you need, feel free to buy it no matter how much it costs. You don\u2019t need to get my permission each and every time.\u201d\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Eugene gratefully replied.Although he had received this guarantee, Eugene didn\u2019t have anything he really wanted to buy. If he wandered through Bolero Street\u2019s auction houses, he might be able to find quite a few rare items, but apart from their inherent value, they wouldn\u2019t be of much use to Eugene.Of course, lumps of mana like a unicorn\u2019s heart or mana stones were of great help in increasing one\u2019s mana levels. However, it wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing to try and make excessive use of them just because of that. Rather than forcefully increasing the mana capacity, it was better to gradually increase the amount of mana that one had.\u2018Though I might be tempted if there was a Dragon Heart.\u2019No matter how useful the heart of a monster was, it was still just a monster\u2019s heart. They had a lot of impurities and lowered the purity of one\u2019s mana when used. The same went for mana stones. Mana obtained through this method wouldn\u2019t quite match one\u2019s body, and a lot of mana was lost during the process of refining it into the person\u2019s body.However, a dragon\u2019s heart was a different story. A pure lump of mana that, if absorbed properly, could allow the core to grow without any losses. But the only problem was that they were terribly difficult to find. It wasn\u2019t a question of whether or not it was even possible to hunt a dragon; the issue was that it was strictly forbidden.In his previous life, he and his comrades had been lucky enough to absorb a Dragon Heart. While they were venturing through Helmuth, they met a dying dragon\u2026 and following that dragon\u2019s last wishes, the party had taken the Dragon Heart and shared it between them.\u201cLooks like I need to go now,\u201d Gilead said as he looked out at the dawn sky. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come out and see me off. Besides, I\u2019m afraid that Tanis won\u2019t have anything pleasant to say if she sees you.\u201dEugene nodded and said, \u201cPlease give my regards to my father, Cyan, and Ciel. Oh, and Ancilla as well.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Gilead acknowledged with a smile.Make sure to keep working hard from now on.Gilead didn\u2019t feel the need to say something like that. Even if he didn\u2019t say anything, he was sure that Eugene would keep doing his best. Also, he didn\u2019t want to burden Eugene with any unnecessary words.\u2018Although I don\u2019t really believe that he\u2019ll feel burdened from something like that,\u2019\u00a0Gilead mused.But Eward hadn\u2019t been able to endure the pressure placed on him by his surroundings. That had made Gilead more cautious than before. After once again looking at Eugene with affectionate eyes, he left the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 39.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39.2: The Square (1)After Gilead had left, Eugene sighed, \u201cLooks like even Patriarchs\u00a0have it hard.\u201dAs expected, Eugene still didn\u2019t want to become the Patriarch. After reaffirming this desire, Eugene walked over to the unicorn\u2019s heart. There was no reason for him to pointlessly procrastinate, so he was thinking of absorbing the unicorn\u2019s heart right here and now.There were several methods for doing so.Although eating it directly was an okay way to go about it, Eugene didn\u2019t choose to use such a barbaric method. While circulating the White Flame Formula, he reached out to the heart.\u2018This is the cleanest and easiest way to do it,\u2019\u00a0Eugene nodded.He would only be extracting the mana from the heart. This was the cleanest way to do it if one could exert complete control over the mana. Eugene concentrated his focus and grabbed the unicorn\u2019s heart.Vwuuuu!The heart began to shake from vibrations. The mana contained within was drawn out completely before being absorbed by Eugene. Eugene did not lose focus as he examined the purity of the mana.\u2018Good. There aren\u2019t that many impurities.\u2019The huge amount of mana was circulated to his cores. From here on was the most crucial step. He needed to have his cores refine the mana while removing any unnecessary impurities. The trio of stars around his heart began to shine brighter as they went to work. As Eugene calmly directed the mana to flow into his cores, he fell into thought.\u2018If it\u2019s like this, it seems like I might be able to reach the Fourth Star before I turn 20.\u2019If the people at the main estate had heard this, they might have fainted from the surprise. In the three hundred years of the Lionheart Clan\u2019s history, not a single ancestor had managed to reach the Fourth Star before becoming an adult.\u2018Although I can\u2019t be sure that a star will form just because the quantity of my mana increases.\u2019After four years of practicing the White Flame Formula, Eugene had realized something. The increase in stars wasn\u2019t dependent solely on the amount of mana possessed but also on how deep the understanding of the White Flame Formula was and how skilled one was at circulating it through their whole body.In this respect, Eugene held an overwhelming advantage over his predecessors due to his past life, both in terms of improving his depth of understanding and his skill in circulating it throughout his body. These were both things that Eugene was definitely capable of doing.\u2018The Patriarch and Gion are at the Sixth Star. Vermouth had reached the Tenth Star.\u2019Reaching the Sixth Star alone was enough to get you recognized as one of a handful of the strongest warriors on the continent.\u2018It looks like I\u2019ll have to start mixing things up before I reach the Fifth Star.\u2019Eugene had no intention of blindly following the path left by the White Flame Formula. Since he had already learned a lot of things from his previous life, he felt that he might as well meld the formula together with everything he had inherited from Hamel.\u2018But it\u2019s still too early for that.\u2019Right now, he\u00a0was\u00a0only seventeen. There was no need to be hasty. As he thought this, Eugene took his hand off the unicorn\u2019s heart. After all the mana had been sucked out of the heart, it had shrunk to the size of a finger. With a flick of his mana, he disintegrated the heart.Then he took out the fragment of the Moonlight Sword that he had kept in his vest and placed it on the windowsill.\u201c...Now I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d he murmured.The fragment absorbed the moonlight shining in from outside the window and began to emit a soft, pale light.Eugene admired the light for a few moments.* * *\u201cThey cost 300 million sals,\u201d Gargith said as he handed Eugene\u2019s card back to him with a proud look on his face.Eugene couldn\u2019t help but blurt out a curse, \u201cMotherfucker.\u201d\u201cI arranged for us to deposit the payment through a public bank. If we don\u2019t make the deposit before noon today, the right to purchase them will be transferred to the next highest bidder, so we need to hurry,\u201d prompted Gargith.\u201cCan\u2019t we just let them have it?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. After all, I had to participate in such an explosive bidding war just to win the bid.\u201d\u201cHow much was its initial price?\u201d\u201cFifty million sals.\u201d\u201cFifty million sals for a giant\u2019s balls\u2026 And it went up from there to 300 million sals? There really are just so many crazy bastards in this world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s just that valuable,\u201d Gargith said with a happy smile. \u201cIf you were there to see it in person, you would probably understand what I\u2019m feeling.\u201dEugene scoffed, \u201cEven if I do see the giant balls in person, they definitely will just look like balls.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s different,\u201d Gargith insisted. \u201cOverwhelmingly so.\u201d\u201cAt the very least, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll definitely be overwhelmingly big. Were they hairy?\u201d Eugene asked in morbid curiosity.\u201cThey looked really neat after they had been spruced up.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say another word because I really don\u2019t want to imagine what that looked like. Anyways\u2026 how do we go about making that deposit?\u201dEugene and Gargith had arrived\u00a0at Pentagon\u2019s\u00a0public bank. They were here to deposit the cost of the balls into the auction house\u2019s secret account. Eugene was feeling flustered, as this was his first time at a bank since he was reborn, and he didn\u2019t know the first thing about making a deposit into another person\u2019s account.\u201cIs this really your first time at a bank?\u201d Gargith asked.Eugene hesitated to admit it, \u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026,\u201d Gargith trailed off in shock. \u201cI had heard that Gidol was in the boonies, but they don\u2019t even have banks there? How is something like that even possible?\u201dGargith was looking at Eugene with a sincere expression of disbelief. Eugene simply couldn\u2019t accept being treated like a bumpkin by someone with shaggy hair, strong body odor, bulging muscles, who wore frilly clothes, and who had bought giant\u2019s testicles for 300 million sals.\u201cGidol has a bank as well,\u201d Eugene insisted.\u201cThen why are you acting like this is your first time?\u201d\u201cBecause I never had a reason to visit it\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo it turns out that you\u2019re a country bumpkin.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t spout such bullshit. You can grab any passerby and ask them who looks more like a country bumpkin between the two of us, and we\u2019ll see what they say.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to judge people by their appearances.\u201d\u201cThis son of a\u2014\u201dAlthough Eugene really wanted to curse at him, Gargith\u2019s words were more or less correct\u2026.Eventually, Eugene came up with a rebuttal, \u201c...Is it really the right thing to call someone a country bumpkin just because they\u2019ve never been to a bank before?\u201d\u201cYou just need to go up to one of the windows and tell them that you need to make a deposit to this account,\u201d Gargith explained.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me?\u201d\u201cYou would usually get a ticket number, but since we\u2019re transferring such a large amount and even have a black card, there shouldn\u2019t be any need to wait. Follow me.\u201d\u201cAnswer me, you pig bastard.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a pig.\u201dRight up until they reached the counter, Gargith refused to answer his question. Sure enough, once they approached one of the bank employees and showed them the black card, they were immediately escorted to a private VIP room.\u201cThank you for visiting our bank,\u201d the head of the bank came out personally to accept the card while bowing his head.Before too long, they had finished setting up the deposit, and the bank manager returned with the card.The bank manager began peddling his services, \u201cDo you have any interest in opening up a separate personal account? If you make one now\u2014\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d Eugene interrupted as he took the card and headed out of the bank.Smiling happily, Gargith followed behind Eugene.\u201cLet\u2019s head to my place,\u201d Gargith suggested.\u201cWhy?\u201d came the curt response.\u201cThey said they\u2019d make the delivery as soon as they received our deposit.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me to go all the way to your place just to get a look at those giant balls? Are you insane?\u201d\u201cIf you see them for yourself, you\u2019re sure to change your mind about them. I\u2019ve said it before, but if you want, I can give you some of their extract once it\u2019s been made.\u201d\u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t going to eat any of that shit.\u201d\u201cI just can\u2019t understand you\u2026.\u201d\u201c...For now, let\u2019s head to your place.\u201d\u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d\u201cApart from the giant\u2019s balls, there\u2019s something else I want to see.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t have any interest in those balls, he was interested in the Red Flame Formula that Gargith had inherited. While he had already taken a look at Gerhard\u2019s Red Flame Formula, rather than that mostly unmodified Formula, he wanted to see the Red Flame Formula that had been improved by Gargith\u2019s family.\u2018Because their version is probably a lot better,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought.He wanted to compare theirs to the White Flame Formula to see where the differences lay. While thinking about this, Eugene stepped out of the bank.As he was heading down the stairs, Eugene\u2019s body suddenly froze to a halt.\u201c...Huh?\u201d he gasped.In the square below the bank, among the teeming crowds, he had spotted a glimpse of purple hair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 40.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40.1: The Square (2)His mind was immediately fixated on those fluttering strands of hair. The moment he saw them, Eugene threw himself down the stairs without hesitation. Gargith was following behind him, and he let out a startled cry, but the sound of his voice couldn\u2019t reach Eugene\u2019s ears.The square below was packed with people, but Eugene rushed into the crowd without caring. He made his way forward by pushing aside the people who got in his way and diving through the gaps.There was no way that Eugene had made a mistake. He would recognize that unique hair color even if he was forced to pick it out from hundreds or thousands of people. A seemingly-unnatural brightly colored purple \u2014 that color was created by Sienna\u2019s vast amounts of mana spreading through her hair.\u2018It\u2019s Sienna,\u2019\u00a0Eugene realized.Could it be a hallucination? No, there was no way.Eugene swung his head from side to side as he dove into the crowd.In a place like this, and under such circumstances, there was no way that he could have been mistaken.When Eugene saw her, he stood rooted on the spot, stunned, staring straight ahead.He tried to speak, but words failed him, \u201c....\u201dThat was Sienna walking in the distance. It was definitely her. Her figure hadn\u2019t changed a bit compared to three hundred years ago. Though it seemed like her hair had gotten a lot longer. But that was only to be expected after three hundred years had flown by. As Eugene clutched his pounding chest, he drew closer to Sienna.Although he had gotten right behind her, Sienna still hadn\u2019t noticed Eugene\u2019s presence. Eugene felt that was understandable, considering how many people were in this square. But what was he supposed to say to her? Although Eugene had recognized Sienna, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to tell who Eugene really was.I\u2019m Hamel, but I was reincarnated as Vermouth\u2019s descendant.No, really. I\u2019m telling you, this isn\u2019t a lie. I really am Hamel.As Eugene imagined how such a conversation would go, he reached out to Sienna.Sienna, that damned chick, wouldn\u2019t believe him so easily. She might even curse at him and tell him to stop with his bullshit.He would actually be thankful if she did. As it would mean that despite the passage of three hundred years, her personality hadn\u2019t changed all that much from what he could remember of her; she would still have the same bad attitude, and her mouth would be as rough as always.\u201cSienna,\u201d Eugene called out her name with a shaking voice.Then he reached out and tried to grab Sienna\u2019s wrist, but he couldn\u2019t get a hold of her.Although she was right in front of him, Eugene couldn\u2019t touch Sienna. And that wasn\u2019t the only strange thing. Eugene blankly took in the scene as people began walking through Sienna\u2019s image from all sides.Truthfully, Eugene had already noticed this as he was getting closer. Sienna hadn\u2019t avoided any of the people walking in her direction, and they had all just walked right through her. And even though the color of her hair was so eye-catching, no one was paying any attention to her. Instead, they just kept eying Eugene with annoyed looks as he roughly barged his way through the crowd.\u2018A ghost?\u2019Eugene couldn\u2019t feel any presence coming from Sienna, who was right in front of him. He had reached out several times, but he still wasn\u2019t able to touch her. He couldn\u2019t feel any of the warmth of a human being coming from her. Although, she didn\u2019t feel cold either.In fact, he couldn\u2019t feel anything from her. Like a fantasm or a ghost, even though it was definitely right in front of one\u2019s eyes, it didn\u2019t feel real.Sienna\u2019s footsteps stopped. Eugene also came to a halt. Sienna turned her head, and Eugene lowered his outstretched hand. Since he couldn\u2019t catch her even if he tried to hold her, he felt that there was no point in continuing to try.Eugene looked at Sienna\u2019s face. And just as he had expected, the mansion\u2019s portrait and the statue in front of the tower of magic both looked better than the real thing.The Sienna in the portrait had softened her usually disgruntled expression and instead put on a benevolent smile.The Sienna sculpted into a statue was smiling with bravery and confidence.But the Sienna in front of him didn\u2019t have either of those expressions. Instead, her eyes were filled with irritation and fatigue. Her lips wouldn\u2019t stop mumbling day in and day out. At the very least, her face was still exactly as Eugene remembered.Now what kind of expression should he put on?First of all, Eugene showed her a grin. But then he had a sudden thought. If he just smiled at her like this, Sienna wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him. Since she hadn\u2019t responded to his numerous calls from behind her, it looked like she probably couldn\u2019t hear his voice either.But she had still turned to look behind her.Didn\u2019t that mean that she could still see with her eyes?\u201cNow then.\u201dEugene immediately held up both of his middle fingers at Sienna.Sienna blinked in shock at this sight. Her lips parted slightly before closing once more. Then she giggled and smiled. That smile was exactly the same as the one that Eugene remembered.Sienna\u2019s lips began to move. Although he couldn\u2019t hear her voice, Eugene could tell what she was trying to convey from her silent lip movements.I\u2019ve found you.Sienna\u2019s lips formed these three words.Following this, Sienna\u2019s figure disappeared right in front of Eugene\u2019s eyes. Just like a puff of smoke, Sienna\u2019s image faded away into thin air. Eugene stood there dumbly for a few moments, staring at the spot where Sienna had disappeared.\u201cI\u2019ve also found you,\u201d Eugene eventually said as he turned around with a grin.\u201cSienna Merdein,\u201d Eugene muttered her name.His heart felt like a weight had been lifted off of it. Sienna wasn\u2019t dead. He was sure of it. The thing that he had seen just now was neither a ghost nor a phantom left behind after she had died.It was an illusion created by magic.\u2018I\u2019ve found you.\u2019Sienna was still alive. She had survived and come looking for Eugene. But how had she known to look? Was it because he had given the middle fingers to her portrait?\u00a0\u2018If that pisses you off, you can come right at me,\u2019\u00a0hadn\u2019t he said something like that? Had she really heard those words and come looking for him?\u2018There\u2019s no way.\u2019The mansion had been preserved as a historical site for over a hundred years. Countless people visited the mansion each day, and blinded by superstition, they would mumble all sorts of things, like passing their exams and what-not, while staring at her portrait. No matter how great Sienna was, it would be impossible for her to come looking for Eugene after listening to all those mutterings.\u2018Maybe she was able to recognize my soul like Tempest did. Or else\u2014\u2019\u00a0Eugene lowered his gaze to look down at his necklace,\u00a0\u2018\u2014she may have come looking for the necklace.\u2019There was probably some kind of spell cast on the necklace.Although he couldn\u2019t tell what kind of spell it might be, what Eugene knew for sure was that,\u00a0\u2018Sienna knows that I\u2019ve been reincarnated.\u2019She might have even been expecting it.And the fact that,\u00a0\u2018Sienna hasn\u2019t died.\u2019However, it seemed like she was in a situation where she couldn\u2019t come to see him personally. So instead, she had sent an illusion to come looking for him and welcome him back to life.\u201cShe must be sealed somewhere,\u201d Eugene mumbled to himself nonchalantly. \u201cCould she have done it to herself? Even with magic, was it impossible for her to last the full three hundred years without doing so? Or else was she sealed by someone? But who could have done it? A black wizard? A Demon King?\u201d\u201cIn any case, it\u2019s fine now that I know she\u2019s unable to move on her own,\u201d as he muttered this, Eugene stroked his necklace. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve come and found me this time, so\u2026.\u201dThe smile that Sienna had shown him right before she had vanished into thin air just wouldn\u2019t fade from his mind. Such an annoying chick could actually smile at him like that? This was the first time that he had discovered such a fact.\u201cSo next time, I\u2019ll be the one who goes and finds you.\u201dEverything was fine as long as she hadn\u2019t died and was still alive somewhere.With a grin, Eugene left the square. Or at least he\u00a0tried\u00a0to.Gargith suddenly caught up to him and asked, \u201cWhere on earth did you run off to in such a hurry?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know,\u201d Eugene dismissed the question.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t like Gidol. The streets here are as complex as a maze, and there are a lot of mean and nasty people. A naive villager like you, ignorant of the world, would be tasty prey to people like that.\u201d\u201cYou fucker, are you really calling me a villager because I told you not to call me a country bumpkin? What the hell is the difference between a country bumpkin and a villager?\u201d\u201cAlthough a country bumpkin is a derogatory term, a villager is just a realistic description.\u201d\u201cDamn you, you pig bastard.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one using the wrong terms. I\u2019m not a pig. After all, isn\u2019t pig used to describe people who are round and fat?\u201dEugene changed the subject, \u201cYou seem to have a lot of pride in your muscles, but after seeing them in action, they\u2019re just big without much substance. Have you forgotten how you lost to me in the arm-wrestling match?\u201d\u201c...I just got distracted,\u201d Gargith tried to excuse himself.\u201cDistracted? That\u2019s bullshit. You were all tensed up even before we even started,\u201d Eugene grumbled as he slapped Gargith on the back. \u201cIn my eyes, whether it\u2019s your prided muscles or a pig\u2019s jiggling fat, it all looks the same.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t insult the muscles created by our family\u2019s revolutionary muscle growth agent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not insulting you. I just think it\u2019s a shame that such carefully sculpted muscles are going to waste. You shouldn\u2019t focus on just pointlessly increasing the size of your body, but instead, think of how to make the best use of your muscles.\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026.\u201dAlthough Eugene had just spat out the first excuse that came to his mind, Gargith\u2019s eyes lit up as if he had attained some great enlightenment.Gargith nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re right. At some point, it seems that I turned away from listening to the voice of my muscles and instead focused solely on showing them off\u2014\u201d\u201cLeave that nonsense for later when you\u2019re on your own. Just show me your Red Flame Formula,\u201d Eugene demanded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just as he had planned back at the bank, Eugene was here to witness Gargith\u2019s operation of the Red Flame Formula.\u201cYou\u2019ve already learned the White Flame Formula, so why are you interested in the Red Flame Formulas as well?\u201d Gargith asked.Eugene shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s difficult for me to show it to you,\u201d without any further questions, Gargith pulled off his shirt and threw it aside.Eugene didn\u2019t understand why Gargith even felt the need to take off his clothes, but it seemed pointless to make a big deal out of it, so he calmly continued to watch Gargith. While flexing his bulging muscles, Gagith struck a pose and held it.Eventually, Eugene couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer, \u201c...You\u2019re just circulating the Red Flame Formula, so why do you have to take such a distracting posture?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my preference,\u201d Gargith grunted.\u201cIs that so\u2026.\u201dGargith\u2019s eyes slowly sank into a calm focus. Soon, his whole body was engulfed in reddish mana. This was the Lionheart collateral clans\u2019 Red Flame Formula. At a glance, Eugene could already see the difference between it and the White Flame Formula.Between the two, the density of the mana was incomparable. Although it resembled the White Flame Formula in the way that it flickered like tongues of flame, this resemblance was only skin-deep, as there was a huge difference in the actual power of the two scriptures.\u201cCan the Red Flame Formula also split the core?\u201d Eugene asked curiously.\u201cOur family\u2019s Red Flame Formula can go up to the Fifth Star,\u201d Gargith answered with pride. \u201cThe version of the Red Flame Formula taught by the main family doesn\u2019t allow you to split off new cores. But various collateral branches have further developed the Red Flame Formula. Thanks to the efforts of our amazing ancestors, our family has succeeded in increasing the number of stars that can be generated by the Red Flame Formula to five stars. As far as I know, among all the versions of the Red Flame Formula derived by the collateral lines, only a handful can generate five stars.\u201d\u2018...Father\u2019s family could barely even reach the Second Star,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled.Looking at it this way, it seemed that the Red Flame Formula would never be able to surpass the White Flame Formula. While stroking his chin, Eugene was lost in thought for a few moments.When he came out of his musing, he asked Gargith, \u201cHow many stars do you have?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on the Second Star,\u201d said Gargith.The Second Star of the Red Flame Formula was incomparably weaker than the Second Star of the White Flame Formula, which Eugene had already graduated from.\u2018Even though it\u2019s been developed over hundreds of years, the Red Flame Formula is still limited to five stars. Vermouth, that bastard, really was one hell of a genius.\u2019The direct line\u2019s White Flame Formula and the collateral lines\u2019 Red Flame Formula.\u2018And the Red Flame Formula taught to the knights who serve the direct line doesn\u2019t even allow you to split off your core.\u2019All this said, the Red Flame Formula was still an excellent mana training scripture. The Knights who swore allegiance to the main family were honored to serve the Lionheart clan and took great pride in learning the Red Flame Formula.\u2018No matter how hard I think about it, I just can\u2019t understand why. Vermouth wasn\u2019t such a petty bastard, but\u2026.\u2019He had still ordered that the White Flame Formula be kept as the main family\u2019s secret, while the Red Flame Formula would be taught to the collateral lines and their descendants. However, the main family was not allowed to use their strength to help develop it further, so the development of the Red Flame Formula was left solely up to the collateral lines and their descendants. In this way, the gap between the direct and collateral lines could be narrowed but never closed.\u201c...I\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d Eugene eventually declared.Although he still couldn\u2019t understand Vermouth\u2019s actions, Eugene wasn\u2019t too deeply invested in figuring it out. For now, what was clear was that the White Flame Formula was superior to the Red Flame Formula.\u2018If it had enough potential, I was thinking of trying to graft the Red Flame Formula onto the White Flame Formula, but it looks like there\u2019s no need.\u2019Even among all the collateral lines, the Red Flame Formula belonging to Gargith\u2019s family was excellent enough to be counted as one of the best. But it still wasn\u2019t good enough to make Eugene feel eager to learn it.\u2018Looks like there\u2019s no need to add the Red Flame Formula.\u2019Of course, what Eugene had seen wasn\u2019t the peak of the Red Flame Formula\u2019s Fifth Star. However, just from the density of the mana and its movements that he had seen just now, it was enough for him to determine the full level of the Red Flame Formula. So, without any regrets, Eugene turned his back on it.\u201cI\u2019m heading off,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d Gargith asked. \u201cBut the giant\u2019s testicles should be arriving soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave the fine inspection up to you.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve already taken off my clothes and started circulating the Red Flame Formula. How about a spar or a practice match?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to win anyway, so what\u2019s the point of sparring? Instead of thinking about that, why don\u2019t you\u2014how did you put it?\u2014listen closely to the voice of your muscles.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s some great advice\u2026,\u201d Gargith nodded his head as if he was deeply impressed.He immediately got down and started doing push-ups, but Eugene didn\u2019t turn to look back at Gargith.\u2018...So Akron, huh?\u2019Sienna\u2019s smile had yet to fade from Eugene\u2019s mind.\u2018Didn\u2019t they say that Sienna left her last grimoire there?\u2019The three-volume series,\u00a0Witch Craft.\u2018There was nothing that stood out in her mansion. The same goes for her statue as well. If so, could that mean that there\u2019s something in the Green Tower of Magic\u2019s library?\u2019That was the place where Sienna could usually be found during her time as the Tower Master.\u2018It would be ridiculous of me to start snooping around the Green Tower of Magic for no reason. For now, I\u2019ll need to wait for the reply to Lovellian\u2019s recommendation letter to see if I\u2019m permitted to enter Akron\u2026.\u2019Balzac Ludbeth, the Black Tower Master, had also said that he would write a letter of recommendation for Eugene. Since things had turned out like this, Eugene felt that he could expect a positive reply to these letters of recommendation.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be in such a hurry,\u201d Eugene muttered to himself as he headed into the Red Tower of Magic. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s been kept waiting.\u201dSince they had already waited three hundred years for him, there shouldn\u2019t be any complaints if they waited a little longer.\u2018It\u2019s not like I asked to be reincarnated, you know?\u2019Instead of returning to his room, Eugene headed straight for the elevator and rode it down to the underground laboratories.\u2018Besides, I should be able to find them within ten years at the very latest. Since they\u2019ve already been waiting for so long, they can wait a little longer.\u2019Entering an empty laboratory, he closed the door behind him. Then, he casually tossed aside the coat he was wearing and placed the fragment of the Moonlight Sword in the center of the laboratory.\u201cLet\u2019s start by examining it step-by-step,\u201d as he muttered this, Eugene stared down at the fragment of the Moonlight Sword.He had watched as the fragment continued to soak up the moonlight all morning. Although nothing seemed special about it, other than the fact that it could emit light, it was definitely still a fragment of that terrifying Moonlight Sword.A sword that only Vermouth had been able to use.\u201c...Hm,\u201d Eugene hummed as he slowly circulated the White Flame Formula.Using the stars around his heart as circles, he cast a spell.Fwooosh!A huge fireball appeared in front of Eugene. Although it was only a First Circle offensive spell, the fireball created from the mana of the White Flame formula was so huge that it was impossible to believe it was merely a First Circle spell.Eugene confidently tossed the fireball at the fragment of the Moonlight Sword, but it didn\u2019t even leave a scorch mark. The moment the fireball touched the fragment, the mysterious power of the fragment scattered all the mana contained within the spell, disintegrating it.\u2018It\u2019s different from the Devouring Sword,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.The Devouring Sword, Asphel, cut apart the magical structure and swallowed the mana.\u2018It\u2019s also different from Gedon\u2019s Shield.\u2019Gedon\u2019s shield sent any attack that connected with it veering off in another direction.\u2018This destroys the structure of a spell just by touching it. That\u2019s how it scatters the mana contained within a spell.\u2019Eugene recalled Vermouth\u2019s favorite method of attack. When he held Asphel, he would cut apart all the spells that came his way and use the mana to increase his own strength.Although it was strong enough to cut apart most spells, it was impossible for Asphel to cut apart the magic of high-ranking demons and Demon Kings. This resulted in their battle with the Demon King of Carnage being hellishly difficult.However, after obtaining the Moonlight Sword, even the spells of those high-ranking demons and Demon Kings couldn\u2019t touch Vermouth. All magic would disintegrate as soon as it touched the Moonlight Sword. Then Vermouth would immediately swing Asphel, swallowing up all the scattered mana and converting it into his own strength before attacking.\u2018....It\u2019s impossible for such a tiny fragment to disintegrate high-ranking spells.\u2019However, something like a low-level spell would be dispersed immediately.\u2018Under these circumstances, even placing it in a wooden box is enough to conceal its power.\u2019The condition for the power of the Moonlight Sword to be activated was that it needed to come into \u2018direct\u2019 contact with the mana. As an example, Eugene had been able to operate the White Flame Formula as usual even while carrying the wooden box next to his chest.\u2018Just by carrying it around with me when I go out, I can deal with any surprise attacks.\u2019It was a barbaric way to use it. However, wasn\u2019t the power of that fragment itself rather barbaric?\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s just be barbaric together.\u201dWith a happy smile, Eugene pulled out Wynnyd.\u2018If that fragment doesn\u2019t interfere with my mana\u2026.\u2019The mana pulled up by the White Flame Formula engulfed Wynnyd.\u2018And if it doesn\u2019t interfere with any spells I cast\u2026.\u2019After manifesting his sword-light, he cast his spells. Dozens of magic missiles obediently hovered around Eugene.\u2018Then that means that the density of my mana increases with every increase in the level of my White Flame Formula.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This type of magic had a lot of variables that needed to be taken into account during the summoning process, so the magic as a whole tended to be rather volatile. As such, explosions and vibrations were common, so all the laboratories had been thoroughly secured against them.\u2018With Eugene\u2019s level of magic, there shouldn\u2019t be any way to create an explosion that can be heard from outside the room, but\u2026.\u2019Recently, Hera had been preoccupied with various things. Although she had been taking a break after her previous research project, she had been greatly inspired by Eugene\u2019s success in using a core in place of a circle. So Hera had stopped working as a librarian and focused on her preparations for a new research project.She hadn\u2019t been able to return to Eugene\u2019s laboratory since her last visit because of this. However, thanks to a command from the Tower Master, along with these rumors, Hera could no longer remain in her own laboratory.Young wizards were frequently faced with an issue. When someone first starts practicing magic, they could get caught up in repeating certain experiments due to their excessive enthusiasm and end up injuring themselves despite their great talent.Hera didn\u2019t want that monstrous boy with his overflowing talent to suffer a needless injury due to excessive use of magic.\u201cSir Eugene?\u201d she called out.Rumors were often greatly exaggerated. The basement laboratories were as quiet as usual, with no signs of explosions or vibrations when Hera arrived. Having been relieved by this fact, Hera was soon knocking on the door of Laboratory 11.\u201cAre you in\u2014\u201dBefore she could even finish her question, there was a loud bang.Kuooong!Along with this loud noise, the door to Laboratory 11 began to shake. Startled, Hera immediately pulled out her staff and held it in front of her before throwing open the door without any further hesitation.\u201cSi-sir Eugene! Are you alri\u2014\u201dOnce again, she wasn\u2019t able to finish her sentence. Hera\u2019s jaw dropped at the scene that was taking place in front of\u00a0her very eyes.The floor was covered in fine cracks, with no spot seemingly left intact. Eugene had been left swaying in a thick, roiling fog of mana. It was obviously the site of an accident. With a frown, Hera swung her staff.Fwooosh!The entire billowing fog of mana was immediately dissipated.\u201cSir\u2026 Eugeeene\u2026.\u201dOnce more, she was unable to finish what she was saying. This time, Hera\u2019s words trailed off as she lowered her staff. But in the middle of her voice trailing off, Hera was forced to swallow a gulp.\u201cPhew,\u201d Eugene sighed as he shook his head and wiped away the sweat that covered his body.Standing in the center of the laboratory, Eugene was wearing only a comfortable pair of pants. In other words, this meant that Eugene\u2019s upper body, which was shining with sweat, could be seen plainly.\u2018What kind of\u2026\u00a0seventeen-year-old\u00a0has a body like that?\u2019\u00a0Hera wondered in disbelief.Taking another gulp, Hera slowly turned her gaze to the side. But before she did so, she subtly took another look at Eugene\u2019s body. Although this wasn\u2019t the case for all wizards, most wizards had poor physiques. Since most of their work was spent sitting around and researching, without anything that had them moving around and working up a sweat, their limbs grew ever thinner even as their bellies ballooned outward.At least in the Red Tower of Magic, there wasn\u2019t a single wizard with a chiseled body like Eugene. Even though Lovellian took regular care of himself, his muscles weren\u2019t as cut as Eugene\u2019s.Hera counted silently,\u00a0\u2018One, two, three\u2026 s-six.\u2019This was her first time seeing a real six-pack. Hera gulped once more before taking a few steps back. Then, upon realizing her mistake, she felt a jolt of surprise and looked up at Eugene once more.This just so happened to grant her another view of his bare torso.Hera stammered an apology, \u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry. I should have waited for a reply before entering, but there was a loud noise, so I\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eugene replied with a nonchalant expression.Calling on the sylphs who were frolicking in the air around him, he had them blow away the sweat dripping down his body.\u201cI was going to respond, but I wanted to finish what I was doing first,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cWhat you were doing\u2026. M-may I ask what that was exactly?\u201d Hera asked after getting a hold of her shaking thoughts.She had thought that he might have been practicing summoning magic, but after looking around the laboratory, it didn\u2019t seem like that was the case.Hera observed,\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t see any magic circles\u2026 but what\u2019s that?\u2019A fragment of some unknown metal was lying in the center of the laboratory. The surrounding floor had been cracked and overturned, but the area beneath the fragment was intact without any traces of damage.\u201cI was training my mana. I also combined that with some magic practice,\u201d Eugene answered with a shrug.It was a week after the incident on Bolero Street. Eugene had spent most of his days inside this laboratory. This was to train his magic and mana by using the fragment of the Moonlight Sword as a target.The results weren\u2019t very satisfying. Even the sword-light he created by mustering all his will would dissipate as soon as it got close to the fragment. The same went for magic, and even the sylphs that he summoned wouldn\u2019t approach the fragment of the Moonlight Sword. When he tried to forcefully order them to do so, the moment they drew near, they would be banished back to the Spirit Realm.However, it wasn\u2019t like there were absolutely no results. At first, his spells would disintegrate before they could even explode, but now it was possible for him to forcibly hold onto the scattered mana and cause an explosion in the fragment\u2019s vicinity.That meant that the cohesion of his mana was growing stronger.\u201cMagic training\u2026?\u201d Hera asked curiously.\u201cLike this,\u201d Eugene demonstrated.Instead of explaining things step-by-step, Eugene immediately cast a spell. Over the past week, the spells he had been using the most were the First Circle\u2019s Magic Missile and Fireball. Hera\u2019s eyes shook at the speed with which he cast these spells.\u2018He\u2019s gotten even faster,\u2019\u00a0she realized.Even though Eugene was already unbelievably fast the last time she saw him when he first cast those spells, his current speed was even faster than back then. At first glance, the speed was enough to make it feel like he may have used a magic scroll instead.\u2018But that wasn\u2019t a scroll. Just now, did he really personally activate his mana\u2026 and totally use his cores like they were circles?\u2019\u00a0Hera asked herself in disbelief.The absence of an incantation was no longer a surprise. Although it might have been faster, that wasn\u2019t the only thing strange about Eugene\u2019s spells. Hera paid close attention to the structure of the mana that made up Eugene\u2019s spell.The structure was so tight and sophisticated that it was hard to believe that this was created by Eugene\u2019s skills in magic. The cohesion of the mana was also incredibly strong, to the point where it would be hard to find a dispel capable of collapsing its structure. No one would believe that these were just a First Circle Magic Missile and Fireball.\u201c...Are you practicing magic dueling techniques?\u201d Hera asked hesitantly.The fact that his spells were difficult to dispel meant that Eugene would have an edge in magical dueling. Since this would also amplify the power of his spells, the current Eugene would be able to face a wizard at a higher level without backing down.\u201cAlthough it has had that effect, I was more focused on training the overall quality of my mana,\u201d as he said this, Eugene allowed the spells to dissipate. Instead of scattering into his surroundings, the mana immediately engulfed Eugene\u2019s body. The transition between using the mana for his spells and the White Flame Formula flowed as smoothly as water.Hera eventually made the observation, \u201c...It looks like you\u2019ve achieved quite some results.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Eugene replied with a grin.As she calmed her chest, which\u00a0was\u00a0pounding from surprise, Hera stared at Eugene. The pure white flames that had engulfed his body were exuding a sense of intimidation that was difficult to describe. However, Eugene\u2019s face still retained its usual naive impression because of his youthful appearance.With a face like that, to think he had a body rippling with such muscles\u2026. Hera slapped her chest, which continued to pound disobediently, and started coughing.Hera reminded him, \u201cIt-it\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019re not hurt. But Sir Eugene, please don\u2019t push yourself too far. If you do get hurt, you\u2019re not the only one who will suffer; both the Head Wizard and the Red Tower of Magic will be placed in a difficult position.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Eugene nodded obediently with a smile.Hera wasn\u2019t just being\u00a0polite with this warning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Eugene hadn\u2019t seen him off, nor had he held any desire to watch Eward depart. Whether that stupid eldest son would get his head screwed on straight because of this incident, or if he became even more twisted and turned into a true asshole, Eugene no longer felt the need to care about it.That would be Tanis\u2019 job. Since she had decided to separate from Gilead and take her son with her to her maternal relatives, she would be the one responsible for furthering her son\u2019s education.In any case, it was true that the Red Tower of Magic and Lovellian himself had been left in a difficult position because of this affair. Lovellian had continued to harbor Eward, despite the complaints and ridicule of his fellow wizards, only for Eward\u2019s true ugly nature to be revealed to all the citizens of Pentagon.Though there had already been many rumors of Eward\u2019s poor behavior since a while back, having his crimes directly publicized instead of simply remaining as rumors had created a whole new set of problems. Thanks to Eward, a large-scale crackdown on drugs had also begun on Bolero Street, and the allowance made for the black wizards belonging to the guild and, of course, the demonfolk had become even stricter.But the truth was that the greatest victim of this whole affair was the Lionheart\u2019s main family. The honor that had been passed down from their ancestor, the Great Vermouth, now had sewage smeared all over it because of the fact that the eldest son Eward had tried to make a contract with an incubus.\u2018I did the right thing by not having any children,\u2019\u00a0felt Eugene.When he had first arrived at the Lionheart Clan\u2019s main estate, he had felt regret and had told himself that he should have left some descendants in his previous life.But now, he no longer held such regrets. If someone calling himself Hamel\u2019s descendant had done something as stupid as Eward\u2026. Just imagining it was terrifying.\u2018If it were me, I would have broken my coffin and crawled out of the grave to teach him a lesson.\u2019While thinking such thoughts, Eugene reabsorbed the mana.\u201cDid you come all the way here just because you were worried about me?\u201d he asked Hera.Hera stammered, \u201cN-no, I mean, yes!\u201d\u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m wrong or right?\u201d\u201cAlthough I was a bit worried\u2026 I\u2019ve also come here because of a different matter.\u201d\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cF-for now\u2026 please put on some clothes,\u201d Hera said as she once again turned her gaze away.It was only then that Eugene realized he was currently topless.\u201cAh, sorry about that,\u201d Eugene apologized. \u201cAs I was training, I was sweating too much.\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Hera.Thanks to that, she got to see something good. As she recalled the memory stored within her head, Hera licked her lips. She suddenly remembered a memory retention spell. A refreshing smile spread across Hera\u2019s face as she thought about extracting this memory later on and saving it as a video.Hera continued, \u201cThe Head Wizard asked me to fetch you, Sir Eugene.\u201d\u201cAre we going up to the top floor?\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cNo, the Head Wizard is actually away from his office right now.\u201d\u201cThen where are we going?\u201d\u201cTo Akron,\u201d Hera revealed with a wide smile.These words caused Eugene to smile just as broadly.* * *Within the capital city of Aroth, Pentagon. In the center of the five-sided shape drawn by the five Towers of Magic, there lies the royal castle of Aroth, named \u2018Abram.\u2019 Built at the heart of a great lake, Abram can not be entered without riding a boat to get there. Even the aerial carriages that fly freely in the skies above Pentagon are not allowed to get close to Abram\u2019s airspace, and it is impossible to cross the lake with the use of magic.This was because Abram and the lake surrounding it were completely covered by a Magic Sealing Formation.Three hundred years ago, the Wise Sienna developed the Magic Sealing Formation as her trump card. This formation blocked the use of mana in a specific area while still allowing her own mana to be used.The Magic Sealing Formation that covered all of Abram was offered as a gift to the Royal Family by Sienna, and even now, after hundreds of years had passed, it was still working as perfectly as ever.They were currently at the Royal Library Akron. Its majesty did not fall short in comparison to Abram, which could be seen in the far distance. Eugene alternated between looking up at the tall clock tower of Akron and over the lake at Abram.\u2018That\u2019s just crazy,\u2019\u00a0Eugene remarked internally.Thanks to the fact that he had recently been diligently studying books on magic, he had reached a general understanding of magic. According to Eugene\u2019s newly developed \u2018common sense,\u2019 it definitely didn\u2019t seem possible to cover all of that huge lake and the royal castle within a Magic Sealing Formation.Three hundred years ago, there wasn\u2019t anything resembling a lake surrounding the royal castle. This lake was also part of Sienna\u2019s gift. In less than a week, she had constructed that enormous lake and moved the entire royal castle from where it used to be into the center of that lake.\u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d Hera pointed to Abram with a bright smile and said, \u201cEven the Tower Masters aren\u2019t able to use magic when they\u2019re at Abram. The only ones allowed to use magic there are the royal family and the court wizards who have sworn absolute obedience to the royal family.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, does that mean that the Tower Masters haven\u2019t sworn absolute loyalty to the royal family?\u201d Eugene asked.Hera found this difficult to answer, \u201cUmmm\u2026 Although they have sworn loyalty, you can\u2019t expect them to obey even the most unreasonable orders unconditionally, right? You could describe the relationship between the Towers of Magic and Aroth to be more along the lines of mutual cooperation\u2026 rather than a relationship based on fealty and obedience.\u201dThe king didn\u2019t have much involvement in the politics that governed Aroth.\u201cThe ones that the Towers of Magic hold a deep connection with isn\u2019t the Royal Palace, but rather the Parliament. Since the Royal Palace has a Court Wizards Division, the wizards of the Towers of Magic are considered the matching power base of the Parliament. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that our two wizard organizations are in conflict with each other.\u201dAroth was at peace. There was no threat of civil war, and there were no enemies outside the kingdom either.After the end of the war three hundred years ago, the whole continent was at peace. It wasn\u2019t like there weren\u2019t a few civil wars or wars fought between small countries, but there had never been a war as great as the one from three hundred years ago.\u201cDo you want to go and visit Abram?\u201d Hera tilted her head and asked upon seeing Eugene continuing to gaze over at Abram.\u201cI\u2019m just staring because it\u2019s so amazing,\u201d Eugene explained. \u201cAfter all, it isn\u2019t a place I can visit just because I want to, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how it is. Because only great nobles and Tower Masters are allowed to visit Abram\u2026. Ah, but if it\u2019s you, Sir Eugene, you might be able to go there.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m a Lionheart?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s part of it, but if you do receive permission to enter Akron, you may also receive a summons from the Royal Palace. I\u2019ve never been there myself, but I\u2019ve heard about it from Head Wizard Lovellian,\u201d as she said this, Hera led the way forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell you about it. You\u2019ll probably hear all the details regarding that from Lovellian later today.\u201dTogether with Hera, Eugene entered Akron. As an attraction of such significance, it should have been crowded with tourists, but the area around Akron was empty without a single tourist to be found.This was because of the massive entrance fee. It was also impossible to approach the vicinity of Akron without obtaining prior permission. This permission also only allowed access up to the first floor. From the second floor onwards, it was impossible to even step foot in them without an entrance pass.\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be heading back now,\u201d Hera stated.Hera did not possess an entrance pass. Since she was unable to lead him any further, she just nodded her head at Eugene.She encouraged him, \u201cSir Eugene, don\u2019t be too nervous\u2026. Good luck!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Eugene accepted her good wishes.Eugene grinned as he pumped his fist in response to her cheer.This was the Royal Library, Akron. Although the Red Tower Master and the Black Tower Master may have written him letters of recommendation, the other three Tower Masters had questioned Eugene\u2019s qualifications to earn an entrance pass into Akron.He might be a member of the Lionheart clan left by the Great Vermouth, but no matter how great the hero\u2019s descendants were, in the end, wasn\u2019t Eugene just a young man without a firm grasp of magic?Akron was not such an easy place to allow you entry with just a letter of recommendation. This was the place where Aroth\u2019s magical history, as well as the Wise Sienna\u2019s distilled wisdom, was kept.\u201cMy name is Eugene Lionheart,\u201d he declared.He was in a spacious room on the first floor. As soon as Eugene entered, he bowed his head deeply.Lovellian and Balzac, along with the rest of the five Tower Masters, stared down at Eugene.But they weren\u2019t the only ones. Both the Chief of the Royal Palace\u2019s Court Wizard Division and the Guild Head of the Wizard\u2019s Guild were there as well.\u201cRaise your head,\u201d a voice called out.A young man who was only a few years older than Eugene was sitting calmly amid all these giant movers and shakers of Aroth.\u201cSince a few years ago, your name has often reached my ears. I had hoped that I might be able to meet with you at some point, but I truly didn\u2019t expect that we would meet in a place like this.\u201dHonein Abram, the Crown Prince of Aroth, smiled down at Eugene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 42.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42.1: Akron (2)Eugene looked up at the Crown Prince, who was only four years older than him. Honein wasn\u2019t just the Crown Prince of Aroth; he was also an excellent wizard in his own right.\u2018He\u2019s a Fifth Circle wizard,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled.From generation to generation, the royal family of Aroth continued to produce excellent wizards. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that they had continued to improve their bloodline\u2019s affinity for magic over the course of hundreds of years.And even among all those specially cultivated talents, Honein was particularly excellent. Every member of Aroth\u2019s royal family was introduced to magic from an early age, but Honein was the first to have reached the Fifth Circle before even reaching adulthood.He was a certified genius.Even Eugene was familiar with the stories surrounding Honein. After all, he was the Crown Prince who was first in line to succeed the throne. Although Eugene had been warned by Hera in advance, it still felt strange to face this handsome prince in person.Eugene contemplated,\u00a0\u2018I only met with royalty a few times even in my previous life, but since I\u2019ve been reincarnated as Vermouth\u2019s descendant, I get to meet a member of royalty when I\u2019m just seventeen.\u2019He\u00a0didn\u2019t really have any ties to royalty in his previous life. Although Vermouth was often called here and there, the orphaned Hamel didn\u2019t receive many invitations, and it had been common for him to ignore the few invitations that he did receive.\u201cDo you know the reason why you\u2019re here?\u201dThe one who spat out this question and marked the beginning of the interview was an uptight-looking wizard. He was the Blue Tower Master. Although he appeared to be middle-aged, his actual age should be much older than that. He glared down at Eugene with eyes full of dissatisfaction and irritation.The Blue Tower Master continued, \u201cEugene Lionheart, I\u2019ve heard many rumors about you, but for you to arrive here\u2026. Both the Red Tower Master and the Black Tower Master have been praising you to the point that it seems like exaggeration.\u201dThe Blue Tower Master then looked at Lovellian and Balzac with narrowed eyes. As they felt his gaze turned towards them, Balzac just shook his head with a faint smile while Lovellian snorted.\u201cAh, but of course, I\u2019m well aware of the fact that you are astounding, to the point where that criminal brother of yours can\u2019t even compare,\u201d the Blue Tower Master conceded. \u201cHowever\u2026 being able to swing a weapon and emit sword-force, isn\u2019t that completely different from being good at magic?\u201dThe Blue Tower Master did not appreciate being put in this situation. The one facing him was just a seventeen-year-old kid. On top of that, Eugene was just a baby chick who had only just started practicing magic a few months ago.A kid like that had been able to get letters of recommendation from two Tower Masters and was now in front of a panel who would decide whether or not to bestow him with permission to enter Akron. The Blue Tower Master absolutely could not accept or even acknowledge such an embarrassment.No matter how he looked at it, this seemed to be a case of solicitation. Irrespective of how talented a seventeen-year-old kid who had just started learning magic a few months ago was, he couldn\u2019t be all that great, could he? Of course, he recognized the fact that Eugene had talent, but that wasn\u2019t enough for him to accept the idea that Eugene deserved an entry permit into Akron.Currently, there weren\u2019t just a few wizards in Aroth who had been called geniuses when they were young. All wizards permitted to enter a tower of magic must have been called a genius at least or twice in their youth. They were all diamonds in the rough with overflowing talent.Even wizards like that would eagerly wait\u00a0decades\u00a0just for a chance to enter Akron, but a brat like Eugene, who couldn\u2019t be considered more than a young chick in terms of his accomplishments in magic, was in the running for entry into Akron? No matter how much the Blue Tower Master thought about this, this felt uncomfortably like favoritism.\u2018The Red Tower Master has long been friends with the Lionheart\u2019s Patriarch, and as for the Black Tower Master\u2026 I would have to guess that he wants to use this shameful affair as a chance to better his relationship with the Lionheart clan,\u2019\u00a0the Blue Tower Master speculated.After all, wasn\u2019t the timing of this offer too perfect to be true? Just as Eward, the eldest son of the Lionheart family, had failed to make much in the way of achievements, Eugene had arrived, and letters of recommendation had been written for him shortly thereafter.The Blue Tower Master wasn\u2019t the only one thinking something along those lines. Although the Green Tower Master and White Tower Master weren\u2019t showing it, they also didn\u2019t appreciate being called to participate in this sham.\u201cI understand what you are trying to say, but what do I need to do to prove that I am worthy?\u201d Eugene asked without showing any hesitation.Then, as if he had been waiting for this, Lovellian spoke up, \u201cAll you need to do is show us your magic.\u201dEugene confirmed, \u201cIs that really all you need?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lovellian said with a nod before turning to look at the other Tower Masters. \u201cIf you could cast a spell in front of us, Sir Eugene, these famous wizards who have gathered here today will take the chance to examine your skill in magic.\u201dThe Blue Tower Master complained, \u201cUsually, we would look at the results of your research and the papers that you have worked on. But since you\u2019ve never done any research, let alone worked on a thesis, I guess\u00a0that will\u00a0just have to\u00a0do.\u201dLovellian narrowed his eyes at the grumbling from the Blue Tower Master. Although Lovellian understood the Blue Tower Master\u2019s displeasure, he was offended by how his fellow Head Wizard kept openly showing him such disrespect in this formal setting.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you need,\u201d Eugene slowly nodded his head in acceptance.Eugene had already prepared himself for the fact that he wouldn\u2019t always be treated favorably, so he didn\u2019t take offense from the Blue Tower Master\u2019s rudeness. Taking a deep breath, Eugene drew on his mana.As the Stars around his heart began to shine, all the wizards in the room were staring at Eugene with calm expressions. Their eyes weren\u2019t focused on Eugene\u2019s body but instead on the movements of his mana within his body.Honein, who wasn\u2019t unable to see such things with his own abilities, lowered a pair of thin glasses onto the bridge of his nose.After a few moments, Honein\u2019s lips parted, and he released an appreciative hum, \u201c...Hm\u2026.\u201dThe Blue Tower Master\u2019s expression shifted. Indeed, Eugene certainly wasn\u2019t using a Circle, but he wasn\u2019t just using a Core either.Eugene was using all three of the Stars generated by the Lionheart main family\u2019s White Flame Formula. As the three Stars resonated with each other, they gathered Eugene\u2019s mana and amplified it. Brilliant white flames engulfed Eugene\u2019s body. Up until this point, there wasn\u2019t anything particularly remarkable.Then, the moment that the White Flame Formula began operating in earnest, the movements of the Cores began to change. The resonating Stars started to rotate in an interlocked pattern. Like this, the three Stars became one Circle.\u2018It\u2019s a Circle.\u2019\u2018So the Cores and Circles aren\u2019t separate from each other. By making the different Cores resonate with each other, they form one Circle\u2026.\u2019Eugene had only created a single Circle. But not a single wizard here believed that to be just a simple First Circle.\u2018The density of his mana\u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous.\u2019\u2018Although he\u2019s been training his mana for several years now, this is\u2026. No, that just makes it even more unbelievable. Eugene Lionheart has only been training his mana for four years now.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know about his talents for martial arts, but they do say he was born with a talent for mana control.\u2019\u2018But that still isn\u2019t enough,\u2019\u00a0the Blue Tower Master judged, his eyes growing cold.\u00a0\u2018Having excellent mana control is a completely different matter from having an excellent understanding of magic.\u2019You couldn\u2019t become an Archwizard just because you had great control over mana. The description of \u2018Great\u2019 in front of the name Vermouth Lionheart and the title attached to him as the \u2018Master-of-All,\u2019 was because he had risen to a never-before-seen level not just in martial arts but also in magic.Combining the Core and the Circle was extremely wasteful in terms of mana. Although many people in this world called themselves magic swordsmen, most of these magic swordsmen were only of so-so strength if you considered their martial arts and magic separately.It had been three hundred years since the time of the Great Vermouth. Since then, there had been many talented individuals in the Lionheart\u2019s direct line, but not a single person among them had shown the same level of prowess in magic as they had in the martial arts.Their ability to use the mana from their Cores to create sword-light and sword-force, and their skill at handling weapons, did not present any great advantage when plumbing magic\u2019s infinite depths.The opposite was also true. Among those Archwizards whose names had gone down in history, not a single one had been good at fighting while personally swinging a weapon in close combat.Even if the mana control required by both was similar, martial arts and magic were always meant to be two separate disciplines.One by one, Eugene showed off all the spells that he could cast. The white flames of the White Flame Formula transformed into a blade of wind and then into a red fireball. For a moment, it looked as if the fireball was about to dissipate, only to reform as dozens of bullets, then the bullets united as one to form an elongated blade.During the transformation process of his magic, Eugene never once uttered an incantation. And there was no wastage of mana, even when the magic was broken down to be reformed. Instead, all of the mana that had been used for the first spell was saved to be used in the next spell.The Green Tower Master, who had been watching silently, asked, \u201c...Are you able to use magic and sword-light simultaneously?\u201dInstead of replying immediately, Eugene directly showed it to them. Without stopping the transformation of his magic, he extended his right hand forwards.There was no need for him to pull out a sword or some other weapon. Instead, the flames of the White Flame Formula were concentrated in his right hand and became a blade of pure mana. Its appearance was enough to finally astonish the wizards watching him.His Circle hadn\u2019t collapsed. While using a Core in place of a Circle, he had still been able to use it as a Core as well. Since it had come to this, the Blue Tower Master\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help but harden.Was it really possible to construct a working mechanism from the parts of two completely different machines? And not just their appearance; could he really have fully combined their functions as well?Even if it were possible, how could a boy who had only been practicing magic for a few months have been the one to do it?\u2018And incantation-less at that.\u2019Eugene had used mental calculations to link his techniques and his will alone to activate them. This meant that he must have fully comprehended all the magic he had learned. The Blue Tower Master let out a low\u00a0groan of frustrated admiration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All of the Tower Masters had been called geniuses since a young age, and they all held pride in their overflowing passion and talent for magic.However, none of them had been able to control their magic as well as Eugene did when they were at his age and experience level.\u201c...I think we need to hold a discussion,\u201d the Green Tower Master murmured.The Blue Tower Master just nodded without further argument, \u201cI guess we do. Sir Eugene, would you be willing to wait outside for a few minutes?\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Eugene obediently replied.\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long. Although you\u2019re not allowed to go to any of the other floors\u2026 since there are a lot of interesting sights on the first floor, please spend some time taking a look around.\u201dEugene bowed his head and left the room.Right afterward, the Blue Tower Master turned towards Lovellian and asked, \u201cRed Tower Master, are you sure that you haven\u2019t given him any guidance whatsoever?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t I already said it so many times? I haven\u2019t given Eugene any sort of guidance,\u201d denied Lovellian.\u201cThen I just can\u2019t understand it. If what you\u2019re saying is true, that means Eugene Lionheart reached such a level just through self-study, without anyone else guiding him.\u201d\u201cHe diligently read all sorts of books,\u201d Lovellian added.\u201cThat just makes it even harder to understand. I have no intention of denigrating the quality of the magic books possessed by the Red Tower of Magic, but didn\u2019t you say that the only magic books that Eugene Lionheart read were the introductory texts on magic?\u201d Shaking his head, the Blue Tower Master continued speaking, \u201cHaving only studied such introductory books on magic\u2026 could he really have reached such an understanding of magic?\u201d\u201cHe is a Lionheart, after all,\u201d the one who spoke up this time was Honein, the Crown Prince of Aroth. He stared at the door that Eugene had closed behind him as he left with shining eyes and continued, \u201cSomeone from the Lionheart clan of the Kiehl Empire. A descendant of the Great Vermouth. Everyone on the continent knows just how superb their \u2018bloodline\u2019 is, right?\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d came murmurs of agreement.\u201cBut Crown Prince, isn\u2019t Eugene Lionheart just an adopted child who hasn\u2019t inherited the blood of the direct line?\u201d one of the panel members argued.\u201cThat might be the case, but isn\u2019t his surname still Lionheart? Even though he comes from a distant collateral line, Eugene Lioheart\u2019s genius is truly indisputable. At least, that\u2019s how it appears to\u00a0me.\u201d\u00a0As he took off his glasses, Honein turned towards the others and asked, \u201cWhat do you all think? I feel like we have met an indescribable genius in Eugene Lionheart. I believe that he deserves to enter Akron.\u201d\u201c....But he\u2019s far too young,\u201d the Guild Head, who had been listening silently, suddenly spoke up. \u201cI can\u2019t help but acknowledge Eugene Lionheart\u2019s genius, but setting his ingenuity aside, he\u2019s too young, and his level of magic is still too low.\u201d\u201cFor now, it is,\u201d the Black Tower Master, Balzac, interjected. \u201cBut that\u2019s why I believe that now, more than ever, is an important time for him. If Eugene enters Akron now, his magic will be able to develop rapidly.\u201d\u201cBut the main question is whether there is even any need to provide him with such a convenience,\u201d the Green Tower Master said as he shook his head. \u201cThe younger he is, the more reason why we shouldn\u2019t rush him into anything. Since we also need to consider Akron\u2019s prestige, as long as the Red Tower Master guides him personally for the next few years\u2026 there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with waiting for him to reach a level that makes it impossible for anyone to object before allowing him free entry into Akron.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any need to procrastinate like that,\u201d Honein argued with his arms crossed defensively. \u201cWith the talent that he\u2019s shown us today, Eugene Lionheart will become an outstanding wizard even without any special guidance. Although I wonder if his\u00a0magic formula\u00a0could also be classified into Circles\u2026. If I had to guess, then I believe that he\u2019ll be able to cast spells at the Fourth Circle without too much trouble before he even becomes an adult.\u201d\u201cAt the very least\u2014\u201d the one who spoke up this time was the only woman on this panel, the White Tower Master. As she twisted strands of her curly hair between her fingers, she continued speaking, \u201c\u2014the spells that the Lionheart kid cast just now\u2026 although they were all First Circle spells, their power far exceeded that of the First Circle. You all felt that, right?\u201d\u201c...Hm\u2026,\u201d came another hum of agreement.The White Tower Master added, \u201cApart from the purity of his mana and the sophistication of his spell structures\u2026 what was particularly surprising was the cohesion of his mana. Although I would need to attempt it personally in order to confirm it, I believe that even a dispel at the level of a Fourth Circle wouldn\u2019t be able to dispel that kid\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cI would agree,\u201d Lovellian nodded his head with a soft smile.\u201c...I think that it would be good to consider this as an investment,\u201d after exchanging a look with Honein, the Chief of the Court Wizards had broken his silence. \u201cHe\u2019s a seventeen-year-old with outstanding talent who was adopted into the Lionheart\u2019s main family. Although he\u2019s young, and his skills aren\u2019t quite up there, isn\u2019t he overflowing with potential? In any case, if his age and skills were enough, there would be no questions about allowing him to enter Akron, so why don\u2019t we issue the entrance permit in advance so that we can build a friendly relationship with him.\u201dOne of the others objected, \u201cIs there a need for that? We already have quite the amicable relationship with the Lionheart clan anyways.\u201dThe Chief argued, \u201cI believe that it would be a worthwhile investment to be owed a personal favor from Eugene Lionheart, not just the Lionheart clan.\u201d\u201c...But even if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll be able to become the Patriarch, no?\u201d the Green Tower Master murmured with a slight frown.At this, Balzac shrugged his shoulders with a grin and said, \u201cOf course, that should be the case. Because no matter how amazing his skills are, Sir Eugene is still an adopted child. The Patriarch\u2026 will probably be one of the main family\u2019s twins.\u201d\u201cCyan Lionheart?\u201d someone recalled his name.\u201cYes. By order of inheritance, Eward Lionheart should have the advantage, but due to the latest unfortunate incident\u2026. Since his skills were also quite lacking, it seems that Eward will have no choice but to be pushed out of the race for succession.\u201d\u201cEven if Eugene Lionheart is unable to become the Patriarch, his position in the main family will by no means be small. The Lionheart\u2019s Second Madam seems to be well aware of this fact.\u201d\u201cInstead, it is because he is unable to become the Patriarch that I believe it would be well worth it to invest in Eugene Lionheart,\u201d as he made his argument, the Chief of the Court Wizards turned to look at the Tower Masters and the Guild Head with calm eyes. \u201cSomeday, Eugene Lionheart will have no choice but to leave the main estate. Should he wish to get married and have children, it is a rule of the Lionheart Clan that he must leave to become independent of the main family.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you want to invite him to Aroth at that point?\u201d someone asked.\u201cSince he is sure to have the skills needed to qualify for an important position by that point, I don\u2019t believe that there is anything wrong with making preparations in advance,\u201d the Chief concluded. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t become independent, I think there will be enough value in having him owe us a favor. As long as he doesn\u2019t become the Patriarch, he will have just as much freedom to act as always, and if he doesn\u2019t forget Aroth\u2019s kindness, he is sure to become a strong ally someday.\u201dThree people had expressed their disagreement with issuing Eugene an entry pass to Akron: the Blue Tower Master, the Green Tower Master, and the Head of the Wizard\u2019s Guild. However, as the discussion progressed, they couldn\u2019t help but be persuaded little by little.That was just how extraordinary the genius that Eugene had shown them was. They couldn\u2019t help but feel pure curiosity. Even though he had only been practicing magic for a few months, he was already that amazing, so if he were introduced to the astounding magic in Akron\u2026 just how far could he develop his own magic? If he wasn\u2019t limited to self-study and received guidance in magic from a proper teacher\u2026.\u201c...I\u2019ve heard that he also showed overwhelming results in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony four years ago,\u201d Balzac mentioned as he stared at the closed door to the room. \u201cEven the Lionheart\u2019s direct line was forced to recognize his talent. If he receives Aroth\u2019s support on top of that\u2026 we might even be able to say that we contributed to the second coming of the Great Vermouth.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026,\u201d the Green Tower Master unconsciously released a chuckle at these words.The second coming of the Great Vermouth? He felt amused that the one who said this was the Black Tower Master.Eventually, the Green Tower Master commented, \u201c...I can\u2019t help but feel that you\u2019re far too generous with your compliments. Balzac Ludbeth, are those words truly yours?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Balzac asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about the Demon King of Incarceration who you\u2019ve contracted yourself to. I only wanted to know whether his influence is coloring your words,\u201d the Green Tower Master explained.\u201cHahaha,\u201d Balzac burst out laughing as he lowered his glasses. \u201cThe Demon King of Incarceration is far too busy with Helmuth\u2019s affairs. Furthermore\u2026\u00a0if I\u00a0was really trying to convey the will of the Demon King of Incarceration, I wouldn\u2019t have made my argument in such a fashion. I would have pushed even harder and more forcefully.\u201d\u201cForcefully?\u201d the Green Tower Master\u2019s eyes cooled considerably.It wasn\u2019t just the Green Tower Master who showed such a reaction.Balzac just let the hostility sent in his direction flow over him as he shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my words sounded offensive, but the weight that the will of the Demon King has on me is far more absolute than anything else.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that lets you off the hook,\u201d the White Tower Master said with a snort as she got up. \u201cIn any case, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ll be able to achieve complete unanimity with our differing opinions. So instead, why don\u2019t we leave it up to a majority vote? Because the longer that our argument\u00a0goes\u00a0on, the more bored that kid waiting outside will get.\u201d\u201cThat would be for the better,\u201d Honein agreed with a smile. \u201cI am in favor of issuing Eugene Lionheart with a permit to enter Akron.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 43.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43.1: Akron (3)This was the first floor of Akron. The entire history of Aroth and Akron covered one wall of this wide-open hall, and quite a few stories related to Sienna were recorded among the rest of the history.This Royal Library not only stored several grimoires of immense value, but on the upper floors, it also kept the various vestiges left by those legendary Archwizards who had left their names in the history of magic.\u2018For being a library, this place also really resembles a museum,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought.Eugene stood and read what was written on the wall with his hands behind his back. Just as expected, what Eugene found the most interesting were the contents about Sienna. Sienna\u2019s vestiges were stored on floors twelve to fourteen. Among all the Archwizards whose names were recorded in Akron\u2019s list of prominent figures, Sienna was the only one with three floors dedicated all to herself.That was just how much of a role the name \u2018Sienna Merdein\u2019 had played in the history of Aroth\u2014no, in the history of magic. She was the Archwizard who had faced off against the Demon Kings together with the Great Vermouth.Vermouth hadn\u2019t really contributed much to the further development of magic, but Sienna had settled in Aroth and spent a long time as the Green Tower Master. She had established the Circles magic formula[1]\u00a0and allowed it to spread so that countless wizards could learn from it.\u2018She really was working hard all her life,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with a wry smile as he read the list of Sienna\u2019s accomplishments.\u00a0\u2018But it really doesn\u2019t suit her.\u2019Live an ordinary life, get married like everyone else, have a child, live peacefully, and become a grandmother; that was what Sienna had told Hamel she wanted to do when she retired.Despite having said that, Sienna had spent her entire life alone. While he was at the Red Tower of Magic, Eugene had found various books written about Sienna, but even though she had lived in Aroth for nearly a hundred years, she didn\u2019t seem to have had even the slightest scandal in all that time.Although she was known as the Wise Sienna, several of Aroth\u2019s history books had given Sienna a different title: the Seeker of Truth[2].Sienna had lived alone her whole life, without consuming any alcohol or living a life of luxury, and she had spent most of her time in either the Green Tower of Magic or her mansion. She never met with any of her three disciples privately outside of the Tower of Magic, and she had never made any appearances at events like parties either.But these anecdotes about Sienna bore no resemblance to the Sienna that Eugene remembered.According to Hamel\u2019s memories, Sienna had enjoyed drinking. Although it wasn\u2019t to the same extent as Anise, throughout their trip, Sienna would constantly steal Anise\u2019s holy water and drink some as she listened to the latest gossip.Sienna had also loved playing around. She loved drinking and chatting with the mercenaries staying in cheap taverns, and she also enjoyed talking to strangers.How could Sienna, with her lively personality, have lived such an ascetic life for this long period of nearly a hundred years, to the extent where she came to be called a Seeker of Truth? Eugene absolutely couldn\u2019t believe such a fact.\u201cHey, kid,\u201d a voice called out.Caught in the midst of reading Sienna\u2019s records over and over again with a frown on his face, Eugene turned to see the White Tower Master, who was smiling as she twisted strands of her curly hair between her fingers.\u201cWhat are you reading so intently?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs there a wizard that you\u2019re interested in?\u201dInstead of answering the question, Eugene asked about something else, \u201cIs the discussion over?\u201dBehind the White Tower Master, the other wizards were walking out of the room.The White Tower Master nodded, \u201cMhm, it\u2019s over. We didn\u2019t keep you waiting for too long, did we?\u201d\u201cIt was actually far quicker than I expected it to be,\u201d Eugene replied.\u201cIf we were forced to come to a unanimous opinion, even the whole day wouldn\u2019t have been enough.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, how did you reach a conclusion?\u201d\u201cWe held a majority vote, of course.\u201dWith a grin, the White Tower Master turned and looked backward.\u201cFive people approved your entry, two people opposed it, and one abstained,\u201d she revealed.Eugene responded, \u201cThat was more support than I had expected.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you curious about who approved, who opposed, and who abstained?\u201d\u201cAs long as I know that more people approved than opposed, I\u2019m fine with that. If that\u2019s the case, then am I allowed to go to the upper floors now?\u201d\u201cMhm, you\u2019re allowed. After all, that is what the majority vote decided. Hah, since it looks like you aren\u2019t all that curious, allow me to just tell you. I\u2019m the one who abstained.\u201dEugene\u2019s eyes widened at these words. From the way she had walked over and started speaking to him in a friendly tone, he had been sure that she was one of those who had approved his entry. While Eugene tilted his head in confusion, the White Tower Master giggled as she looked at him.\u201cFrom the atmosphere in the room, it felt like there would be a lot of people voting for you in any case, so I didn\u2019t feel like the outcome would change just because I abstained,\u201d she explained. \u201cOh, but there\u2019s no need to worry. Although I may have abstained, I\u2019m not opposed to you entering Akron.\u201d\u201cBut no matter your reasoning, you didn\u2019t approve my entry either,\u201d Eugene refuted.\u201cThat may be the case. The truth is, I felt a bit ambivalent about it. You might be overflowing with talent and full of potential. However, isn\u2019t it just a fact that you\u2019re still a bit too young?\u201d as she said this, the White Tower Master lowered her voice. Then, leaning over slightly towards Eugene, she whispered quietly, \u201cAnd besides. The crucial point is that if I showed my support to either side through my vote, I would just get caught up in an annoying argument. You can see it in their faces, right? They all still look upset\u2026. Even though the majority vote has already been cast, and a conclusion has been reached, they\u2019ll just change the location and start arguing once more.\u201d\u201cAnd what about you, White Tower Master?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cSince I abstained, I don\u2019t need to care about it. I can just tell them honestly that I won\u2019t change my neutral position no matter what they want me to hear.\u201dAfter straightening up once more, the White Tower Master waved her hand toward the other wizards. The only person who showed any reaction was the Blue Tower Master, who still had the uptight look on his face. After shooting a disgusted expression at the White Tower Master, he sighed deeply and made his way out of Akron.The White Tower Master suddenly said, \u201cThe Blue Tower Master approved.\u201dEugene was slow to respond, \u201c...Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about your permission to enter Akron. At first, he was opposed to it, but he seemed to have changed his mind along the way.\u201dEugene felt surprised at these words. From the moment he had entered the room, the Blue Tower Master seemed the most blatantly dissatisfied with his presence, but it seemed that the Tower Master had ultimately changed his opinion.\u201cNow then, dum-dum-dum. Who do you think the two opposing parties were?\u201d the White Tower Master asked.\u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t curious,\u201d Eugene grumbled.\u201cIt was the Green Tower Master and the Head of the Wizard\u2019s Guild.\u201d\u201cWhy are you still telling me this when I\u2019ve said that I\u2019m not curious about it?\u201d\u201cAre you really seventeen years old? What\u2019s with that cold reaction? Shouldn\u2019t you be more upset and frustrated?\u201d\u201cWhat is there to be upset and frustrated about?\u201d\u201c\u2018How dare they ignore the prestige of the Lionheart\u2019s direct line?\u2019 Don\u2019t you have any feelings of offended elitism?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cIs it because you feel like you\u2019re just from a collateral branch, after all?\u201d\u201cHah, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Eugene sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just, why should I show any elitism? How disgusting would it be for me to come all this way to a foreign country, only to get drunk on such nonsense.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about your older brother, right?\u201d the White Tower Master asked with a mischievous smile.Eugene looked confused for a moment, and then glared at the White Tower Master.The White Tower Master\u2019s name was Melkith El-Hayah.Even Eugene had heard about her. She was known as the best Spirit Summoner of their time. She was the first person in history to have signed a contract with two Spirit Kings at the same time. Not only was she skilled in Spirit magic, but she was also a great wizard who had reached the level of being called an Archwizard in general magic as well.\u201cYou really do keep saying things that I don\u2019t want to listen to. Do you have some kind of grudge against me?\u201d Eugene probed.\u201cNope,\u201d Melkith denied it.\u201cThen, do you have any ill feelings for the other wizards?\u201d\u201cNo way. Do you really think that the words I said just now were an attempt to stoke bad blood between you and the others? Yeesh, it\u2019s nothing like that. What would I get from poisoning your impressions of them?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why are you telling me all this?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m interested.\u201d With a grin, Melkith pointed at the Storm Sword Wynnyd, which was hanging at Eugene\u2019s waist, \u201cI know what that sword is. It\u2019s a treasure of the Lionheart clan, the Storm Sword Wynnyd. I\u2019ve heard that that sword has even been blessed with the protection of the Wind Spirit King?\u201dEugene confirmed it, \u201cYep, so what about it?\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m interested in you as well, I\u2019m even more interested in that sword of yours. For a long time now, I\u2019ve always wanted to sign a contract with the Spirit King of the Wind, but\u2026. he seems to be such a proud person that, no matter how many times I try to summon him, he just won\u2019t appear.\u201d\u201cFrom what I\u2019m aware of, Head Wizard, haven\u2019t you already signed a contract with two Spirit Kings? Aren\u2019t those two enough to satisfy you?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not enough.\u201d1. Circles magic formula was previously translated as Circles magic system. We changed this to formula when OBW realized that \u201cformula\u201d was a better translation than \u201csystem.\u201d\u00a0\u261c2. A term usually used to describe someone who seeks the Buddhist path to enlightenment through ascetic training. A Western equivalent may be the hermits who live in poverty.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 43.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43.2: Akron (3)Melkith was staring at Wynnyd with sparkling eyes. It looked as if she was just about to run over and try to tear it from him.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying really hard, you know?\u201d Melkith whined. \u201cI\u2019ve even begged the Lightning Spirit King and the Earth Spirit King, but they\u2019ve told me that the Wind Spirit King won\u2019t sign a contract with anyone. That\u2019s why I sent such an earnest letter to the Lionheart\u2019s main family, begging to borrow Wynnyd, but do you know what they sent back in their reply?\u201dIgnoring her question, Eugene asked, \u201cIs it alright for me to head upstairs?\u201d\u201cThey said that the treasures of the main family can never be lent to outsiders. Petty bastards, it\u2019s like they think I might take Wynnyd and go into hiding with it. I just want to use it as a catalyst of a contract, so why\u00a0do they have to be\u00a0so stubborn about obstructing me,\u201d Melkith complained.Eugene sighed, \u201cHey, no matter what you tell me, I have no intention of loaning Wynnyd to you, Head Wizard. Strictly speaking, it\u2019s not like I own Wynnyd. I\u2019m borrowing it with the Patriarch\u2019s permission.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Melkith promised. \u201cYou can just lend it to me for a few moments. It probably won\u2019t take that long? Just a day at the most.\u00a0If you want, you can even watch as I use it.\u201dIn fact, this proposition was quite appealing to Eugene. Vermouth had died, and although Sienna appeared to be alive, she wasn\u2019t in a state where she could speak to him as she seemed to be sealed away somewhere in this vast world. As for Anise? Having become a pilgrim, her tracks had been cut off two hundred years ago, and the whereabouts of Molon, that bastard, were similarly unknown.In this current era, only the Wind Spirit King, Tempest, knew the full story of what had happened three hundred years ago in the castle of the Demon King of Incarceration. Of course, Tempest had played innocent, claiming that he didn\u2019t know anything, but Eugene definitely couldn\u2019t believe those words.Eugene cursed internally,\u00a0\u2018That son of a bitch, his fat ass must have gotten pretty damn heavy over the years since he won\u2019t come out no matter how many times I call him.\u2019During these past four years, Eugene had attempted to summon Tempest several times. Every time he had reached the next star in the White Flame Formula and every time his mana capacity had increased. Although he'd even attempted to use his contracted sylphs to reach out to the Wind Spirit King, Tempest had never once responded to any of his summons.\u2018With the amount of mana I currently have, I still can\u2019t summon Tempest,\u2019\u00a0Eugene calculated.However, Melkith might be able to summon him. Wouldn\u2019t she also have the necessary qualifications as well? Amongst the Spirit Summoners who had made a name for themselves on this continent, Melkith was the only one who had made a contract with two Spirit Kings at the same time. Although he hadn\u2019t appeared whenever she had tried to summon him up until now, if Wynnyd was used as the catalyst, who knew how Tempest might react.Melkith tried to keep Eugene from leaving, \u201cKid, where are you going? I haven\u2019t finished talking to you yet.\u201dEugene just asked, \u201cIt seems that there\u2019s no point in listening any longer, so why should I stick around?\u201dAlthough he had his hopes up for it, Eugene wasn\u2019t going to show a positive reaction to Melkith\u2019s proposal just yet. Rather than allowing her to simply grab onto the bait, it was better to tease the line a bit to see if he was able to draw in a bigger catch.\u201cI asked, where are you going?\u201d Melkith insisted.\u201cI\u2019m heading up,\u201d Eugene replied. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I\u2019d been given permission to enter? Or do I still need something like an entry pass?\u201d\u201cIf you go over there and ask for one, they\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d Melkith surprisingly answered his question immediately.Eugene headed over to the door that she had pointed out.Even a place like Akron had a Library Director. Although he was called the Director, he was actually just a public servant who wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the upper floors and merely managed the\u00a0familiars[1]\u00a0responsible for the maintenance. The elderly wizard currently filling the position immediately opened the door at the sound of Eugene\u2019s knock.\u201cI\u2019ve already heard the news,\u201d the Head Librarian stated before Eugene could say anything.It didn\u2019t take long for his entry pass to be issued. Akron's seal was stamped on the back of Eugene\u2019s identity card, and that was all there was to it.\u201cIf I had tried to go up without this entry pass, what would have happened to me?\u201d Eugene asked out of curiosity.\u201cYou would die,\u201d the Director casually replied, as if it was only natural. \u201cFirst of all, Akron\u2019s interception magic would pierce through your entire body, and if that wasn\u2019t enough to kill you, all of Akron\u2019s familiars would be put into attack mode. Although before that happened, the wizards with entry passes into Akron would have been dispatched to stop you.\u201d\u201cDid you know? The familiars who work here were all left behind by the Archwizards whose names have been written on Akron\u2019s wall,\u201d this fact came from Melkith, who had yet to leave Eugene\u2019s side. As she gazed at Wynnyd with greedy eyes, she continued speaking, \u201cThis, of course, includes those belonging to the Magic King who founded Aroth, a few from the Battlemage who was called the Father of Battle Magic, and familiars which belonged to the Wise Sienna as well.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene stayed silent.\u201cKid, your reactions really are bland. Don\u2019t you have a tremendous amount of interest in Lady Sienna?\u201d Melkith asked with a half-smile. \u201cI saw everything earlier. You were reading the records belonging to Lady Sienna over and over again. On your first day in Aroth, you headed straight to Lady Sienna\u2019s mansion for a tour, and last time, you even met with your friend from a different collateral branch at Merdein Square.\u201d\u201cWhy do you know so much about my activities?\u201d Eugene asked, disturbed.Melkith teased him, \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re not too aware of it, kid, but you\u2019re actually really famous.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know I\u2019m famous,\u201d Eugene replied with a snort.\u201cYour personality is a little\u2026 unlike your appearance. It\u2019s lacking in charm.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by saying it\u2019s unlike my appearance?\u201d\u201cYou have a handsome face, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cSo please just think of my rudeness as the cost of enjoying my good looks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a little lacking. You really aren\u2019t charming at all.\u201d\u201cBut why do you keep calling me a kid?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m calling you a kid because you are one. Aren\u2019t you just seventeen years old? Phew, you still smell like breast milk.\u201d\u201cThere are some words running through my head right now, but I\u2019m not sure if I should spit them out.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of words?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just keep quiet. Since they feel a bit too rude to express during our first meeting.\u201dThere was no way that he was trying to say that she smelled like a granny, right? After gazing at Eugene speechlessly, Melkith sniffed her own body.\u201cI don\u2019t smell of anything,\u201d she insisted.Eugene returned the favor, \u201cAnd I also don\u2019t give off the smell of milk.\u201d\u201cAnyways, when are you going to lend me Wynnyd?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to lend it to you.\u201dIgnoring Melkith, who was continuing to follow him, Eugene turned to look at his surroundings. He was just wondering if he needed to find some stairs in order to go to the upper floors, but then he spotted the elevator in the corner.Melkith helpfully explained, \u201cDo you see the hole beside the door? If you put your ID card in there, the door will open. You\u2019re going up to the twelfth floor, right?\u201d\u201cYep,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cSee, it seems like you really do like Lady Sienna a whole lot.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d\u201cCould it be because you\u2019re just a young kid that you seem embarrassed by the strangest things? It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. This big sister understands everything. Children are usually like that, aren\u2019t they? Especially boys. They\u2019re never honest about saying that they like what they like, and that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019re so cute.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it going a bit too far to call yourself \u2018big sister\u2019?\u201d\u201cYou, just now, were you asking that because of my age?\u201d\u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, you are already over sixty years old.\u201dEven if he added the years from his previous life to his current age, Melkith still had more years than him. Of course, going by Melkith\u2019s outer appearance, she looked like she was in her mid-twenties at most, but just because she kept her looks young didn\u2019t mean her true age got any younger.Melkith defended herself, \u201cWhen you\u2019re young at heart, why should age even matter? So don\u2019t be shy, and feel free to call me big sis.\u201dEugene didn\u2019t reply to these words. Instead, he placed his ID in the elevator\u2019s slot and lost himself in some irrelevant thoughts.If Sienna truly was alive and had lived all this time, that meant that her age had to be over three hundred years old.Eugene made a note to himself,\u00a0\u2018When we meet, I might have to call her a grandma.\u2019Or it might be better to call her an undead rather than a grandma. Of course, if he really did say that in front of her, Sienna was sure to try to kill Eugene while oozing bloodlust.He would actually be very happy if that were to happen.With a wry smile, Eugene entered the elevator. Melkith didn\u2019t get onto the elevator with him. She stood outside the elevator and waved her hand at him with a grin.\u201cCome back soon,\u201d she said.Eugene asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be waiting here for me, are you?\u201d\u201cEven I\u2019m not such a free-willed person,\u201d Melkith pouted. \u201cAlthough I actually want to go and take a look with you, ummm\u2026. But if I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to focus.\u201d\u201cThat would definitely be the case,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cMhm, since that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m not going with you. Although I won\u2019t get to see your shock when you face a glimpse of the truth\u2026.\u00a0Fufu, your first time is definitely the most intense.\u201d As Melkith hid a laugh, she pointed at Eugene\u2019s lower body and said, \u201cIt might be better for you if you wear a diaper?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou might just wet your pants a little.\u201dIt had been pointless to ask. With a deep frown, Eugene pressed the button for the twelfth, then he immediately pounded the button to close the door.The elevator climbed up. It didn\u2019t take that long for it to reach the twelfth floor. It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that he had arrived on the twelfth floor in the blink of an eye.Eugene was greeted by a voice saying, \u201cWelcome to Sienna\u2019s hall.\u201dAs soon as the elevator doors opened, he was welcomed by a little girl looking up at Eugene with a broad smile.\u201c...,\u201d Eugene\u2019s lips parted silently as he looked down at the girl.The girl, who appeared to be about ten years old, looked exactly like the Sienna that Eugene remembered.1.\u00a0These are the servants summoned or created by wizards to handle their chores.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Eugene could see Sienna\u2019s childhood form in the familiar in front of him. With her light purple hair and an indescribably mischievous smile, although its age was a lot younger, the familiar looked just like Sienna.\u201c...A familiar?\u201d Eugene eventually asked.\u201cYes!\u201d the girl chirped in confirmation.\u201c...That\u2019s\u2026. Um\u2026.\u201dYou really aren\u2019t Sienna?Eugene desperately suppressed his desire to ask such a question. Thinking of Sienna\u2019s illusion that he had met in the square in front of the bank, there was no way for this familiar in front of him to be Sienna herself.\u201c...What should I call you?\u201d Eugene hesitantly asked as he examined the familiar.The short familiar\u2019s height was hovering around Eugene\u2019s waist. Thanks to that, Eugene had to bow his head slightly just to look at the familiar.\u201cLady Sienna named me \u2018Mer,\u2019\u201d the familiar declared.\u201cNo way. Did she really name you Mer after the Mer in Merdein?\u201d asked Eugene.\u201cYes! It\u2019s such a glorious name, don\u2019t you think?\u201d while Mer replied with a bashful smile, Eugene could only snort in disbelief.Merdein was Sienna\u2019s surname. Having made a familiar in her own image, she had just ripped off the first half of her surname and attached it to the familiar as its name.\u2018What was she thinking?\u2019\u00a0Eugene pondered.Hesitantly, Eugene asked, \u201c...Uh, I\u2019m just asking since I don\u2019t know much about your kind, but are familiars usually\u2026 um\u2026 as human-like as you are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m special, of course,\u201d Mer answered, her chin raised proudly. \u201cThe one who made me was the Wise Sienna, companion of the Great Vermouth. The familiars found on the other floors aren\u2019t as special as I am.\u201d\u201c...Is that so?\u201d\u201cYep! You haven\u2019t been to the other floors yet, right, Sir Eugene?\u201d\u201cHow do you know my name? Are you really a familiar?\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201dWhat kind of nonsense was that? As Eugene stared at Mer with suspiciously peeled eyes, Mer could only put a bewildered expression on her face.\u201cSir Eugene Lionheart, didn\u2019t you just now register your name with Akron on the first floor?\u201d Mer reminded him.\u201c...So I did,\u201d Eugene recalled.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just me. All the familiars in this place are linked to Akron\u2019s systems. We know exactly who is entering and exiting Akron at all times,\u201d Mer creepily explained.Eugene changed the subject, \u201cSo you were saying that you\u2019re a special case among familiars?\u201d\u201cYep!\u201d Mer raised her chin once more and pulled a boastful expression as she explained, \u201cYou can see it for yourself if you go to one of the other floors; the familiars there aren\u2019t as good at conversation as I am. They can only execute what was programmed into them when they were first created and respond to external commands.\u201d\u201c...And what about you?\u201d\u201cI was created with the personality of my master, the Lady Sienna, as the basis.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a taboo of magic to create a living being?\u201d Eugene asked as he recalled the words he had heard at the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony a few years back.Why can\u2019t you create anything living?Eward, at that time, hadn\u2019t shown any interest in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, but his eyes had been shining brightly as he gazed upon Lovellian\u2019s magic. Unfortunately, even though Eward had held such interest in magic, he had still turned into such garbage after four years had passed.\u201cBut I\u2019m not a living being,\u201d Mer said in a tone that didn\u2019t have even a trace of uncertainty. \u201cAlthough it may look like I\u2019m alive, I don\u2019t have a soul like all living beings have. My body was created through Lady Sienna\u2019s magic, and as for my consciousness\u2026.\u201dMer returned the hat to her head and turned to look behind her. Only then did Eugene also tear his gaze away from Mer to look ahead of him. Up ahead, he saw a large sphere of light floating in the room, with several orbiting rings slowly rotating around the sphere of light.\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d Mer declared with a bright smile.Eugene stared blankly at the sphere. It was his first time seeing such a three-dimensional artwork. Even at first glance, it gave off a mysterious impression, but Eugene\u2019s senses detected an absurdly huge and elaborate arrangement of mana located within the sculpture.\u201c...What on earth is that?\u201d Eugene eventually asked.Mer smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question!\u201dMer puffed out her chest and threw her shoulders back, tilting her head backward in the process and causing her large hat, which was far bigger than her head, to also tilt backward. From the way her hat remained perched on her head despite looking like it could fall at any moment, it seemed like she was accustomed to making such movements.\u201cThat is the distilled essence of all the magic that Lady Sienna developed over the course of her life. That is \u2018Witch Craft!\u2019\u201d Mer revealed with a prideful cry.Eugene\u2019s jaw couldn\u2019t help but drop once more.\u00a0This was Witch Craft? The grimoire that Sienna was said to have just finished writing before she disappeared and was said to have been divided into three volumes?!\u201cHow does that look anything like a book?\u201d Eugene protested.Mer sniffed, \u201cIt\u2019s an outdated prejudice to say that a book should look like a book.\u201d\u201cThat just sounds like nonsense\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that Sir Eugene doesn\u2019t understand it. After all, there\u2019s no way that Sir Eugene is capable of understanding Lady Sienna\u2019s magic when even the Tower Masters can\u2019t comprehend it, right?\u201dMer\u2019s words were overflowing with pride, and her mischievous smile was full of confidence. And at the same time, her attitude subtly looked down upon the one facing her. She had said that she was based on Sienna\u2019s personality\u2026. Indeed, Mer was very similar to Sienna in the way that she was annoying and lacking in any charm.\u201c...You said that your creation was based on\u2026 Lady Sienna's personality, right?\u201d Eugene felt the need to confirm it.\u201cYes!\u201d Mer answered proudly.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 um\u2026 right up until she disappeared, was Lady Sienna\u2019s character similar to yours?\u201dEugene recalled the appearance of Sienna that he had seen in her portrait. It had a warm and benevolent smile that had seemed unlike her. The Sienna that Eugene remembered had never once shown that sort of smile.\u201cOf course it\u2019s different,\u201d Mer replied with a grin. \u201cLady Sienna was much nobler and overflowing with dignity. She didn\u2019t laugh much and was solely preoccupied with researching and developing magic.\u201dAfter a brief pause, Eugene asked, \u201c...If that\u2019s the case, then why is your character like that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my character?\u201d\u201cEven though you were based on Lady Sienna\u2019s personality, you seem completely different from the Lady Sienna you described.\u201d\u201cOf course I am. That\u2019s because the personality I was based on is Lady Sienna\u2019s childhood personality.\u201dThat annoying chick. It looked like she was even more annoying when she was a little girl.Eventually, Eugene changed the subject, \u201c...So what did you mean by saying that your consciousness is in there?\u201dMer hesitated, \u201cHmmm\u2026 that\u2019s a tricky question. How should I put it so that you, Sir Eugene, who hasn't had much education, can understand it\u2026?\u201d\u201cJust tell it to me in a way that\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m something like an artificial intelligence that Lady Sienna created for Witch Craft.\u201dThat was certainly an easy concept to understand.Mer explained, \u201cMy consciousness is maintained by Witch Craft\u2019s magic, and the purpose of my existence is to protect and maintain Witch Craft. I have been supervising this hall following the orders that Lady Sienna gave me two hundred years ago.\u201dEugene walked past Mer without saying anything. He could feel Mer begin to follow along behind him at a quick trot.\u201c...Why did Lady Sienna use her childhood personality as a base for you?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cJust to reminisce,\u201d said Mer.\u201cReminisce?\u201d\u201cIt might still be hard for Sir Eugene to understand, but most adults find it hard to recall their childhood. Although their memories might remain clear, they often can\u2019t quite remember what kind of \u2018personality\u2019 they may have had just from reconstructing those memories.\u201d\u201c...I guess that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cSo, to reminisce about her childhood, Lady Sienna decided to restrict my personality to one based on her childhood memories. Her magic was so amazing that it was easy for her to call up those distant memories.\u201dEugene came to a stop in front of Witch Craft. Having gotten this close to it, its majesty really was impressive. The glowing sphere that was encased within several rings was the distilled essence of an Archwizard\u2019s understanding of magic that had been preserved for hundreds of years.Eugene suddenly thought of something, \u201c...If that\u2019s the case, do you have all of Lady Sienna\u2019s memories?\u201d\u201cNo way,\u201d Mer said, bursting into laughter. \u201cAlthough Lady Sienna may have used her personality as the base for mine, she didn\u2019t go so far as to share all her memories with me. If she had, there was a good chance that my existence could be abused.\u201d\u201cThat sounds about right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If Mer had all of Sienna\u2019s memories, there was no way that the wizards of Aroth would have left her alone.They might have dismantled Mer in order to extract all her memories of magic, or else they could have used her to research new magic. No matter how much the wizards respected Sienna, if there had been something like \u2018that\u2019 in front of them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to call themselves wizards if they didn\u2019t take it apart to study it.Eugene concluded,\u00a0\u2018The fact that they haven\u2019t means\u2026.\u2019That it either couldn\u2019t be done.It didn\u2019t need to be done.Or they had already done it.Eugene openly stared at Mer. As far as Eugene\u2019s understanding went, Mer\u2019s very existence as Witch Craft's artificial intelligence was absurd. It was just as Lovellian had said. When the Head Wizard had first read the first volume of Witch Craft, he had said that all the magic that he learned up to that point in his life now seemed like child\u2019s play.\u2018Certainly, this is far beyond the realm of ordinary magic,\u2019\u00a0Eugene nodded in understanding.Was this why Melkith had warned him to wear a diaper because he might wet himself? As Eugene recalled Melkith\u2019s mischievous smile, he shook his head.\u2018The original text of Witch Craft is still under the sole care of Akron. Any wizard permitted to enter Akron is allowed to read Witch Craft,\u2019\u00a0Eugene considered.Since the secrets of Mer\u2019s consciousness and existence were clearly recorded within Witch Craft, there was no need to dismantle her.Eventually, Eugene asked, \u201c...Do you know why Lady Sienna went into seclusion, or where she went?\u201d\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mer huffed. \u201cLady Sienna\u2019s disappearance was both surprising and secretive. Neither her disciples nor the servants at her mansion nor myself knew anything about Lady Sienna\u2019s retreat into seclusion.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cSir Eugene, how many times do you think I\u2019ve been asked a question like that over the past two hundred years?\u201dMer\u2019s expression had shifted. She no longer puffed out her chest, her shoulders had slumped, and the pride-filled smile on her face disappeared. Her cold, dull eyes seemed to lack even a single ray of light and were framed by scrunched-up brows and a twisted half-smile.That smile was so similar to Sienna\u2019s that it gave Eugene goosebumps.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that question so many times that I\u2019ve lost count. I was already stored in Akron long before Lady Sienna decided to go into seclusion. But the king of Aroth, the Tower Masters of that time, the Head of the Wizard\u2019s Guild, and countless other wizards still captured me and asked me for Lady Sienna\u2019s whereabouts,\u201d Mer complained bitterly.Had something like that really happened?Mer continued, \u201cI told them that I didn\u2019t know anything. However, just like you did now, they didn\u2019t believe me. So I told them to just do what they pleased. Then men who didn\u2019t even know what they were doing and were lacking in skills started trying to access Witch Craft and messing with my memories. They seem to have lost their ability to learn from their mistakes since they keep finding me in order to repeat the same attempts every few decades.\u201dSo they\u2019d already done it. Since Sienna went into seclusion, Aroth\u2019s wizards had already scoured Witch Craft and Mer\u2019s mind several times.\u201cHowever, I really don\u2019t know anything about Lady Sienna\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Mer repeated. \u201cThe last time I saw Lady Sienna, she showed no signs of wanting to go into seclusion.\u201d\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve asked you a pointless question,\u201d Eugene apologized.\u201cAs long as you\u2019re aware of that.\u201dEugene stepped away from Witch Craft. Although he wanted to take a closer look at Sienna\u2019s magic that had been stored within it, the truth was that he currently did not have the confidence to understand it even if he did see it.\u201c...They say only the first volume is displayed at Akron, is that correct?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cYep,\u201d Mer confirmed.He followed with another question, \u201cAre the other two volumes stored here as well?\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d Mer shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014no, I mean\u00a0that\u00a0is definitely the original text of Witch Craft, but only the first volume is stored inside there. Lady Sienna took the other two volumes with her when she left.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Eugene exclaimed in surprise.\u201cUmmm\u2026,\u201d Mer seemed hesitant to admit it. \u201cLady Sienna \u2018extracted\u2019 the second and third volumes from the original text, and when only the first volume was left, she donated the original text to Akron. Thanks to that, I\u2019ve really suffered a lot. They all\u2026 not only do they want to find Lady Sienna\u2019s whereabouts, but they also want to find the location of the two other volumes,\u201d as she said this, Mer drew closer to Eugene. \u201cSir Eugene seems to have a lot of interest in Lady Sienna.\u201dEugene defended himself, \u201cIsn\u2019t that true of everyone who comes here?\u201d\u201cThat may be the case, but Sir Eugene isn\u2019t exactly an ordinary wizard, right? Although I have never been able to leave Akron or had any reason to, for these past hundreds of years, even I have heard about the Lionheart clan.\u201d Mer lifted her head to look up at Eugene and continued, \u201cThe clan left by the Great Vermouth. This is my first time actually seeing one of his descendants, so it feels a little amazing.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to go so far as to feel amazed.\u201d\u201cNo, I really am. From what I can recall, before Lady Sienna donated me to Aroth, she never once interacted with the Lionheart clan. She never even met with Vermouth again.\u201dEugene was also aware of these facts. In the three-hundred-year-old history kept by the Lionheart clan, there was strangely very little contact made with Sienna and Anise.The same went for Molon as well. Although Eugene didn\u2019t know the reason, that fool, he had never once come to see Vermouth after Vermouth was done establishing the Lionheart clan.In the end, after Molon had stepped down from his throne, his descendants, the royalty of the Northern Ruhr Kingdom, and the Lionheart clan had begun making contact little by little. But considering the relationship and ties between their ancestors, the connection between the royal family of Ruhr and the Lionheart clan was pretty shallow.Eugene definitely couldn\u2019t tell the reason for this. Although Vermouth was a bastard with abysmal social skills, Anise had followed Vermouth while claiming that he would be the hero to save the world. Molon had also been intimidated by Vermouth and had usually refrained from his foolish behavior when standing in front of the hero.But why hadn\u2019t they stayed connected after returning from Helmuth, without ever meeting with each other?Eugene recalled,\u00a0\u2018...According to the records of the Lionheart clan, there was no further interaction after the clan was established. The next time that any of the companions met\u2026 was at Vermouth\u2019s funeral.\u2019Vermouth\u2019s funeral had become a day of national mourning for the Kiehl empire. At that time, Anise had recited a tribute as the Saintess of the Holy Empire, and Molon, as the king of the Northern Ruhr Kingdom, had taken off his garish crown and personally carried Vermouth\u2019s coffin. As Aroth\u2019s Green Tower Master, Sienna had\u2026 when it looked like the sky was about to pour down with rain, she had used her magic to part the sky and made warm sunlight shine down on Vermouth as they parted ways with him.In the end, the only reunion of these companions following their return from Helmuth was for Vermouth\u2019s funeral.This made Eugene feel like there was a strong sense of separation between them and this filled him with complicated questions.Eventually, Eugene asked, \u201c...In your memories, were there any times when Lady Sienna talked about her former companions?\u201d\u201cThere were times she would look at Sir Molon and call him an idiot,\u201d Mer confessed.\u201cAnd Anise?\u201d\u201cShe called her a snake-like woman.\u201d\u201c...What about Hamel?\u201cIdiot, son of a bitch, fool, and motherfucker.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say earlier that Lady Sienna was \u2018much nobler, and overflowing with dignity?\u2019 And you said that she didn't even smile much.\u201d\u201cEven a noble person overflowing with dignity can do something like swearing. Also, whenever Lady Sienna talked about her former companions, she never once appeared to smile. Instead, her expressions always seemed like she was about to cry.\u201d As Mer recalled those memories from hundreds of years ago, she turned her head and spoke, \u201cEspecially when she would talk about Hamel, it was extremely distressing for her.\u201dA large portrait hung in the direction that Mer had turned her head to. It was the same portrait as the one hanging in Sienna\u2019s mansion.The portrait where she had on a benevolent smile.\u201c...That portrait is a forgery,\u201d Mer revealed.\u201cA forgery?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cLady Sienna never once smiled like that.\u201d\u201cShe might have smiled like that sometime before creating you.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s definitely a forgery. Of course, that portrait was painted before I was created, but I once asked her directly during the frequent talks Lady Sienna held with me to establish my personality.\u201d\u201c...What did you ask her about?\u201d\u201cI asked Lady Sienna why she always seemed so sad.\u201d Mer looked at the portrait for a few moments before looking up at Eugene. Then she mimicked the same smile as the one that Sienna had on in the portrait and said, \u201cAlthough Lady Sienna wasn\u2019t able to smile like me, she explained to me why she would leave behind a portrait like that.\u201dIf it was meant to be passed down to future generations, it would be better to see a smiling face rather than a sad face.\u201cAs for that portrait\u2026 the artist just randomly drew a smile. Perhaps that\u2019s why Lady Sienna didn\u2019t like it very much. Although the portrait is currently up for public display in her mansion, at least while I was there, the portrait was always left hanging with its face against the wall. That goes for the portrait in this hall as well.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene silently contemplated the portrait.\u201cI\u2019m the one who flipped over the portrait in this hall,\u201d Mer confessed. \u201cBecause it\u2019s true that it\u2019s always nice to see a smiling face.\u201dEugene unconsciously reached out and patted Mer on the head.However, Mer immediately knocked away his hand and gravely said, \u201cDon\u2019t cross the line.\u201dComing to his senses, Eugene apologized, \u201cOh\u2026 you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cAlthough I might have a smaller body than you, Sir Eugene, I\u2019ve been here for over two hundred years, you know.\u201d\u201c...Did Lady Sienna have anything to say about Vermouth?\u201dMer pursed her lips and turned around, \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about him.\u201dWas she mad that he had patted her head? Without looking back at Eugene, Mer walked off with short, quick steps.\u201cShe didn\u2019t make any compliments, curses, or even observations about him.\u201dOpenbookworm's ThoughtsdMomo: I felt sorry for Mer, even though she is an AI. On another not, all the hero party definitely had a falling out after Hamel died. I am guessing it is related to the deal that Vermouth made with the DKs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The various magical tools that Sienna had used during her lifetime that couldn\u2019t be kept in her mansion because it had been opened up as a tourist attraction were stored here instead.For example, the staff that Mer was pointing to. That item was also included in Eugene\u2019s memories.\u201c...It\u2019s called Akasha,\u201d he recalled.\u201cAs expected, you already knew about it,\u201d Mer smiled triumphantly and puffed out her chest. \u201cThere is a type of tree known as the Fairy Tree, which only grows in Samar Forest, the sanctuary of the elves. Akasha, the most powerful magic staff in the world, was made from the roots of that thousand-year-old tree which grows in the center of their forest.\u201dHer voice, which was trembling with excitement, really made Eugene feel like he was listening to Sienna. Sienna had personally explained the staff\u2019s origins to him a long time ago, and like a parrot, she had kept repeating those boasts about it whenever she got drunk.Mer continued her tale, \u201cThe elves believe that the ancient tree holds the spirits of their ancestors and that its roots support the entire world.\u00a0This World Tree is the center of the elves\u2019 religion.\u00a0You know what that means, right? Those arrogant elves actually cut off a root of that ancient and sacred tree in order to make this staff as a gift for Lady Sienna!\u201dSienna wasn\u2019t an elf or even a half-elf.Although she was a human, Sienna was often associated with the elves. Among the many rumors about where she might have gone into seclusion, a few speculated that she may have taken refuge in Samar Forest, the sanctuary of the elves.Sienna didn\u2019t know who her parents were. When she was just a baby, she was abandoned in the great jungle at the southern tip of the continent, the Samar Forest. Usually, she would have been eaten by a monster or a wild beast, but Sienna\u2019s luck was good that day. An elf who just so happened to be passing by was drawn to the baby\u2019s cries and saved Sienna.That was how Sienna was taken to the elves\u2019 sacred grove, which lay somewhere in the heart of that jungle.The elves there were not too welcoming of Sienna. However, after discovering that she had tremendous magical talent, they recognized her as one of their own and taught her the magic of the elves.As Eugene stared at Akasha with blank eyes, Mer continued the lecture in her high-pitched voice.\u201cLady Sienna is the first person to ever own a staff made from the roots of the World Tree. Even among the elves, this was an unprecedented honor. Not only that, do you see that thing over there. The red jewel at the end of the staff! If you\u2019re curious to know what that is, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cA Dragonheart,\u201d Eugene interrupted.Mer took this interjection in her stride, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right! Among all the magic staffs that exist in the world, there are only two staffs that have incorporated a Dragonheart. One is Lady Sienna\u2019s Akasha, and the other is\u2026.\u201d\u201cVladmir,\u201d Eugene answered the unspoken question in a calm tone.That terrible staff had still been around three hundred years ago. At that time, Vladmir\u2019s owner was a lich named Belial, a servant of the Demon King of Incarceration.Eugene had an ill-fated relationship with that staff.Eugene needlessly glanced down at his own stomach. In his previous life, the one who had killed him was that lich, Belial. That guy was responsible for the powerful traps installed all over the Demon King\u2019s castle, and their party had been constantly harassed by those traps without getting any time to rest.During their time in that castle, Hamel had been left with a body that was in danger of dying at any moment after a hole was pierced through his chest.From the very start, the Castle of the Demon King of Incarceration was so torturous that it was incomparable to the castles of the previous Demon Kings. On top of that, all the demonic beasts and demonfolk who guarded the castle were powerful enough to be a match for any of the previous Demon Kings\u2019 servants.And even among those powerful guardians, there were three especially powerful demonfolk. These three were known as Incarceration\u2019s Blade, Shield, and Staff, respectively.While they were in the middle of fighting Incarceration\u2019s Shield, Belial, the Staff, had intervened. In the Castle of the Demon King of Incarceration, it was impossible to completely remove the effects of black magic and any curses cast on them by the Staff, even with Anise\u2019s holy magic.Someone had been needed to push forward and open up a path.Hamel had volunteered for that role. Although Molon would normally have been the one to assume such a role, Hamel had rejected him and insisted he would take the lead, thus paving their way forward.It was impossible for them to conquer the Castle of the Demon King of Incarceration without anyone dying.So if someone had to die for it\u2026.\u2018Let that person be me,\u2019\u00a0he had insisted.Hamel was strong.But he wasn\u2019t as strong as Vermouth.Hamel was tough.But he wasn\u2019t as tough as Molon.Having been well aware of these facts, he had taken the lead. So that even if he died, Molon would be there to endure the blows. Even if he could no longer fight, Vermouth would still be there to keep fighting.Once Incarceration\u2019s Shield was defeated, Hamel had suffered so many injuries that he was already on the verge of death. Neither divine power nor magic could be used to heal his wounds. The evil power of the Demon King\u2019s Castle and the curses of the lich drove Hamel close to death.And once the battle with Belial, Incarceration\u2019s Staff, was over, a large hole had been pierced through Hamel\u2019s chest.That was how his previous life had ended.Hamel had been killed by Belial and Vladmir. Eugene had definitely believed that Vladmir was destroyed. Just before he died, he had witnessed Belial\u2019s phylactery being shattered and the lich itself collapsing into dust.However, Vladmir somehow wasn\u2019t destroyed. Although he didn\u2019t know the full details of how it survived, the current owner of Vladmir was Count Edmond Codreth of Helmuth. Along with the Black Tower Master Balzac, Edmond Codreth was one of the three black wizards to have signed a contract with the Demon King of Incarceration.\u201cCan I try holding it?\u201d Eugene asked as he pointed at Akasha.At this question, Mer put on a mischievous smile and nodded, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s okay, but just so you know, it\u2019s impossible for you to cast any magic with that staff.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cAkasha will only recognize Lady Sienna as its master. After Lady Sienna went into seclusion, several wizards tried to become Akasha\u2019s new owner, but none of them were able to receive Akasha\u2019s approval.\u201d\u201cIf they couldn\u2019t use it, why just leave it here? They should have broken the staff and at least taken the Dragonheart.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t spout such nonsense. Akasha is a treasure gifted to Lady\u00a0Sienna\u00a0by the elves and the dragons. Although it\u2019s not possible to be used, just on its own, it holds a tremendous value.\u201dAs Mer pointed this out with a tsk of her tongue, Eugene gave a faint smile. He felt some nostalgia from her answer. A long time ago, he had also heard the same sort of thing from Sienna.\u201cYou should already know this as well, right, Sir Eugene? A Dragonheart is literally a dragon\u2019s heart. Because the heart of one of their deceased comrades was sacrificed to make a staff for Lady Sienna\u2026 if someone were to break Akasha for it, while I\u2019m not sure about the elves, the dragons will definitely make an appearance and strafe Aroth with their breath attacks.\u201dHe had also heard something along those lines from Sienna. When he had joked about breaking the staff and dividing the Dragonheart\u2019s mana between them, Sienna had thrown a beer bottle at him with a loud shout.\u2014You ignorant bastard. You want to break what? Do you really want to doom us all?Of course, Mer didn\u2019t swear at him harshly like Sienna had. Even so, hearing her say the words that Sienna had said, with a face that resembled Sienna, caused Eugene to recall the memories of Sienna from his past life.\u2018...This is\u2026.\u2019\u00a0After standing there stunned for a few seconds, Eugene came to his senses with a thought,\u00a0\u2018Not good.\u2019He was becoming too obsessed with the memories of his past life. Eugene shook his head vigorously and turned away from Mer. He hadn\u2019t come to Akron just to immerse himself in his recollections.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s just try and hold it,\u201d\u00a0saying this, Eugene\u00a0reached out his hand.The staff was as tall as Sienna was. Although he was holding it directly, nothing seemed to have happened. After shooting a glance at Mer, Eugene attempted to infuse some mana into Akasha.But once again, nothing happened. Akasha wouldn\u2019t accept the mana that he had offered it. Since he\u2019d seen the illusion of Sienna, Eugene had held a slight hope that he might be able to obtain Akasha\u2019s approval. But it seemed that Sienna had left no such\u00a0arrangements for him.\u2018If you were going to leave something behind for me, I\u2019d rather you\u2019d have left Akasha instead of my necklace.\u2019He still wasn\u2019t sure who had left behind the necklace in the Lionheart\u2019s main estate. However, Eugene was almost certain that Sienna had been the one responsible for dropping it there.\u201c...Do you know what this is?\u201d Eugene asked; having had a sudden thought, he pulled out the necklace and showed it to Mer.Mer examined it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a worn-out necklace.\u201d\u201cSo you don\u2019t recall having seen it before?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that I could have. Didn\u2019t I already tell you that I haven\u2019t stepped foot outside of Akron in all these hundreds of years?\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t recognize it.\u201dWithout asking any further questions, Eugene tucked the necklace back inside his collar. Then he left Akasha behind and started looking around Sienna\u2019s Hall earnestly.There were quite a few things that he recalled having seen before.There were the robes and hat that Sienna had always liked to wear. They, too, were artifacts of extraordinary magical value. The first floor of the hall was full of such things. With Witch Craft at the center, its surroundings were filled with all the magic tools that Sienna had personally used.\u201cYou can\u2019t take any of it outside with you,\u201d Mer warned.Eugene waved her off, \u201cI won\u2019t try and take them with me.\u201dPerhaps due to preservation magic having been applied to them, they were still in mint condition even though hundreds of years had passed. That isn\u2019t to say that they were in perfect condition, though. The robes were frayed in many places. As Eugene tried not to feel bothered by that, he headed upstairs.\u201cThese books are the notes written during the process of constructing Akron,\u201d Mer continued to act as a tour guide.The thirteenth floor was packed full of bookcases. Although there had been a lot of books back in the mansion, the books on display there could not compare to the ones displayed here in terms of their value. The magic books of truly outstanding value were definitely not stored in the mansion but here, in Akron.\u201cAnd that\u2019s a draft of the Circle magic formula, written when Sienna was in the process of developing it. If you were to read it as you are now, Sir Eugene, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it. Even if it is a draft, the techniques and research used to develop it are extremely advanced.\u201d As Mer followed behind Eugene, she continued to mutter, \u201cThat goes for her other research journals stored in Akron as well. Among all the wizards who\u2019ve found their way here, none of them were able to understand Lady Sienna\u2019s research at first.\u201dAllowing these words to flow in one ear and out the other, Eugene pulled out one of the research journals from a bookshelf. Although the books in the mansion were on display, you weren\u2019t allowed to flip them open and read them. However, here, you were allowed to read as many research journals as you wanted.\u201c...Ha,\u201d a laugh slipped out before Eugene had even flipped through more than a few pages.\u201cSee, you have no idea what any of those words mean, right?\u201d Mer rubbed it in.\u201cI guess so,\u201d Eugene admitted with a grin as he turned away from the bookcase. He thought to himself,\u00a0\u2018Her handwriting is still as bad as ever.\u2019Sienna\u2019s horrible penmanship was forever preserved inside these books. It was already difficult to understand what she was talking about when she went on about mana this and Circles that, but Sienna\u2019s\u00a0scribbled chicken scratches\u00a0required decryption in and of themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When it felt like his head was about to start spinning, he closed the book and looked around. It felt like there were about a hundred volumes of books stored here.After glancing over all of them, Eugene opened his mouth and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t there any of Sienna\u2019s personal notes? Ones that don\u2019t talk about magic.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any,\u201d Mer stated. \u201cRight before going into seclusion, Lady Sienna erased all the personal notes that she had left in her mansion.\u201d\u201cLooks like she was really thorough in covering her tracks.\u201d\u201cThat just shows how much she didn\u2019t want anyone to know where she was going for her seclusion.\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s your opinion on that?\u201d Eugene asked as he returned the research journal to the bookshelf he had pulled it out of. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about where Lady Sienna might have gone into seclusion. Some say that she went to Helmuth, others say that she went to the Samar Forest\u2026 and a few even say that she was assassinated by the black wizards.\u201d\u201cI believe that she went to Samar Forest,\u201d Mer replied with a shrug. \u201cAlthough many people think she might have gone to Helmuth, from what I recall, Lady Sienna wasn\u2019t the type who would dare to do something so reckless and impossible. Of course\u2026 right up until Lady Sienna went into seclusion, she was the most beautiful and strongest person I know. However, to challenge Helmuth\u2019s Demon Kings all by herself, Lady Sienna wasn\u2019t someone who would do something like that.\u201d\u201cI also agree with that,\u201d Eugene nodded along.\u201cFor the black wizards to have assassinated Sienna is also unthinkable. Although at the moment, powerful black wizards like Balzac Ludbeth can be found in Aroth, two hundred years ago, the black wizards who lived in Aroth\u00a0were\u00a0all insignificant and weak,\u201d Mer sneered dismissively.\u201cBut black wizards from Helmuth could have snuck in to assassinate Lady Sienna,\u201d Eugen said, playing the devil\u2019s advocate.\u201cHa! That\u2019s even more unthinkable. Sir Eugene, just think about it. Lady Sienna\u2019s magical barrier was even able to block the black magic cast by the Demon King of Fury,\u201d Mer shouted in agitation.\u2018Although it wasn\u2019t able to block Belial\u2019s black magic,\u2019\u00a0Eugene silently noted.In terms of their magic levels alone, Belial the lich\u2019s level was actually greater than that of the Demon King of Fury. Though that didn\u2019t mean that Belial was stronger than the Demon King of Fury.Mer continued her tirade, \u201cIf, just if, the black wizards of Helmuth had really snuck in to assassinate Lady Sienna, there is no way they could have taken down Lady Sienna so quietly. There would have to have been enough surges of mana to shake the entire capital city\u00a0of Pentagon\u00a0to its foundations. However, no such disaster happened when Lady Sienna went into seclusion! That means that Lady Sienna must have gone into seclusion of her own will and could not have been murdered by anyone.\u201dWithout calming down in the slightest, Mer continued to glare at Eugene. Mer refused to accept even the slightest possibility that her creator, whom she loved and respected, could be murdered by someone like a black wizard.\u201cLady Sienna must definitely still be in Samar Forest,\u201d Mer insisted. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know where exactly the elven holy glade is within that vast forest, Lady Sienna is definitely\u2026 definitely\u2026.\u201dUnable to finish her words, Mer drifted off into mumbles. Two hundred years was a really long time. If you were an ordinary human, you would definitely pass away during that time. Even Vermouth couldn\u2019t break free of the natural limits of his lifespan.\u201c...She has to just be\u00a0comfortably\u2026 resting her eyes somewhere. Although\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s still alive,\u201d Mer reluctantly admitted.\u201cI believe that she\u2019s alive,\u201d Eugene suddenly declared.Mer\u2019s slumped shoulders were bothering him. Although he wanted to pat her on the back, remembering Mer\u2019s stern warning from earlier, Eugene kept himself from reaching out unwantedly.Unsure how to continue, Eugene hesitated, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the Brave Sir Molon was also still vigorously living it up just one hundred years ago. So Lady Sienna should still be alive. She\u2019s probably just\u00a0stopped her aging\u00a0with magic or something like that.\u201d\u201c....It looks like Sir Eugene really does like Lady Sienna a whole lot?\u201d accused Mer.\u201cYou can\u2019t really call it liking her.\u201d\u201cLiar. You don\u2019t know what kind of expression you were making, do you, Sir Eugene?\u201dMer lifted up her drooping shoulders and looked up at Eugene.\u201cEvery time I tell a story about Lady Sienna, your eyes twinkle brightly, and whenever you see something that belonged to Lady Sienna, you become extremely immersed in its history,\u201d Mer listed the evidence.\u201cI\u2019ve always had a liking for old stories,\u201d Eugene protested.\u201cIs that so? Then you should like that book as well.\u201dWith a grin, Mer headed to a corner of a bookshelf. She took out a book, whose cover had been faded by the traces of time.She read its title, \u201cThe Great Adventures of the Hero Vermouth.\u201dEugene\u2019s cheeks had started twitching from the moment he saw it.\u201cIt\u2019s a famous fairy tale, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mer proudly held it up. \u201cSince Lady Sienna and her other companions were always reluctant to talk about what happened in Helmuth, this fairy tale is actually the first book to tell the world about the legends of the Great Vermouth.\u201d\u201c...It\u2019s a damned book, is what it is,\u201d Eugene grumbled.\u201cHuh? Why would you call it a damned book?\u201d Mer asked, looking puzzled.\u201cI mean, the truth is that I actually like Sir Hamel the most, and I respect and admire him,\u201d Eugene struggled to hide his embarrassment. \u201cBut in that fairy tale, Sir Hamel is really, really made out to look like such an idiot.\u201d\u201cBut Lady Sienna also called Hamel stupid, a son of a bitch, a fool, and a motherfucker?\u201d\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t really like that. Sir Hamel wasn\u2019t stupid, a son of a bitch, a fool, or a motherfucker either. Instead, he was pretty nice and brave, and uh\u2026 um\u2026. In any case, he was a great person.\u201dWhy did he have to be the one to say such things? As Eugene felt a deep sense of shame, he sighed heavily.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sir Eugene must have quite the weird personality. Usually, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who likes Hamel after reading this fairy tale, right?\u201d Mer expressed her concerns.\u201cSorry, but apart from me, our Patriarch also said that he happens to like Hamel the best,\u201d Eugene defended himself.Mer argued, \u201cThat just means that your Patriarch is also a bit of a strange person.\u201d\u201cAre you really cursing my adoptive father right now?\u201d Eugene became aggressive in the face of his losing argument.\u201cI\u2019m just saying he\u2019s a bit strange, so how is that cursing him? In any case, Sir Eugene, if you really do like old stories, then you should have read this book as well.\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a lie to say that I read that book more than a hundred times while I was still young.\u201d\u201cThat might be the case, but this book is the first edition. It\u2019s different from the revised version that is spread throughout the world right now. You might not be aware of this, Sir Eugene, but this fairy tale was actually first published in Aroth three hundred years ago.\u201d\u201cThen who\u2019s the bastard responsible for publishing it?\u201d\u201cHow would I know? After all, the author of this book is anonymous\u2026 He was probably a bard from long ago, no?\u201dHow could the author have been a bard? Eugene snorted and shook his head. While he was wandering around the continent in his previous life, he had met quite a few bards, but he had never once encountered a bard in Helmuth.\u201cOr else, well, he might just be a novelist who gathered and connected all the rumors surrounding Helmuth. Although I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t leave his name on it.\u201d As Mer waved the fairy tale book around, she continued speaking, \u201cLady Sienna also liked this fairy tale. Even though she wasn\u2019t someone who often smiled, sometimes at night, when she couldn\u2019t sleep\u2026\u00a0she\u00a0used to smile briefly while reading this book alone in her bedroom. I know because she read it to me as well.\u201d\u201c...Did you say that the contents of the first edition are a bit different from the modern versions?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cUmmm\u2026. It\u2019s also been a while since I last read the latest revised version, so I can\u2019t be sure that it\u2019s exactly the same as the one you read\u2026. But as the first to come out, the first edition is\u2026 a little more\u2026 how should I put it\u2026 it\u2019s a little crude.\u201d\u201c...Crude?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cursing. The anecdotes about Vermouth and his comrades are also slightly different\u2026. Should I say that they're a bit more pessimistic?\u201d\u201cLet me have a look.\u201dEugene quickly walked over and took hold of the fairy tale book. It might be because the book was from three hundred years ago, but the pages seemed really worn out. That was probably a sign of how many times it was read over and over again.[Hamel was an asshole. Although that asshole fought so excitedly with Vermouth upon their first meeting, he couldn\u2019t even touch Vermouth\u2019s collar, and his face was thrown into the ground so hard that he cried.]\u201cThis son of a bitch,\u201d Eugene\u2019s face contorted as he cursed.Mer had said that it was crude and full of curses, and it really was. The version of the fairy tale that Eugene had read said that Hamel was an idiot, but at least it didn\u2019t call him an asshole like this one.\u2018Could the bastard who wrote this have been Anise?\u2019\u00a0he wondered.Recalling Anise, whose eyes were always stuck in a cheerful smile, Eugene ground his teeth angrily. Although he considered comparing the handwriting to Anise\u2019s, the fairy tale book seemed to have been made by magic or using a printing press, so the writing was neat and mechanical.\u2018It\u2019s true that I was thrown into the ground face first, but I did at least manage to brush his collar. Vermouth even said that he shed a drop of blood because of me. And crying because my face was smashed? Where does this person get off with spouting such bullshit?\u2019As he tried to cool the boiling rage inside, Eugene placed the fairy tale back onto the bookshelf.After he had gotten a hold of himself, Eugene asked, \u201c...What\u2019s on the fourteenth floor?\u201d\u201cThe thirteenth floor is for research journals, so the fourteenth floor has the magic books that organize and connect all this research together. Although those will still be difficult for Sir Eugene to read, they\u2019ll still be easier to handle than these research journals. Because the explanations are a lot clearer,\u201d Mer eagerly recommended them.\u201cBut aren\u2019t they still a lot worse than Witch Craft?\u201d Eugene questioned why he should even bother with them.\u201cHeheh\u2026,\u201d Mer snickered, her cheeks twitching as she tried to avoid sneering. \u201cOf course, they\u2019re a lot worse. But this\u2026 rather than trying to explain with words, it\u2019ll be better if you try to read Witch Craft yourself. Well, to put it simply, let me explain the difference between the two. Witch Craft is harder to understand than it is to read, but as for the magic books on the fourteenth floor\u2026 if you can read them, you can at least understand them slightly. Although it might be unreasonable to expect that much from you, Sir Eugene.\u201dTurning around, Mer headed towards the elevator.\u201cFor now, why don\u2019t we go up to the fourteenth floor,\u201d Mer suggested. \u201cYou would probably prefer that floor to this one.\u201d\u201cWhy so?\u201d Eugene asked cautiously.\u201cBecause you said that you like old stories, right? And that you like Stupid Hamel as well.\u201dAlthough Eugene couldn\u2019t comprehend these words, when they arrived on the fourteenth floor, he immediately understood what Mer had meant by that.\u201cTake a look,\u201d Mer giggled as she waved her hand forward. \u201cThose are the personal memories that Lady Sienna extracted for her own recollections. Those aren\u2019t just simply portraits, but are the real versions of Lady Sienna\u2019s comrades as she remembered them.\u201dWithin the walls of the fourteenth floor, the figures of four people were clearly reflected.\u201cOver there, the handsome man standing in the center is the Great Vermouth,\u201d Mer eagerly pointed him out.Vermouth looked exactly as he did in Eugene\u2019s memories.\u201cBeside him, the blonde woman whose eyes are smiling so much that it\u2019s impossible to see her pupils \u2014 that\u2019s Faithful Anise.\u201dThe saintess, who carried around bottles of wine while calling them holy water.\u201cThe macho\u00a0causing you confusion about whether he\u2019s a troll or a human is the Brave Molon.\u201dEven though his body was already so big, he was always carrying around an ax that was even bigger than his own body, and he was a fool who kept causing problems in every fight.\u201cAnd over there, the man who looks like he has a bad personality, with a frown on his face, is Stupid Hamel. This is the one and only sole record of Hamel\u2019s appearance. You can only find his face here, in Lady Sienna\u2019s Hall.\u201dAt that moment, Eugene couldn\u2019t find any words.Hamel, who had died in Helmuth, hadn\u2019t left behind even a single portrait for the world to see.\u201c....Puhahaha,\u201d as he continued to look at this appearance from his previous life, Eugene eventually burst into laughter. \u201cIf you were going to leave something like this behind, wouldn\u2019t it have been better with a smile on his face?\u201dAs Eugene chuckled, he shook his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Vermouth, as he was pictured on the wall, didn\u2019t appear to have the Moonlight Sword on him.\u2018I also look like I have fewer scars.\u2019In his previous life, Hamel had ended up with a lot of scars. The many scars on his body had been covered up by his clothes and armor, and even his face had borne a lot of minor scarring. Around half of them had been obtained while he was working as a mercenary, and the remaining half were obtained in Helmuth.The \u2018Hamel\u2019 in front of him had almost no scars on his exposed skin. Although he had a nasty expression, his eyes weren\u2019t all that offensive. From how neat and tidy his appearance was, this image had to be from before they had gone through all sorts of hardships in Helmuth.\u201c...How handsome,\u201d Eugene eventually murmured.\u201cRight?\u201d Mer agreed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve also seen this image a countless times, I still can\u2019t get over how handsome Sir Vermouth was\u2014\u201dEugene interrupted her praises, \u201cI was saying that Hamel was so handsome, not my ancestor.\u201dMer\u2019s eyelashes fluttered. Her jaw dropped open as she alternated between looking at Hamel and Vermouth.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Mer demanded.\u201cWell, my ancestor, um, I admit that he\u2019s handsome, but Hamel also\u2026 uh\u2026 he has his charms. With his\u2026 um\u2026 untamable countenance? And that\u2026 um\u2026 that bestial charm\u2026,\u201d\u00a0Eugene's lips\u00a0eventually fell shut as he felt an unbearable sense of shame.\u00a0\u2018What the hell am I even saying?\u2019Although the shame he was feeling was already intense, Mer\u2019s gaze, which looked as if she was seeing something confusing and pathetic, made him feel even more embarrassed.\u201c...That\u2019s just how I feel,\u201d Eugene finished lamely.\u201cYou have quite the unique taste,\u201d Mer observed politely.\u201cThat\u2019s just how people are.\u201d\u201cUntamable countenance? Bestial charm? If that\u2019s where your tastes lean,\u00a0how about admiring Molon instead of Hamel?\u00a0Just from looking at him, you get the feeling that he\u2019s a bear, not a human.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit too much? Instead of a bear, at least say that he looks like a monster.\u201d\u201cWell, that also works.\u201dMer couldn\u2019t deny those words. After glancing at Molon\u2019s bulging muscles with a disgusted eye, she eventually turned her gaze back to Eugene.\u201c....Apart from the portrait, don\u2019t you have any other recordings of Lady Sienna\u2019s appearance? Something like these,\u201d Eugene asked curiously.Mer returned his question with one of her own, \u201cSir Eugene, aren\u2019t you able to recall your own appearance without having to use a mirror?\u201dEugene argued, \u201cBut if she was going to leave something like this, she should have at least left her own figure since all she needed to do was stand in front of a full-length mirror.\u201d\u201cLady Sienna probably just didn\u2019t have any desire to do so,\u201d as she said this, Mer giggled. \u201cAfter all, she so disliked attention that she was even reluctant to leave behind the portraits. Now then, what exactly are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m not too aware of the situation, the fact that you have been allowed in here despite only being seventeen and lacking a high grasp of magic means that\u2026 those arrogant wizards must have seen some amazing potential in you, Sir Eugene.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s something like that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to act so humbly. Even without you doing that, Sir Eugene, reading just one of the books of magic stored here will make you realize how humble your talent truly is,\u201d as she said this, Mer looked at Eugene with a proud expression on her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t just have Lady Sienna\u2019s hall here. Including Lady Sienna, nine other wizards have had their names added to Akron\u2019s list of halls.\u201dThis was the Royal Library, Akron. Here, there were other floors dedicated to nine other Archwizards like Sienna.The topmost, fifteenth floor, was the Hall of the Magic King who had founded Aroth. Below Sienna\u2019s Hall, on the eleventh floor, was the Hall of the Battle Mage, who had been called the father of battle magic; on the tenth floor was the Hall of the Great Spirit Summoner, the first human to have made a contract with a Spirit King.\u201cThe second, third, and fourth floors are used to store a range of magic texts,\u201d Mer continued. \u201cAll of them are rare and valuable books of magic that were carefully selected by previous Tower Masters. Of course, although you were allowed to enter Akron because you possess the qualities to be called a genius, the magic stored in Akron was all created by fully-fledged geniuses.\u201d\u201cGot it,\u201d Eugene nodded his understanding with a calm expression.He knew what Mer was trying to tell him. From an objective point of view, Eugene\u2019s knowledge of magic was still too shallow. Although he had somehow managed to get into Akron, it was impossible for him to self-study the magic texts stored here as he had done with the introductory books on magic back at the Red Tower of Magic.\u201cAren\u2019t you able to cast magic?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cI can\u2019t be the one to teach you,\u201d Mer rejected his unspoken question, shaking her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to do so, and the system programmed into me also strictly prohibits me from transmitting magic. For hundreds of years, many wizards have attempted to try and extract Witch Craft from me, but none have been able to change my settings.\u201dAfter she had finished, Mer fell silent for a few moments. She had a complicated expression on her face as she crossed her arms in front of her.\u201cThe only type of spells I\u2019m permitted to use\u2026 are ones for removing any dust in this hall or picking up small pieces of trash,\u201d Mer explained. \u201cDo you still want to see my magic?\u201d\u201cMhm,\u201d Eugene wordlessly responded.\u201cIf so, please try to break into Akron without an entry pass. If you really do so, then I will make sure to appear faster than any of the familiars from the other floors to execute you, Sir Eugene.\u201d\u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d\u201cIf you dislike that method, you could try to attack either Witch Craft or myself. If you have a preferred method of death, Sir Eugene, I will do my best to fulfill your desire.\u201dIt didn\u2019t sound like a simple joke when she said it like that. In any case, it looked like it would be impossible to be personally taught magic by Mer. After taking a few moments to think, Eugene headed for the elevator.As he walked, he asked Mer, \u201cEven if you can\u2019t teach me, can you give me any advice about magic?\u201d\u201cThat is also restricted,\u201d Mer admitted. \u201cIf it were so easy for me to gently guide you into learning magic, wouldn\u2019t all the Archwizards of Aroth have already mastered Witch Craft?\u201dWitch Craft was just as infamous as it was renowned. Even though you couldn\u2019t even touch it without being first qualified to enter Akron, among all the Archwizards who had entered this library, not a single one had yet to fully master the magic of Witch Craft.Mer hesitated, \u201cIf you do need some advice\u2026 um\u2026. Sir Eugene, how many Circles have you reached?\u201d\u201cIf I had to say it, I might be at the Third Circle,\u201d Eugene awkwardly admitted.Mer cringed, \u201cUgh. Really?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been a bit over two months since I started learning magic,\u201d Eugene defended himself.\u201cHm. Considering how long it\u2019s been since you started, I guess you can be called somewhat of a genius. But even with that, you\u2019re still far from qualified to enter Akron.\u201dUntil just now, Mer had been smiling as she joked about this and that, but when it came to magic, her attitude became cold and scornful. Even this sort of look somehow reminded Eugene of Sienna, causing him to smirk in amusement.\u201cWhat did you mean by, \u2018If I had to say it, I might be at the Third Circle\u2019?\u201d Mer demanded.\u201cI haven\u2019t actually created any Circles,\u201d Eugene confessed.\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\u201cNo, really. Without any Circles, I\u2019ve been using my Cores as Circles when casting magic.\u201d\u201c...Is that the Lionheart Clan\u2019s unique magic formula?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be. I don\u2019t know how Vermo\u2014I mean, my ancestor used to cast magic, but the Lionheart\u2019s direct line doesn\u2019t have any record of such a magic formula. Although, I can\u2019t be sure about any of the collateral branches.\u201dThere were countless collateral branches of the Lionheart Clan. Although they didn\u2019t seem to interact much with the main family, there were also families among the collateral lines who specialized in magic.\u201cHm\u2026,\u201d Mer hummed contemplatively. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, is the magic formula that you\u2019re currently using something that you came up with on your own, Sir Eugene? Or did you get advice from some other wizards?\u201d\u201cI made it all by myself,\u201d Eugene declared.Mer was lost in thought, \u201cHm, hmmm\u2026.\u201dThe elevator doors opened, and they entered. While they were descending to the twelfth floor, Mer was caught up in her own musings as she stroked her chin. Perhaps because the speed of their descent was so fast, her thoughts also seemed to quickly reach a conclusion.Mer appeared to be relieved as she said, \u201cWell then, it seems that your qualifications aren\u2019t as terrifyingly inadequate as I had feared. I was worried that your entry into Arkon was bought mostly by the prestige of your family name.\u201d\u201cI think it may have played at least a small factor,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cI really appreciate such an honest attitude. Although it would be faster to just see your magic than hear it from you, for now\u2026 what type of magic are you interested in, Sir Eugene?\u201d\u201cAre you asking so that you can give me some advice?\u201d\u201cI might not be able to teach you any magic personally, but I can at least point you in the right direction.\u201d\u201cI want magic that will be useful in a fight. Spirit magic would be okay as well.\u201d\u201cWhat a barbaric request.\u201dMer clicked her tongue a few times in disapproval as she followed behind Eugene.Still, she continued to generously give her advice, \u201cThe tenth floor is the Great Spirit Summoner\u2019s Hall. That Hall is dedicated to the human who was the first to make a contract with the Water Spirit King.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s not like you can be sure to make a contract with the Water Spirit King just because you\u2019ve learned the magic stored in that hall,\u201d Eugene quibbled.\u201cWell, that may be the case. After all, the innate compatibility of the summoner is also important when making a contract with a spirit. As for the magic stored on the tenth floor\u2026 most of the spells there are meant to be applied together with the power of water spirits.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, they won\u2019t be of much use to me. I prefer wind spirits over water spirits.\u201d\u201cBut something like compatibility isn\u2019t up to you to decide, Sir Eugene\u2026. Well, for now, I get your point. If you want magic that\u2019s useful in a fight, then the eleventh floor is definitely perfect for you. Because that hall is dedicated to the Archwizard, who was called the Father of Battle Magic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you intend to solely use magic when you fight? Even though the Lionheart\u2019s main family is a famous martial family?\u201d Mer asked doubtfully.\u201cI\u2019ll use them both\u2014magic and a weapon,\u201d Eugene clarified.\u201cHow arrogant of you,\u201d Mer giggled.Even considering the potential Eugene had shown at such a young age, it still felt absurd that he was planning to use both magic and martial arts together when he fought.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, rather than the tenth floor, the floor below that will be of more use to you,\u201d Mer said, changing her recommendation. \u201cThe magic texts on the tenth floor mainly deal with the proper application of battle magic and how to adapt the magic according to the situation. In other words, their difficulty level is extremely high. Although that\u2019s actually the case for all the magic in this place.\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s on the floor below?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cIt has some powerful, and yet simple, magic. The spells of the Fire Wizard and Ice Wizard, who were eternal rivals during their lifetimes. While the ice magic pairs well with water spirits\u2026 since you said that you\u00a0prefer\u00a0spirits of the wind, it would be better for you to learn the fire magic instead.\u201d Although Mer was sarcastic, her advice was clear and helpful. \"Sir Eugene, once you\u2019ve become quite proficient in fire magic, you can also go to the seventh floor. Although the difficulty of the spells stored there is quite high, once you\u2019ve mastered them, there is magic powerful enough to wipe out an army or even a nation in a single spell. Have you heard of the \u2018Meteora\u2019 spell, Sir Eugene?\u201d\u201cOf course, I have,\u201d Eugene answered cautiously. \u201cThat\u2019s the spell that rains meteor showers from the sky.\u201d\u201cWas it around five hundred years ago? It was during an era of constant conflict between nations. The Eighth Hall is dedicated to the wizard known as \u2018Disaster,\u2019 who destroyed several armies with his signature spell Meteora during that time. Akron is the only place on the continent that has a complete copy of the Meteora technique.\u201dAlthough Eugene didn\u2019t know if he would learn Meteora, he couldn\u2019t deny being interested in it.Moving on, Mer revealed, \u201cThere\u2019s spatial magic on the sixth floor. Sir Eugene, if you wish to fight with your martial arts skills instead of magic, I would also recommend learning spatial magic. As long as you can completely master Blink, you will have an absolute advantage in any magical duel.\u201dBlink was a short-range teleportation spell. Although the distance that could be teleported differed on the level of the wizard casting it, Sienna used to be able to jump dozens of meters with a single Blink.As he continued to listen to Mer\u2019s advice. Eugene slowly started to get an idea of what he could do with Blink. While teleporting here and there with Blink, he could either swing his weapon or cast a spell. As long as he was able to adapt to the style properly, he would be able to surpass his strength in his previous life.\u2018Since I wasn\u2019t able to cast even a single spark in my previous life, let alone Blink.\u2019To be able to do something that he couldn\u2019t do in his previous life\u2014Eugene felt a fluttering sort of pleasure from that.Breaking out of his daydreams, Eugene asked, \u201c...And what about Witch Craft?\u201dMer began a long-prepared lecture, \u201cWitch Craft contains an optimized mana application formula designed for Circles. Through this, it can amplify the magical power created by a Circle. It can also simplify any technique, increasing efficiency and removing the need for incantations. It can even allow multiple activations of the same spell through a single casting. Also, it can be used to imprint spells into your subconscious mind and store them there, allowing you to cast the spell immediately according to the situation, and you can even set a trigger so that the spell casts itself in response to external stimulation.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene was struck silent by this extensive list.\u201cAmong all these benefits, the most impressive is that its Circle provides the ideal application of force. Although most wizards nowadays already use Circles, Witch Craft\u2019s Circle magic formula is far superior to ordinary Circles. To put it simply, it allows you to exert maximum power with the minimum amount of mana.\u201d\u201cSorry, but while I hear what you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case. If you could understand it just by hearing it, there wouldn\u2019t be any reason for Witch Craft to be called the greatest grimoire in the history of magic, would there?\u201dWith a broad grin, Mer puffed out her chest.\u201cOkay then,\u201d Eugene shrugged off the boasting, \u201cAnd just how am I supposed to read it?\u201d\u201cClose your eyes and reach out your hand,\u201d instructed Mer. \u201cAfter that, transmit your mana into Witch Craft, Sir Eugene\u2026 if you do that, you\u2019ll be able to read it.\u201dHe just needed to reach out his hand? For a few moments, Eugene stared at the sphere of light that was covered by dozens of rings. Since he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it if he just kept looking at it like this, Eugene stretched out his hand as Mer had instructed. Although his hand was drawing closer to the light-emitting sphere, he couldn\u2019t feel anything like heat from it.However, he did feel a tremendous amount of mana. Ignoring his uneasy goosebumps, Eugene drew out his mana using the White Flame Formula. Would it be alright if he just poured his mana in as it was? Or should he apply it through the pseudo-circle that he used whenever he cast a spell? As he hid these worries, for now, he just poured in his mana.Suddenly, he lost all sensation in his body. He couldn\u2019t hear anything, and he couldn\u2019t smell anything. Although his eyes shot open in alarm, he couldn\u2019t see anything either. He couldn\u2019t see Mer, who had been right next to him, nor could he feel her presence.\u201cAh,\u201d he tried to voice this sound, but the noise failed to reach Eugene\u2019s ear.He couldn\u2019t even hear the sounds of his own body. It was only then that Eugene was somewhat able to grasp the situation he was in.This was a world formed within his own mind. Eugene\u2019s body didn\u2019t exist within this space. Once he had connected to Witch Craft, only his consciousness was dragged into the depths of this place.\u2018It\u2019s similar to a dream\u2026 but also different.\u2019Things weren\u2019t changing according to his will, like in a lucid dream. And he wasn\u2019t seeing any unpleasant hallucinations like in the bullshit pulled by Night Demons. Instead, he just felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. Since his body did not exist, he couldn\u2019t move anything.Among all of his senses that had been blocked off, only one sense remained accessible.His sensitivity towards mana. This mental world was packed full to the brim with mana. Although this place was constructed in Eugene\u2019s own consciousness, Witch Craft\u2019s mana had flooded his head, creating an infinite sea of mana.In the middle of this sea, Eugene\u2019s sense of self wasn\u2019t even as large as a grain of sand. He couldn\u2019t even wander around and explore as he wished. So all he could do was contemplate the situation and wait.\u2018The mana\u2026 I can move it a little.\u2019A little?\u2018Oh, that\u2019s right. So this is all the mana that I have currently.\u2019Eugene realized that the mana he could move was the mana that belonged to his own consciousness. But within this sea of mana, Eugene\u2019s mana was just as small and insignificant as his sense of self. If he gathered in all his mana, would he be able to get out of here? That was probably the case, but Eugene didn\u2019t want to test that just now.After all, he hadn\u2019t seen anything yet.Eventually, the mana\u2014no, the sea began to move. A huge wave formed in front of Eugene, only to become a single ring.It was a Circle. The single Circle began rotating slowly, then at some point, it accelerated so fast that he couldn\u2019t even tell it was spinning. With each rotation of the Circle, the mana that flooded this world was drawn into the circle\u2019s rotation, copying it. Through this, the Circle multiplied one at a time.Of the levels of magical aptitude that was divided into Circles, the highest level was the Ninth Circle.However, the copied Circles did not stop at nine. The moment the Tenth Circle was created, the mana that had been drawn into the Circle\u2019s rotation stopped, leaving an immense line of Circles. These ten Circles separated, but after pulling apart, they joined together once more to form a single giant circle, and the center of this circle was filled with an infinite amount of mana.That alone would have been alarming enough, but the phenomenon wasn\u2019t done yet. Countless Circles began to be created within the larger Circle. One, two, three, four\u2026. At this point, Eugene gave up on counting. Having drawn out an infinite amount of mana, the greater Circle was creating an endless amount of Circles within it. These Circles kept multiplying, dividing, intertwining, multiplying once again, dividing, and\u2026.Although he was simply looking at it, just the sight of it alone was shaking Eugene\u2019s consciousness. It felt like an optical illusion that exhausted the mind and caused motion sickness, But no, it wasn\u2019t an optical illusion. Within that Circle, an infinite amount of Circles truly were repeatedly multiplying, dividing, and intertwining.\u2018Even if I can see it, I don\u2019t think I can understand it.\u2019All the magic that he had learned in his life until that point had felt like child\u2019s play.That was what Lovellian had said.A glimpse of the truth.That was how Melkith had described it.Both of them were correct. His consciousness wavered. The transformations taking place with those infinite circles and all the possibilities that they contained\u2014Eugene definitely couldn\u2019t fully comprehend all of them.However, he knew this much for sure.The Wise Sienna, she was the most astounding and powerful wizard in human history.\u2018Hold on\u2026.\u2019His consciousness began to collapse. Eugene sensed what was currently happening to him. An unstoppable shutter was about to close in his mind and cause him to fall unconscious.\u2018I don\u2019t want to faint, but\u2026. Hold on, no way!\u2019\u2014It might be better for you if you wear a diaper?\u2014Why?\u2014You might just wet your pants a little.Melkith\u2019s earlier words weren\u2019t just a joke. Just when did he last\u2026 go to the bathroom\u2026? Eugene desperately attempted to keep a hold of his consciousness, but in this world that was connected to Witch Craft, Eugene\u2019s consciousness was pitifully weak.Resistance was impossible.\u2018No way! Please, my excellent body, you can\u2019t let me down.\u2019Don\u2019t let me piss myself.With this earnest prayer, Eugene lost consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was worried that he might have wet himself, just like Melkith had warned.Fortunately, his underwear was soft and dry. However, Eugene couldn\u2019t feel reassured by this fact alone. Mer\u2019s gaze, who was standing nearby and looking in his direction, felt somewhat unusual.\u201cDid I do something shameful while I was out?\u201d Eugene asked as he desperately tried to remain calm.\u201cWell, it was a bit shameful for you to faint like that,\u201d teased Mer.Eugene bit out, \u201cApart from that.\u201d\u201cWere you worried that you might have peed your pants?\u201d Mer asked with a mischievous grin.As Eugene felt his heart sinking, he shook his head desperately and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have done something like that.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that the truth almost always hurts?\u201d Mer sighed.[1]\u201cPlease, don\u2019t feed me such bullshit. Because, as I said, there\u2019s no way I could have done something like that!\u201d Eugene\u2019s tone grew even more desperate.Mer finally let up on poor Eugene, \u201cStop worrying about it. At the very least, you didn\u2019t pee your pants, Sir Eugene. Although you did froth at the mouth a bit.\u201d\u201c...So just froth?\u201d\u201cYou also had a bit of a nosebleed. But anyway, haven\u2019t I already told you that you didn\u2019t wet yourself? Sir Eugene, if you had peed your pants, there\u2019s no way I would be standing this close to you\u2026.\u201d\u201c...From the way you say that, it seems that there are people who have wet their pants.\u201d\u201cOf course, there\u2019ve been quite a lot. The current White Tower Master, Melkith El-Hayah, also peed herself\u2026 and so did the Blue Tower Master Hiridus Euzeland.\u201dEugene recalled the Blue Tower Master with his uptight face. So that old wizard with an easily-offended personality had actually peed himself upon entering Witch Craft? He didn\u2019t really want to imagine such a sight\u2026.\u201cI see, so that means I really didn\u2019t wet myself. If that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s fine,\u201d Eugene said in a relieved tone as he got to his feet.How much time had passed? As he was looking around for a clock with this question in mind, Mer suddenly spoke up.\u201cSir Eugene was passed out for around two hours,\u201d Mer said, answering his unspoken question.\u201cThat means I was out for quite a while,\u201d Eugene murmured in surprise.\u201cSo, how was it?\u201d Mer asked, her eyes lighting up as she waited for his impressions.However, Eugene found it almost impossible to describe his reaction to all that he had just seen and felt.\u201c...Difficult,\u201d Eugene eventually chose to begin with this word. \u201cAnd arduous. I don\u2019t even know what I was looking\u2026. No, I think I can vaguely understand what I saw. However, I\u2019m finding it difficult to accept it as the truth, or as even just a theory.\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mer declared in approval.Mer truly appreciated Eugene\u2019s heartfelt impression. Archwizards, who held an overflowing pride in their skills and knowledge, rarely gave their honest impression after experiencing the contents of Witch Craft.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why Witch Craft and the one who made it, Lady Sienna, are so amazing,\u201d Mer proudly affirmed.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Eugene admitted, not denying such a fact.Or rather, he couldn\u2019t deny it.Even though he had wholeheartedly believed that Sienna was the greatest wizard, he had still been curious about what had made her so amazing that even the other wizards were forced to rate her so highly. Such thoughts couldn\u2019t be helped.Eugene \u2014 no, Hamel knew Sienna extremely well. Not as the Archwizard, The Wise Sienna, but as Sienna Merdein, the person who had once been his comrade. He was all too aware of how clumsy, rude, and foul-mouthed she could be, as well as how good she was at getting on other people\u2019s nerves due to her over-inflated ego.\u2018Though I guess she deserves to have such an ego.\u2019Eugene turned his head back to look at Witch Craft.To be honest, if he relied on self-study, it didn\u2019t feel like he would be able to understand Witch Craft even if he struggled for the rest of his life.\u201c...The movements of the Circles were truly mesmerizing,\u201d Eugene mumbled to himself.As she heard Eugene\u2019s mutters, Mer\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cHoh?\u201dLooking at Eugene deep in thought, Mer smiled.\u201cIndeed. He must have good eyes to see that Witch Craft can\u2019t be compared to all the magic he has learned up until now. And it seems that his comprehension is also pretty good,\u201d Mer quietly analyzed Eugene.\u201cThat Circle, just what the hell was that?\u201d Eugene asked as he rubbed away the dried blood left from his nosebleed.The most surprising and incomprehensible thing in Witch Craft \u2014 that Circle \u2014 was the very essence of the magic formula taught by Witch Craft.Eugene knew what a Circle was. It had been three hundred years since Sienna established the Circle Magic Formula. Over these past hundreds of years, Aroth\u2019s wizards had spent that time exploring the Circle\u2019s capabilities, improving its functions, and developing new versions. In this current era, it wasn\u2019t just in Aroth but most of the wizards in the world who had started practicing magic through the Circles.In other words, Circles had become popularized because they were easy to understand and learn. Even the introductory books on magic that Eugene had read were all able to describe Circles in a detailed way that was also easy to understand. Although he had read more than a dozen of such books back at the Red Tower of Magic, the description of the Circles given across these many magic texts were mostly similar.\u201cAnd what exactly was it that you saw?\u201d Mer asked with a mischievous smile.It seemed that she really wanted to hear more of Eugene\u2019s evaluation or, more precisely, his amazement at Sienna\u2019s accomplishments.\u2018So Sienna must have already been like that even when she was young,\u2019\u00a0Eugene realized.Mer had said that she had been created using Sienna\u2019s childhood personality as a basis. The Sienna, whom Eugene knew, had also enjoyed listening to other people\u2019s gobsmacked impressions as a way of fluffing her own ego.\u201c...That Circle\u2026 it just kept multiplying,\u201d Eugene said as he rubbed his aching head. \u201cBut the Circles I know\u2026 they only go up to the Ninth Circle.\u201dThe Ninth Circle.These days, there were no wizards who had managed to reach the Ninth Circle. Even the Tower Masters, who were seen as the forefront of magic, were limited to the Eighth Circle, and even Helmuth\u2019s black wizards, who had signed a personal contract with a Demon King, could not cross the wall into the Ninth Circle.The Ninth Circle was the final step of the Circles magic formula. Although Eugene had seen this line written down in the many books of magic that he had read, only the Wise Sienna had actually been able to reach the Ninth Circle after the Circles magic formula had been established.\u201cWitch Craft is the last grimoire that Lady Sienna ever made,\u201d Mer declared, placing her hands firmly on her hips as she looked at Eugene. \u201cWhen she had first created the Circles magic formula, Lady Sienna was already at the Ninth Circle. However, Lady Sienna continued to focus on researching and training her magic. And just like that\u2026 she surpassed the limits that she had set herself.\u201dEugene surmised, \u201cIf it\u2019s after the Ninth Circle, then that means that there\u2019s a Tenth Circle?\u201d\u201cAre you an idiot, Sir Eugene?\u201d Mer rudely asked.He was just making a guess based on simple arithmetic, but he was forced to hear someone call him an idiot. Eugene put on an offended expression, silently asking her to mind her words, but Mer\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change from the look of pity that she was giving him.\u201cSir Eugene should also have witnessed the contents of Witch Craft first hand. You shouldn\u2019t have fainted before the demonstration reached the ten Circles, right?\u201d Mer asked doubtfully.\u201cI saw what happened after that,\u201d Eugene admitted. \u201cFrom the moment that the ten Circles split apart\u2026 their mana started intertwining with each other, forming a single huge Circle. Then, inside that Circle, countless circles were multiplying, dividing, and intertwining\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat right there was the core truth of Witch Craft,\u201d then, as if she had been waiting for this, Mer raised her finger like a lecturer calling for attention. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Eternal Hole. The ultimate end goal of the Circles magic formula that only Lady Sienna has been able to reach. Since Witch Craft was released, numerous wizards have attempted to recreate the Eternal Hole, but none have managed to break through the wall into the Ninth Circle.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Eugene listened patiently.\u201cWithout wasting even a single point of your mana, you need to contain all your mana within a giant series of Circles, then split them apart and recombine them to form a new one.\u00a0This could be said to form the most efficient and amplifying model of a Circle. And it\u2019s not as complicated as a conventional Circle.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that it isn\u2019t complicated? Something like that?\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s difficult to create an Eternal Hole, it\u2019s actually very simple and easy to cast magic through it. Didn\u2019t I tell you this before?\u201dAn optimized mana application system for Circles that amplifies the magical power created by a Circle, simplifying any technique, increasing its efficiency, as well as removing the need for an incantation. Allowing multiple castings of the same spell through a single casting and imprinting spells into your subconscious mind to save them for later use.\u201cIf you can create an Eternal Hole, you can do all of these as naturally as breathing,\u201d Mer assured Eugene while also bringing up an example. \u201cA fireball cast through an Eternal Hole is stronger than a Hellfire spell cast at the Ninth Circle. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t require such vicious consumption of mana as a Hellfire, and its casting technique still isn\u2019t any more complicated than before.\u201d\u201cIf I can create an Eternal Hole, can I even cast Ninth Circle spells without incantations?\u201d Eugene asked curiously.\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case, but you won\u2019t have any need for that. Since you can reproduce the power of a Hellfire spell with only a fireball, why would you even need to use Hellfire? It would be easier to just keep throwing fireballs. Ah, of course, if you do need even more power than that, it might be better to cast Hellfire, but by the time that Lady Sienna had created the Eternal Hole\u2026 she never once felt the need to use Hellfire.\u201dBy then, she was no longer trying to conquer the Castles of the Demon Kings, nor was she fighting the Demon Kings and other high-ranking demonfolks. Following \u2018The Oath,\u2019 the world had been at peace, so Sienna was no longer living such an action-packed life as she had when they were wandering through Helmuth.\u201cYou should have figured it out by now, right?\u201d Mer asked as she waved her upheld finger left and right. \u201cFor Lady Sienna to be assassinated by black wizards, there\u2019s no way such a thing would happen. By creating the Eternal Hole, Lady Sienna could be said to have become invincible. Although she didn\u2019t confirm it personally, she could probably have slain a Demon King all on her own.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Eugene said, unable to deny those words.Sienna, with whom he had wandered around Helmuth together, was already an incredibly powerful wizard, but it seemed that she had become even stronger after the end of the war with the Demon Kings.Eugene\u2019s basic understanding couldn\u2019t fully comprehend the greatness of Witch Craft. However, he could tell that Sienna, who had made Witch Craft, was far stronger than her previous self that Eugene remembered from her days out in the field.\u2018Sienna wasn\u2019t just wasting her time frivolously.\u2019The others had probably done the\u00a0same, except for one.1. What Mer literally said is: There\u2019s a saying that the truth is mostly cruel. I\u2019ve changed it to a version more familiar to Western audiences.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was already peerlessly strong even when they were in Helmuth, but Eugene wasn\u2019t sure what had come over Vermouth to make him so obsessed with bearing children\u2026. Vermouth, from Eugene\u2019s memories, wasn\u2019t such an idle person.\u2014If you just tried a little harder\u2026. You could be a lot better than you are now.Those were the words he had heard from Vermouth so very long ago. Those words were the ones that had left the deepest scars on his heart during the entirety of his previous life. Vermouth, that son of a bitch, even though he was already a genius, had also put in quite a lot of hard work.However, compared to the amount of effort he had put in, the results he had achieved were just excessive.\u2018Anise and Molon should also have gotten a bit stronger.\u2019Although he wasn\u2019t able to confirm their achievements with his own eyes, as he had with Sienna, Eugene was confident of this fact. His comrades from his previous life were all just those sorts of people. They were all so talented that they could be called geniuses no matter what era they had been born in, and they all had clear goals and convictions.And they had all sworn together to wipe out the Demon Kings from this world.\u201cBut that\u2019s what makes me even more worried,\u201d Eugene muttered to himself in a low voice as he got to his feet.\u00a0\u2018Sienna Merdein. If you were that strong, then\u2026. Sienna, who I knew would definitely have found some way to challenge the Demon Kings once more.\u2019The Demon King of Incarceration and the Demon King of Destruction \u2014 these two Demon Kings were so powerful that the Demon Kings of lower ranks couldn\u2019t even be compared to them.But even if they were defeated because of that, the companions that Eugene was familiar with weren\u2019t the type to fall into despair. On the contrary, after increasing their strength and regaining their confidence, even if victory wasn\u2019t certain, they were definitely the type to once again risk their lives for their convictions before they died.So for those guys to have not gone to challenge the Demon Kings once more until the very end.And for Sienna and Anise to have gone into hiding at around the same time.\u2026And for them to have no interactions with the Lionheart clan before Vermouth\u2019s funeral.\u2018Vermouth,\u2019\u00a0Eugene let out a long sigh as he shook his head.\u00a0\u2018Just what on earth were you planning?\u2019* * *Although Akron, as the Royal Library, had a nominal Library Director, there was no closing time as most of the library's operation was left to the familiars.In other words, as long as you gave up on time spent eating and sleeping, you could stay in Akron for as long as you wanted.\u2018If that\u2019s the case, it would be good if they had a separate location like a break room,\u2019\u00a0Eugene wished.The library in the Red Tower of Magic was much more convenient in this regard. It had both the cafeteria and bedrooms prepared nearby. But unfortunately, there was no space for such things in Akron. He didn\u2019t know whether it was because they didn\u2019t want the smell of food spreading through the air or if they wanted to maintain a dignity worthy of its title as the Royal Library, but it was strictly forbidden to eat and drink inside Akron.Fortunately, there were separate research wings attached to the halls on each floor, where you could go to study and experiment with magic. If that was the case, shouldn\u2019t it be alright for him to eat and sleep there? Although Eugene asked Mer about this fact\u2014\u201cEven though I can\u2019t eat and it\u2019s impossible for me to drink anything, are you really going to do something like that in front of me?\u201d Mer protested. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way. If you\u2019re hungry, just go outside to eat.\u201d\u2014Mer had only offered such a petty denial.\u201cAre you really saying that such acts are forbidden because of a frivolous reason like that?\u201d Eugene asked in disbelief.\u201cOf course not. There are definitely reasons behind these restrictions. Since Sir Eugene isn\u2019t a pure wizard, he might not be aware of this, but ordinary wizards\u2026 no, even wizards who can be called Archwizards are basically magic addicts,\u201d Mer replied, shaking her head vigorously. \u201cIf we don\u2019t draw a clear line like this, the wizards who enter this place might become so engrossed in magic that they even risk shortening their lifespans to stay here longer. Isn\u2019t that why such stories are famous? Stories about wizards who became liches in order to keep researching magic after their deaths. And about wizards who died from overwork while immersed in research within their dungeons\u2026.\u201d\u201cI thought that such stories had an element of exaggeration mixed into them,\u201d Eugene said doubtfully.\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a precedent, we wouldn\u2019t have any reason to make such a rule, no?\u201d Mer lowered her voice. Intent on creating a gloomy atmosphere, she quietly whispered, \u201cAkron has a long history tracing back to around eight hundred years. A long, long time ago\u2026 a certain wizard managed to obtain Akron\u2019s entry pass, which he had longed for all his life. He truly loved magic and was fascinated by the truths found in the research of his great and respected seniors. And just like that\u2026 he indulged in magic while forgetting to eat, drink, and sleep, until eventually\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo what, does he come out at night as a ghost?\u201d Eugene asked, his tone skeptical.\u201cHe could appear,\u201d Mer insisted. \u201cThough I\u2019ve never actually seen him myself.\u201d\u201cWow, so scary.\u201dFaced with Eugene\u2019s dry reaction, Mer pouted her lips.\u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow,\u201d Eugene said as he turned to leave.Mer tilted her head in curiosity, \u201cWhy are you coming back here? The magic texts in this hall should be too difficult for you, Sir Eugene?\u201d\u201cIf they\u2019re hard, then I just need to keep learning,\u201d Eugene declared confidently.\u201cI\u2019m not going to teach you anything,\u201d Mer warned him.\u201cThat\u2019s fine because other than you, there is someone who can teach me.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s fine, but if you make too much noise, I\u2019m still kicking you out.\u201dMer said this with a tone of setting down an ultimatum. Eugene smirked and nodded in agreement.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to be quiet,\u201d he promised.Honestly speaking, Eugene was experiencing some internal conflict. He wanted to keep getting to know her and even become friends with Mer, who exceedingly resembled Sienna. However, he didn\u2019t think it would be right to transfer that kind of affection to her.It wouldn\u2019t be correct, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to Mer either.After all, Mer was a familiar. She wasn\u2019t Sienna herself. Mer\u2019s existence was also causing Eugene to become overly conscious of his past life. So Eugene didn\u2019t want to get any closer to Mer than was absolutely needed.However, things weren\u2019t going as he had planned. Just taking today as an example, there were several times when Eugene had seen glimpses of Sienna in Mer\u2019s behavior.\u2018But I can\u2019t just act like I don\u2019t know her either.\u2019If he really wanted to keep his distance, the best and simplest thing to do was not go to Sienna\u2019s Hall any longer. But Eugene didn\u2019t want to go that far. Because aside from the existence of Mer, he also wanted to indulge himself in Witch Craft and the other magical texts stored insideBefore going down to the first floor, taking Mer\u2019s advice, Eugene looked around the lower floors.Although there were also familiars on these floors, they didn\u2019t have a personality or an artificial intelligence guiding them, so they could only answer a few simple questions and maintain their assigned halls.There were no familiars as human-like as Mer.\u2018Though the difficulty is the same.\u2019Following the mechanical guidance of the familiars, Eugene had looked at the magic books on display. Even if it wasn\u2019t as much as Witch Craft, which was impossible for Eugene to understand currently, the difficulty of these books was the same as the other magic texts that he had seen in Sienna\u2019s Hall.When he arrived on Akron\u2019s first floor, a voice called out to Eugene, \u201cYou sure were late to come back down.\u201dIt was Melkith, who still hadn\u2019t returned to her own affairs and was just waiting there for him.\u201cSo, how was it?\u201d another voice asked.Lovellian was there as well. Up until just now, he\u2019d had a frown on his face, but from the moment he saw Eugene, he was walking over with a bright smile as he asked this question.\u201cTruthfully speaking, I\u2019m not really sure what I saw,\u201d Eugene replied as he shook his head. \u201cBased on the magic theory that I\u2019ve learned so far, I think it will take me several years just to properly understand a single one of those magic books.\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case. Because the magic books stored here are the distillation of Aroth\u2019s hundreds of years of magic,\u201d Melkith responded with a smirk. While glancing at Wynnyd, which was hanging from Eugene\u2019s waist, she continued speaking, \u201cKid, no matter how smart you might be, there\u2019s a limit to the amount of magic you can learn without a proper teacher.\u201dLovellian interjected from the side, \u201cWhite Tower Master.\u201d\u201cAh, like I said, you don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d Melkith assured him. \u201cI have no intention of taking that kid as my disciple. I just\u2026 I want to make a plain and simple deal with him.\u201d\u201cFor Wynnyd?\u201d Eugene asked although the answer was obvious.At this question, as if she had just been waiting for this, Melkith immediately nodded vigorously.\u201cAs long as you lend me Wynnyd for a bit, I\u2019ll explain ten volumes of magic texts to you in a way that\u2019s easy for you to understand. Doesn\u2019t that sound like a good deal?\u201d Melkith persuaded him.\u201cIt does sound good, but\u2026,\u201d Eugen turned his gaze away from Melkith and met Lovellian\u2019s eyes. \u201cSir Lovellian, may I ask if you have any intention of making me your disciple?\u201dAt these words, the two Tower Masters\u2019 faces underwent drastic changes. Lovellian\u2019s face lit up with a smile, while Melkith\u2019s face twisted into a grimace.\u201cIf that is what you desire, Eugene, there\u2019s no way I can turn you down, right?\u201d Lovellian welcomed him cheerfully.\u201cBut aren\u2019t you very busy?\u201d Melkith objected.Lovellian insisted, \u201cIf it\u2019s for Eugene, no matter how long it lasts, I can make the time for him.\u201dMelkith turned towards Eugene, \u201cAnd as for you, kiddo, no matter how desperate you are, you shouldn\u2019t bow your head so easily. Besides, aren\u2019t you a Lionheart? Is it really okay for you to enter a master-disciple relationship of your own volition?\u201d\u201cAny more objections?\u201d Eugene just sighed.\u201cThere\u2019s also me,\u201d Melkith quickly added. \u201cSince I\u2019m here, you don\u2019t need to enter a master-disciple relationship so carelessly. You might encounter some pointless annoyances later. What will you do if the Red Tower Master does something bad to you after you\u2019ve already taken him as your teacher?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such nonsense,\u201d Lovellian huffed.Eugene expressed his faith in the man, \u201cThe Head Wizard Lovellian that I know isn\u2019t that type of person.\u201dMelkith narrowed her eyes in frustration, \u201cYou annoying brat, you\u2019re only seventeen years old. Do you really think you know the Red Tower Master better than I do?\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep spouting such ridiculous nonsense?\u201d Lovellian asked with narrowed eyes.Unable to come up with another answer, Melkith chewed her lips for a moment before finally letting out a deep sigh.\u201cFine then. If you do become the Red Tower Master\u2019s disciple, you won\u2019t need me to explain those magic texts in exchange for lending me Wynnyd. Although admitting this really hurts my self-esteem, the Red Tower Master\u2019s magic skills are better than mine, alright?\u201d Melkith reluctantly confessed.\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need to trade for guidance on those magic books,\u201d Eugene said with an amused shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything else that\u2019s worth trading for? Items can work just as well.\u201dMelkith\u2019s jaw fell halfway in shock at this bold statement. After staring at Eugene for a few moments, she burst into laughter as she shook her head.\u201cThis kid really knows how to cut a deal,\u201d Melkith commented sarcastically.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Eugene casually replied.\u201cWho says that I don\u2019t want to?\u201d Melkith responded immediately as she rubbed her chin. \u201cJust let me think for a moment.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how much he hated someone, as long as they were offering him something useful, he would still accept it. Besides, Eugene didn\u2019t really have any hard feelings towards Melkith.\u2018Anyways, I shouldn\u2019t have any need to use Wynnyd for the time being.\u2019Of course, Eugene couldn\u2019t just decide to loan Wynnyd all on his own accord. The Storm Sword was a treasure that belonged to the Lionheart\u2019s direct line. Eugene was currently only borrowing it for a while.\u2018Though I don\u2019t think the Patriarch will say that it\u2019s not allowed.\u2019Although he felt that he still needed to first ask for permission, Eugene wasn\u2019t really afraid that Gilead would turn down this proposal. Despite being the Patriarch of the Lionheart clan, which heavily valued tradition, Gilead Lionheart had shown several times that he was more invested in being realistic and pursuing the clan\u2019s best interests than in protecting such outdated traditions.And it wasn\u2019t like they were just handing Wynnyd over to Melkith. Gilead shouldn't have any reason to refuse if they could get something of value in return for lending it out for a few days if they could get that promise recorded in clear writing.\u2018And this works out for me as well.\u2019Even as Eugene considered all this, Melkith was also lost in thought. She was busy recalling all the various artifacts she had collected for herself, as well as any magic books which were exclusively kept by the White Tower of Magic.\u2018...The magic books aren\u2019t valuable enough,\u2019\u00a0Melkith judged.Since Eugene was allowed entrance into Akron, the magic books belonging exclusively to the White Tower of Magic were no longer of great value to him.\u201c...How about a staff?\u201d Melkith suddenly spoke up. \u201cKid, you don\u2019t have a staff yet, right? Although you might feel like you can already use magic quite well even without a staff, that\u2019s just because all the magic you\u2019ve learned so far has been simple.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Eugene responded politely.\u201cOf course, that\u2019s the case,\u201d Melkith insisted. \u201cDid you think that wizards carried around staffs just to look cool? With the aid of a staff, you can easily fine-tune your mana, simplifying all your spell-casting techniques.\u201d\u201cEugene. I have a lot of fine staffs in my collection as well,\u201d Lovellian immediately interjected.Truthfully speaking, he was reluctant to allow Melkith to borrow Wynnyd.Although it wasn\u2019t guaranteed that she would be able to summon the Wind Spirit King just because she was using Wynnyd as a catalyst, what if Melkith truly did succeed in signing a contract with the Wind Spirit King?The White Tower Master, Melkith El-Hayah, was already the greatest Spirit Summoner in the history of magic. Before her, no other Spirit Summoner had managed to sign contracts with two Spirit Kings. If the Spirit King of the Wind was added to that\u2026 the power held by the White Tower of Magic would become far too strong.As the Red Tower Master, Lovellian didn\u2019t want the balance of power between the Towers to collapse. Who knew what would happen if Melkith, who was already so free-spirited and self-righteous, held more power than the other Tower Masters?\u2018With her personality, she won\u2019t want to be involved in Aroth\u2019s day-to-day affairs, but\u2026 it still isn\u2019t good to allow too much power to be focused on one Tower Master,\u2019\u00a0Lovellian believed.A current example of this was the Black Tower Master, Balzac Ludbeth. Even in Aroth, he needed to be treated with special consideration. This was because of the Demon King of Incarceration, who had signed a contract with Balzac and thrown his support behind the Black Tower Master. Balzac was both the Black Tower Master and, at the same time, Helmuth\u2019s ambassador.\u201cWhy do you have to keep trying to get in my way?\u201d Melkith demanded.Lovellian replied with a question of his own, \u201cWhy do you have to keep being so greedy when you already have contracts with two Spirit Kings?\u201d\u201cThis old man. Do you think that I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re really afraid of? Are you truly that worried that I might wreak havoc after signing a contract with the Wind Spirit King?\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re well aware then.\u201d\u201cHey! Even though we\u2019ve known each other for decades, do you still not know me that well? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019ve got no interest in the headache that\u2019s meddling in Aroth\u2019s state of affairs?\u201d\u201cAlthough you can say that now, once you obtain too much power, it might end up twisting you.\u201dLovellian didn\u2019t raise his voice. He just continued to stare at Melkith with calm eyes, and Melkith was unable to refute him and could only grind her teeth in frustration.\u201c...You really are an amazing patriot. Since when were you so devoted to Aroth?\u201d Melkith asked sarcastically.Lovellian calmly replied, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to step aside and allow further disturbances to break out. Balzac alone is enough to give me a headache.\u201d\u201cHah! From how you\u2019re acting, someone might think that Balzac really was up to something,\u201d Melkith snorted in amusement. \u201cLovellian Sophis, although I'm well aware of how much you detest black wizards, sometimes you just go too far. Don\u2019t you think you should avoid misjudging people because of your preconceptions?\u201d\u201cPreconceptions?\u201d Lovellian\u2019s lips twisted into a mocking smile. \u201cI lost my family due to a black wizard\u2019s attempt at human experimentation. Right in front of my eyes, I was forced to watch as my mother, father, and sister writhed around as parts of a single chimera. If my master hadn\u2019t saved me, I too would have undergone the exact same thing to become part of that chimera.\u201d\u201c...Ugh..,\u201d Melkith grimaced.\u201cSo isn\u2019t it only natural for me to detest black wizards and to have preconceptions about them?\u201d Lovellian pressed.\u201c...I\u2019ve\u2026 put my foot in my mouth. Sorry,\u201d Melkith apologized. \u201cYou have the right to detest black wizards. However\u2026 Balzac is still innocent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t be sure of that,\u201d with a snort, Lovellian shook his head. \u201cCan you really say for certain that Balzac isn\u2019t the mastermind behind the filth that goes on in Bolero Street? These days, several people go missing from Bolero Street each year. Such disappearances aren\u2019t just taking place on Bolero Street, but in various other places throughout Aroth as well.\u201d\u201c...There\u2019s no evidence that the black wizards are behind those\u2026,\u201d Melkith weakly argued.\u201cOf course, there isn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t attempted to interrogate Balzac either. But there\u2019s one fact that we just can\u2019t ignore. As far as I know, the only ones who enjoy kidnapping strangers are the black wizards.\u201d\u201c...It\u2019s none of my concern whether you hate black wizards or are suspicious of Balzac,\u201d Melkith spat out as she rallied her anger. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to guard against. However, I swear on my mana that I have no desire to abuse my power and make a mess. Even if I do manage to sign a contract with the Wind Spirit King, I won\u2019t do anything that disgraces my position as the White Tower Master.\u201d\u201cAlright then,\u201d Lovellian easily accepted.\u201c...What?\u201d Melkith struggled to respond.\u201cIf you\u2019ve sworn on your mana, then I guess I\u2019ll just have to trust you, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Lovellian smiled warmly as if his cold attitude from earlier was merely for show.Seeing this, Melkith couldn\u2019t help but click her tongue, \u201cTch\u2026 this fox-like old man\u2026![1]\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too offended. If I had just plainly asked you to swear an oath, would you really have agreed to do so?\u201d Lovellian asked her.Melkith found herself unable to come up with any denials and could only raise her clenched fists in anger. If she had her way, she really wanted to go up to Lovellian, grab him by his collar, and squeeze his throat until his tonsils popped out[2].\u201c...Ah, but of course,\u201d Lovellian recalled. \u201cThe choice is still up to Eugene. My apologies for going off-topic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Eugene said politely.He didn\u2019t feel particularly offended by Lovellian\u2019s cautious attitude. Instead, he was more concerned about the Head Wizard\u2019s suspicions regarding Balzac. After all, Eugene felt the same distaste that Lovellian did for black wizards.When he first met with Balzac due to the previous incident with Eward, Balzac had drawn a line between himself and other black wizards, saying he had never committed any crimes. Eugene definitely couldn\u2019t believe these words. All the black wizards he had ever known turned out to be right sons of bitches.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really want a staff,\u201d Eugene admitted.\u201cIf anyone heard you say that, they\u2019d think I was just giving it to you. Kid, I\u2019m just\u00a0lending\u00a0it to you. You got that!\u201d Melkith insisted.\u201cAllow me to say this in advance, but I will only be able to lend Wynnyd to you for a few days,\u201d Eugene clarified. \u201cBut if that means I will only be able to borrow one of the artifacts that Head Wizard Melkith owns for a few days at most, then we might as well not go through with it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026. Just as I thought, you really are an annoying brat,\u201d Melkith growled, her shoulders heaving in anger as she turned to look at Lovellian and then Eugene.Now that she looked back on it, it appeared that the two of them had already worked out what to say in order to take advantage of her.\u201c...Let\u2019s trade one year per day,\u201d Melkith spat out. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the best offer you\u2019re going to get. If you lend me Wynnyd for one day, I will lend you one of my artifacts for a whole year.\u201d\u201cSo if I lend you Wynnyd for a week, you\u2019ll let me borrow whatever it is for seven years?\u201d Eugene confirmed.Melkith grudgingly acknowledged, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dWith some surprise, Eugene asked, \u201cDo you really have to go that far just because you want to borrow Wynnyd?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself over and over again. I have to make a contract with the Wind Spirit King no matter what!\u201d Melkith shouted with a growl of frustration. Having already confessed her desire, Melkith didn\u2019t restrain herself any longer and continued, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that ever since I became a spirit summoner, all I\u2019ve ever wanted was to sign a contract with the Wind Spirit King. The Lightning Spirit King and the Earth Spirit King are great, but I\u00a0have\u00a0to make a contract with the Wind Spirit King!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Eugene asked bluntly.\u201cWhy else! Because the Great Vermouth was the last one to have made a contract with the Wind Spirit King!\u201d Melkith shouted once more. \u201cNone of the great spirit summoners who managed to contract Spirit Kings before me were able to make a contract with the Wind Spirit King. Although you might not be aware of this, among the spirit summoners like me, the Wind Spirit King is\u2026 um\u2026 he\u2019s like a dream for us. This might not register with you because you were born to the Lionheart clan, but like how some wizards revere the Wise Sienna, some spirit summoners greatly respect the Great Vermouth.\u201d1. Rather than fox, the Korean version of this insult uses a species of snake.\u00a0\u261c2. The original Korean version of the idiom describes it as squeezing out the thrush in his throat.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just feel like he\u2019s also a great person worthy of respect.\u201d\u201cWhy should I hold any respect for him! Just grab any passersby and ask them! Between the Great Vermouth, the Wise Sienna, and the Stupid Hamel, if you asked them to pick the one they most respected, as long as they\u2019re not some lying attention-seeker, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d say they respect Hamel.\u201d\u201c...Cough\u2026,\u201d Lovellian let out a low cough at Melkith\u2019s outburst. As Gilead\u2019s words about how he most liked Hamel ran through his mind, the Red Tower Master hesitantly spoke up, \u201c...Ahem\u2026. Eugene, if you don\u2019t have any desire for a staff, then\u2014\u201dMelkith interrupted him, \u201cHey you, don\u2019t say anything pointless and just keep quiet.\u201dIgnoring her, Lovellian continued, \u201cAmong the artifacts collected by the White Tower Master, there\u2019s one that\u2019s extremely rare and precious.\u201d\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201d Melkith screeched. As if something was responding to her cry, her curly hair started to rise upwards as an electric current surged through it.\u201cIt is strictly forbidden to commit any acts of violence within Akron,\u201d Lovellian reminded her.Melkith threatened him, \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t spout any nonsense, I won\u2019t need to do anything violent\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense?\u201d Lovellian defended himself, \u201cI\u2019m just going to give Eugene some advice so that he can make an informed choice.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also quite curious about what he has to say,\u201d Eugene spoke up with a grin.Eugene also wanted to see Melkith summon the Wind Spirit King, Tempest. But if he could also get a rare treasure on top of that, he\u2019d be bursting with happiness.\u201dLovellian began, \u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019s this artifact called the Cloak of Darkness\u2014\u201d\u201cI said shut up!\u201d Melkith repeated once more.\u201cWhy do you sound so upset? When, as far I know, you haven\u2019t even used the Cloak of Darkness once in these last ten years?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026. Do you know how much I went through to get my hands on that cloak?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to lend it to someone who needs it and get what you want in return instead of just leaving it lying around unused except for ornamental purposes?\u201dOnce again, Melkith was left speechless. She dug her fingers into her floating hair as she was caught in frustrated anguish.\u201cWhat exactly is the Cloak of Darkness?\u201d Eugene asked curiously.\u201c...It\u2019s just a winter cloak. Since it\u2019s got fur all over it, it\u2019s quite warm\u2026. Th-that\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d Melkith stammered as she avoided giving a real explanation, but Lovellian was kind enough to explain in detail.\u201cYou know about Gedon\u2019s Shield stored in the Lionheart treasure vault, right?\u201d Lovellian confirmed. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not really on the same level, the cloak can do something similar. If you direct a frontal attack into the inside of the cloak, you can redirect it back in any direction you want.\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s not that versatile,\u201d Melkith desperately tried to downplay it. \u201cStrictly speaking, it relies on a rebound instead of a reflection. If you don\u2019t calculate the spatial coordinates correctly and guide the path of the attack with mana, you won\u2019t really be able to send the attack back in the direction you want it to go.\u201d\u201cIn any case, it has some of the highest levels of spatial magic. You might not be able to get familiar with it right away, but if it\u2019s with your talents, Eugene, I believe that you\u2019ll be able to use it soon enough,\u201d Lovellian assured him.\u201cYou\u2026! You, just why do you keep blowing such hot air? Does the Cloak of Darkness really look all that easy to grab?\u201d Melkith\u2019s shoulders trembled as they heaved up and down.\u201cThat\u2019s not the only way you can use it,\u201d Lovellian continued, ignoring Melkith\u2019s latest outburst. \u201cThe outer surface of the cloak is also enchanted with high-level defensive spells. You can easily block an offensive spell of the Fifth Circle just by wearing it.\u201d\u201c...But that also depends on your own mana,\u201d Melkith sulkily added.\u201cAll in all, it\u2019s a very convenient artifact. Also, Eugene, do you still enjoy using various different weapons?\u201d Lovellian asked, showing no signs of having heard Melkith.The Head Wizard recalled the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony he had\u00a0spectated\u00a0a few years ago. Although the current Eugene only wielded Wynnyd by itself, during the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, Eugene had skillfully wielded both a shield and a sword together. Not only that, he had heard from Gilead that Eugene was also very good at handling spears.Eugene pretended modesty, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I use multiple weapons just for the fun of it. But if I have them, I\u2019ll use them. Though I currently only have Wynnyd on me since it\u2019s inconvenient to carry multiple weapons.\u201d\u201cHaha! If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll really love the Cloak of Darkness. That cloak also has the highest levels of subspace magic imbued into it. There\u2019s nothing complicated about it. Just put some things into the cloak\u2026 and then you can take them out whenever you need them,\u201d Lovellian revealed dramatically.\u201cThis son of a bitch\u2026!\u201d Melkith cursed as she raised despair-filled eyes to glare at Lovellian.\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d Eugene nodded his approval with a broad grin. \u201cLet\u2019s trade for the Cloak of Darkness instead of a staff. Ah, but not right now. I still need to request permission from the main family.\u201d\u201cI \u2014 I still haven\u2019t agreed to this,\u201d Melkith spat out with desperation in her heart.However, Melkith was the one who had the most to lose by not making this deal, not Eugene. Or at least, that was how Melkith felt. Even in her dreams, Melkith couldn\u2019t have imagined the fact that Eugene was extremely eager to speak with Tempest once more.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d Eugene shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cAnyways, I used too much brain power upstairs, so now I\u2019m starving\u2026. Head Wizard Lovellian, if it\u2019s okay with you, would you like to have a meal together? We can talk about what I need to do as your disciple.\u201dLovellian accepted the offer, \u201cThat sounds good to me. Although it isn\u2019t that close to here, I know of a nice restaurant situated up in the sky, in one of the floating stations. Although the food there is delicious, the night view seen from its windows is even better than the food.\u201d\u201cWow. Come to think of it, I still haven\u2019t gotten to see the night view that\u2019s called one of Aroth\u2019s Crown Jewels.\u201d\u201cIf so, then that\u2019s great! Allow me to call an aerial carriage for us immediately.\u201dIgnoring Melkith, Eugene and Lovellian got to know each other better as they exchanged chit-chat. Melkith had just been glaring at this sight, but now she gritted her teeth and dropped her head in surrender.\u201c...F-fine, I get it,\u201d Melkith reluctantly admitted defeat.\u201cOh, you were still here?\u201d Eugene asked in surprise.He was just as he appeared, a cheeky brat. As Melkith glared at Eugene, she clenched her fists.Melkith struggled to spit out the words, \u201c...The Cloak of Darkness\u2026! If that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll lend it to you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush. Haven\u2019t I already told you that I need to ask permission from the main family?\u201dAs Eugene replied with a shake of his head, Melkith was unable to endure it any longer and started releasing shrill screams of rage, \u201cKyaaaaaah! Kiyaaaaah! Ukyaaaaah!\u201d\u201cI could almost think that you were a crow\u2026,\u201d as Eugene shook his head in pity, he backed away from her.* * *Just as Eugene had expected, Gilead made no objections to loaning Wynnyd.However, he did attach conditions. They absolutely could not risk destroying Wynnyd during that time, and an observer from the Lionheart clan would be attached to Melkith for the duration she was borrowing Wynnyd.\u201cAn observer?\u201d Melkith asked.Having visited him in the early morning hours, a few days after they had last talked, Melkith\u2019s face didn\u2019t look all that good. Perhaps because she\u2019d been under a lot of stress for the past few days, the dark circles under her eyes were very deep.Melkith continued, \u201cWill the Patriarch be coming personally?\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d Eugene answered.\u201cThen who will be coming? Is it that guy, the Patriarch\u2019s younger brother, Gion Lionheart?\u201d\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\u201cThe Patriarch of the Lionheart clan\u2019s main family wouldn\u2019t be so carefree as to be called here and there on various matters. Since he\u2019s already been called to Aroth recently because of his wastrel son\u2026 it would be ridiculous for him to return for something like this,\u201d Melkith grumbled as she unclasped the collar of her cloak.\u201cIs that the Cloak of Darkness?\u201d Eugene asked, pointing to the cloak that Melkith was wearing.She had said that it was warm because it was covered in fur, which was exactly how this cloak appeared.\u201c...Cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Melkith bragged with mixed feelings.\u201cI think it would look cooler if I wore it than when Head Wizard Melkith wears it,\u201d Eugene teased.\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like you were an annoying brat, but this is\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too upset. Since we\u2019re doing business with each other, wouldn\u2019t it be better if there were smiles all around?\u201d\u201cShut it. So then, when will the Patriarch\u2019s younger brother be arriving?\u201d\u201cThey said that he\u2019d be here sometime around noon today\u2026 but Sir Gion isn\u2019t the only one who's coming.\u201d\u201cThen who else is tagging along?\u201dMelkith narrowed her eyes as she carefully brushed the fur on the cloak.\u201cThe Lionheart clan\u2019s Guardians will also be accompanying him,\u201d Eugene replied with a tsk. \u201cThis will be the first time loaning out a treasure of the main family, and they\u2019re also here to take a look at\u2026 Eward\u2019s\u2026 my older brother\u2019s incident.\u201d\u201c....The Guardians?\u201d Melkith\u2019s narrowed eyes softened as she tried to recall the term. After a moment\u2019s thought, Melkith smiled and nodded, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You\u2019re talking about the Hunting Dogs of the Lionheart clan, right?\u201dCalling them Hunting Dogs, although the Guardians wouldn\u2019t appreciate these words, Eugene\u2019s opinion of them wasn\u2019t all that different from Melkith\u2019s.The Guardians of the Family Commandments \u2014 the Lionheart Clan\u2019s Black Lions.Although that\u2019s what they were called, the Guardians\u2019 role was no different from that of hunting dogs.If a child from the collateral lines who had not attended a Bloodline Continuation Ceremony were to train their mana or pick up a real sword, or if the White Flame Formula, which was meant to be learned exclusively by the main family, was taught to a collateral descendent \u2014 the Guardians would appear to deliver the judgment for their crimes.\u2018And as for black magic,\u2019\u00a0Eugene recalled.The practice of black magic was strictly forbidden by the Lionheart clan\u2019s commandments. Although Eward hadn\u2019t succeeded in practicing black magic, it was true that he had tried to start learning black magic.As such, the Guardians had decided to visit Aroth to investigate this matter closely.Gion Lionheart, the still-unmarried younger brother of the Patriarch, was a member of the Lionheart clan\u2019s Black Lions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 49.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49.1: The Black Lions (2)The current Patriarch of the Lionheart\u2019s main family had two younger brothers.The relationship between the three brothers was calm and the eldest son, Gilead, had ascended to the position of Patriarch without having to shed even a single drop of blood. In addition to the simple prioritization of seniority, Gilead\u2019s skills at that time were superior to his brothers\u2019.And Gilead\u2019s two younger brothers hadn\u2019t held much interest in the position of the Patriarch. The second son, Gilford Lionheart, whose skills fell short compared to both his older and younger brothers, had given up on the position of the Patriarch at an early age and searched instead for his own happiness.From what Eugene could recall, Gilford Lionheart was a middle-aged man with a slightly protruding belly, though not as much as Gerhard\u2019s. According to the rumors, he had played around quite a bit when he was young, but\u2026 although they hadn\u2019t gotten to know each other all that well, Gilford hadn\u2019t seemed like such a bad person to Eugene. Gilford had left the main estate earlier this year and established his own household in a secluded and peaceful country estate.Unlike Gilead and Gilford, Gion Lionheart had never gotten married, nor did he wish to be married. Eugene had personally asked Gion about his reasons for this a few years ago.\u2018Marriage? Of course, it\u2019s an admirable and beautiful thing. However, if I wanted to get married and have children, I would have to part ways with the main family before any of my children turned five. I would hate to have to do that. And with my personality, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a great father.\u2019Gion had a free-spirited personality. He was always sharing a laugh with the knights who served the main family, and his attitude towards the servants was never overbearing. He showed a passion for teaching Ciel and Cyan and had even cut down on his free time to instruct the knights.Gion was very kind to Eugene in particular. During the four years Eugene spent at the main estate, Gion had personally instructed Eugene alongside Gilead. At least while Eugene was at the main estate, he had never once been discriminated against just because he was an adopted child from a collateral branch.In Eugene\u2019s view, Gion was quite a unique individual because of all this.His martial skills were also outstanding. Even the Patriarch, Gilead, had shown respect for Gion\u2019s skills. However, unlike Gilead, who hadn\u2019t been able to focus on his training after having become the Patriarch, Gion had devoted himself to his training while he wandered around the continent. Due to this, presently, Gion\u2019s skill had actually surpassed Gilead\u2019s.That said, Gion had never once thought of rebelling against Gilead. Gion would never deviate from his role as the Patriarch\u2019s \u2018younger brother.\u2019One year ago, there was a period when Gion was away from the main estate for several months. When he returned, the Lionheart, the personal sigil of the Lionheart clan that Gion had also worn on the left chest of his formal dress, was slightly different.It had turned into a sigil of a black lion with its fangs drawn and claws exposed.This showed that Gion had become a formal member of the Knights of the Black Lion, the Guardians of the Lionheart clan.In fact, this wasn\u2019t anything unusual. As long as you had exceptional skills and proven loyalty to the clan, anyone in the Lionheart clan could apply to join the Knights of the Black Lion. The Knights of the Black Lion were stronger and had a sharper edge than the Knights of the White Lion, which consisted of the knights who served the main family.\u2018Although this will be my first time seeing them personally.\u2019It was getting closer to noon \u2014 the appointed time of their arrival. Eugene was feeling a slight excitement as he checked the time. Although he had lived at the main estate for four years, he had never once seen a member of the Knights of the Black Lion during all that time.The Knights of the White Lion, who belonged to the Lionheart\u2019s direct line, had sworn their loyalty solely to the main family. However, the Knights of the Black Lion weren\u2019t sworn to the main family; instead, their loyalty had been sworn to the \u2018Lionheart\u2019 name as a whole.The guiding force behind the Knights of the Black Lion was the Council of Elders, the group made up of the giants who had left their weighty names in the history of the \u2018Lionheart\u2019 clan, regardless of whether they were from the direct line or the collateral lines. Even the current Patriarch, Gilead, did not stand on an equal footing with the Elders of the Council.\u2018It still isn\u2019t time yet,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought impatiently.He couldn\u2019t help but be interested in the Knights of the Black Lion.He had spent four years at the main estate. Gilead was strong, and so was Gion. Both of them were strong enough to be recognized for their strength no matter where in the continent they had been placed.The main family\u2019s Knights of the White Lion were also strong. Even among the numerous knightly orders that existed on this continent, they were one of a handful of the strongest. Even when the current Knights of the White Lion were compared to the Kiehl Empire\u2019s knightly orders, while they might be said to be lacking in numbers, they couldn\u2019t be said to be lacking in quality.But that alone wasn\u2019t enough.Vermouth had been the strongest person in all of humanity\u2019s history. That was why he was called the Hero and why he had led the subjugation force that sought to slay all the Demon Kings. Neither the elves, who were long-lived, nor the dragons, who were called masters of magic, had been able to slay a Demon King.However, Vermouth was able to kill three of the Demon Kings. Eugene was deeply aware of this fact.Molon, Anise, Sienna, and\u2026 Hamel, all of them were strong. However, if it wasn\u2019t for Vermouth, it would be impossible for them to kill a Demon King.Vermouth, whom Hamel had seen and accompanied, and who resided in Eugene\u2019s memories, had been so strong that he hadn\u2019t even seemed human.\u2018That\u2019s why it\u2019s still not enough.\u2019Eugene stood up with a disappointed click of his tongue. Although Gilead and Gion were strong, as were the Knights of the White Lion, it wasn\u2019t enough for them to truly claim to be Vermouth\u2019s successors.Since that was the case, what about the Knights of the Black Lion? Without distinguishing between the main and collateral branches, accepting the most exceptional and loyal clan members who bore the name \u2018Lionheart\u2019 \u2014 how strong would such a knightly order be? And what about the Council who backed the Knights of the Black Lion? How strong were they?\u2018Those old geezers who\u2019ve retreated into the background\u2026 it can\u2019t just be for the sake of making room for others, right?\u2019Gilead didn\u2019t like the traditions of the direct line. Of course, there was the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, but other traditions meant to absolutely suppress the collateral lines also existed.However, the Patriarch\u2019s strength alone wasn\u2019t enough to change these traditions that had been passed down for over three hundred years. Both the Council and the Knights of the Black Lion were part of the Guardians of the Family Commandments that upheld the rules of the Lionheart clan above all else.As guardians, they were required to have the appropriate strength needed to enforce their duties.Eugene hadn\u2019t intended for all of this to happen, but he was excited to finally get involved with the Knights of the Black Lion.* * *A gigantic aerial carriage boasting a magnificent splendor landed in front of the Red Tower of Magic.\u201cThey sure are throwing their weight around,\u201d Melkith scoffed.She didn\u2019t appreciate being placed in such a position, especially when the other party wasn\u2019t even a high-ranking personage of Aroth. If it wasn\u2019t for the sake of Wynnyd, Melkith wouldn\u2019t be standing out here, respectfully waiting to welcome these guests.Eugene reminded her, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you respect Sir Vermouth, the ancestor of the Lionheart clan?\u201d\u201cKid, don\u2019t misquote me,\u201d Melkith corrected him. \u201cThe one I respect is the Great Vermouth, not the founder of the Lionheart clan.\u201d\u201cWell, aren\u2019t they pretty much the same thing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different. I don\u2019t really like the Lionheart clan. I don\u2019t like how its main family suppresses its collateral lines nor how their Council and their Knights of the Black Lion put on such a secretive act.\u201d\u201cBut for now, you should hide such an attitude,\u201d Lovellian reminded Melkith.Unlike Melkith, Lovellian\u2019s expression was calm.While staring at the disembarking carriage, he continued, \u201cIf you really want to borrow Wynnyd, you had better avoid doing anything that might offend them.\u201d\u201cAre you really asking me to act all nice and polite?\u201d Melkith demanded. \u201cIf anyone had heard you say that, they might be confused into thinking that I\u2019m not trading with them on an equal footing. I\u2026 with my greatly cherished and adored Cloak of Darkness, I\u2019m actually trading it for Wynnyd!\u201dIt was Eugene\u2019s turn to correct her, \u201cIt\u2019s not really a trade. We\u2019re just loaning them to each other. And you remember that we promised a day for a year, right?\u201dMelkith ground her teeth angrily.But even though she was showing such an expression, she wasn\u2019t truly angry. Although she had indeed been angry that day at Akron, when she had started screeching like a crow, once she went back to the White Tower of Magic, while clinging tightly to the Cloak of Darkness\u2026 she had managed to calm her emotions and think about it rationally.[1]\u2018As if it would take me a day. It will probably only take a few hours, maybe half a day at most?\u2019\u00a0Melkith thought optimistically.Melkith trusted in her affinity with spirits. Since she would also have the strong catalyst of the Storm Sword Wynnyd with her, there was no reason she wouldn\u2019t be able to summon the Wind Spirit King.\u2018That means I\u2019ll only be lending the cloak for a few months at most. I can endure it if it\u2019s just that much,\u2019\u00a0Melkith assured herself.In exchange for getting the chance to sign a contract with the Spirit King of the Wind, which Melkith had longed for ever since she was young, she was loaning out the Cloak of Darkness for just a few months. No matter how much she thought about it, wasn\u2019t this a great deal? Of course, Melkith made sure not to openly reveal such joy.\u2018If I needlessly show my true feelings, that kid might try to change the terms of our deal.\u2019Although it had\u00a0only been a few days since they had first met, Melkith had already figured out that Eugene was shrewd, nasty, and as stubborn as a pitbull.The door of the aerial carriage finally opened. For such a spacious carriage, there were only five people riding in it, and the first person to get off was\u2014\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Eugene demanded.It was Ciel.\u201cMy mother\u2019s birthday is coming soon,\u201d Ciel said by way of explanation.Since it had only been a few months since they had last met, Ciel\u2019s appearance couldn\u2019t have changed all that much. However, as he was now seeing her in a sharply-cut formal dress and her\u00a0hair tied\u00a0up in a way that he had never seen her wear before during his time at the main estate, she felt a little unfamiliar to him.\u201cBecause of that, I\u2019ve come to pick out a few presents for her. I was also curious to see if you were doing well,\u201d Ciel replied with a dry expression that didn\u2019t show even a trace of amusement.With this, she narrowed her eyes and waited for Eugene\u2019s reaction. However, Eugene didn\u2019t seem as surprised or perturbed as Ciel had hoped.\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d he asked.And that was it. Ciel furrowed her brows, but instead of continuing to block the doorway, she stepped aside.Following Ciel, Gion was the next to emerge. Like the last time Eugene had seen him, the sigil of the Knights of the Black Lion was embroidered on the left side of Gion\u2019s chest. As soon as Gion saw Eugene, he smiled brightly and waved his hand.\u201cIt really hasn\u2019t been long enough since you two last saw each other to feel such joy at your reunion,\u201d said the middle-aged man who next emerged from the carriage as he patted Gion on the shoulder.\u201cThat might be the case, but what can I do about feeling so happy at getting to meet Eugene like this?\u201d Gion asked cheerfully.\u201cThere\u2019ll be enough time for that later, so let\u2019s just focus on business for now,\u201d the man advised.Although he didn\u2019t know who the man was, Eugene could feel he had exceptional skills.\u2018But not with a sword. It looks like he uses a spear,\u2019\u00a0Eugene observed.The man wasn\u2019t carrying a weapon. But considering his posture and the way his muscles had developed, Eugene could be certain that he used a spear.1. The raw text says yesterday instead of \u2018that day\u2019 at Akron, but the previous chapter states that their first meeting was a few days ago. Taking into account that the Lionheart family may have needed a few days to discuss and arrange things, we have decided to assume that the author just made a mistake in this chapter.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since they were coming here to check on both Wynnyd\u2019s loan and Eward\u2019s issue, it was only natural for them to have included a wizard in their group.\u2018And behind him\u2026. Oh, my.\u2019The last to emerge from the carriage was a woman with her dress uniform\u2019s black jacket draped over her shoulders. Seeing as how she was the only one whose dress uniform was unbuttoned and draped over her shoulders while the others were wearing their dress uniforms all neatly buttoned up, it appeared as though she had the highest rank among them.\u2018She\u2019s strong.\u2019But what Eugene noticed before all that was the woman\u2019s hands. Although they were covered up by leather gloves, due to the long period of time that had been spent training them as weapons, it was possible to estimate the strength of the woman\u2019s hands through their outlines alone.\u2018So she doesn\u2019t use a sword or a spear. She\u2019s a fist-fighter.\u2019\u201cHas it been twenty years?\u201d the woman spoke up as she looked straight at Lovellian with a cheerful smile.\u201cTo be more precise, it\u2019s been twenty-three years,\u201d Lovellian corrected her.\u201cHas that much time really gone by already? Ah, I\u2019ve heard the news. You\u2019re the current Red Tower Master, right?\u201d\u201cWhen we last met, I had already told you I would soon become the next Red Tower Master.\u201d\u201cDid you really? Since so much time has passed, I can\u2019t clearly recall it. And I probably wasn\u2019t all that interested in the first place,\u201d having said this, the woman turned to look at Eugene. \u201cSo you\u2019re Eugene Lionheart.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d for now, Eugene decided to just bow his head.\u201c...My name is\u2026 Carmen Lionheart. By all accounts, you could consider me your great-aunt, but don\u2019t call me that, got it?\u201d\u201c...Um, yes?\u201d Eugene hesitantly responded after a few moments of trying to comprehend Carmen\u2019s words.Did she say that she was his great-aunt? But that would mean that this woman was Gilead\u2019s aunt\u2026.\u2018Appearance really isn\u2019t everything,\u2019\u00a0Eugene sighed to himself.Among those here, Melkith alone was over sixty years old, and\u00a0Lovellian was\u00a0the closest to her age. But even so, these two were able to maintain unbelievably youthful looks at their respective ages, so it was no surprise for Carmen to look so young.However, aside from her youthful appearance, it was her seniority that caused Eugene to feel so surprised that someone like her had come all the way here.\u201cThe wind is picking up, so why don\u2019t we head inside and talk,\u201d Lovellian said with a grin.They started making their way to the drawing-room located on the top floor of the Red Tower of Magic. On the way there, Eugene was able to pick up a bit more about the members of the Knights of the Black Lion who had made their way here today.~Carmen Lionheart, like Gion, was the younger sibling of a previous generation\u2019s Patriarch, and again, like Gion, she hadn\u2019t gotten married. After staying at the main estate for quite some time, she transferred to the Knights of the Black Lion. Currently, she\u00a0was\u00a0the captain of the Third Division of the Knights of the Black Lion.Naishon Lionheart was the man who patted Gion on the shoulder. He was one of the commanders in the Third Division led by Carmen, and instead of the direct line, he came from one of the collateral lines.Falgo Lionheart was the wizard. He likewise belonged to the Third Division. He was from a magic-focused branch, which was rare even among the collateral lines, and today he was the one in charge of formalizing the deal with Melkith.~\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve already negotiated the contents of this deal, allow me to confirm them once more,\u201d Falgo said as he laid his staff on top of the table. \u201cThis deal involves the Storm Sword Wynnyd, which belongs to the Lionheart\u2019s main family, and the Cloak of Darkness, which belongs to the White Tower Master. For every day that Wynnyd is borrowed, the Cloak of Darkness will be loaned out for one year\u2026. Although the condition has been laid out like this, a day isn\u2019t exactly the best unit to measure this by, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cSo, what do you propose?\u201d Melkith asked grudgingly.Falgo offered, \u201cA fortnight for an hour. A month for two hours. A year for twenty-four hours. How does that sound?\u201dMelkith sarcastically replied, \u201cWhat about the minutes?\u201d\u201cAlthough that\u2019s possible, I\u2019m afraid it might be a bit cumbersome to do so,\u201d Falgo politely admitted.\u201cSo if I borrow it for ten minutes, you\u2019ll still get to play with my Cloak of Darkness for an hour,\u201d Melkith snorted in exasperation.Right away, it was obvious that such a condition wasn\u2019t favorable to her.\u201cPlease understand our position,\u201d Falgo requested. \u201cThe Storm Sword Wynnyd is a sword that was personally used by our ancestor, and it\u2019s one of a handful of the rarest treasures in the Lionheart clan\u2019s possession.\u201d\u201cIs that the only condition you\u2019re insisting on?\u201d Melkith finally asked.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve already prepared a contract,\u201d Falgo said with a sly smile as he pulled out a contract from his pocket.The contract then needed to be checked over, not just by Melkith but by Eugene as well.What was emphasized in bolded characters was that Melkith was not allowed to risk destroying Wynnyd.\u201c...If that occurs, you must pay the corresponding price.\u00a0Isn\u2019t that rather vague wording?\u201d Melkith complained.Falgo explained, \u201cWe just hope to show our desire for there to be no incidents.\u201d\u201cWell then, just in case, I would like to hear what would happen if I did destroy Wynnyd?\u201d Melkith insisted on asking.\u201cThen you would have to pay for it with your life.\u201dThe one who replied to Melkith\u2019s question was Carmen. Instead of sitting in the seat offered to her, Carmen was sitting on the window sill as she looked out the window. It was impossible to associate that crooked and rakish appearance with someone who should, by all rights, be Gilead\u2019s elderly aunt.Carmen continued, \u201cThe Storm Sword Wynnyd is a treasure of priceless value. If you really want to borrow it, then, of course, you should be prepared to risk your life.\u201d\u201cEven though my life also has incalculable value?\u201d Melkith asked challengingly.\u201cAlthough that might be the case for Aroth, that doesn\u2019t apply to the Lionheart clan,\u201d Carmen said in a cold voice as she pulled out a rolled-up cigar.After looking at Carmen, staring out the window as she chewed on a cigar, Eugene shook his head.\u2018Even though she isn\u2019t a teenager anymore.\u2019Looking at this pretentious rascal, Eugene was reminded of Cyan from a few years ago. His twin, Ciel, had only started showing symptoms of going through puberty this year, but Cyan had begun showing the signs of going through puberty two years ago when he was fifteen. Cyan had started to enjoy wearing the black clothes that he had somehow gotten his hands on, and when he had tried to get into alcohol and cigarettes by stealing them from the footmen, he had been harshly scolded by Ancilla.\u201cAnd what will you do if I say that I won\u2019t pay with my life?\u201d Melkith challenged her.\u201cNow, now, there\u2019s really no need to offer up your life,\u201d Falgo intervened while trying to maintain a wavering smile. \u201cI have faith in the White Tower Master. I also have respect for you as a fellow wizard. I don\u2019t truly believe that the White Tower Master will make such a clumsy mistake of destroying the catalyst while trying to make a contract with the spirit.\u201d\u201c...Hmph,\u201d Melkith snorted, still displeased.Fargo tried to smooth things over, \u201cIn any case\u2026 should Wynnyd be destroyed, we will discuss the matter again at that time.\u201dMelkith remained unmoved, \u201cBut what you\u2019re saying is that it will still be up to the Lionheart clan to decide first, right?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then give up on borrowing Wynnyd,\u201d Carmen said as she continued to look out the window while chewing on her cigar. Despite having had it in her mouth for a while, she had yet to light it. \u201cThe truth is, no one on the Lionheart side is desperate to make this deal. If the Patriarch hadn\u2019t personally requested it, I wouldn\u2019t even have come here.\u201d\u201cHmph, if someone heard you say that, they\u2019d think you came all the way here because of me,\u201d Melkith implied slyly.\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve come here for the truly important issue, not this trivial matter,\u201d mumbling this, Carmen took out a pocket watch from her vest.To think she was carrying a pocket watch\u2026 Eugene held back the laughter that unconsciously threatened to burst out. It was the first time he had seen someone carrying such an uncomfortable and heavy watch in their vest pocket.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go around carrying a pocket watch, why are you also wearing a wristwatch?\u201d Unlike Eugene, who was holding back his urge to make a retort, Melkith questioned Carmen without any hesitation. \u201cAlso, why do you keep chewing on a cigar you haven\u2019t even lit?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019ve made an appointment to visit the Black Tower of Magic in an hour from now,\u201d Carmen said, refusing to respond to Melkith\u2019s retorts\u2026. \u201cI need to have a conversation with Balzac Ludbeth about the incident with Eward. And after that, I will be accompanying him to Aroth\u2019s prison.\u201d\u201cWhy go to the prison?\u201d Melkith asked.\u201cTo interrogate the cheeky black wizard who dared to teach black magic to the eldest son of the Lionheart clan.\u201dThese words were the complete opposite of Gilead\u2019s previous response. Gilead had said that he would allow Aroth\u2019s laws to hold precedence in judging Gavid\u2019s case.\u201c...That seems to be a bit different from what Gilead had decided,\u201d even Lovellian couldn\u2019t allow such behavior to go unchallenged after hearing these words.He was a longtime friend of Gilead, and his sympathies laid with the Lionheart Clan. But even so, Lovellian was Aroth\u2019s Red Tower Master. He couldn\u2019t simply overlook it when a powerful clan from a foreign country talked about ignoring Aroth\u2019s laws.\u201cAlthough the Patriarch may have made his decision, the Council has reached a different decision. The name of the Lionheart clan was dirtied due to the previous incident. The person who caused such filth to tarnish our name needs to be held accountable,\u201d Carmen\u00a0stated\u00a0with a smirk as she stared at Lovellian. \u201cI have already obtained permission from Aroth\u2019s royal family and parliament. Rather than tearing at each other's faces over this issue, wouldn\u2019t it be a lot cleaner to allow us to interrogate and punish him?\u201d\u201cOf course, it isn\u2019t clean,\u201d Lovellian still objected.\u201cIt seems like you misunderstand something. The Council has no intention of relying on the Lionheart name to push this matter. Since the Lionheart\u2019s eldest son was involved in this incident,\u00a0we\u2019ve already agreed to show enough\u00a0sincerity\u00a0to Aroth. Besides, the price of that sinner\u2019s life is worth nothing.\u201dSince Carmen had said all that, Lovellian could no longer raise any objections. Magic research required a lot of money. For this reason, substantial tourist fees were set for all of the tourist attractions in the capital city of Pentagon.On top of that, rather than making money by revealing and utilizing the magic they had studied, most wizards were the type to hole up and devote themselves to research. He didn\u2019t know how much money the Lionheart clan must have paid for the right to interrogate and punish the criminal, but\u2026 the Council must have paid a large enough bribe that no one had sought to refuse.\u201cAs such, what are you going to do?\u201d Carmen prompted. \u201cAre you going to take the deal? I don\u2019t have much time, so answer quickly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Melkith replied with a frown, even as she thought,\u00a0\u2018So they want to go by hours instead of days? That works out better for me since three hours should already be enough.\u2019Thanks to this condition, no matter how long it might feel, she would be able to get her Cloak of Darkness back within two months.As Melkith signed the contract, she held back the urge to burst into laughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The contract wasn\u2019t simply written down on paper, but created by magic, so that even an Archwizard like Melkith couldn\u2019t get out of it.\u201cWhat happens if I somehow destroy the cloak?\u201d Eugene asked out of curiosity.Melkith was the one who answered him, \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to recompense me for the value of the cloak. You don\u2019t need to worry since I won\u2019t ask you to give your life for it.\u201dFrankly, she wasn\u2019t really in a position to even request something like that. Although Eugene might not be an heir, the opposite party was still an adopted son of the Lionheart\u2019s main family. If she made such an unreasonable request, it was obvious that she would be making an enemy of the Lionheart clan, and Melkith wouldn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201cThough that sort of thing couldn\u2019t happen in the first place,\u201d Melkith said as an afterthought. \u201cThe Cloak of Darkness was specifically designed to be a top-notch defensive artifact. If the Cloak was destroyed while you were wearing it\u2026 then you\u2019d probably be dead. Kid, do you get what I\u2019m trying to say?\u201d\u201cYou meant that if I don\u2019t want to die, I should be careful?\u201d Eugene confirmed quizzically.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t swagger around while trusting in its defenses, and keep it low-key. It\u2019s okay if you want to wear it to a fancy party, but don\u2019t go fighting in it.\u201dIf he was only allowed to use it like that, why would he even need a cloak like this? Eugene snorted and swung the Cloak of Darkness onto his shoulders.\u201cIts design is impressive,\u201d Carmen spoke up from her window seat. She still kept the unlit cigar in her mouth as she said, \u201cI especially like the thick fur around the collar. It reminds me of the symbol of our Lionheart clan, the lion\u2019s mane.[1]\u201d\u201cI guess it does resemble that,\u201d Eugene politely agreed.\u201cBut it\u2019s a shame that the fur is colored black. If the fur was dyed white like the flames of the White Flame Formula or\u2026 if it was dyed gray, it would look much more impressive. The current fur color seems to suit someone from the Knights of the Black Lion much better,\u201d Carmen critiqued.\u201c...,\u201d without saying anything, Eugene faced Carmen with a blank expression.Carmen also stared at Eugene without saying another word. After they exchanged stares like this for a few moments, Ciel, who was sitting next to him, poked Eugene in the side.\u201cHand it over,\u201d she hissed.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Eugene asked petulantly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear her say she wants to try it on?\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t think she said something like that.\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t necessarily have to put it into words for you to get what she meant.\u201dWhat kind of nonsense was Ciel spouting now? Although Eugene didn\u2019t really understand, he was feeling an annoying pressure from Carmen\u2019s gaze.\u201c...Please try it on,\u201d Eugene reluctantly offered as he took off the cloak, and Carmen immediately walked over.While putting on an expression of blatant indifference, she took the cloak that Eugene had offered her and wrapped it around her body in a flourish.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Carmen said as she glanced at her reflection in the window and slowly went through a series of poses.Eugene eyed Carmen\u2019s back as she did this. Although he\u2019d seen a lot of elders in both his past and present lives, this was his first time seeing such a unique elder like Carmen, who seemed unable to act her age.\u201cI think it would be even better if you used a lion-shaped brooch to clasp it across your chest. You could also have the Lionheart sigil embroidered on the back,\u201d Carmen suggested.\u201cFrom the way you\u2019re talking, it\u2019s like I\u2019m giving it to you. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea. I\u2019m only lending it to you, remember? Don\u2019t mess around with my cloak,\u201d Melkith, who had been gazing down at Wynnyd with greedy eyes, shouted in protest.However, Carmen didn\u2019t show any reaction to Melkith\u2019s cry. After continuing to be absorbed with her reflection in the window for a few more moments, she finally took off the cloak after Naishon pointedly coughed several times.\u201cIt\u2019s about time. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Carmen declared.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Naishon said with a sigh of relief as he rose from his seat.He had been worried that Carmen might head off without first taking off the cloak, but fortunately, it seemed like Carmen wasn\u2019t about to do something so shameless and embarrassing.\u201cCiel,\u201d before leaving the drawing-room, Gion called out Ciel\u2019s name.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll make sure to wait with Eugene,\u201d Ciel readily replied with a grin, as if she had been waiting for this.Unlike Ciel's smile, Gion had a somewhat reluctant expression. However, Eugene wasn\u2019t able to ask him his reason for this because Carmen immediately exited the drawing-room without giving them a chance to chat.After Carmen and the other Knights of the Black Lion had left, Melkith leaped to her feet and said, \u201cI\u2019m also heading off.\u201dShe was hugging Wynnyd to her chest and smiling so widely that her cheeks were twitching.\u201cIt definitely won\u2019t take as long as you expect,\u201d Melkith gloated. \u201cMaybe half a day at the most?\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll also go with you,\u201d Eugene proposed.Melkith refused, \u201cNo way. Who said that you could do that? Kid, this is about a contract with a spirit. Although the summoner\u2019s affinity with the spirit is important, the location and the setting are also important. Therefore\u2026 if you had to compare it, you could see it as a meeting with a prospective spouse.[2]\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Eugene grunted in confusion.\u201cJust think about it. How would you feel if you arrived at the appointed meeting place all excited, only to find some unknown scrub hanging around with the person you\u2019re supposed to meet?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it would make that much of a difference. Maybe they\u2019ll just consider me as the person who arranged the blind date?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have any experience with such things?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cExperience with meeting prospective marriage partners.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only seventeen.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t prestigious families often arrange such meetings at a much younger age than that? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve read in romance novels.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t confuse fiction with reality.\u201d\u201cYou really haven\u2019t? As always, reality fails to live up to fiction,\u201d Melkith stopped mumbling and turned to face him. \u201cIn any case, there\u2019s no way you can come with me. Now that I\u2019m about to seduce the Spirit King of the Wind, what will I do if he sees that you\u2019re there as well and refuses to make a contract with me? Wouldn\u2019t that be impolite to the Spirit King?\u201d\u201cBut I also want to see the Wind Spirit King in person,\u201d Eugene complained.Melkith boasted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, once we\u2019ve signed a contract, I\u2019ll let you see him when I return Wynnyd.\u201dEugene nodded in agreement. Just as Melkith had said, it seemed unlikely that Tempest would appear if he was with her. To be honest, it was hard to understand her simile about it being like meeting with a prospective marriage partner and whatnot, but Tempest was already aware that Eugene was Hamel yet refused to answer his summons.\u2018That son of a bitch, he\u2019s definitely hiding something from me.\u2019When they had met four years ago, Tempest had claimed that he didn\u2019t know anything, but Eugene definitely couldn\u2019t trust those words.\u2018Although he might not know anything about the Oath of Peace, he should be aware of what happened before the fight with the Demon King of Incarceration.\u2019Eugene decided that he at least needed to ask Tempest about that.After Melkith left, the only ones left in the drawing-room were Eugene, Lovellian, and Ciel.Lovellian belatedly realized, \u201c...Ah, apologies for my late greeting, Miss Ciel. Hasn\u2019t it been four years since we last met?\u201dCiel smiled politely, \u201cYes, sir.\u201dWhen Eugene had seen her a few months ago, she had definitely been caught in the throes of puberty,\u00a0leading her to self-isolate in her room. But she seemed to have gotten over that phase as Ciel nodded at Lovellian with a bright smile.While looking at the seventeen-year-old Ciel, Lovellian keenly felt the passing of time. Although he had also felt this when he reunited with Eugene, children seemed to grow up very quickly these days. Ciel showed hardly any traces of the childishness he had felt from her four years ago.\u201cDid you say you\u2019ve come here to pick something out for Lady Ancilla\u2019s birthday?\u201d Lovellian asked.\u201cYes, sir. Oh, and every single one of the gifts you have sent me over the years, Sir Lovellian, is decorating my room beautifully,\u201d Ciel reported as she smiled charmingly.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve always enjoyed reading the letters of thanks you sent me, Miss Ciel. I had just been thinking that it was strange you haven\u2019t sent me one this year\u2026 perhaps you didn\u2019t like the gift I sent you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201dThough it had been an awkward question, Ciel just shook her head while maintaining a smile.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s embarrassing for me to admit this myself\u2026 since the beginning of this year, my personality has become sensitive in various ways. The gift you sent me was beautiful, but strangely I just didn\u2019t want to pick up a pen and write you a letter,\u201d Ciel explained.\u201cAh\u2026 I understand. At your age, young lady, the days for those things can come quite suddenly,\u201d Lovellian readily accepted her excuse without feeling offended.Lovellian had never had any children of his own, so he couldn\u2019t understand a father\u2019s grievances, but there had been several times when he was forced to listen to Gilead\u2019s sorrows of having to watch his only daughter go through puberty.\u201cAnd by this point, I felt it would be rude of me to write a letter and send it to you,\u201d Ciel continued. \u201cBut even so, I would feel sorry to have taken your gift for granted\u2026 especially since it feels like you won\u2019t be sending\u00a0me any more gifts from next year onwards.\u201dCiel smiled mischievously as she reached into her pocket. She pulled out what seemed to be a neatly wrapped gift box and said, \u201cSo I\u2019ve picked out a gift that I thought would suit you, Sir Lovellian. It isn\u2019t much, but I bought it after saving my allowance.\u201dLovellian sucked in a breath of surprise, \u201cOh\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease open it up quickly,\u201d Ciel urged with a soft smile.Lovellian felt an unfamiliar yet warm feeling deep in his heart. Was this why people got married and had children? He hadn\u2019t thought anything of the idea when he was listening to Gilead gush over how proud he was of his children, but now that he was receiving a gift like this, Lovellian felt like he was becoming overwhelmed with emotions.\u201cThis is\u2026,\u201d Lovellian\u2019s voice and eyes trembled when he opened the gift box.Inside the box was a tie pin with a neat design. As Ciel had said, it couldn\u2019t really be called anything amazing. It seemed well-crafted enough that it might be a bit expensive, but an item like this could easily be bought as long as you had the money.However, Lovellian sensed a sentiment that far exceeded the price of this gift. He had never received a gift like this before in his life\u2026.Ciel commented, \u201cAt first, I thought I should give you a gift that has something to do with magic since you are a wizard. However, after thinking about it some more, I felt that you would already have a lot of stuff like that.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Lovellian remained silent.\u201cBut then, after a lot of thought\u2026 I realized that you are always wearing robes. However, I thought that just because it\u2019s you, Sir Lovellian, there\u2019s no way that you will always be wearing robes\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be right back after I\u2019ve changed my clothes,\u201d Lovellian said as he leaped to his feet, interrupting Ciel, who immediately giggled and shook her head.\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do that. Instead of showing me how it looks on you right now, please wear it for my birthday party next year,\u201d Ciel requested.\u201cWhy do I need to wait until next year?\u201d Lovellian asked sulkily. He really wanted to try it on immediately.Hearing Lovellian plead in a trembling voice, Ciel continued speaking, \u201cBecause it\u2019s a gift that I gave you. Although I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll be attending my mother\u2019s birthday party, please don\u2019t wear it then either, and instead, wear it to my birthday party. That way, I\u2019ll be able to brag about it to Cyan and the other guests.\u201d\u2018Even after going through puberty, you\u2019re still as wicked as ever,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought with a grin as he glanced over at the smiling Ciel.Although Eugene was also quite confident in dealing with adults, he was absolutely sure he couldn\u2019t compete with Ciel in this.Lovellian gave in, \u201cUm\u2026 alright, I understand. Miss Ciel, by any chance, are there any gifts that you would like to receive next year?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be happy with anything you give me, Sir Lovellian. Ah, but please don\u2019t be too generous with any present you give me. My brother gets jealous.\u201dSo what if he gets jealous. Lovellian had no intention of paying any attention to that.Following the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony, he had sent a gift to the twins at the main estate every year, and like Ciel, Cyan had also sent him thank-you notes. However, Cyan\u2019s letters had always been so formulaic that even now, Lovellian couldn\u2019t\u00a0recall their contents if he tried.\u201c...Hmph,\u201d Lovellian came to his senses with a grunt after staring at the tie pin with a fascination for a bit.He looked up at the clock hanging on the drawing room\u2019s wall and smiled disappointedly.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ve been holding you two up for far too long,\u201d he apologized.\u201cPlease don\u2019t say such a thing,\u201d Ciel begged. \u201cReally, saying that you\u2019re the one holding us up\u2026. Instead, we should be the ones apologizing for stealing your precious time.\u201dHow was she able to speak in such a charming manner? Lovellian shook his head in amazement as he stood up.Lovellian waved off her apology, \u201cNo, not at all. I would much prefer to continue enjoying our chat a bit longer, Miss Ciel\u2026 but since you have affairs to see to, let\u2019s end our talk here.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m fine with staying a bit longer\u2026,\u201d Ciel trailed off hesitantly.\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I, too, must return to work,\u201d Lovellian admitted.In order to confirm the Knights of the Black Lion\u2019s claims, it looked like he would need to show his face at the council for once. Since Lovellian had said this, Ciel could no longer refuse him.Eugene slowly began, \u201c...If that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m also head\u2014\u201d\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going? You need to come with me,\u201d Ciel demanded.\u201cWhy should I do that?\u201d Eugene protested.\u201cBecause this is my first time in Aroth. As such, don\u2019t you think that you should show me around?\u201d Ciel pointed out.\u201cI\u2019d also appreciate it if you could do so, Eugene,\u201d Lovellian added.Having gotten his hands on the Cloak of Darkness, Eugene had hoped to go down to the laboratories to test its performance\u2026 but Lovellian had already added his support to Ciel\u2019s words. Eugene smoothed out his furrowed brows and helplessly nodded in agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In your eyes, it might look like I just tossed them into a corner, but in my eyes, all of them are in their proper places as decorations.\u201dWas that really the case? Eugene felt her claims were absurd, but he couldn\u2019t figure out how to refute Ciel\u2019s words. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like she had just crammed them out of sight, but could they really have been arranged as part of her decoration?\u201c...But I think they were covered in dust the last time I saw them?\u201d Eugene recalled hesitantly.Ciel insisted, \u201cThat\u2019s just because you weren\u2019t looking properly. Do you really think I\u2019d let my room get dusty? Something like that is impossible. If that really was the case, I'll immediately call my attendants and scold them as soon as I get back to the main estate.\u201d\u201cNow that I give it a second thought, it seems like there wasn\u2019t any dust.\u201d\u201cI guess it must have been a pretty memorable experience,\u201d Ciel smirked as she casually drew closer to Eugene.\u201cWhat was?\u201d he asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about you coming into my room,\u201d Ciel clarified suggestively. \u201cIt seems like it was so memorable that you can clearly remember every single thing that you saw there\u2014\u201dEugene interrupted her, \u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve always had a good memory. I even remember everything I saw when I last visited Cyan\u2019s room. Now that it\u2019s been brought up, when you see Cyan, tell him to get rid of the strange books that he\u2019s been hiding under his bed.\u201dCaught off guard, Ciel belatedly responded, \u201c...What?\u201d\u201cCyan still seems to believe that he\u2019s done such a great job hiding them so that no one else can find them. But it\u2019s not just me, even Nina knows that he\u2019s been collecting some pornography about women wearing strange bunny-eared headbands, ever since he was fifteen years old.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\u201cRight? Nina was distraught that someday, when Cyan becomes the Patriarch, he might change the maids' uniforms to include bunny-eared headbands and stockings of different colors.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass your words on to my mother.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s a little\u2026,\u201d Eugene's reply trailed off with a troubled expression.If the strict Ancilla got wind of it, it was clear that she would soon grab Cyan by the ear and scold him silly; but if that really happened, Cyan might just commit suicide out of shame.\u201cYou should just try and insinuate it to him,\u201d Eugene recommended.\u201cWhat should I say?\u201d Ciel asked, puzzled.\u201cJust say that you don\u2019t particularly like bunny ears,\u201d Eugene started striding off, having successfully changed the subject.After blinking her eyes in surprise at Eugene, Ciel quickly caught up with a hurried pace.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, what type of ears do you like?\u201d Ciel probed.Eugene eyed her warily, \u201cWhy would you ask something like that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve said that you don\u2019t particularly like bunny ears. If that\u2019s the case, what kind of ears\u00a0do\u00a0you like?\u201d\u201cSorry, but I just prefer ordinary ears. If you really think about it, don\u2019t you find it a bit weird and disturbing? If they have rabbit ears growing out from the tops of their heads, what on earth could there be in the places where ears usually go?\u201d\u201c...Couldn\u2019t it just be featureless?\u201d\u201cIf you saw something like that in real life, wouldn\u2019t you find it creepy?\u201d\u201c...If that\u2019s the case\u2026 what if they just have ordinary ears in the usual spots?\u201d\u201cThat means they would have both a pair of human ears and a pair of rabbit ears? Isn\u2019t that kind of disturbing as well?\u201d\u201c...Ah\u2026 ahem,\u201d Ciel hadn\u2019t expected such a reply. With a sour look, she cleared her throat and said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop with the useless talk and go pick out a present for my mother.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t even know what Lady Ancilla likes,\u201d Eugene complained.\u201cBut I do, so why should that matter? You just need to follow me.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to have me follow you, why ask me to act as your guide?\u201d\u201cYou really do lack any courtesy. Then do you want me to just wander around all on my own? You\u2019re going to abandon me in the capital of a foreign country, which I\u2019ve never been to in my life, a place I know nothing about?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by abandon\u2026.\u00a0After all, it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cEven if you say that, everyone knows you\u2019re supposed to be following me,\u201d Ciel warned him.\u201cThen I guess it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m sure that if I needlessly blow you off, I\u2019ll be hearing about this for ages,\u201d Eugene grumbled as he unclasped the Cloak of Darkness.Although it was still too early in the season to wear a cloak like this that was bristling with fur, thanks to the various spells imbued into the cape, he could avoid feeling the heat even if he was in a desert.\u201c...Come to think of it, it was your birthday last month,\u201d Ciel suddenly said.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cDid you do anything for your birthday? How about a party?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I was just reading books.\u201d\u201cBooks?\u201d\u201cInside the library of the Red Tower of Magic.\u201d\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have a party? And you didn\u2019t get any presents from anyone.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t get any. Although Head Wizard Lovellian and Miss Hera offered to get me some, I begged them not to because I would feel embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Hera?\u201d\u201cA wizard of the Red Tower of Magic.\u201d\u201cIs Hera a woman?\u201d\u201cHer name is Hera, so did you really think she would be a man?\u201d\u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d\u201cLike a wizard.\u201d\u201c...And what do you mean when you say she looks like a wizard?\u201d\u201cI meant it literally. She\u2019s always wearing robes, donning a tall hat, and holding a staff.\u201d\u201cWhat about her looks?\u201dJust as Eugene was feeling bothered about how to answer her question, he saw Hera walking down the other side of the street. She was hugging a large bag full of bread while breathing in the scent of the baguettes.\u201cThat\u2019s Hera over there,\u201d he pointed out.\u201cOh my, Sir Eugene!\u201d came an answering cry.Having just spotted Eugene, Hera smiled widely and waved her hand at him. In that brief moment, Ciel scanned Hera\u2019s appearance from head to toe. Then she smiled innocently as if what had just happened was an illusion and bowed deeply to Hera.\u201cI am Ciel of the Lionheart clan,\u201d she introduced herself.Hera exclaimed, \u201cWha\u2026! I-I am Hera Strillila from the Red Tower of Magic.\u201dHera was unable to immediately process the situation and glanced at Eugene for help.\u201c...She came along with the Knights of the Black Lion,\u201d Eugene explained.\u201cOh\u2026 for the Cloak of Darkness! It seems that the deal went through swiftly!\u201d\u201cYep. Originally I was planning to head down to the laboratories, but she kept begging me to go with her.\u201dHera felt Ciel\u2019s subtle gaze rest on her.\u201cAhem\u2026,\u201d she cleared her throat with a low cough and nodded in understanding, \u201cI hope you two have a good time.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Eugene made a confused noise.Hera didn\u2019t see any need to say anything further. With quick steps, she ducked around Eugene.After looking at Hera\u2019s back for a few moments, Ciel nodded and said, \u201cShe seems like a nice person.\u201dStill confused, Eugene hesitated, \u201cAh\u2026. You\u2019re right. She is a good person.\u201d\u201cIt might be because of the smell of her bread, but I\u2019m feeling hungry.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t we get something to eat first.\u201dAs Eugene resumed his paused stride, he glanced at Ciel and said, \u201cBut you, did you really come all the way to Aroth just to buy presents?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I was here to see you as well?\u201d Ciel reminded him.\u201cBut apart from that. I\u2019ve known you for four years. Did you really think that I couldn\u2019t read your reactions? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some huge secret. So what do you want to do with Lady Carmen?\u201d\u201cYou really do notice the strangest things.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just too obvious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of requesting her to take me as her squire,\u201d Ciel replied with a shrug of defeat. \u201cSince, in any case, my brother is going to become the Patriarch, and I have no desire for the position myself. Although it seems like Mother wants me to enter an arranged marriage\u2014\u201dFor a moment there, Ciel peeked at Eugene\u2019s expression. However, Eugene's face didn\u2019t show any changes.\u201d\u201c\u2014I hate the idea of arranged marriages. But I don\u2019t want to be locked up in the main estate either and forced to act like a lady,\u201d Ciel continued.\u201cSo that\u2019s why you want to join the Knights of the Black Lion?\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cAlthough I cannot join right now, I want to become Lady Carmen\u2019s squire and receive her personal guidance.\u201d\u201cAnd has Lady Carmen accepted your request?\u201d\u201cIf she truly didn\u2019t like me, then she wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to accompany her here. Although you might not be aware of it, Lady Carmen has been fond of me since I was a little girl,\u201d Ciel bragged with a smirk.Eugene recalled Carmen\u2019s stark-looking or rather pretending to be stark-looking, face.\u201c...That\u2019s good,\u201d he concluded.Ciel asked, \u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you looking for something you can do yourself, rather than just relying on the main family. How\u2019s Cyan doing?\u201d\u201cHe keeps talking about you. He also pulled me aside to talk about you before I left to come here.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cBut my brother asked me to keep it a secret\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re going to tell me anyway, so how secret can it be?\u201d\u201cHe wanted me to find out what Star of the White Flame Formula you\u2019ve reached.\u201d\u201cThe Third Star.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as before.\u201d\u201cWhat about Cyan?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s on the Second Star,\u201d Ciel revealed.\u201cWell, that means that he hasn\u2019t progressed either,\u201d Eugene replied with a grin.Unlike that hopeless Eward, it looked like the twins were working quite hard. Eugene was quite happy to see this. Cyan\u2019s inferiority complex was fuelling his training, and while still as wicked and manipulative as ever, Ciel didn\u2019t have a nasty personality that looked down on others.Only Eward had grown up to be a dog.[1]\u201c...Have you heard any news from our older brother?\u201d Eugene asked. \u201cI heard that he\u2019s gone back to his maternal relatives\u2019 house.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t know and don\u2019t care,\u201d Ciel spat out with a furrowed brow. \u201cAlthough my mother was very pleased to hear of Eward\u2019s fall from grace, it just pisses me off. It also put my brother in a bad mood.\u201dEugene pressed, \u201cBut you should have still heard some news, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019ve heard that Lady Tanis might be looking for a wizard to hire as a tutor,\u201d Ciel admitted.\u201cA tutor?\u201d Eugene repeated in confusion.\u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? Even though he did something so foolish, I guess they still want him to learn magic. Even though they should just let him do what he likes since he won\u2019t be able to become the Patriarch anyway,\u201d Ciel mumbled as she clung to Eugene\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s stop discussing such upsetting topics and get something to eat. Isn\u2019t there a good restaurant nearby?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of restaurants, but their food probably tastes worse than the main estate\u2019s cooking,\u201d Eugene warned her.\u201cThe taste doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ciel said with a roll of her eyes as she looked up at Eugene. \u201cIn the first place, when it comes to good food, it isn\u2019t just taste, but the atmosphere is also important.\u201d1. This feels like a reference to the Asian idiom, \u2018A lion does not give birth to a dog.\u2019 The idiom implies that the children of great people aren\u2019t ordinary either. Only in this case, Eward has failed to live up to this ideal, while the twins have been successful.\u00a0\u261cOpenbookworm's ThoughtsOBW: I think we\u2019ve all learned a little more about Cyan than we wanted to in this chapter.Yojj: I died laughing at that.

His meals back at the Red Tower of Magic were satisfying, since they had gotten used to him demanding large chunks of meat for his meals over the last few months, but a restaurant like this that prided itself on its atmosphere wouldn\u2019t serve the hunks of roasted meat that Eugene really desired.\u201cNow that your body\u2019s all grown up, do you really need to keep eating so barbarically?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cI could still be growing,\u201d Eugene argued.\u201cWhat will you do if you come to resemble Gargith by eating like that? I\u2019d really hate it if you grew that large.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d hate that as well. Who would even want that?\u201dWhile making an unpleasant expression, Eugene wiped his lips with a napkin. As the meat he had been served only came out in small portions due to the restaurant\u2019s rules on plating, a small mountain of empty dishes had piled up on Eugene\u2019s side of the table.On the other side of the table, the area in front of Ciel was clear. Eugene clicked his tongue when he saw she had only selected vegetables, apart from her disliked bell peppers and carrots.Eugene lectured her, \u201cIf you\u2019re that picky, of course, you won\u2019t grow up.\u201d\u201cWe can't be too sure about you, but I\u2019m already fully grown,\u201d Ciel refuted.\u201cAs long as you stop being so picky, I think you can grow a little more,\u201d advised Eugene.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be attractive for me to grow up too tall,\u201d\u00a0Ciel\u00a0said, getting up from her seat.Eugene glanced down at Ciel\u2019s slender forearms and shook his head in disapproval, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s always good to train your mana, physical workouts are equally as important. If you run out of mana in the middle of a fight, you\u2019ll be forced to rely solely on your body to\u2014\u201dCiel interrupted him, \u201cIt might be because you were hanging out with Gargith a while ago, but even the way you talk is starting to resemble him.\u201d\u201cTake that back,\u201d Eugene demanded.As Eugene expressed his instinctive disgust, Ciel stuck her tongue out and laughed.\u201cSo I heard something from father,\u201d Ciel changed the subject. \u201cDid you really use 300 million sals just to purchase giant testicles as a favor for Gargith?\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Eugene asked defensively.\u201cDid you really eat them together with him? I asked Hazard about it, but apparently, it\u2019s not just the giants; all beast testicles have a nourishing effect on the body. But no matter how healthy it is, how could you eat something like that?\u201d Ciel asked with a mix of curiosity and disgust.\u201cI didn\u2019t eat any,\u201d Eugene insisted.\u201cReally? Then Sir Gerhard will be happy.\u201d\u201cWhy would my father be happy?\u201d\u201cHe was pouting because you kept such a good thing all to yourself.\u201d\u2018Father, please,\u2019\u00a0Eugene groaned internally.Thankfully, Ciel changed the subject, \u201cIt\u2019s been over three months since you\u2019ve arrived in Aroth. So what have you been doing?\u201d\u201cReading books, learning magic,\u201d Eugene explained simply.\u201cApart from such obvious things,\u201d Ciel dismissed. \u201cHaven\u2019t you had any new and exciting experiences?\u201dEugene argued, \u201cLearning magic is a new and exciting experience.\u201d\u201cWhat about Akron?\u201d she asked.Though she had come here to buy Ancilla\u2019s present, once they were eating, Ciel decided to go for a walk around the outskirts of the floating station instead of heading down to the streets for shopping. As she asked her question, Ciel pointed to the lake that could be seen in the distance and at Abram, the royal palace.She continued, \u201cAfter all, not just anyone is allowed to go to a place like that. Do you\u00a0know how happy father and Sir Gerhard were when they heard the news about you being granted an entrance pass to Akron?\u201d\u201cWhat about Lady Ancilla?\u201d Eugene asked.\u201cOn the surface, my mother also acted like she was happy. But on the inside, she was feeling more complicated.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to feel complicated about? After all, I can\u2019t become the Patriarch anyway.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Ciel turned to look at Eugene with a grin. \u201cYou might not be able to become the Patriarch, but you\u2019re more suited to becoming the Patriarch than any of us siblings.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just because I\u2019m so talented,\u201d Eugene retorted shamelessly.\u201cBeing too talented is also a flaw. Wouldn't it be better for you to show something of a weak point somewhere?\u201d Ciel suggested.\u201cI\u2019ll just say this outright because I\u2019m having difficulty understanding you, but Ciel, did you come all the way here just to warn me right now?\u201d Eugene said with a similar smile to Ciel\u2019s.This smile caused Ciel\u2019s eyes to waver slightly. Over the four years that they had lived together, she had seen Eugene smiling more than a few times.But now, he had a different look in his eyes from those other times. Eugene was staring right at her as if he could see right through her. His eyes made Ciel recall when she had first met Eugene four years ago \u2014 back when he had accepted the challenge to a duel. Eugene had glared at Cyan with eyes just like that.\u201c...A warning, as if,\u201d Ciel lightly shrugged the accusation off and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m also feeling a little unsettled due to the recent events. Cyan has always wanted to become the Patriarch. So this situation has turned out to be very good for my brother. Because of your actions, Eward and Lady Tanis were forced to leave the main estate.\u201d\u201cIf so, then they should thank me,\u201d Eugene prompted sarcastically.\u201cMother should be feeling grateful to you. But my brother\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019ll just resent this,\u201d Ciel revealed.Eugene confessed, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m quite fond of Cyan. His strong self-esteem actually reminds me of someone.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Ciel asked curiously.\u201cJust some guy whose self-esteem seemed overinflated compared to his actual abilities,\u201d Eugene muttered as he walked past Ciel.\u00a0\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. Even though you\u2019re always nagging your brother, you really do love him, and even though you resent Lady Ancilla, you\u2019re still worried about her.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Ciel remained silent.Eugene reassured her, \u201cI have no intention of becoming the Patriarch. I don\u2019t want to be the Patriarch; even if someone told me to, I wouldn\u2019t do it. For the rest of my life, I won\u2019t take any actions to become the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just say something like that so easily,\u201d Ciel complained.\u201cThen what do you think?\u201d Eugene turned to Ciel and asked. \u201cWhat would you do if I someday changed my mind and said that I wanted to be the Patriarch?\u201d\u201c...Cyan would probably accept it,\u201d Ciel admitted hesitantly.\u201cAnd you?\u201d Eugene asked.Ciel avoided the question, \u201cMy father\u2026 would also accept you. Uncle Gion and the rest of the main family members would do so as well. If you said that you were determined to do it, they would have no choice but to accept you. Because the gap between you and Cyan is just too great.\u201dEugene repeated, \u201cI asked you, what would\u00a0you\u00a0do?\u201d\u201c...I would also accept it,\u201d Ciel mumbled through pursed lips. \u201c...Though I wouldn't really feel comfortable with it. Because my mother would absolutely never accept you.\u201d\u201cSee that,\u201d Eugene laughed as he leaned his back against a railing. \u201cIf I say that I will be the next Patriarch, someone will end up being upset. That\u2019s unavoidable. Because no matter how talented I am, I\u2019m not an heir of the direct line.\u201d\u201c...Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re giving up for the sake of my mother?\u201d\u201cThere are several reasons why I\u2019ve given up on it. Even if you twins and the knights serving the main family accept me as the next Patriarch, the Council of Elders won\u2019t accept me. Wouldn\u2019t that be the first and most difficult challenge I\u2019d face?\u201dCiel couldn\u2019t find anything to say to refute him, \u201c....\u201dEugene continued, \u201cThat alone would be annoying enough, but I truly don\u2019t want to become the Patriarch. Why would I even want to? Becoming the next Patriarch of the Lionheart\u2019s direct line, what\u2019s so amazing about doing that?\u201d\u201c...Aren\u2019t there a lot of amazing perks?\u201d\u201cEven if I don\u2019t become the Patriarch, I have the confidence that I\u2019ll always receive the best kind of treatment no matter where I go.\u201d\u201cYou really are an annoying bastard.\u201d\u201cBut did I say anything untrue? Let\u2019s just look at the facts,\u201d with a snicker, Eugene raised a finger in front of Ciel. \u201cFirstly, I\u2019m from a collateral bloodline. But at the age of thirteen, I was the first in the history of the Lionheart clan to defeat members of the main family in the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. In addition, I received the unprecedented reward of being adopted into the main family, and I was even granted ownership of the Storm Sword Wynnyd.\u201cAt that age, I could initiate my mana on my first try, and I also inherited the White Flame Formula. And now? My progress in the White Flame Formula is higher than Cyan\u2019s, who first started practicing the formula several years before me. Even though there are people in the history of the Lionheart clan who could reach the Third Star before becoming adults, none of them managed to reach the Third Star when they were only seventeen like I did.\u201dCiel warned him, \u201cYou really are starting to annoy me.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s not all. After only learning magic through self-study for a month, I was able to cast my first spell, and now that three months have passed, I\u2019ve received permission to enter the Royal Library, Akron. When I\u2019m this talented, do I really need to turn my eye to the seat of the Patriarch?\u201d\u201cFine. You win. You really are so talented, you annoying bastard.\u201dHaving listened to each point one by one, Ciel couldn\u2019t help but think that Eugene really was a monster. As she looked at Eugene\u2019s slyly grinning gaze,\u00a0Ciel shook her head in frustration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mother wants me to marry you.\u201d\u201cHow awful.\u201dCiel\u2019s eyebrows twitched at Eugene\u2019s immediate reply.\u201cWhat\u2019s so terrible about it?\u201d she growled.\u201cYou and I are family, siblings at that,\u201d Eugene pointed out.Ciel complained, \u201cBut you\u2019ve never once called me big sis.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re the same age, so who do you think you\u2019re calling a little brother?\u201d Eugene argued. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to repeat the same nonsense that you spouted when you were thirteen, are you? About how you\u2019re the older sister just because you were born a few months earlier?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been telling you to call me big sister for the past four years. If you\u2019ve been forced to hear me say it this much, can\u2019t you at least pretend to let me win just once and call me big sis?\u201d\u201cWhy should I pretend to lose when I\u2019m always winning? If you really want to hear me call you \u2018big sis,\u2019 then why don\u2019t we have a spar for it. I know you\u2019ve been studying diligently under Gion and the Patriarch, even while you were holed up in your room.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring up things from the past.\u201d\u201cIf someone could hear you say that, they\u2019d think it happened long ago. Sorry, but the last time I saw you\u00a0acting like you\u2019ve got leprosy\u00a0because you were going through puberty was only three months ago.\u201d\u201cPuberty usually starts suddenly and stops suddenly. That\u2019s how it was for Cyan as well.\u201d\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the case for me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s because you\u2019re the weird one,\u201d Ciel humphed without retracting her pouting lips.From the twin\u2019s perspective, it was clear that Eugene was the strange one. Even though they were the same age, his skills were far superior, and then he didn\u2019t even seem to go through puberty like they did.\u2018So what about puberty? If I started complaining about puberty, at my real age, that would just be a sign of dementia,\u2019\u00a0Eugene thought secretly.Ciel didn\u2019t even want to think about how hard puberty had hit her just a few months ago. Like she had just said, her puberty came onto her suddenly. For some reason, she had started to dislike how she looked in the mirror, and her moods would feel off for no reason. Her body odor, which she had never found unpleasant since she was born, was suddenly offensive to her\u2026.But then it was suddenly over. Ever since Eugene had left for Aroth, the things that had been strangely bothering her didn\u2019t feel so bothersome any longer.Ciel spoke up, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Eugene asked.Hesitantly, she began, \u201cWell, back then, when I was going through puberty\u2014\u201d\u201cYou are talking about a few months ago, right?\u201d he interrupted teasingly.\u201c...That was\u00a0long\u00a0ago,\u201d Ciel insisted with a glare.Eugene returned to the topic, \u201cWhatever. What about back then?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you smell something strange coming from me?\u201d Ciel asked shyly.\u201cI didn\u2019t smell anything, though? In the first place, you didn\u2019t even want to come out of your room because you were afraid of\u00a0giving off any body odor,\u201d Eugene pointed out.\u201c...How about now?\u201d\u201cI can smell a slight scent of perfume.\u201d\u201cWhat about the smell of sweat?\u201d\u201cWith how refreshing this breeze is, why would you even be sweating? Hey, stop paying attention to such strange things. So what if people smell of sweat? It happens.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that I do smell of sweat?\u201d\u201cI already said that you don\u2019t. If you\u2019re really worried about that, you should try meeting with Gargith.\u201d\u201cWhy should I meet with that pig?\u201d\u201cBecause if you meet with him, you\u2019ll come to think that the smell coming from your own body isn\u2019t the smell of sweat, but instead the sweet scent of flowers,\u201d having spat out such a claim, Eugene started to walk off once more.After standing there silently for a few moments, Ciel followed behind Eugene, the corners of her mouth twitching as she tried to hide a smile.\u201cSo now you\u2019re saying that I smell of flowers?\u201d Ciel asked, acting purposefully obtuse.\u201cEven though your body has grown up, it looks like your brain hasn\u2019t,[1]\u201d Eugene observed.\u201cI\u00a0did spray on\u00a0some rose-scented perfume,\u201d Ciel revealed.Eugene just said, \u201cI prefer the smell of soap over the smell of flowers.\u201cYou sound like an old man.\u201dCiel\u2019s careless teasing pierced his heart deeply. Eugene coughed and, after recovering, gestured to the downtown area below the flying station.\u201c...So when are we going to buy the present?\u201d he asked.\u201cI wanted to keep looking around, but\u2026. Hm\u2026.\u201d Ciel trailed off without finishing her sentence as she checked her wristwatch. \u201c...Our appointed meeting time is at five o\u2019clock.\u201dEugene asked, \u201cWhere are you meeting back up?\u201d\u201cIn front of the warp gate.\u201d\u201cAre you really heading back today?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already finished signing the contract for Wynnyd. And because the issue with the black wizard was dealt with before we even arrived\u2026 it was decided that we would return right away after picking up some new recruits.\u201d\u201cWeren\u2019t you returning to the main estate?\u201d\u201cNope. We\u2019re going to Uklas Mountain. Do you know where that is?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s in the southern portion of the Kiehl Empire.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where the Knights of the Black Lion are based.\u201d\u201cBut you haven\u2019t entered the Knights of the Black Lion just yet, have you?\u201d\u201cIt was decided that I would take a simple test from Lady Carmen. Do you want to go there together?\u201dHer trying to hook him into doing something without giving him any warning reminded Eugene of back when they were both thirteen.Eugene questioned, \u201cWhy would I want to go there?\u201d\u201cLady Carmen is actually more interested in you than she is in me,\u201d Ciel explained.\u201cInterested? In me? Why?\u201d\u201cWhy ask when you already gave the explanation with your own mouth earlier? Because you\u2019re so talented. But even though you\u2019re that talented, you can\u2019t become the Patriarch. Isn\u2019t it obvious that the Knights of the Black Lion would be interested in someone like you?\u201dIt certainly was obvious. To be honest, Eugene couldn\u2019t help but feel interested in Ciel\u2019s offer. After all, the Knights of the Black Lion were the Lionheart clan\u2019s strongest force.Regretfully, he could only say, \u201cPlease tell her not to act on her interest for now and save it for later.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ciel asked.\u201cCurrently, I\u2019m having far more fun learning magic.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of wizards in the Knights of the Black Lion as well. Like Fargo, who came with us today, he\u2019s at the Fifth Circle.\u201d\u201cBut Crown Prince Honein, over there in the Royal Palace, reached the Fifth Circle when he was only twenty-three years old.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just because he\u2019s the Crown Prince of Aroth.\u201d\u201cAnyways, I won\u2019t go with you right now.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more helpful to use the time you\u2019ve spent learning magic to train the White Flame Formula?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still training with the White Flame Formula even as I learn magic.\u201dThis was the truth. Since Eugene had arrived in Aroth, he hadn\u2019t missed a single day of training with the White Flame Formula.\u201cIf you promised to meet up at 5 o\u2019clock, there are only a few hours left,\u201d Eugene reminded Ciel. \u201cDon\u2019t you need to pick a present?\u201dCiel dismissed his concerns, \u201cIf it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve personally chosen, Mother will be happy with whatever it is, so it\u2019s fine if we take our time.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to play it, why come all the way to Aroth just to buy a present for her?\u201d\u201cYou already heard me say it earlier, so why do you even keep asking?\u201dCiel giggled and clung to Eugene\u2019s arm as she cutely confessed, \u201cI\u2019m here because I wanted to see you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, so get off me,\u201d Eugene attempted to shake her off.\u201cPicking a present for my mother won\u2019t even take me thirty minutes. That means we need to use our time more efficiently. Don\u2019t you know any places where we can go and visit?\u201d\u201cWould you like to see me perform some magic?\u201d\u201cI feel like that won\u2019t be any fun just watching. So where\u2026. Oh, that\u2019s right. They did say the night view in Aroth is famous. Although I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get to see it today\u2026. Why don\u2019t we go and take a look at the Wise Sienna\u2019s mansion?\u201d\u201cI did that on my first day here.\u201d\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen it with me.\u201dEugene was dragged along by his arm.* * *\u201cSince he said that he doesn\u2019t know anymore, then it can\u2019t be helped,\u201d a cold voice declared.They were in an underground prison cell.The smell of blood mixed with the scent of cigarettes was coming from where Carmen had been leaning back against the wall. She finally threw the cigar she had been chewing on onto the floor.They were here for Gavid, the black wizard who had been a member of the Wizards Guild. Among the many people who had been caught in the drug den on Bolero Street, those who could be killed were already dead, and those who shouldn\u2019t be killed were imprisoned.Gavid was someone who would usually be killed without consequences. He wasn\u2019t a member of the Black Tower of Magic, and even in the Wizards Guild, he was nothing more than a trivial black wizard of no significant strength who drifted around the night streets of Aroth.Nevertheless, Gavid hadn\u2019t died and had remained alive until now.And today, he was finally being executed.But before that, he had first been tortured. There had been no need for Carmen to come forward to do this task personally. Naishon, the commander of the Third Division, was good with spears, but he was also skilled in torture. Most of the Lionheart\u2019s Knights of the Black Lion were like that. Their fangs and claws weren\u2019t just good at biting and tearing their enemies from the front.Gavid was the one who had arranged the contract for Eward Lionheart. From what he had told them, the two had become friends through meeting at the succubi\u2019s shop on Bolero Street. Their friendship had started at the beginning of this year, and Gavid claimed that he would always hang out with Eward when Bolero\u00a0Street opened once a month.1. This is a reference to their first meeting when Eugene criticized her for having a rose-tinted view of the world, and Ciel mistook it as a compliment.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He must have had his sense of fear surgically removed, or he could just be crazy.\u201d[1]\u201cHe was probably just desperate,\u201d the reply came from outside the prison cell. \u201cHe first started practicing black magic dozens of years ago, but had found little success. If he grew old and died just like that, his soul would become the property of the demonfolk he was contracted to, and he wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to reincarnate.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Carmen stayed silent.The speaker continued, \u201cAs such, he felt like he had to try something. Even if he ran into a problem and it ended up getting him into trouble, he probably believed that he could get out of trouble with the \u2018strength\u2019 that he would have gained for selling the Lionheart clan\u2019s eldest heir.\u201dGavid had admitted as much. Throughout his torture, he had screamed that he had done this solely for his own greed.Carmen finally responded, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Noir Giabella claims she wasn't involved in this.\u201d\u201cAlthough that might be the case, Duchess Giabella would surely have bestowed a reward had the incubus managed to successfully catch the Lionheart\u2019s eldest heir, and she certainly wouldn\u2019t have punished him,\u201d the voice opined.\u201cAnd you?\u201d Carmen demanded.\u201cI\u2019m not sure why the target of your questions always comes back to me,\u201d Balzac, the one standing outside the cell, shrugged. \u201cEspecially since I believe I have cooperated with you at every step in this affair, and I\u2019ve shown you more than enough apologies and respect.\u201d\u201cRather than believe that such an insignificant black wizard could be behind this plot, it would make more sense to suspect that you\u2019re the one who masterminded it,\u201d Carmen gave her reasoning.\u201cAh. Although I understand why you would think that if that were the case, what would I gain from allowing this?\u201d Balzac asked, pointing to Gavid\u2019s dismembered corpse. \u201cIf I was the one to have planned this\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have allowed the risk of someone picking up my trail. I would have arranged things so thoroughly that no one would be able to make a connection back to me. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201cThis incident was extremely clumsy. To think that they chose a drug den in the middle of Bolero street as the site of their ritual. Plus, their guards were so weak that they didn\u2019t even notice a seventeen-year-old was following them, nor were they able to prevent his interference. Haha\u2026 even if I tried my best, I couldn\u2019t pretend such ineptitude.\u201d\u201cWhat if they were meant to be caught, to throw off the trail?\u201d Carmen supposed.\u201cAre you saying they\u2019re my subordinates? What reason would I have to cut off my own flesh like that?\u201d Balaz chuckled, and with a snap of his fingers, a flame was lit on the end of the cigar that Carmen was currently biting. \u201cSir Carmen,[2]\u00a0I happen to have a lot of enemies.\u201dCarmen waited for him to get to his point, \u201c....\u201d\u201cI serve the Demon King of Incarceration, and I am grateful to him for placing a lot of trust and love on me. But thanks to that, many people in Helmuth don\u2019t like how much of his favor I receive.\u201d\u201cLike Edmond Codreth?\u201d\u201cOf course, he must also think of me as a hindrance. Amelia Merwin shouldn\u2019t like me very much either.\u201dIn this era, there were only three black wizards who had personally made contracts with the Demon King of Incarceration:An Earl of Helmuth and current owner of Vladmir, Edmund Codreth.Aroth\u2019s Black Tower Master, Balzac Ludbeth.The Dungeon Master of Nahama Desert, Amelia Merwin.\u201cOf course, apart from those two, there are a lot of \u2018demonfolk\u2019 who dislike me. In my opinion, one of them may have\u2026 sought to disgrace me by using this as a pretense,\u201d Balzac conveyed his suspicions.\u201cBut you don\u2019t have any evidence,\u201d Carmen pointed out.\u201cThere\u2019s also no evidence for me being responsible for this incident. Really now, how many times over the past few days have I said that I had nothing to do with it\u2026.\u201d Balzac trailed off with a chuckle as he shook his head. \u201cBy the way, Sir Carmen, surely I\u2019m not the only suspect that you have?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re free to spit out whatever you\u2019ve got brewing in that head of yours,\u201d Carmen straightened up, no longer leaning back against the wall, and glared at Balzac. \u201cHowever, with that freedom comes responsibility. Are you willing to take responsibility for your words?\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t have any other suspects?\u201d Balzac pushed his glasses up with a sly smile. \u201cAs a faithful servant of the Demon Lord of Incarceration, just as he wishes to get along with the Lionheart clan, so do I. That is why I bowed my head in apology, cooperated with your investigation, and showed you my respect. However, I am only human, so\u2026 I can\u2019t fully suppress this feeling of injustice piercing deep into my chest like an awl.\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Carmen stayed stonily silent.\u201cI am Balzac Ludbeth. Aroth\u2019s Black Tower Master. Servant of the Demon Lord of Incarceration. Although I understand why you would refuse to show me any respect\u2026 in the face of such excessive insults\u2026 even if it\u2019s for the sake of the Demon Lord of Incarceration and myself, I won\u2019t be able to show such inexhaustible consideration,\u201d Balzac stated as his pupils grew darker.Naishon and Fargo, who were both inside the cell with Carmen, stepped forward to block the front of the cell with hardened faces. Gion also placed his hand on the sword at his waist as he watched the situation from further inside the cell with narrowed eyes.\u201c...I really have no desire to cause even more discourtesy as a visitor to this foreign kingdom,\u201d Carmen sighed eventually.\u201cIf that is what you desire, I\u2019ll do my best so that no one feels that your actions are disrespectful,\u201d Balzac offered.\u201cBut to do that, your neck must first remain attached to the rest of your body.\u201dBalzac didn\u2019t respond to this blatant threat and just smiled. But Balzac\u2019s shadow, which was cast on the cell wall, began to waver. Carmen had been staring at him coldly, but she eventually shrugged and shook her head.Carmen changed the subject, \u201cThen it looks like I\u2019ll just have to keep thinking about it.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d Balzac asked.\u201cAbout who in the Lionheart clan wishes to harm the prestige of the main family,\u201d Carmen said, appearing to have ruled out Balzac as a suspect.The Lionheart clan was far too large. For the past three hundred years, except for the direct line of succession from Patriarch to Patriarch, all other members of the main family were forced to become independent and found their own collateral branches. And no limit was imposed on the number of collateral lines that could exist.Among these countless collateral descendants, there were definitely a few who harbored enmity towards the main family.\u201cIt was just a hunch,\u201d Carmen admitted without apology. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find out anything with torture or with mind magic. It was all too clean. That's why I suspected you.\u201d\u201cOh my, then it looks like I went too far with my words,\u201d Balzac stated embarrassedly.They\u2019d been left thoroughly in the dark, without any clues on where to pick up the trail.Hesitantly Balzac said, \u201cI must add that what I\u2019m about to talk next isn\u2019t all that \u2018clean.\u2019 And there\u2019s no reason you would trust me with this.\u201d\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Carmen conceded.\u201cIf you need help, then I can offer you my power. Should you wish for it, that is\u2026. Oh, that\u2019s right. Gavid\u2019s soul hasn\u2019t left this place yet\u2026 shall I summon it for you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to see any of your foul magic, and I really don\u2019t want your help with the investigation since you might be able to pull something off on us in the process.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat about Olpher\u2019s head?\u201d\u201cI can show it to you, but it isn\u2019t an enjoyable sight.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already seen a lot of cruel and terrible things. Like this sight right in front of me.\u201dDespite saying this, Carmen\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t stray to Gavid\u2019s corpse. Instead, her narrowed eyes were fixed on Balzac. In her opinion, the cruelest and terrible thing here wasn\u2019t the corpse that had died from torture but the living black wizard.\u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel,\u201d Balzac shrugged.Balzac snapped his fingers, and the shadow attached to him slowly rose off the floor. The shadow was holding out the decapitated head of a handsome incubus in its black hand.\u201cHis soul was harvested by the Demon King of Incarceration. If you like, I can also request that it be offered to you,\u201d Balzac said.Carmen rejected the offer, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201dWith a smirk, Balzac laid the head of Eoin Olpher down on the cell's floor. Carmen immediately kicked the offered head.Crack!Eoin Olpher\u2019s head hit the bars of the cell and shattered into pieces. Standing behind those bars, Balzac had his face and clothes splattered with blood, bones, and bits of brains, but his smile didn\u2019t even shake.\u201cLet\u2019s head back,\u201d Carmen ordered, wiping down the jacket slung over her shoulders as she emerged from the cell. Standing in front of Balzac, she warned him, \u201c...I\u2019m telling you this just in case. Eugene Lionheart. We are leaving him in the care of the Red Tower of Magic. If you even come into contact with him\u2014\u201d\u201cThe only one who can command my actions and desires is the Demon King of Incarceration,\u201d Balzac interjected before Carmen could finish speaking. As his fingertips gently pulled off his glasses which had been spattered with blood, he turned away and said, \u201cSir Carmen, you have no power over me.\u201d1. Originally, Carmen says that he must have had his liver extracted from his stomach. In Korean, the liver is the organ that governs fear instead of, say, the heart. If your liver is trembling, that means you\u2019re afraid.\u00a0\u261c2. Carmen is being referred to with the knightly Sir.\u00a0\u261cOpenbookworm's ThoughtsOBW: This was a fun chapter.

Not only had he heard the rumors surrounding them, but he had also met a few of them. While still in his youth, he had given up on competing for the seat of the Patriarch and had instead wandered the world. During his travels, he had once stayed at Black Lion Castle, which was found in the depths of Mouth Uklas.\u2018They\u2019re definitely\u2026 necessary.\u2019The Lionheart clan was one of the most prestigious families on the entire continent. Not only that, by maintaining its bizarre tradition, it had greatly increased its size, and at the center of this gigantic Lionheart clan stood the main family. To keep this position, the main family couldn\u2019t help but require people dedicated to doing rough and dirty work.The Lionheart clan wasn\u2019t the only one that raised these kinds of \u2018hunting hounds.\u2019\u2018...But Ciel.\u2019Gion didn\u2019t feel any qualms about becoming a member of the Knights of the Black Lion. This was something he had decided on for himself, and he wanted to help his brother, the Patriarch, even if it meant stepping into the darkness. Moreover, since Gilead\u2019s ambition went against the strict adherence to tradition that the Council insisted on, by becoming a Black Lion, Gion hoped to serve as a bridge between the Council and the main family.Whether it was dirty or cruel jobs, tasks that might get blood on his hands, Gion would do whatever it took if he was required to do these sorts of things. It wasn\u2019t for the sake of the Lionheart clan but for the sake of his brother, the Patriarch, and also his family.Gion believed it was enough for him to be the only one to take on such a role. As for Ciel, that little niece of his, he didn\u2019t want her to set foot into this kind of business. He wasn\u2019t sure what Ciel desired for herself, but as for Gion\u2026 he wanted his niece, who had been following him around and calling him uncle since she was a snot-nosed toddler, to live a peaceful life free from the scent of blood.It wasn\u2019t just Ciel. Cyan, Eugene\u2026 and Eward as well. Gion hadn\u2019t gotten married nor had children and saw each of his nephews and niece as one of his own.\u2018...Eward. Why on earth would you turn to black magic\u2026?\u2019\u201cGion,\u201d a voice called out.While he was in the middle of thinking such bitter thoughts, Carmen suddenly spoke up as she walked in front of him.\u201cDo you regret joining the Knights of the Black Lion?\u201d she asked him.\u201c...How could I? It\u2019s not like that, Lady Carmen,\u201d Gion replied with a wry smile.Just like how Gion had been looking after Gilead\u2019s children since they were young, Carmen had also watched over Gion\u2019s childhood. Just a few decades ago, Carmen had still been living at the main estate while a young Gion had trailed after her while calling her his aunt.His wanderlust was also something that he had caught from Carmen.\u201cThis kind of work doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAlthough you should already be well aware of this.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Gion acknowledged the reminder.Tasks that required someone on a captain\u2019s level to attend to them personally were uncommon. Most of the champions who led the Knights of the Black Lion rarely left Black Lion Castle.The current issue of the Patriarch\u2019s eldest son attempting to learn black magic was serious enough that it required a captain of the Knights of the Black Lion to make a move.\u201cSo, what do you think the truth of this matter is?\u201d Carmen asked for his opinion.Gion hesitantly admitted, \u201c...It feels like the Black Tower Master wasn\u2019t involved. Instead, it appears to be as he said\u2026 someone on the sidelines is attempting to stir up strife.\u201d\u201cAmelia Merwin,\u201d Carmen abruptly spat out the name. \u201cI suspect that it\u2019s her. She\u2019s also someone who wants to keep Balzac Ludbeth in check. The Demon King of Incarceration isn\u2019t known for suppressing the free will of the black wizards he contracted with. He also doesn\u2019t interfere with every one of his subordinates\u2019 squabbles.\u201d\u201cIf Amelia was the mastermind of this plot, wouldn\u2019t that mean that Nahama is behind this?\u201d\u201cLately, Nahama\u2019s movements have been suspicious. Sultan Alabur is a young piglet with a lot of ambition. He\u2019ll probably declare war within the next few years.\u201dWar \u2014 this word caused Gion\u2019s eyes to grow cold. The Desert Kingdom of Nahama had long aspired to be called an empire.Gion questioned, \u201cAre you saying they\u2019ll go to war with Kiehl?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll probably hit Turas first,\u201d Carmen corrected him.The Kiehl Empire shared a border with Nahama. The relationship between the two countries wasn\u2019t hostile, but Nahama frequently quarreled with its western neighbor, the Kingdom of Turas.\u201cEven though they probably don\u2019t have a casus belli?\u201d Gion asked curiously.\u201cIf they need a casus belli, they can just somehow create one. But if Nahama attacks Turas, Kiehl will also need to prepare for war. Of course, as part of these \u2018preparations,\u2019 the Lionheart clan will also be called up,\u201d Carmen speculated.\u201cSo preempting that, Amelia made the first move to create division within the Lionheart clan. Is that what you think?\u201d\u201cEven if this doesn\u2019t lead to any division, it\u2019s planted a seed for it. In any case, like what the late Gavid confessed, it might just be a crime of impulse without any conspiracy behind it. However\u2026 we can't be sure of that. That\u2019s why we need to be suspicious.\u201d Carmen narrowed her eyes and continued, \u201cI heard that Eward doesn\u2019t even know anything about Gavid. When I saw him in his childhood, I thought Eward seemed pretty smart. Could it be that the Patriarch doesn\u2019t have the qualifications to teach his own children?\u201dGion sighed, \u201c...He just wanted to believe in his children.\u201d\u201cA whip for the horse, a bridle for a donkey, and a rod for the back of fools.\u00a0Though it\u2019s pointless to say such things now that it\u2019s come to this. Instead of the eldest heir, Eward, it looks like the next Patriarch will be Cyan,\u201d having said this, Carmen turned to look at the prison they had just left. \u201c...Gion. Hypothetically, what would have happened if we hadn\u2019t overlooked Balzac\u2019s provocation back there?\u201d\u201cIt would have caused quite the crisis,\u201d Gion dutifully concluded.\u201cDon\u2019t point out something so obvious. I\u2019m asking if we could have killed him?\u201d\u201c...I don\u2019t think what he said was an insult deserving of death. From the perspective of the Black Tower Master, he also had reason to feel upset. But\u2026 if we had to fight him, apart from you, the rest of us would have died in there.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being too modest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that good at fighting with wizards,\u201d Gion replied with an awkward smile.\u201cJust like you, I also lacked enough confidence. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get into a fight,\u201d Carmen admitted with a click of her tongue as she pulled out her pocket watch.It was slowly getting closer to the time when they had arranged to meet. Gion recalled Ciel, whom he had told to meet with them back in front of the warp gate.\u201c...Are we really going to take Ciel back with us to Black Lion Castle?\u201d Gion asked reluctantly.Carmen simply pointed out, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the child wants?\u201d\u201c...,\u201d Gion couldn\u2019t argue with that.\u201cDon\u2019t overly smother a child who has already grown up so much.\u201dThere was a short silence. Then Gion shook his head to cast off these complicated feelings.\u201cAbout Eugene Lionheart, what do you think of him?\u201d Carmen suddenly brought up this question.However, Gion immediately replied without any surprise, \u201cI\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve already heard all about him.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve heard about him. Four years ago, when the Patriarch said he would take in that child as an adopted son, and when Gilead said he would open the main family\u2019s treasure vault to him, do you know just how noisy the Council got?\u201d Carmen demanded.\u201cIt certainly must have been a headache,\u201d Gion sympathized.Carmen complained, \u201cThe Council had already been in an uproar due to the Bloodline Continuation Ceremony. Because the outcome was unprecedented.\u201d\u201cBut it was worth it,\u201d Gion stated with satisfaction.In Gion\u2019s view, Eugene was an outrageous monster.For the past four years, Gion had taught him various combat techniques based on his swordsmanship, but\u2026 to be honest, Gion couldn\u2019t be sure if he had really taught Eugene anything.\u2018It was like he already knew how to do everything.\u2019According to Gion\u2019s intuition, what made Eugene truly great wasn\u2019t his mana sensitivity or his quick progress in the White Flame Formula.His true talent was that no matter what weapon he held in his hand, Eugene could wield it skillfully. Not just at the level of being a proficient wielder, but with the skill of a true master. His techniques did not resemble those passed down by a prestigious family and instead pursued practicality above all else.Eugene couldn\u2019t have learned such a style from anyone else. No masters of such skill existed in Gidol, Eugene\u2019s hometown. Could it be that Gerhard was really hiding his power? But something like that was absurd.Everything that Eugene had was something he had honed by himself. He had an instinct for battle that was unbelievable for someone of his age.Gion had also\u00a0sparred\u00a0with Eugene several times. Without drawing on their mana, they had contested purely in terms of skill. Yet Gion had never once felt like he could overwhelm Eugene. No, instead, there were several times when he felt like he was being carried along by Eugene\u2019s rhythm.But that was\u2026 something he couldn\u2019t accept, nor did he want to accept. To be carried along by Eugene\u2019s rhythm? That meant\u2026 that instead of Gion, it was the much younger Eugene who was overwhelming him in terms of technique.\u201cIf only that child wasn\u2019t from a collateral line, everyone would have supported him becoming the next Patriarch,\u201d Carmen\u2019s words weren\u2019t simply meant to evaluate Eugene.Gion felt the blatant inquiry hidden in her gaze and responded, \u201c...That child has no desire to become the Patriarch. In a way, he resembles both myself and you, Lady Carmen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If that\u2019s the case, shall I invite him to join the Knights of\u00a0the Black Lion?\u201d\u201cHadn\u2019t you already decided to do that?\u201d\u201cI intended to respect that child\u2019s resolve. It also feels a little too early to invite him right now. After all, isn\u2019t he still in the middle of growing up? In my personal opinion, he really doesn\u2019t need to learn magic, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s wasting his time by learning magic, right?\u201d Gion asked optimistically.Carmen gave a cold reminder, \u201cThat\u2019s as long as it doesn\u2019t cause him to drift from his path.\u201dGion recalled\u00a0Eward.\u00a0Could that child really have\u2026 attempted to learn black magic? Gion had yet to accept such a fact. Carmen glanced over at Gion\u2019s troubled face.\u201c...Eward will be placed under surveillance,\u201d she said eventually.Gion remained silent, \u201c....\u201d\u201cWe have already dispatched one of our Black Lions to Tanis\u2019 relatives. Since he\u2019s the eldest son of the main family, Eward will be spared having his throat cut, but there will be no next time. Eward will live under surveillance for the rest of his life. And of course, his right of succession will be stripped from him.\u201dHe wanted to live freely.Gion heard that was what Eward had said. However, no matter how much Eward wished for this, he would remain under guard for the rest of his life.Carmen revealed, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that Tanis is looking for a tutor to teach her son magic. We will allow this to happen. Because if a mastermind is truly behind this incident, they may attempt to reestablish contact with Eward.\u201d\u201c...Understood,\u201d Gion acknowledged, left with no choice but to nod in confirmation.* * *In the end, Eugene wasn\u2019t able to talk much with Gion, whom he had finally reunited with after several months.He could smell the scent of blood wafting from the Knights of the Black Lion. It was clear what had taken place since they had gone to interrogate a black wizard. It appeared that he had been interrogated, tortured, and finally executed.\u201c...Alright then, we\u2019ll see you next time,\u201d Gion said with a low voice as Ciel waved her hand from beside him and cried out, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dFor a moment, Eugene thought about what he should say to Gion, but in the end, he just bowed his head and said, \u201cSee you next time.\u201d\u201cDo you have any thoughts about joining the Knights of the Black Lion?\u201d The one who had suddenly spoken up was Carmen.Confused, Eugene turned his head only to see Carmen standing there with her arms crossed.\u201cHuh?\u201d he grunted.\u201cThey say that you have great talents. If you have no interest in becoming the Patriarch, you should just join the Knights of the Black Lion as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThank you for the offer\u2014\u201d\u201cCurrently, the position of the Second Division Captain\u2019s squire is vacant. If you want, I can recommend you for it immediately.\u201d\u201cThanks, but\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you become a captain\u2019s squire, you can learn a lot. The apprenticeship period is about five years, but if it\u2019s you, you should be able to become a full member of the Black Lions when you become an adult, three years later.\u201d\u201cI hope you have a safe journey.\u201dShe should allow people to finish what they were saying. Why did she have to keep cutting him off like that? Eugene bowed his head deeply as he said farewell to Carmen.\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Carmen said as she turned around.Before they entered the warp gate, Ciel waved at Eugene once more.\u201cHas there been any word from the White Tower Master?\u201d Eugene asked Lovellian once the visitors were gone.\u201cNope. If she had successfully managed to sign a contract, she would have come here right away to brag. But, seeing that there is no news, it seems that this contract won\u2019t be so easy,\u201d Lovellian speculated.That son-of-a-bitch Tempest. Eugene\u2019s brows furrowed deeply as he clicked his tongue.\u201cFucking Tempest,\u201d a voice cursed on the roof of the White Tower of Magic.Standing there being struck by strong gusts of wind, Melkith had also spat out a few swear words regarding Tempest. Without a single thread covering her, she was completely naked and holding a staff.By embracing the wind in this primal fashion, it had taken her several hours just to excite all her senses and maximize her sensitivity to the wind. She had feared that the wind might still not be strong enough, so she had risked using magic to summon even stronger gusts. Finally, she had aroused the blessing of protection placed on Wynnyd and personally transmitted her intentions to Tempest.However, there was absolutely no response from Tempest. Even though she had clearly conveyed her intentions to the spirit world\u2026 it felt absurd that he still hadn\u2019t replied even once.The sun was setting, and the day was turning into night. To raise her sensitivity to its absolute limits, Melkith couldn\u2019t even use magic to warm her body. Her skin was forced to endure these freezing cold winds and was already covered in goosebumps. Melkith had to sniff through a runny nose as she continued infusing her mana and will into Wynnyd.She finally heard a voice, [Contractor\u2026.]But Melkith didn\u2019t feel any joy upon hearing it.\u201cLevin\u2026!\u201dIt was the Spirit King of Lightning. As Melkith called out\u00a0his name, a crackle of lightning was mixed into the loudly blowing wind.\u201cI haven\u2019t even called you, so why are you the one appearing?\u201d Melkith demanded.[Put on some clothes first\u2026,] muttered the crackling lightning.However, Melkith had no intention of putting on her clothes.Instead, she pulled up her body, which had curled up from the cold, and cried out, \u201cGreat Spirit King of the Wind, Master of Storms! I, Melkith El-Hayah, wish to make a contract with you!\u201dLevin sighed, [Tempest asked me to tell you to shut up\u2026.]\u201cTell him to come here personally and say it to my face!\u201d[Tempest just\u2026 doesn\u2019t want to make a contract with you\u2026.]\u201cTell him that he should at least come and hear me out for a bit! Tell him that I can give him whatever he wants!\u201d[Contractor. You are not able to give Tempest what he wants.]\u201cWhat does Tempest want?!\u201d[That\u2019s\u2026,] the lightning trailed off. After a few moments of silence, he released a long sigh and continued, [You really are lost in your own delusions\u2026.]\u201cWhat?\u201d Melkith demanded.[He wants you to return Wynnyd to its original owner\u2026.]\u201cIt\u2019s mine! I\u2019m the owner!\u201d[Don\u2019t lie\u2026. Even Tempests knows that you only borrowed it from the true owner of Wynnyd for a short while\u2026.]\u201cSo he was listening in all this time! Tempest! I am the greatest spirit summoner in all of history! I am the only spirit summoner in the world who deserves to make a contract with you!\u201dMelkith threw down her staff and grabbed hold of Wynnyd. Then she started randomly swinging Wynnyd around on the roof of the tall White Tower of Magic, her body still stark naked.She desperately pleaded, \u201cThat\u2019s why you should appear in front of me! Although I don\u2019t know what you want, I can give you whatever you desire?!\u201dLevin groaned, [Contractor\u2026 please\u2026 have some shame\u2026.]\u201cI said get out here!\u201d[Tempest says\u2026 stop this vain attempt\u2026.]\u201cKyaaagh!\u201dAn eruption of stress caused the sound of a crow\u2019s cry to escape Melkith\u2019s lips. Her hair raised on end as she continued her harsh screams. The lightning, which had been watching this silently, sighed once more.\u2014Fizz.A streak of lightning descended from the sky above the White Tower of Magic. This merciless lightning strike engulfed Melkith.\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201dWith a piercing scream, Melkith\u2019s eyes rolled up into the back of her head. If she was an ordinary person, this lightning would have killed her instantly, but as the one who had made a contract with the Lightning Spirit King, Melkith wouldn\u2019t die from a lightning strike like this. However, all the strength left her muscles, and she collapsed onto the floor.[The Storm\u2026 wishes to go northward. To defeat the devildom in the north that no one has been able to conquer\u2026. To deal with the regrets that have yet to be forgotten after hundreds of years\u2026.]Although Melkith was already unconscious, the lightning continued to mutter to her with a sorrowful tone.* * *Melkith came to find Eugene after ten days had passed.Eugene, who had been staying in Sienna\u2019s Hall within Akron, couldn\u2019t stop his jaw from partially dropping when he saw Melkith\u2019s appearance as she stepped out of the elevator.How could a person become so exhausted in just ten days?Eventually, he remembered to ask, \u201c...So, the contract?\u201d\u201cWhy even ask when you can clearly tell, you motherfucker?\u201d Melkith cursed.Caught off-guard, Eugene asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the cursing?\u201d\u201cThat son of a bitch Tempest!\u201d Melkith burst out.Mer narrowed her eyes at Melkith\u2019s sudden cry. She slid off of a chair that was about as tall as she was and turned to glare at Melkith.\u201cMiss pants-wetter, this is a place where you\u2019re supposed to keep quiet,\u201d Mer reminded her.\u201cKyaaaagh!\u201d Melkith squawked in anger.\u201cHah, really,\u201d with a sigh, Mer\u2019s expression twisted even more as she raised a finger. She was thinking of shutting Melkith up and kicking her out, but before Mer could use her magic, Eugene stepped forward to stop her.\u201cSo you really weren\u2019t able to sign a contract with him?\u201d Eugene confirmed.\u201cWhy! Would! I! Lie?!\u201d Melkith growled.\u201cTempest hasn\u2019t asked you to lie about it, right?\u201d\u201cKiyaaaaak!\u201dWas she really a human? As Eugene tsked his tongue, he tapped on the Cloak of Darkness that he had slung around his shoulders.\u201cAs long as you borrow it for the rest of the day, that would be a full ten years, though,\u201d Eugene said with some regret.\u201cKiiiih\u2026,\u201d Melkith hissed.Eugene offered, \u201cIf you return Wynnyd to me now, I\u2019ll round it down to nine years for you.\u201dMelkith\u2019s head fell forward as her shoulders shook. Then, with shaking hands, she held onto Wynnyd.\u201cN-nine years\u2026?\u201d Melkith struggled to comprehend it.\u201cThis is nice and warm,\u201d Eugene gloated over his latest acquisition.\u201c...It isn\u2019t too hot even when you wear it in summer.\u201d\u201cHow should I clean it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 need to. There\u2019s magic that does that\u2026.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s great.\u201dEugene really was happy to have it. With a snort, Melkith returned Wynnyd to Eugene.\u201c...Take\u2026 good care of it,\u201d she reluctantly requested.\u201cPlease take care,\u201d Eugene first put away Wynnyd, then bowed his head in farewell.After looking at Eugene with desperate and unwilling eyes, Melkith got up to leave.\u201cWhat am I supposed to do when he doesn\u2019t even come when I call him\u2026,\u201d Melkith grumbled to herself at an audible volume as she headed back to the elevator.He didn\u2019t really care why she felt the need to do this, so Eugene didn\u2019t pay her any attention.[Hamel was an asshole, and Molon was an idiot. Although it was difficult to determine who was worse between them, Hamel was at least a little better than Molon.]It was painful for Eugene to even read this.Saying that he was better than that fool, Molon didn\u2019t bring Eugene any comfort\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 53.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53.1: The Fairy Tale (2)[The chieftain of the giants, Kamash, was ridiculously huge. No matter how straight the hulking Molon drew himself up, his height could only reach about the same level as Kamash\u2019s heel.][Although Molon leaped forward, swinging his prided ax, that fool was sent flying with a single kick from Kamash. \u2018He\u2019s strong!\u2019 Molon shouted. Wasn\u2019t something like that already obvious?][The beautiful Sienna raised her staff, Akasha! The light emitting from the staff was just as beautiful as Sienna. Some of you may not know this, but the giants possess the greatest magic resistance among all the races. Do you know what this means? No matter how powerful the cute Sienna\u2019s spells were, they were useless against a giant.][But her foe was the dreaded Kamash! A giant that was hundreds of years old and the most powerful chieftain in all of the giants\u2019 history. However, you all should know that just because you\u2019re powerful doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a great person. And that\u2019s exactly what Kamash was like. He was a savage bastard who sold his entire race to the Demon Kings.][With her beautiful magic, Sienna beautifully attempted to restrain Kamash.]\u2018How on earth would you use beautiful magic to beautifully restrain someone?\u2019\u00a0Eugene momentarily stopped reading the fairy tale to ponder this question.[However, it was impossible to restrain Kamash. In return for betraying his entire race, that savage bastard had received a powerful increase in strength from the Demon Kings. A giant could already fight a dragon with just its bare body, but Kamash, who had the blessings of the Demon Kings on top of that, was just like a sentient natural disaster.]Even the revised versions contained the battle with Kamash, the chieftain of the giants. However, the backstory of Kamash wasn\u2019t told as explicitly as in this first version. He was merely described as a bad giant. As it was a fairy tale meant for young kids, they now published a simplified version.[Still, they wouldn\u2019t back down. The gentle and elegant Anise radiated a divine light of resolve. That\u2019s right. They couldn\u2019t back down. Because behind Kamash marched an army of giants numbering in the hundreds, and they were advancing towards the Plains of Palmir.]Eugene could remember it clearly.The Plains of Palmir lay at the entrance to the Devildom of Helmuth. Three hundred years ago, a tall rampart had stood there, separating the plains from the border of Helmuth.To prove his loyalty to the Demon Kings, Kamash had led an army of giants and had come to topple the wall personally. It was impossible for any of the armies belonging to either the kingdoms or the empires to stop this sentient natural disaster.However, they still needed to be stopped.[When the sweet Anise lifted high a rosary, what happened next was amazing. Brilliant lights poured down from the heavens like rain. Although the human armies prepared to stop the giants appeared insignificantly small, Anise\u2019s blessing gave courage and strength to them all.][A thousand men were gathered to face hundreds of giants. Do you think that was too few? But it couldn\u2019t be helped. To you who are currently reading this book, are you truly confident that you wouldn\u2019t run away in the face of these giants\u2019 advance? The shaking from the footsteps of these enormously tall monsters could be felt on the Plains of Palmir a few days before they even arrived.][Also, the truth was that the number of allies didn\u2019t really matter.]That\u2019s just how it was.Eugene recalled his past life from hundreds of years ago.[Because Vermouth was there.]The Great Vermouth, the Master-of-All, and the God of War.He raised his dazzling Holy Sword high and marched forward. The rain of light called down by Anise increased the Holy Sword\u2019s strength. Any emotions detrimental to the battle, such as fear or despair, were erased from everybody\u2019s minds. At that moment, all the humans gathered there weren\u2019t afraid of death, pain, the giants, or even the Demon Kings.Anise\u2019s blessing didn\u2019t stop at just erasing any useless emotions. Any wounds would heal immediately, and no matter how long you fought, it made it so that you wouldn\u2019t get tired. In addition, it released the physical limits of what your body could handle, making your body more suitable for battle.Giants possessed strong magical resistance. But that didn\u2019t mean that Sienna\u2019s spells were useless. She shook the earth even more fiercely than the giants\u2019 footsteps and tore it apart. Lava rose from the ground, and lightning fell from the sky.[Molon, that idiot, wanted to test his strength against Kamash in a frontal contest. Although everyone thought Molon was an idiot, we all held back the urge to say it, and only that rude bastard Hamel actually socked Molon in the jaw.]\u2014You stupid bastard. A contest of strength? You\u2019re saying that you want to go up to that savage bastard and challenge him to an arm-wrestling match? Don\u2019t spout such bullshit, and just stay with the soldiers over there.\u2014Why do I need to do that?\u2014If you\u2019re not there to stop the giants, all those soldiers will be crushed into pancakes by the giants\u2019 feet!When Hamel had shouted that in a fit of perplexed frustration, Molon\u2019s mouth had hung open for a few moments in a look of confusion before he had nodded with an exclamation.\u2014Oh, so that\u2019s the case. Hamel, you really don\u2019t want them to die.\u2014Why are you putting it like that? If we\u2019re going to fight together, it\u2019s just better if more survive than less.\u2014Okay, I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ll act as their shield. But what will you be doing?\u2014What I always do.It was better for more to survive than less.Of course, that was only the case when talking about his allies. As for enemies, it was definitely better if a lot of them were killed. This was also something that Hamel was particularly confident, enthusiastic, and skilled in ensuring.[At that time, the knights still believed in their own greatness. When Molon stood in front of the soldiers, the knights headed over to Vermouth. Introducing themselves as the knights of this-rose and that-pebble,[1]\u00a0they continued to spout off the names of knightly orders that no one would ever even care about. What these idiots basically meant by saying all this was\u2014]Let us fight together.[What did they mean by \u2018fight together?\u2019 It would be difficult for them to cut off one of Kamash\u2019s toes even if they all charged together. Also, saying that they would fight together with Vermouth was nothing but lip service. What they really wanted was to have their names added to Vermouth\u2019s legend so their reputation could be passed down to future generations.][Besides, Vermouth didn\u2019t really like fighting with such groups. He very well knew that if he fought alongside these knights, they would only drag him down uselessly and serve as meatshields at most.][This was the Great Vermouth. There was only one man who was able to fight alongside that inhuman monster, and he was the only one Vermouth could rely on this battlefield.]\u2014Hamel.\u2014Yeah. What?[The Stupid Hamel.]\u2014The left arm. Can you do it?\u2014I\u2019d prefer the right arm. Isn\u2019t that bastard, Kamash, right-handed?\u2014If that\u2019s the case, you can take the right arm.\u2014Why do we even need to divide up the left arm and the right arm? I\u2019ll just figure it out as I go along.[That\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 it\u2019s hard to put it into words. Although you readers might not be aware of it, it\u2019s taken me a lot of tries to somehow write this down, you know? However, if you\u2019ve read up to this point, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already noticed it. I\u2019m not very good at writing stories. I just write whatever comes to mind.][In any case, it was an unbelievable fight. Kamash was as tall as a mountain. As for Vermouth and Hamel, well\u2026. Although they weren\u2019t as hulking as Molon, they were still tall and with good physiques, but there was no way that they could be compared with Kamash.][However, Kamash wasn\u2019t able to advance any further. When Kamash attempted to take another step, Hamel slashed at his ankle with an ax. When Kamash swung his arm at the pest, Hamel sliced his arm with a sword. When Kamash threw his fist at Hamel, Hamel\u2019s spear pierced Kamash\u2019s wrist.][Then Vermouth sliced open Kamash\u2019s throat.]It wasn\u2019t as simple as this book made it appear. Trusting in Anise\u2019s blessing, Hamel had headed out to meet Kamash. Whenever things got scary, Sienna\u2019s magic intervened, then Vermouth would parry the attack. Without the help of the light from the Holy Sword and Vermouth\u2019s assistance, Hamel couldn\u2019t have possibly blocked Kamash alone.[Only the Holy Sword was able to put an end to Kamash, who was clad in the power of the Demon Kings. But, since the Holy Sword would only recognize Vermouth as its master, the only one who was finally able to kill Kamash was Vermouth.][With his throat cleanly sliced open, the blood spewing from Kamash washed over the plains. It was like a riverbank somewhere had burst open.][Although Kamash had died, the giants did not surrender. However, the situation was still more manageable than it was at first. The Demon Kings\u2019 blessing had faded with Kamash\u2019s death, so the beautiful Sienna\u2019s beautiful magic was able to exert its full force.]This was what Eugene had felt having read this far,\u00a0\u2018It was either Sienna or Anise who wrote this book.\u2019Of course, the author of this classic fairy tale was unknown, but having read this book, Eugene had figured something out.The Wise Sienna and the Faithful Anise. Those were their usual epithets.However, in this first edition of the fairy tale, all sorts of titles were attached to the front of Sienna and Anise\u2019s names. Beautiful Sienna. Elegant Anise. Cute Sienna. Sweet Anise. Charming Sienna. Seductive Anise.\u2018Just what were those\u00a0two\u00a0bitches playing at?\u2019On the other hand, Molon and Hamel were harassed terribly. Idiotic Molon. Asshole Hamel. Stupid Molon. Son-of-a-bitch Hamel. Noisy Molon. Foul-mouthed Hamel.Perhaps because they couldn\u2019t bear to attach any other title to Vermouth, from beginning to end, whenever he appeared, he was only described as the Great Vermouth.1. The original text says: \u2018The knights of the dog-shit roses and the horse-shit rat-tail.\u2019 Saying that two things are dog-shit and horse-shit is a Korean way of saying they\u2019re virtually identical, similar to po-tay-to and po-tah-to. As for the rat-tail, it means something small or insignificant, like saying that the pay is peanuts. The rose might also mean something that looks pretty but is useless.\u00a0\u261cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Damn ReincarnationCH 53.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53.2: The Fairy Tale (2)But it wasn\u2019t just the titles. While this first edition was incomparably more savage in its depiction, the contents were extremely detailed. It wasn\u2019t just the battle with Kamash and the giants; the various events they went through in Helmuth were also described in considerable detail.The author of this fairy tale that was published three hundred years ago was speculated to be a bard experienced in picking up various rumors and weaving them into a song.However, having read this first edition himself, Eugene was sure that the author of this book wasn\u2019t anything like a bard. The relationship between the characters was depicted in far too real a fashion for a book said to have been written by a bard.\u2018It\u2019s just like how I remember it.\u2019Sienna and Anise got along well. According to what Mer had said, Sienna would often describe Anise as a snake-like woman. This evaluation hadn\u2019t surprised him in the least. During their travels, Sienna had often called Anise a snake bitch to her face.Since they had gotten along so well\u2026 the two of them may have written this fairy tale together. If that was the case, it would make sense for them to have used bullshit, such as beautiful or elegant, to describe each other.\u2018Or else, one of the two could have written it and then tried to obscure which of them it was by writing like this\u2026.\u2019Was it Sienna? Or could it be Anise? Eugene was lost in thought for a few moments. Surprisingly\u2026 they both had rotten personalities, so he could see either of them pulling bullshit like this.\u2018Still, weren\u2019t they being a bit too blunt with these descriptions.\u2019\u201cWasn\u2019t this written by Lady Sienna?\u201d Eugene turned to Mer and asked this question rather than pondering it all by himself.After all, he had with him a familiar who had accompanied Sienna hundreds of years ago.\u201cDon\u2019t say something so crazy,\u201d Mer, who had been reading a book on magic, responded with a disgusted expression. \u201cWhy would Lady Sienna write such a story?\u201dEugene tried to explain himself, \u201cNo, well\u2026 As I was reading it, I noticed a lot of adjectives that were used to describe Sienna in particular.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the ones calling her beautiful, cute, and adorable? Really now\u2026 Do you truly believe that Lady Sienna would write about herself like that?\u201d Mer asked him skeptically.Eugene hesitated, \u201c...Um\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t insult Lady Sienna like that. Unless they\u2019re insane, who would attach such words in front of their own name in a story that they had hand-written themselves?\u201d Mer demanded.\u201c...Ummm\u2026,\u201d Eugene held back his urge to say something in his own defense.\u201cEven if it\u2019s you, Sir Eugene, I won\u2019t forgive you if you insult Lady Sienna,\u201d Mer said, lifting up her clenched fists.In response to this violent reaction, Eugene continued flipping through the fairy tale without asking further questions.[Sienna. I\u2019ve always liked you.]\u2018Why is this part the same as in the revised versions?\u2019There was no way that Sienna would do this.After reading Hamel\u2019s death scene, Eugene was sure of this.\u00a0The one who had written this fairy tale was Anise.\u2018Didn\u2019t they say that until she left on a pilgrimage, she spent her days in the Holy Empire being called a saint? It looks like such a life must have been boring enough to drive Anise crazy.\u2019That had to be why she had written something so crazy. With Anise\u2019s personality, it was likely that she would write about herself as being kind and charming. As for why she had added this and that to Sienna\u2019s name\u2026.\u2018She must have wanted to fuck with Sienna.\u2019Sienna. I\u2019ve always liked you.\u2018And in the process, I was fucked with as well. That motherfucker.\u2019Eugene clenched his fists in a surge of frustration.Although he had read it hoping otherwise, even in this fairy tale, it didn\u2019t really record how the decisive battle with the Demon King of Incarceration ended. In this, it was similar to the revised versions. An oath had been sworn, and with this newly forged peace, the members of the party had left Helmuth and returned to their respective homes. That was how they lived happily ever after.Happily, it said.Eugene clicked his tongue and closed the book. Eugene\u2019s mood further worsened when the portrait of Sienna with a smile that didn\u2019t suit her caught his eye.\u201cAre you going to have another go?\u201d Mer asked.Eugene grunted in confirmation, \u201cHm.\u201dMer observed, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to give it another attempt, it seems a little arrogant to attempt it at your level, Sir Eugene.\u201dHe had already heard something similar from her a few times before. Eugene smirked and headed over to Witch Craft.\u201cThe challenge needs to be difficult to be worthwhile,\u201d Eugene stated.Mer scoffed, \u201cYou keep failing, so how is it worthwhile.\u201dAlthough she said this, Mer didn\u2019t try to stop Eugene. She was secretly interested in what Eugene was attempting.Ten days after the Knights of the Black Lion had left, Eugene had spent most of his waking hours in Akron.For the first few days, he had studied the magic on the lower floors as Mer had recommended. The battle magic on the eleventh floor, the fire magic on the night floor, the battlefield magic on the seventh floor, and the spatial magic on the sixth floor.Eugene had been especially interested in the spatial magic on the sixth floor. It wasn\u2019t for Blink, which he couldn\u2019t use yet, but instead for studying how to properly use the Cloak of Darkness. This cloak had been enchanted with the highest levels of spatial magic and was an amazing piece of armor in and of itself, but it could be used in various other ways depending on how skillful you were in handling it.From the start, it was easy to use the subspace sealed inside the cloak. It worked just by grabbing any object and placing it inside the cloak. Taking it back out was also easy. You just needed to stick your hand inside the cloak and pull the object out.However, in order to use the cloak to rebound an attack, the spatial coordinates needed to be calculated separately. In other words, it was necessary to quickly identify the spatial coordinates from which the attack would be received and then designate the coordinates along which the attack was to be returned. Even just searching for these coordinates required high-level magic.Even though he\u2019d held great interest in it, Eugene was forced to give up for now.Eugene returned once more to the twelfth floor. The Eternal Hole he had seen in Witch Craft just wouldn\u2019t leave his mind.So once more, he went back to Witch Craft, saw its contents, and fainted.From his third attempt onwards, he stopped fainting. Eugene\u2019s consciousness got used to the absurd movements of the mana. But that alone wasn\u2019t enough. What could be gained from simply seeing it happen? If he really wanted to gain something from it, he needed to develop at least some understanding of it.\u2018The Eternal Hole.\u2019The ultimate achievement in Circle magic.\u2018The White Flame Formula.\u2019The Lionheart clan\u2019s mana training scripture.\u2018I\u2019m familiar with controlling mana, and I\u2019m also familiar with the White Flame Formula.\u2019He thought about trying to combine them through practical application.It was impossible for the current Eugene to fully reproduce the Eternal Hole. He needed to at least reach the Ninth Circle to replicate it.The Eternal Hole. To put it simply, it was just a matter of holding an infinitely multiplying amount of Circles inside one huge Circle. By continuously reproducing, entwining, and collapsing the Circles created through this, it amplified any mana put into it.Eugene didn\u2019t use Circles when casting magic. He replaced the Circles with his Cores, the Stars of the White Flame Formula. By rotating his three Stars, he formed a Circle.But what if he could generate multiple Circles inside the Circle that he formed through his method?Eugene grinned to himself as he stood in front of Witch Craft.In his past life, Hamel hadn\u2019t learned the White Flame Formula. Since he hadn\u2019t learned magic either, he also didn\u2019t have any Circles.What Hamel had learned was the cheap mana training scripture that was widely spread among mercenaries. Hamel had added his own knowledge and improvements on top of that. Afterward, Sienna had even gone through and corrected it.It didn\u2019t have a fancy name. Hamel had no intention of writing it down and leaving it for future generations, and he hadn\u2019t had any disciples or descendants to whom he could pass it down. In the end\u2026 the only one in the world who had learned this mana training scripture was Hamel.First, you built your core. Then you burst the mana formed in this core in a chain of explosions. The mana propelled by this internal explosion quickly spread throughout the body. The exploded mana wasn\u2019t released outside the body. By exploding all of his mana, Hamel could bring his full force to bear for a single second.With just that alone, Hamel was able to slash Kamash\u2019s limbs.\u2014You were born with an instinct for battle.This was something that Vermouth had once told him.\u2014You actually paid good money for this kind of mana training scripture?That was what Sienna had said.\u2014I just can\u2019t understand it. With this kind of\u2026 garbage\u2026 by practicing this mana training scripture\u2026 you were able to reach the level of strength that you have now?He could do it.Eugene didn\u2019t doubt himself. He saw that his idea had some possibility of success. If that was the case, he could definitely do it. He didn\u2019t necessarily need to perfectly reproduce the Eternal Hole. With his Third\u2013Star White Flame Formula and the Circle he had created from these Stars, he would explode the mana generated inside the Circle. It wouldn\u2019t just be any ordinary explosion. Instead of a singular explosion, there would be a continuous chain of explosions. If he could manage to do all that as naturally as if he was breathing\u2026.\u201cSince you\u2019ve allowed me to see everything like this\u2026.\u201dWithin his consciousness, Eugene saw the infinite sea of mana being used to draw a Circle. This was the Eternal Hole \u2014 the ultimate endpoint of the Circle Magic created by Sienna. It conveyed a sense of awe even though he had already seen it many times.By now, he was no longer at risk of falling unconscious. As he immersed himself in his own consciousness, Eugene watched the flow of mana. An infinite series of Circles was being created, all contained within one huge Circle. As he focussed on his consciousness, Eugene\u2019s mana, which was like a speck of dust within this vast sea, began to respond.Just like that\u2026.Two years passed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the interior of Akron was rife with spells used to guarantee various conveniences such as air purification and temperature control, Eugene was the only one who could be seen wearing a fur-lined cloak in this sweltering heat.He didn\u2019t have any particular reason for it. It was just comfortable. Contrary to its heavy appearance, the Cloak of Darkness barely weighed anything.Although this fact was already obvious, magic truly was convenient.Even the small weight that Eugene did feel wasn\u2019t enough to burden him. Since he had been going about his daily training while strapping heavy sandbags onto his body ever since he was ten years old, there was no way that the weight of this cloak would make him feel uncomfortable.It wasn\u2019t hot either. The cloak resonated with its wearer\u2019s sensory systems and constantly monitored both internal and external temperatures, ensuring its wearer\u2019s comfort in any situation. That alone was already convenient enough, but what Eugene most appreciated was definitely the spatial enchantments imbued within the cloak.And among these, he got the most use out of the subspace.While spinning a pen around on his finger, Eugene stared down at his desk. He was looking at a thesis he had started writing a few hours ago. By the time he came to his senses, he had several pages filled with writing. Eugene roughly scooped them all up and threw them inside his cloak, then took out some more blank sheets of paper.\u201cIsn\u2019t it almost time for you to get something to eat?\u201dThis question came from Mer, who was sitting across from him. Her legs were swinging idly as she sat on a chair too tall for her, and both her hands were cupped under her chin.Eugene gave an excuse, \u201cI ate a lot before I came here.\u201dBut Mer saw through it, \u201cWhat are you saying all of a sudden? You always eat a lot. So aren\u2019t you still hungry now?\u201d\u201cI am a bit hungry,\u201d Eugene admitted. \u201cBut if I go now, I\u2019ll lose my focus, so I can\u2019t eat just yet.\u201d\u2018Liar,\u2019\u00a0Mer thought as she gave a small hmph and puffed up her cheeks. For him to say that he would lose his focus was ridiculous. She had been watching over Eugene for two years now, and Mer had never once seen Eugene lose his focus.\u201cAren\u2019t you being too hasty?\u201d Mer asked him.\u201cI really don\u2019t think so,\u201d Eugene responded.\u201cNow that the time has come to write your thesis, that\u2019s even more reason not to be hasty. You should write it calmly and slowly so that you don\u2019t make any small mistakes\u2026,\u201d Mer tried to think of any other arguments. \u201cUm\u2026. So in any case, that\u2019s why it\u2019s better to write carefully, got it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not rushing it, and I am writing calmly. Though I\u2019m not sure about writing slowly. I\u2019ve been revising my thesis constantly, and at least in my eyes, I\u2019ve yet to see any mistakes. This must mean that I am writing carefully,\u201d Eugene replied as he continued to spin his pen in circles.Mer wasn\u2019t really satisfied with this answer, and after a short pause, she continued speaking. \u201c...I\u2019m just talking about normal wizards, but doesn\u2019t it usually take them several decades just to complete a thesis that summarizes their magic?\u201d\u201cThe amount of time I\u2019ve spent learning magic is a lot less than a few decades.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even more reason to think that you are being overly arrogant by writing your thesis so early! Instead of doing something so rash, you should just immerse yourself in magic for the next ten years\u2026.\u201d Mer trailed off, still protesting.\u201cIt looks like our little Mer is feeling really shy,\u201d Eugene grinned as he stared at Mer.At this, Mer\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as if disgusted, and she raised both of her clenched fists towards Eugene.\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you enough times to stop crossing the line?\u201d Mer demanded.Eugene denied the accusation, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that I crossed any line.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about what you said: \u2018our little Mer!\u2019 I\u2019ve told you not to call me that. I am two hundred years older than you, Sir Eugene.\u201d\u201cThen it looks like our little granny Mer is pretty shy.\u201d\u201cWanna die?\u201dMer\u2019s shoulders seemed to be heaving with anger. But even so, Eugene didn\u2019t feel any killing intent flowing his way. Since she had been teased like this for two years now, it looked like Mer had gotten used to it. Besides, they both knew Mer wasn\u2019t serious while saying that and didn\u2019t really hate it when Eugene treated her like that.It was strange, novel, and nostalgic. Among all the wizards who had been granted entry into Akron over these hundreds of years, not a single one of them had treated Mer like a young child. Although some fools occasionally wanted to dissect Mer and Witch Craft under the foolish pretext of doing research, most wizards kept a certain distance from Mer, making it difficult for her to talk to them.They had no choice but to treat Mer that way. Mer was a familiar who had been personally crafted by\u00a0the\u00a0Wise Sienna, and based on a childhood version of herself at that. She also served as the artificial intelligence of Witch Craft, the greatest grimoire in all of magic history. Even though they had already dissected it once, all the wizards who had experienced the contents of Witch Craft were in awe of Mer.However, Eugene wasn\u2019t like that.There was no reason for him to follow that trend. Respect for the Wise Sienna? Although he could admit that she was a great wizard, to Eugene, Sienna was just Sienna.Eugene got straight to the point, \u201cDo you hate that I\u2019m leaving?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026,\u201d Mer hesitated to reply.\u201cSee now, you do hate it. To think that it\u2019s already been two years since I first came here. Though it seems I\u2019m the only one who regularly comes and goes from this floor,\u201d Eugene noted sympathetically.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s unavoidable,\u201d Mer mumbled as she loosened her tightly clenched fists. \u201cBecause the other wizards have already finished examining Witch Craft long ago.\u201dIt had been two years since Eugene first entered Akron. He had been visiting Akron almost every day since then and had spent around half of his waking hours in Sienna\u2019s Hall.This wasn\u2019t particularly impressive or surprising. All the wizards who were allowed to enter Akron, like Eugene, diligently immersed themselves in the study of magic.Most of the wizards who received permission to enter Akron had overwhelming pride and confidence in their magical abilities. But by refining their abilities even further, these wizards sought to reach the ultimate truths.So wasn\u2019t it just natural?Mer had been in existence for over two hundred years. The wizards who had been permitted to enter Akron were now either Tower Masters, Heads of the Wizards Guild, a member of Aroth\u2019s Court Wizards, or part of the royal family of Aroth. They had all been born with a rarely-seen gift for magic, and by now, they had already proven themselves as wizards.For them, Witch Craft was an amazing piece of magic that their predecessor had left behind. The ultimate point of Circle magic \u2014 the Eternal Hole. If one was a wizard who had encountered Witch Craft for the first time, they couldn\u2019t help but be stunned and in awe of its greatness.Over their next few visits, these wizards would take their time to try to understand and explore the contents of Witch Craft. But they would eventually realize it.That this truth wasn\u2019t something that they could grasp just yet.From then on, their visits would decrease. Although Witch Craft was a great piece of magic, the Archwizards who were allowed to enter Akron had already established their own magic formulas, and none were in a position where they could fully devote themselves to replicating Witch Craft. Their admiration and astonishment wouldn\u2019t fade, and they would reference Witch Craft for their own magic, but\u2026 in the end, they would seek to complete their own unique magic formula through independent research.In this respect, Eugene was unique.Or at least that\u2019s what he looked like in Mer\u2019s view. It might be because he was young, or it might just be because he had yet to establish his own magic formula. Or maybe it was just that he was a flexible thinker? Or could it be due to having little pride in his identity as a wizard? It was probably all these things combined.In these two years, Eugene had spent half his accrued time within Akron immersed in Witch Craft without ever fainting or getting a nosebleed. Every session, after spending quite some time perusing Witch Craft\u2026 he would then emerge to study the magic texts stored in Sienna\u2019s Hall.What meaning was there in watching that scene over and over again? When he wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it anyway. It was said that a crow-tit will only tear its crotch if it tried to walk like a crane, but the level of Eugene\u2019s magical skill compared to that required for Witch Craft wasn\u2019t even up to the same level as the crow-tit\u2019s crotch. Instead, it was more like the difference between the earthworm and a dragon or a bug and a god.He had set his sights far too high.It was probably because he was a young master of the Lionheart clan, which was a step above even the most prestigious families. And he wasn\u2019t just any young master. No, he was a young master who had once been a collateral descendant and was the first in history to be adopted into the main family after being recognized for his talents, wasn\u2019t he? It seemed obvious to others that Eugene was lost in his own genius and had set his sights on a height impossible for him to reach.However\u2026.Eugene was able to comprehend Witch Craft. No\u2026 could that really be called comprehension? It was more along the lines of pounding it straight into his head. Mer had been watching over Eugene for two years now, but she still couldn\u2019t accept that Eugene\u2019s behavior was in any way reasonable.Mer finally asked, \u201c...If you really do manage to complete the thesis, will you be leaving Aroth?\u201dEugene returned her question with his own, \u201cDo you know just how many times you\u2019ve asked me that?\u201d\u201cIf you include today, then it\u2019s the 137th time.\u201d\u201cThat sounds about right. Since I started writing my thesis about half a year ago\u2026 it means you\u2019ve asked me that question about once a day.\u201d\u201cThere were two days when I didn\u2019t ask that question,\u201d Mer insisted poutily. \u201cFine. If I have to be honest, I don\u2019t want you to leave Aroth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know when the Red Tower Master might be retiring, but\u2026 Sir Eugene, if you say you wish to become the next Tower Master, the current Red Tower Master would probably approve you as his successor without hesitation.\u201d\u201cI have no intentions of becoming a tower master.\u201d\u201cThen how about the Court Wizards? Isn't Trempel Vizardo also extremely interested in recruiting you?\u201dTrempel Vizardo was the Commander of Aroth\u2019s Court Wizards. Since about a year ago, he had been trying to get close to Eugene to recruit him for a position in the Court Wizards.\u201cCrown Prince Honein also greatly favors you, Sir Eugene. In my opinion, Crown Prince Honein\u2019s line is one that will be able to continue to proudly make a name for itself over the next few decades, until it even reaches outside of Aroth,\u201d Mer continued to persuade him.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m grateful for the Crown Prince\u2019s favor, that also doesn\u2019t appeal to me,\u201d Eugene rejected the suggestion.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to become the Patriarch anyway, so why do you have to return to the Lionheart clan?\u201d Mer argued.Eugene just asked, \u201cDo I really need such an amazing reason just to go home?\u201d\u201cAnd since when were you so attached to your home?\u201d Mer asked sulkily.When she had first heard him mention his thesis, Mer hadn\u2019t thought much about it.This was because, even though Eugene\u2019s accomplishments were astonishing, it would be by no means an easy feat to establish his findings in a thesis.However, Eugene\u2019s growth far exceeded Mer\u2019s imagination. It had only been half a year since he started writing his thesis, but Eugene had already neatly organized his previously vague magic theories into a coherent hypothesis. During the process, he had managed to advance his own unique magic formula by several steps.\u201c...That thesis, do you really have no intention of publishing it?\u201d Mer asked.\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Eugene replied with a shake of his head. \u201cThis thesis is just for my self-satisfaction. In any case, other than me, no one else would truly be able to make use of it. So I\u2019m just using it to tidy up the details of my magic formula by writing it all down.\u201dThis meant that Eugene didn\u2019t really need to write a perfect thesis. Mer had already heard him say so dozens of times before. That was why Mer refused to retract her pouting lips. As it was a thesis written solely for self-satisfaction, there was no reason for him to worry too much about the quality of the paper, as it wasn\u2019t going to be presented to a panel anyway.Although that was the case, Eugene wasn\u2019t going to casually write just anything. The thesis he had been working on for over half a year would be examined by Eugene\u2019s teacher, the Red Tower Master, Lovellian. It was Lovellian who had first brought up the opinion that there was no need for Eugene to publish his thesis.\u2014This Ring Flame Formula can\u2019t be reproduced by any other wizard. Regardless of how advanced their understanding of magic is, it would be physically impossible for them to replicate it.Eugene didn\u2019t use the normal Circle magic formula.\u2014It\u2019s also not something that can be reproduced by the White Flame Formula users of the Lionheart\u2019s main family.Instead, Eugene had replaced the Circle with the Stars from the White Flame Formula.\u2014I\u2019ve also\u2026 attempted to reproduce your results by following your thesis. I was stalled right from the beginning because I haven\u2019t formed a core, nor have I learned the White Flame Formula. So I tried to use my Circles as a replacement, but I wasn\u2019t able to replicate your results, Eugene. Instead, my mana seemed to flow backward.In order to copy Witch Craft\u2019s Eternal Hole, Eugene had adapted the Eternal Hole to use the Stars of his White Flame Formula in place of the Circles.He was currently at the Fourth Star of the White Flame Formula. With these four Stars, he made a Circle. Then inside this Circle, just as Hamel had done in his past life, he would ignite his mana to set off a chain of explosions. The exploding mana would then be refined into countless Circles that would then be intertwined with each other to create more Circles. On the outside, the spinning ring of flames in his pseudo-Circle would tightly bind his Stars, preventing any mana from leaking out.This was the Ring Flame Formula.Originally, he had intended to attempt something similar once he reached the Fifth Star of the White Flame Formula, but the timing had been pushed forward due to his meeting with Witch Craft. Learning magic every day allowed him to stimulate his mana, and as a result, it also increased his progress in the White Flame Formula.The two years he had spent at Aroth couldn\u2019t be described as simply hectic; they were far more intense than that.He had become Lovellian\u2019s disciple, so while half of his waking hours were spent studying in Akron, the other half was spent learning magic from Lovellian.As an Archwizard, Lovellian could clearly tell what level Eugene had reached. Apart from a strong foundation in mana control, Eugene only knew the basics. Lovellian didn\u2019t give Eugene any lessons on the vital arrangement of formulas or the attunement of mana used to create spells.He felt there was no need to teach Eugene any of that, and Lovellian\u2019s judgment was soon proven correct.During Eugene\u2019s previous life as Hamel, with only a poor mana training scripture as his foundation, he had become strong enough to serve as Vermouth\u2019s companion. Hamel was one of the protagonists during the war with Helmuth, and he was right there alongside the others when they had killed three of the five Demon Kings.All while only having learned such a common and cheap mana training scripture.So Lovellian only taught Eugene various spells. And among the myriad of spells that he knew, he taught Eugene only the most useful. He tried to simplify their complicated formulas as much as possible, then left it solely up to Eugene to figure out how to arrange his mana to cast these spells.After Eugene had managed to establish his Ring Flame Formula to a certain extent, Lovellian had provided his helpful critique as Eugene began to write his thesis. He had also assisted in adapting the existing Circle spells to fit Eugene\u2019s unique magic formula.There wasn\u2019t really a need for Lovellian to do so, as it was possible to cast the usual Circle spells with the Ring Flame Formula. However, if Eugene was going to be using his own unique magic formula, wouldn\u2019t it be better for him to use improvised spells so that they were both stronger and easier to cast?\u201cAre you upset?\u201d Eugene asked Mer.Mer harrumphed, \u201cWhy would I be upset?\u201d\u201cBecause I said I\u2019ll be leaving even though you asked me to stay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not upset. What right do I have to stop you from leaving? Sir Eugene, if you say you\u2019re going, then you can just go. Although I\u2019ve never thought about wanting to go somewhere, even if I did, I\u2019m just a familiar who can\u2019t leave Akron.\u201dThe more Mer talked, the further her lips protruded in her pout.\u201cThat\u2019s why you should just feel free to leave. You can just leave me here all alone in this boring, dull, and quiet place while you go off by yourself. I\u2019m not at all disappointed about parting ways with you, with whom I\u2019ve been playing for these past two years. After all, I'm not really a living human being, and I know full well that humans are just selfish creatures.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Eugene calmly asked.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m well aware of this. Because I\u2019m two hundred years older than you. Even so, Sir Eugene, please at least come and see me before you leave. Don\u2019t just leave without saying anything like Lady Sienna,\u201d Mer pleaded.\u201cAlright,\u201d Eugene readily agreed.\u201cEven though I\u2019ve said all this, you\u2019re still as calm as ever. Though it feels like I\u2019ve thought this hundreds of times over these past two years, you really are a piece of trash,\u201d Mer grumbled.Eugene argued, \u201cWhy am I a piece of trash?\u201d\u201cBecause I just get that feeling from you. It doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a reason or not. You, Sir Eugene, are simply trash. You\u2019re really so annoying. Even though you\u2019re a lot younger than me, you haven\u2019t shown me any respect as your senior. If an adult tells you to do something, shouldn\u2019t you just be a good child and accept the order obediently?\u201dAs she grumbled these words, Mer picked up the hat she had placed next to her and put it back on her head, covering her face in embarrassment.\u201c...Of course\u2026 if you were to be truly persuaded by my words and chose not to leave Aroth, then I\u2019m sure I would feel extremely distressed because of that,\u201d Mer haltingly admitted. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help it. As my personality is based on Lady Sienna\u2019s childhood, my emotions and behavior can\u2019t help but be influenced by a childish temper.\u201dEugene seemed doubtful, \u201cIs that really the case?\u201d\u201cYes, of course, that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mer insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say such childish things and show a child\u2019s stubbornness. Even under such circumstances, part of me still accepts that it\u2019s your right to leave. That\u2019s why I still feel like an idiot for uttering such nonsensical words. Because I\u2019m sure that Lady Sienna wouldn\u2019t act like this. I feel like my actions are an insult to Lady Sienna.\u201d\u201c...Hm,\u201d Eugene hesitated.\u201cThat's why you should just treat my words like air. Since I\u2019m just being childishly stubborn about this, there\u2019s no need for you to pay attention to what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s any point to it, and I don\u2019t really have anything I can offer you,\u201d Mer meekly conceded.\u201cMaybe,\u201d Eugene said, even as the pen he was using to write his thesis continued to move. \u201cBut the real Lady Sienna might have acted just like you.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say something so nonsensical. There\u2019s no way that Lady Sienna would do that.\u201d\u201cNo, she would have.\u201d\u201cAnd how would you know that, Sir Eugene? When you\u2019ve never even met the real Lady Sienna. Could you really be saying that while thinking of Lady Sienna as she\u2019s depicted in the fairy tale?\u201d Mer asked as she lifted up her hat, revealing her face.Pffft.Mer blew a raspberry at Eugene.\u201cIn the end, that was just something someone wrote while using their imagination,\u201d Mer scolded him. \u201cI knew Lady Sienna; she wasn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d\u201cMy thesis should be finishing soon,\u201d Eugene declared as he childishly returned Mer\u2019s raspberry with one of his own. \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t get too needlessly ambitious with it, I\u2019ll probably be able to finish it before the end of summer.\u201d\u201cSo what about it?\u201d Mer asked grumpily.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely come looking for you before I leave. I might just have something I\u2019ll need to say to you at that moment, you know?\u201d Eugene teased.Mer demanded, \u201cWhat is it? Are you trying to provoke me? I really will kill you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you at that time,\u201d Eugene replied with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though it wasn\u2019t as long as the time he had spent in Sienna\u2019s Hall, he had also stayed on the eighth and sixth floors for quite some time.The eighth floor held the Hall of Scorching Heat and the sixth floor held the Hall of Space.If Eugene had been a bit greedier, he might have even wanted to spend some time in the Hall of Heavenly Punishment on the seventh floor and the Hall of Icy Chill on the eighth floor. But instead of needlessly spreading himself thin, reaching for this and that, Eugene had decided that he needed to concentrate on a few chosen topics.The fire magic on the eighth floor was relatively simple yet powerful. Although the difficulty of the magic varied depending on how he wanted to control the flames, as long as he could first ignite some flames, he would be able to cast spells of sufficient power.Flames on their own were just that powerful, volatile, and destructive. However, the flaw of fire spells was that they required an absurd amount of mana. And the Hall of Scorching Heat on the eighth floor stored the spells of the one who was the most powerful Fire Wizard in all of magic\u2019s history.Eugene held a personal interest in the Blink spell on the sixth floor in the Hall of Space, and he also needed to learn spatial magic to use the Cloak of Darkness properly.The fruits of his study on the eight and sixth floors had proven more than adequate.\u201cSo you\u2019re finally out.\u201dA voice greeted Eugene as he stepped onto the first floor of Akron.A middle-aged wizard who had been seated there got up to meet him. He waved his hand at Eugene while pasting on a friendly smile that seemed a touch too enthusiastic.\u201cWas there something else you needed from me?\u201d Eugene asked exasperatedly.This was Trempel Vizardo. As the Commander of Aroth\u2019s Court Wizards, he had shown himself to be extremely interested in Eugene.Strictly speaking, Trempel\u2019s blatant attempts to curry favor was also a way of conveying Crown Prince Honein\u2019s friendly intentions. Since their first meeting with Eugene, they didn\u2019t hide the fact that they wanted to pull him closer.\u201cSir Eugene, I\u2019m always asking you to come and have a meal with me, but since you are so busy, we haven\u2019t eaten together even once, have we?\u201d Trempel asked chidingly.Eugene replied, \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d\u201cEven though I\u2019ve heard that you haven\u2019t been out of Akron in the last nine hours? There\u2019s no way Sir Eugene isn\u2019t aware of the rule that eating and drinking are not allowed in Akron,\u201d Trempel confidently declared.It looked like the director must have spilled the beans.Eugene glanced at the closed door to the director\u2019s office before replying, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I ate a bit too much at breakfast. If I had at least been able to move my body around a bit more actively, I would have digested it all already, but since I\u2019ve just been sitting and reading, I haven\u2019t been able to digest anything.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you weren\u2019t able to digest anything after nine hours?\u201d Trempel asked skeptically.\u201cWhat\u2019s so hard to believe? In any case, let\u2019s put off getting a meal until next\u2014\u201d\u201cAgain with the next time? Sir Eugene, I didn\u2019t want to say this, but\u2026 I\u2019ve heard \u2018next time\u2019 so many times that it feels like those words are getting stuck in my ear.\u201d\u201cI simply don\u2019t have an appetite right now.\u201dAlthough Trempel\u2019s gaze grew piercing, Eugene didn\u2019t change his reply. It was obvious what this old wizard was trying to talk to him about. Promising him an important position in the Court Wizards and such\u2026.Aroth\u2019s Court Wizards Corps was considered one of the best Magic Corps on the entire continent. The treatment the members received was correspondingly excellent, and many wizards wished to become a member. Though no matter how prestigious or impressive it might be, in the end, it was still a military force, and during a time of peace like the one they had now, it was just another public office.\u2018Do they think I\u2019m crazy?\u2019\u00a0Eugene scoffed to himself.Eugene was only nineteen-years-old. He didn\u2019t want to get tied down somewhere so soon. And among all his choices, he especially disliked the idea of joining a military force.No matter how peaceful the world was, an army was still an army. Although it would be easy to rely on the names of the Lionheart Clan and Crown Prince Honein to get by in the hellish hierarchy-based system that was an army, Eugene still wouldn\u2019t be able to live as freely and as comfortably as he did now.\u2018Why is he trying to avoid such a great opportunity?\u2019\u00a0Trempel thought to himself as he felt frustrated.\u00a0\u2018Could he truly have accepted an offer from somewhere else?\u2019Such thoughts caused Trempel to become nervous.Eugene was currently the disciple of the Red Tower Master, Lovelllian. Although the position of a Tower Master wasn\u2019t hereditary, if Eugene\u2019s talent was paired with Lovellian\u2019s teachings and the influence of the Lionheart clan, he would be sure to rise to the position of the Red Tower Master.Trempel couldn\u2019t allow this to happen. Aroth\u2019s Towers of Magic and the Royal Palace might be in a cooperative relationship, but they weren\u2019t truly of one mind. Trempel wanted to drag Eugene into the Court Wizards Corps by whatever means necessary. If he could achieve that, it would be easy for them to obtain the cooperation of the Lionheart clan with Eugene\u2019s background\u2026.\u2018There\u2019s no way it could be that old fogey, Jeneric,\u2019\u00a0Trempel decided.Jeneric Osman was the Green Tower Master.Trempel didn\u2019t believe that geezer could have swayed Eugene. Just think about it. When Eugene first arrived in Akron two years ago, Jeneric and the Head of the Wizards Guild had been the only two to oppose granting Eugene an entrance pass until the last moment.It was understandable why the Head of the Wizards Guild had taken such a position. Although it may have also been due to a question of fairness, there were surely personal feelings involved as well. The black wizard who had gotten close to Eward had been a member of the Wizards\u2019 Guild. Though Balzac, the Black Tower Master, had been able to profess that he had had nothing to do with the incident, this left the Head of the Wizards Guild in a position where he couldn\u2019t say the same.In Aroth, where the power lay firmly in the hands of the Towers of Magic, the strength of the Wizards Guild couldn\u2019t help but be diminished. Most perceived the Wizards Guild to be made up of a bunch of amateur wizards who weren\u2019t able to join one of the Towers of Magic, and unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t really deny the reality of this.But if that was the case, why had Jeneric also opposed it?The answer was simple. Because the one who had recommended Eugene was Lovellian.Three hundred years ago, when the Wise Sienna had served as the Green Tower Master, two of the three disciples that she had taken had remained in the Green Tower of Magic, while the remaining disciple transferred over to the Red Tower of Magic.These days, Aroth\u2019s many wizards revered the Wise Sienna as their great master. However, Jeneric and Lovellian were the only ones who could legitimately claim to be part of Sienna\u2019s line of succession.The two of Sienna\u2019s disciples who chose to remain in the Green Tower of Magic got married, had a child, and passed down their magic onto him. This child was the former Green Tower Master and Jeneric\u2019s father.There was no way that Jeneric\u2019s family would be on friendly terms with the Red Tower of Magic. According to them, the third disciple\u2019s audacity to leave the Green Tower of Magic where their master had taught and take root in a different Tower of Magic bordered on blasphemy.Jeneric had inherited this line of succession through his blood and hated Lovellian even more. If Lovellian didn\u2019t exist, then only Jeneric would be able to claim the legitimacy of the inheritance Sienna had passed down to her disciples. This would grant his bloodline a power that could not be ignored in this magical kingdom that worshiped Sienna.So Lovellian\u2019s very existence could be considered a thorn in Jeneric\u2019s eye. This annoyance, Lovellian, also happened to be on excellent terms with the Patriarch of the Lionheart clan. Due to this, Lovellian had even taken the Lionheart\u2019s eldest son into the Red Tower and given him special treatment. When that eldest son was caught doing something foolish, the adopted son of the Lionheart\u2019s family had been sent to replace him.That was why Jeneric had taken the opposing side on that issue. But after Lovellian took Eugene as his disciple, Jeneric began paying Eugene renewed attention. There was truth in the saying that in most cases, the other person\u2019s share always seems bigger. So out of jealousy, Jeneric hoped to somehow persuade Eugene to leave the Red Tower of Magic.Apart from the Green Tower of Magic and the Court Wizards Corps, many others were interested in Eugene.The White Tower of Magic, Melkith, who had had the Cloak of Darkness taken from her for a whole nine years, hoped to somehow persuade Eugene to allow her to borrow Wynnyd again. Or, if not that, she hoped to at least convince him to return the Cloak of Darkness. But these materialistic desires weren\u2019t the only reason she was paying attention to him, as Eugene had shown that he could freely control mid-level wind spirits.As for the Black Tower of Magic, although it wasn\u2019t openly stated, rumors had spread among the Tower Masters that Balzac was interested in Eugene. Due to the incident with Eward, the hostility between the Lionheart clan and the Black Tower of Magic had only deepened, so it seemed that Balzac somehow wanted to improve their relationship.Only the Blue Tower of Magic was showing complete indifference to Eugene.Trempel decided to change the subject, \u201c...Ahem, Sir Eugene. Well\u2026 is your thesis going smoothly?\u201d\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Eugene replied curtly.\u201cIf you wish, I can help you review it,\u201d Trempel eagerly offered. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m fully aware that your teacher, the Red Tower Master, is already in charge of your review. However, the more advice you receive, the better, right?\u201dEugene started to reject him, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m grateful for your offer\u2014\u201d\u201cHold on. Don\u2019t refuse just yet. It feels a bit embarrassing to say this myself, but in the end, isn\u2019t the Red Tower of Magic specialized in summoning magic? Not only am I good at summoning magic, but I\u2019m also capable in battle magic. After all, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the commander of the Court Wizards for nothing.\u201d Trempel quickly added, \u201cMy advice is sure to be different from the advice given by the Red Tower Master, who specializes in summoning magic.\u201d\u201cThough that might be the case, it\u2019s not like Sir Trempel knows what kind of thesis I\u2019ve been preparing, right?\u201d Eugene asked doubtfully.That\u2019s because the only one you\u2019ve shown it to is the Red Tower Master.\u00a0These words threatened to escape Trempel\u2019s throat, only for him to swallow them back down with a gulp.Trempel laughed, \u201cHa ha\u2026. I might not know what it is, but I can find out just by reading it, right? I\u2019m just as keen on the guidance of juniors as any of the Tower Masters. I also regularly publish theses with the Magic Society of Aroth, and I\u2019ve reviewed the theses of my juniors on many occasions.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful for your offer, but really, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Eugene rejected him once more. \u201cSir Trempel, If I accept your offer after having already gotten to this point, I\u2019m afraid that I would be committing a great disrespect to my teacher, Master Lovellian.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
