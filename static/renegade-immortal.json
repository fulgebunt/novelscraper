    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 Leaving HomeTie Zhu was sitting on the side of a little road in the village, looking at the blue sky in a daze. Tie Zhu was not his real name, but due to having a weak body since he was little, his father was afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep him alive and gave him this traditional nickname.His real name was Wang Lin. The Wang family was considered a big family name in the area, a family of carpenters. The Wang family was well known in the area, and owned a number of shops that sold wood products.Tie Zhu\u2019s father was the second son of the family. He was born from a concubine, therefore, he couldn\u2019t take over the family business, so he left the house after he got married and settled in this village.However, due to his father being a skilled carpenter, Tie Zhu\u2019s family was pretty well off, not having to worry about food or clothes. They were well respected within the village.Tie Zhu had always been very intelligent since he was little. He loved to read books and had a lot of ideas. Almost everyone in the village agreed that he was a prodigy. Every time his father heard someone praise Tie Zhu, the wrinkles on his face would fade and he would reveal a happy smile.His mother cared for him a lot. One could say that he had grown up in his parents\u2019 love. He knew that his parents had high expectations of him. Other children his age were all working in the fields, while he sat at home reading.As one reads more, ideas come naturally. He yearned for the world outside of the village. Tie Zhu raised his head, looked at the end of the road, let out a sigh, closed his book, got up, and walked home.His father was sitting in the courtyard. Holding a pipe, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cTie Zhu, how goes your studies?\u201d as Tie Zhu walked through the door.Tie Zhu muttered a few words as he passed by. His father shook the ashes out of his pipe, rose up, and said, \u201cTie Zhu, you have to study properly. Next year is the district exam. Whether you have a future or not will all depend on this exam, don\u2019t end up like me, who will spend my entire life in a village.\u201d\u201cHoney, you complain about this every day. If you ask me, our Tie Zhu will definitely pass the exam!\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s mother carried over some food and set it on the table. She gestured at the two to come and eat.Tie Zhu responded with a sound, then sat down and casually ate a few mouthfuls. His mother affectionately looked at him and passed him the few pieces of meat there were.\u201cDad, is Fourth Uncle almost here?\u201d Tie Zhu asked, as he raised his head.\u201cCalculating the time, it should be within these next few days. Your fourth uncle is more successful than your father. Hey, Tie Zhu\u2019s mom, have the mountain dishes prepared for Fourth Uncle all been packed?\u201d The moment Tie Zhu\u2019s father mentioned Fourth Uncle, there was a hint of sadness on his face.His mom nodded and emotionally said, \u201cTie Zhu, your fourth uncle is a very good person. In these past few years, it was all thanks to him that your father\u2019s wood carvings have stayed at a good price. If you are able to achieve success, don\u2019t forget to repay your fourth uncle.\u201dAs Tie Zhu\u2019s mom was talking, the sound of a horse was heard outside the door. Following the sound of the horse drawn carriage, a hearty laugh could be heard.\u201cSecond Brother, open the door!\u201dTie Zhu was surprised. He immediately rushed to open the main gate. He saw a strong middle aged man with bright eyes standing outside. He called out Tie Zhu\u2019s name, laughed, and rubbed Tie Zhu\u2019s head. Smiling, he said, \u201cTie Zhu, I only haven\u2019t seen you in half a year and you have grown taller again.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s parents immediately stood up. His father, smiling, said, \u201cFourth Brother, I figured it was about time you arrived. Hurry inside. Tie Zhu, why haven\u2019t you gotten a chair for your fourth uncle yet?\u201dTie Zhu happily agreed. He hurried back into the house, took out a chair, and placed it next to the dining table. He carefully wiped it with his sleeves while looking hopefully at the middle-aged man.The middle-aged man winked in his direction and jokingly said, \u201cTie Zhu, since when were you so diligent? I remember the last time I was here, you were not like this.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father glanced at Tie Zhu and said, \u201cThis little rascal was just inquiring about when you would arrive.\u201dThe middle age man saw Tie Zhu blushing and laughingly said, \u201cTie Zhu, your fourth uncle hasn\u2019t forgotten his promise to you.\u201d After he finished speaking, he took out two books and placed them on the table.Tie Zhu excitedly cheered, then flipped through the books. He could barely contain his excitement.Tie Zhu\u2019s mom kindly glanced at her son and said to the middle-aged man, \u201cFourth Brother, your older brother is always thinking of you. This time, you should stay for a few days.\u201dThe middle-aged man shook his head and said, \u201cSecond Sister-in-Law, there are many matters to attend to in the family these days. I must head home early tomorrow morning. After this busy time, I\u2019ll come back and see you guys.\u201d He gave his second brother a regretful look.Tie Zhu\u2019s father sighed, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to my wife. Properly pack the goods tomorrow. The family\u2019s matters are more important. We can meet next time.\u201dThe middle aged man looked at Tie Zhu\u2019s father and asked, \u201cSecond Brother, Tie Zhu is 15 years old, yes?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father nodded and said, \u201cAfter this year, this little rascal is going to be 16. In a flash, more than 10 years has quickly passed by.\u201d He look at his son dotingly.The middle-aged man pondered for a while and said, in a serious tone, \u201cSecond Brother, Second Sister-in-Law, I have something to tell you: the Heng Yue Sect is taking in disciple. This year, the family has three recommendation slots and I received one of them.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father was stunned and said, with a pale face, \u201cHeng Yue Sect? But the Heng Yue Sect is full of immortals.\u201dThe middle-aged man smiled, nodded, and said, \u201cSecond Brother, it is that very immortal sect! Our family is still a prominent one in the area and has the qualifications to recommend potential disciples. You know my boy, he can\u2019t really study, but is good with swords and knives. I doubt the immortal sect will take my son. This spot is really precious. I know Tie Zhu has been very smart since he was little and has always loved to study. He might have a chance.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mother felt delighted and said, \u201cFourth Brother this \u2026 this \u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man rubbed Tie Zhu\u2019s head and said, \u201cSecond Brother, Second Sister-in-Law, from my view, let this matter be settled. Let Tie Zhu try; if he really gets accepted, it is his fortune.\u201dTie Zhu confusedly looked at his parents and his fourth uncle. He wasn\u2019t able to understand what was going on. \u201cImmortals? What are immortals?\u201d Tie Zhu softly and hesitantly asked.The middle-aged man\u2019s face turned serious. Looking at Tie Zhu, he said, \u201cTie Zhu, immortals are those who can fly in the sky, and are simply not something us mortals can understand.\u201dTie Zhu grew curious of immortals.Tie Zhu\u2019s father excitedly got up, pulled Tie Zhu\u2019s mom, and bowed to the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man quickly pulled them up and sincerely said, \u201cSecond Brother, what are you doing? My mother died early. If it wasn\u2019t for Second Brother\u2019s mother taking care of me, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. Tie Zhu is my nephew and this is the least I can do.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father started crying. He heavily patted the middle-aged man\u2019s back, nodded his head, and sternly said to Tie Zhu, \u201cRemember, Wang Lin, never forget what your fourth uncle has done for us or else I will not consider you my son!\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s heart trembled. Although he was ignorant towards immortals, he could tell from parent\u2019s expressions that they viewed this matter with great importance. He knelt in front of his fourth uncle and kowtowed a few times.The middle-aged man pulled up Tie Zhu and praised him. \u201cGood child. You get ready and I\u2019ll pick you up at the end of the month.\u201dThat night, Tie Zhu went to bed early. He could still hear sounds from his father and fourth uncle. Father was very happy. Even though he rarely drank, he had to drink a few cups with Fourth Uncle today.Immortals, what were they? Tie Zhu\u2019s heart was very excited. He knew in his heart that this was an opportunity, an opportunity to see the outside world!Fourth Uncle left early the next morning. Tie Zhu and his parents saw him off at the village entrance. On the way back, he noticed that his father looked a lot younger. His eyes were filled with hope.The expectations in his eyes were much greater than the time he wanted Tie Zhu to pass the district exam.There was no secret in the village, even if it was how many pups a dog gave birth to. Everyone in the village would hear the news. Soon, everyone in the village knew the news from Tie Zhu\u2019s mother and all the neighbors came in to visit. Everyone\u2019s eyes were different from before as they looked at Tie Zhu with envy and jealousy.\u201cThe Wang family gave birth a good son. He has been accepted as a disciple of the Heng Yue Sect.\u201d\u201cI have watched this child, Tie Zhu, as he grew up! He was very smart since he was little. Now he is a Heng Yue Sect disciple. He has a very promising future.\u201d\u201cTie Zhu, you have great talent! When you are successful in the future, don\u2019t forget to come back and visit.\u201dThese talks filled Tie Zhu\u2019s ears, acting like Tie Zhu was already a Heng Yue Sect disciple. Every time his parents heard it, they couldn\u2019t stop smiling. The wrinkles on their faces had lessened greatly.Whenever Tie Zhu would walk alone in the village, all of the villagers passionately asked him about this and that. There were even people who told their kids to follow Tie Zhu as an example.Half a month passed by quickly. The news of Tie Zhu becoming a Heng Yue Sect disciple quickly spread. All of the villagers nearby came to see Tie Zhu.Everyone who came by brought gifts. Tie Zhu\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t reject them, but as they left, Tie\u2019s Zhu\u2019s parents planned return gifts. According to Tie Zhu\u2019s father, \u201cOur son will be an immortal in the future, so he can\u2019t owe any favors. We will prepare return gifts for all the visitors.\u201dSoon, the Wang family learned that Tie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle gave his son\u2019s spot to Tie Zhu. One after another, they came to congratulate him.Tie Zhu\u2019s father attached great importance to the visiting relatives, as many of them used to look down on him in the past and drove him out of the family all those years ago. Now that they were all coming to visit him, he swept away his sorrows.He and Tie Zhu\u2019s mother discussed a bit and decided to properly entertain everyone. They spent a fortune to hire the village teacher to write invitations to send to their relatives.The village teacher didn\u2019t want money, but wanted Tie Zhu to acknowledge that he grew up studying in his care. Tie Zhu had no objections as this was the truth.After the invitations were sent to most of the Wang family members, there were so many people that Tie Zhu\u2019s dad had to move the party\u2019s location to the village square and set up a feast.The villagers helped entertain the guests. As they spoke to each other, they would praise Tie Zhu endlessly.Tie Zhu\u2019s dad brought his wife and son to the village entrance to personally greet the guests and introduce each relative to Tie Zhu.\u201cThis is your third grandfather. When Father left the family, your third grandfather secretly helped a lot. Tie Zhu, you have to remember to repay his kindness,\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s father said, as he helped a white-haired old man.Tie Zhu quickly agreed. The old man looked at Tie Zhu and said, \u201cLao Er, time passes by so fast. Your son is already this big! He has better prospects than you.Tie Zhu\u2019s father\u2019s face was full of radiance. He smiled, and said, \u201cThird Grandfather, Tie Zhu has been smart ever since he was a kid. He was bound to be better than me. Take your time. Wife, help support Third Grandfather.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mother quickly helped the old man walk toward the feast.Seeing the old man leaving, Tie Zhu\u2019s father let out a snort and said to Tie Zhu, \u201cThis old guy looked down on your dad and forced me away. Now that you have a good future, he comes to congratulate me. He is just that kind of relative.\u201dTie Zhu cluelessly nodded and asked, \u201cIs Fourth Uncle coming?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father shook his head. \u201cYour fourth uncle sent a letter. He won\u2019t be able to come back until the end of the month.\u201dAt that moment, another carriage arrived at the village entrance. A 50-plus-year-old man came out. He looked at Tie Zhu\u2019s father and said, \u201cLao Er, congratulations!\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father\u2019s face turned complicated and said, \u201cBig Brother!\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes swept across and looked at Tie Zhu. He smiled. \u201cLao Er, so this is your son? Not bad! Maybe he will really be selected.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father frowned, stretched, and said, \u201cTie Zhu might not have much merit, but he is smart and loves to read books. He is bound to be selected.\u201d\u201cThat is not necessarily true. When immortal sects look for disciples, there are very strict requirements. I see this kid is very dumb. Going is a waste of time,\u201d said a haughty voice from the carriage, as a 16 or 17 year old boy stepped out.The young boy looked very pretty. He had eyebrows like scimitars, a face like Guan Yu, and eyes full of disdain.Tie Zhu\u2019s father glared at him and Wang Lin gave him a deep look, but didn\u2019t say anything.The old man\u2019s face changed color and shouted, \u201cWang Zhuo, how can you be so rude?! This is your second uncle and your little brother Wang Lin, why haven\u2019t you greeted them?!\u201d He turned to Tie Zhu\u2019s father and said, \u201cMy son\u2019s speech is ugly. Lao Er, don\u2019t mind him, but\u2026\u201d As he was talking, he suddenly turned and said, \u201cBut Lao Er, it is not a simple matter for these immortals to accept a disciple\u2013it is a matter of fate. This time, it\u2019s because the Heng Yue Sect was very interested in my son that our Wang family was given three spots, including his.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father snorted and said, \u201cIf your son can do it, then my son will definitely be selected!\u201dThe youth laughed, not caring about the old man\u2019s words. With disdain, he said, \u201cSo, you are Second Uncle. I suggest you don\u2019t be so optimistic. The way of cultivation is very complex, and only one in ten thousand people can even learn it. How can he compete with me, who, while not being an official disciple yet, was personally selected by an immortal teacher?\u201dThe old man\u2019s face flashed with a color of pride, \u201cscolded\u201d the youth, and brought him toward the feast.\u201cTie Zhu, don\u2019t worry. Even if you are not selected, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is always the district exam next year.\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s father earnestly said, after suppressing his anger.Wang Lin confidently whispered, \u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be selected!\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s dad gently patted his son\u2019s shoulder. His eyes were filled with rays of hope.One after another, they greeted a lot of relatives. Tie Zhu\u2019s father took him back to the feast. In front of them was a bustling scene of people celebrating.Tie Zhu\u2019s father cried out, \u201cMy dear relatives, my fellow villagers, I, Wang Tianshui, am not a very cultured man and don\u2019t have much to say, but today, I\u2019m very happy because my son has a chance to become a Heng Yue Sect disciple. This is the happiest moment of my life. I won\u2019t say more, but thank you all for coming.\u201d He raised his cup and drained it of the wine within.\u201cLao Er, your son has been very smart ever since he was little. He will definitely be selected like Wang Zhu\u2019s son and become an immortal.\u201d\u201cSecond Brother, having a son like Tie Zhu, you have not lived your life in vain. In the future, all you have to do is wait to enjoy the good fortune.\u201d\u201cTie Zhu, you must make your father proud! This time, no matter what, you must enter the Heng Yue Sect!\u201dThere were numerous bright scenes everywhere. The sounds of celebration came from all sides, but there were many people, like Wang Zhuo\u2019s father, who on the surface was giving his congratulations, but in his heart had always looked down upon his brother and his brother\u2019s son. He looked at his son, and then at Tie Zhu. He felt very dissatisfied. Fourth Brother\u2019s actions were outside of his expectations, but as the immortals weren\u2019t blind, there was no way Tie Zhu would be selected.People passed by, one by one. Tie Zhu\u2019s father pulled Tie Zhu around from table to table to give a toast and introduce various unknown relatives to him.Today, Tie Zhu\u2019s father drank a lot of wine. He was never this well regarded. The feast lasted until it was very late and everyone started to head home. Before leaving, and still with a look of contempt, Wang Zhuo, while no one noticed, whispered to Tie Zhu, \u201cLittle fool, you won\u2019t be selected. You don\u2019t have the ability.\u201dHe left with his father as he displayed a smile full of contempt.After returning home, Tie Zhu lied on his bed. He secretly decided in his heart that he must be selected no matter what!Half a month passed by quickly. Today, Tie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle arrived in a carriage.Tie Zhu\u2019s parents quickly welcomed him inside. The middle-aged man washed his face and hurriedly said, \u201cSecond Brother, Second Sister-in-Law, I can\u2019t stay long this time. I\u2019m taking Tie Zhu and leaving. The Heng Yue Sect will arrive to pick up the potential disciples tomorrow morning.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father was stunned. A trace of sadness appeared on his face. He firmly said, \u201cFine. Tie Zhu, follow your fourth uncle. If you are selected, study dutifully at the Heng Yue Sect. However, if you aren\u2019t selected, don\u2019t worry and come back home.\u201dTie Zhu, not wanting to leave his parents, nodded heavily. His mother took out a parcel from the room and lovingly said, \u201cTie Zhu, listen to your fourth uncle and don\u2019t cause any trouble; the outside is not the same as home. You must have patience. Mother has prepared you some new clothes. Also, there are some of your favorite, baked sweet potatoes. Mother will miss you. If you are not selected, just come back.\u201d As Tie Zhu\u2019s mom was talking, tears began appearing in her eyes.Tie Zhu had never left the village ever since he was born. This was his first time leaving.Fourth Uncle emotionally said, \u201cTie Zhu, you must be selected to make your parents proud. Second Brother, Second Sister-in-Law, the family will have a big celebration in a few days, so I am too busy today. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll pick you guys up. The results for the three candidates should be out by then.\u201dHe quickly pulled Tie Zhu onto the carriage, whipped the horse, and set off.With tears in their eyes, Tie Zhu\u2019s parents stared at the carriage as it quickly disappeared into the distance.\u201cTie Zhu has never left home before. Will he be bullied?\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s mom said, while biting her lip. Her eyes were filled with sadness.\u201cHe has grown up and has to deal with his own fortune.\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s father picked up his pipe and inhaled deeply. More wrinkles appeared on his face.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 ImmortalsThe carriage quickly rolled along the road. Wang Lin\u2019s body bounced with the uneven ground. In his arm was the package that contained all of his parents\u2019 hope as he left the village he had lived in for 15 years.The trip won\u2019t be a short one. Wang Lin lied down and fell asleep in the carriage. Not knowing how much time had passed, he was gently nudged. He opened his eyes and looked up to see fourth uncle, who looked at him with smiling face and asked, \u201cTie Zhu, how do you feel about leaving home for the first time?\u201dWang Lin noticed that the carriage had stopped and smiled. \u201cNot much to say, just a little afraid if I will be selected by the immortals or not.\u201dFourth uncle let out a laugh and patted Tie Zhu\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t over think it. This is uncle\u2019s house. You go rest first, then I\u2019ll take you to the family tomorrow morning.\u201dAfter getting off the carriage, in front of Wang Lin was a tile roofed house. He followed fourth uncle to a room. Wang Lin sat on the bed. He was unable to sleep. The things that his parents, the villagers, and relatives said flashed through his mind. He signed in his heart. The thought of becoming the disciple of an immortal become heavier in his mind.Time passed by, bit by bit. A moment later, the sun gradually started to rise. Wang Lin didn\u2019t get much rest throughout the night, but he was still full of energy. With a trace of fear, he followed fourth uncle to the main house of the Wang family.This was the first time Wang Lin had seen a house this big, leaving him in a daze. Fourth uncle said, while walking, \u201cTie Zhu, you have to make your father proud. Don\u2019t let the relatives ridicule you.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s mind became more tense. He bit his lips and nodded.Soon, fourth uncle brought him to the middle of the courtyard. Tie Zhu\u2019s father\u2019s eldest brother was standing there. When he saw Tie Zhu, he nodded and said, \u201cTie Zhu, when the immortal arrives, don\u2019t freak out, just follow your older brother Wang Zhuo. Do everything he does.\u201dThe old man\u2019s tone was very hard on those last few words.Wang Lin stayed silent. He looked around and noticed that besides Wang Zhuo, there was another youth. The youth\u2019s skin was a bit dark, his build was very large, and his eyes showed a hint of intelligence. There was a bulge in his shirt, like he was hiding something.He look at Tie Zhu and made a face, then ran over and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re second uncle\u2019s son? My name is Wang Hao.\u201dWang Lin chuckled and nodded.When the old man saw Wang Lin ignoring him, he became very annoyed and was about to scold him.Right at that moment, the clouds in the sky suddenly split. A sword of light suddenly descended like lightning. After the light disappeared, there stood a youth in white, whose eyes were bright and piercing, emitting an elegant spirit. This cold eyes swept across the three youths, especially at the youth with the bulge in his shirt. He coldly asked, \u201cAre these three the ones recommended by the Wang family?\u201d\u201cThis is an immortal?\u201d Under his gaze, Wang Lin started to feel cold. His heart started pounding and his face became pale while staring at the immortal.The dark skinned youth, after seeing the immortal, placed his hands near the pockets of his pants, showing a respectful demeanour. His eyes held a fanatical expression.Only Wang Zhuo casually looked at the others and snorted.Wang Zhuo\u2019s father quickly stepped forward and respectfully said, \u201cImmortal, these three are the Wang family\u2019s recommended youths.\u201dThe youth nodded and impatiently said, \u201cWho is Wang Zhuo?\u201dThe old man\u2019s face showed a flash of happiness, then he quickly pulled Wang Zhuo. \u201cImmortal, this is my son, Wang Zhuo.\u201dThe immortal youth gave Wang Zhuo a deep look. His face brightened and he nodded. \u201cWang Zhuo is indeed talented. No wonder Uncle-Master took a liking to him.\u201dWang Zhuo proudly looked at Wang Lin and proudly said, \u201cThis is natural. In order to become an immortal, one must have a strong spirit.\u201dThe youth made a frown, but it quickly disappeared. He directed a faint a smile at Wang Zhuo\u2019s direction, waved his sleeves, and took the three youths on the rainbow and disappeared.Fourth uncle looked into the sky and muttered, \u201cTie Zhu, you must be selected!\u201dWang Lin felt his body lighten. The wind hitting his face caused him pain. On closer inspection, he noticed that he was under the arm of the youth, flying quickly through the sky. The village turned into little black dots as they quickly flew forward.After just a little while, the wind caused his eyes to turn red and tear up.\u201cUnless you three want to become blind, close your eyes,\u201d the youth coldly said. Wang Lin\u2019s heart tensed. He quickly closed his eyes, afraid to keep looking.After a short period of time, Wang Lin could feel that the youth was short of breath and that his speed started decreasing. Then, in a flash, the youth quickly descended. The moment before landing, the youth loosened his arm and the three youths fell to the ground.Thankfully, the fall wasn\u2019t hard. The three got up quickly. In front of Wang Lin was a paradise-like scene, with mountains, flowers, and a river. It was a truly idyllic scene.Straight ahead was a towering mountain. Its peak was covered in clouds, which hid its true appearance. Echoes of beasts\u2019 cries could be heard. There was a path of twisted steps that snaked its way down the mountain, like a painting, evoking a feeling of a different world.Far off in the in the distance, at the top of the mountain, stood a hall. Even though it was covered by the clouds, the shining bright light made people to want to worship it.Next to the hall was a silver colored bridge with the shape of a crescent moon, which connected that peak with another mountain peak.With these natural beauties, this was truly worthy of being the location of the Heng Yue Sect. The Heng Yue Sect was one of the few existing immortal sects. 500 years ago, it was the leading force of the entire cultivation world, with many branch sects. However, with the passage of time, it had shrunk to its current size and was only barely able to have a foothold in the cultivation world.However, for the mortals near the Heng Yue sect, it was still an elusive figure.\u201cLittle brother Zhang, are these the three candidates recommended by the Wang family?\u201d A middle aged man dressed in black with an immortal demeanor floated down from the mountain\u2019s peak.The youth showed a face full of respect and said, \u201cThird brother, these are the Wang family\u2019s three recommended youths.\u201dThe middle aged man\u2019s gaze swept across them. He focused on Wang Zhuo a few times. Smiling, he said, \u201cI know you are about to have a breakthrough. I\u2019ll handle the test, you go cultivate.\u201dThe youth agreed. His body moved toward the mountain, and in the blink of an eye, disappeared without a trace.Wang Lin stared at the scene before him, full of excitement. Suddenly, he noticed someone tugging his clothes and turned around. It was Wang Hao. His eyes were filled with excitement. He said, \u201cThis is where the immortals live! F*ck my grandmother! No matter what, I, Wang Hao, must be selected.\u201d Saying so, he touched the bulging object concealed in his shirt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 \u2013 TestWang Zhuo was dazed by the scene before him. It took a long time for him to recover his senses, and the amount of arrogance in his heart had shrunk.At that moment, several rainbow colored swords flew toward them. For each sword that dissipated, there was a Heng Yue Sect disciple, each followed by several 15 year olds.There were both male and female youths. As they landed, they too had similar expressions to Wang Lin\u2019s group as they stared at the scene in front of them with different expressions.All of the Heng Yue Sect disciples that brought the youths gathered at the side and started talking about the youths. After waiting for a while, all the other youths who had been recommended arrived at the sect. A black clad middle aged man scanned the area. He emotionlessly said, \u201cAmong the lot of you, only a few will be selected to be Heng Yue Sect disciples.\u201dAll of the youths cried out in shock. Wang Lin\u2019s heart shuddered. He counted a total of 48 people taking the test.\u201cCultivation, the path to becoming an immortal, depends on your natural talent. The first test is to see whether or not your spirit is strong enough. Now, whoever I point to will come up and take the test.\u201d The middle aged man emotionlessly pointed at a youth.The youth\u2019s legs trembled. He walked over carefully. The middle aged man put his hand on his head and said, \u201cNot qualified, stand to the left.\u201dThe youth suddenly lost all strength. Face looking bleak and eyes blank, he moved to the left in silence.Then, another youth was pointed at. He moved forward with a fearful expression.\u201cNot qualified.\u201d\u201cNot qualified.\u201d\u201cNot qualified.\u201dTen people in a row all failed the test. Up until now, there was still no one to the right of the middle aged man.It was Wang Zhuo\u2019s turn. All of his previous pride had disappeared from his face. Looking pale, he stepped forward.After the middle aged man put his hand on Wang Zhuo\u2019s head, his face suddenly lit up and asked, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201dWang Zhuo quickly replied respectfully, \u201cImmortal Hui Bing, my name is Wang Zhuo.\u201dThe middle aged man nodded. He smiled, and said, \u201cSo, you are the one Martial Teacher mentioned. Good, Wang Zhuo, stand to the right.\u201dWang Zhuo felt exaltation and walked toward the right under everyone\u2019s admiration. His eyes were filled with arrogance and contempt as he looked at the crowd. He felt untouchable.\u201cMother f*cker, he is one lucky dog.\u201d Wang Hao murmured to Wang Lin, while curling his lip.Wang Lin\u2019s heart became more tense. In front of his eyes rose his parents\u2019 eyes, filled with expectations. He tightened his fists.\u201cNot bad. You also stand to the right,\u201d said the middle aged man, surprised, to the young girl in front of him.After a short period of time, almost all of youths had been tested and only two stood to the right of the middle aged man. Wang Hao was up next.Wang Hao quickly ran up to the middle aged man. Before he could even start the test, he knelt to the ground and kowtowed a few times. He said, \u201cImmortal Hui Bing, may you enjoy a long life! My name is Wang Hao. You already tested so many people! You must be tired. Why don\u2019t you rest for a while. I\u2019m in no rush, it\u2019s no problem.\u201dThe middle aged man laughed out loud. Testing so many people whose faces were filled with fear, yet this clever youth here, without the slightest bit of fear, was trying to win favor with him. He pressed his hand on Wang Hao\u2019s head and said, \u201cSpirit is lacking, not\u2026\u201dThe moment Wang Hao heard his spirit was lacking, his heart plummeted. Without waiting for the middle aged man to finish, he quickly pulled out a jaded box and presented it front of him. Wang Hao wisely said, \u201cImmortal Hui Bing, my father found this by accident in the mountain, but was unable to open it. I especially brought it to give to Immortal Hui Bing.\u201dThe middle aged man chuckled as he shook his head. He was about to refuse Wang Hao, but as he scanned the box, his pupils suddenly contracted. His face suddenly lit up. \u201cNot bad! This is an at least 300 year old mushroom. Looking at the jade box, it was sealed by a cultivator. No wonder your father couldn\u2019t open it.\u201d He paused, then said, with a slightly faltering voice, \u201cI\u2019m in need of a helper for my pill concoction, are you willing to be my helper?\u201dWang Hao, surprised, got up quickly. The difference in treatment was like heaven and earth, causing him to be very excited. He exclaimed, \u201cYes Immortal Hui Bing, I am willing!\u201dThe middle aged man said, while chuckling, \u201cBeing my helper, I won\u2019t mistreat you. You can cultivate just like the other disciples. Go stand to the right.\u201dWang Hao was very excited in his heart. He ran to the right side and faced Wang Zhuo with a triumphant stare.The faces of all the youths that failed turn pale. All of them felt very depressed. A few even started crying.The middle aged man frowned. He shouted, \u201cSend away all those who started crying.\u201dA few of the Heng Yue Sect disciples stepped out. They quickly took the ones that started crying and casually disappeared in swords of light.The middle aged man pointed at Wang Lin.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He nervously walked toward the side of the middle aged man. His mind was completely blank. Praying silently in his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but remember the expectations in his parents\u2019 eyes.\u201cI will definitely be selected!\u201d Wang Lin thought, with determination.The middle aged man\u2019s hand pressed on his head. With a deadpan face, he said the two words Wang Lin dreaded the most.\u201cNot qualified!\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t remember how he had made it to the left side, he only heard the spring thunder roaring in his ears and echoing the two words the middle aged man had said.After a moment, everyone had been tested, and only three people stood to the right. In the eyes of everyone else, the three were insurmountable and immensely tall.Wang Zhuo looked at Wang Lin with face full of contempt, fully expressing his disdain for him.\u201cWhile a strong spirit is needed in order to be a cultivator, perseverance is even more important. Even ordinary students like you, with enough perseverance, can become a sect disciple! The second test is perseverance!\u201d The middle aged man paused, then said, with a deadpan face, \u201cFollow the steps up. If you reach the top, you are qualified. If you\u2019re not finished within three days, you fail. Those who fail will be returned to their families. If you cannot endure any longer or meet danger, just yell out loud and someone will come and save you.\u201dThe middle aged man smiled to the three on his right and said, \u201cYou two, follow me to meet the patriarch. We will also find you masters. Wang Hao, you don\u2019t need to go. Come with me to the pill house so you can get used to the place.\u201dAfter the middle aged man finished giving instructions, he took the three selected youths and disappeared into the mountains.Wang Lin took a deep breath. His eyes were full of determination. He walked up the stone steps with no hesitation and started the test of perseverance.Aside from the three selected youths and the six crying youths who were taken away, thirty nine remained.Among these 39 youths, the ones that were very depressed, the ones very determined, and those who were scared all walked towards their own future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 \u2013 HeartlessThe uneven stone steps were very dangerous on both sides. The slightest mistake would cause one to slip and fall.After less than half a day, Wang Lin\u2019s legs felt like they were made of lead. He was sweaty and out of breath, it was difficult to even move. Looking up from the bottom of the mountain, the trail didn\u2019t seem long, but now, this trail felt like it had no end. Wang Lin\u2019s heart sank. He could not help but generate thoughts of despair.In front of him there were a dozen physically strong boys, slowly climbing. They were all also out of breath. Until now, no one had given up.Wang Lin gritted his teeth. He knew this was his last chance. His parents\u2019 expectations filled his mind. At that very moment, the foot of a boy behind him slipped. The boy fell off the side of the mountain with a scream.\u201cI give up! HELP!\u201dEverybody stopped to looked down at the same time and saw a dark light flashing by. A Heng Yue Sect disciple appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the boy. Their bodies could be seen gently falling to the foot of the mountain.Wang Lin was pale and silent. He carefully continued climbing upwards. Time seemed to be passing much more slowly. Two days later, he could see the shadows of the dozen of youths in front of himWang Lin didn\u2019t know how many of these companions would give up, he only knew that he must not give up. His feet were were bleeding and swelling. He felt a terrible tingling every step he took. He still persisted and used his hands to climb.A middle aged man with a sickly complexion floated down the stairs from the top of the mountain. \u201cLittle children, keep your hearts strong, for this path is ruthless. It won\u2019t be in vain, nothing is in vain\u2026.\u201d He let out a lengthy sigh as he floated down past the climbing youths.The middle aged man passed Wang Lin. This was the sixth youth he passed by, and he was the most pathetic of the bunch. With clothes soaked with blood, he seemed to be bleeding everywhere. His knees and toes were mangled. Wang Lin was climbing using his hands at this point. The middle aged man sighed loudly and asked, \u201cMy child, what is your name?\u201dWing Lin\u2019s vision was blurry. The only thought in his head was to reach the top or die. He didn\u2019t even hear the middle aged man\u2019s question. In his eyes this little trail was the only thing that mattered.The middle aged man looked at Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. Deep down, he was rather moved. He put his hand on Wang Lin\u2019s head. \u201cThis boy has amazing perseverance. It\u2019s too bad he lacks talent. What a waste, what a waste\u2026.\u201d He gave Wang Lin a deep look, then continued to descend the steps.The next night, Wang Lin\u2019s hands were bloody. He left a trail of blood as he climbed the stairs. He did not know how he kept going, but something kept fueling his body to go on. He felt like he could die at any time.The sun rose on the third day. In the distance, Wang Lin could just barely make out the end of the stone steps. Unfortunately, with the end in sight, he heard a thunderous voice that shook his heart.\u201cTime is up. Only three have qualified. The rest\u2026.FAILED!\u201dWang Lin let out a small, bitter laugh. He looked down while his body was slanting down on the stairs. His consciousness completely faded.The black-clad middle aged man from three days ago stood on top of the mountain. He was looking at Wang Lin from less than 50 meters away with a ruthless look in his eyes.A few Heng Yue Sect disciples went down from the top of the mountain. They each stopped next to one of the youths on the way down and fed them medicine.A female Heng Yue Sect disciple said in a cold voice, \u201cSeniors, out of 39 testers, 25 gave up. Only three passed the test, and 11 remain.\u201d She had also experienced this brutal test. She relied on the martial arts she had practiced since she was a child to pass. She barely had enough perseverance. Even now, after ten years of effort, she still hadn\u2019t become a true disciple.The black-clad middle aged man had an icy look in his eyes. He slightly nodded while his eyes swept past the 11 unconscious teenagers.\u201dTake the three that qualified and find work for them to do in the future. Send the 25 that gave up back to their families. As for the last 11 people, wait for them to wake up. Send them together to the house of the sword spirit to see if any of them have spiritual affinity with the sword spirit. If they don\u2019t, send them home\u201dAfter the middle aged man was finished here, he walked away without another glance and the youths below.Three days later, at the house of the sword spirit, stood 11 teenagers with pale faces. The injuries all over Wang Lin\u2019s body were already healed, but the wound in his heart was still gaping open. The pain of his failure kept eating away at his mind and body.This test of the spirit of the sword was conducted not by the black-clad middle aged man, but by a man wearing white, someone they hadn\u2019t seen before. He had the same cold, ruthless look in his eyes. He looked at the youths as if they were ants.The man said, with an impatient look, \u201cThis is the last test. If you can walk into this room, you are qualified.\u201dAll Wang Lin saw was an extremely common building. The front door of the building was open. When he looked inside, he could see swords of different lengths.Each of the youths, one by one, walked towards the house. The first one that approached got within 5 meters of the house. His face went red as he struggled to get closer, but was expelled by an invisible force.\u201cUnqualified! Next!\u201d said the man in white.Wang Lin was the seventh in line. The six before him all met the same fate, expelled by an invisible force when they got within 5 meters of the house. He smiled bitterly, and with the last bit of hope in his heart, stepped forward.As he approached the five meter mark, Wang Lin was able to keep going with ease. His heart was beating rapidly with anticipation. He stepped closer, 1 meter more. He wasn\u2019t feeling any discomfort yet.The white clothed man let out a surprised \u201cHey!\u201d. His eyes were bright, and his face showed slight interest. He gently said, \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to continue. Keep walking towards the house of the spirit of the sword. If you are recognized by the spirit of the sword, you will be accepted as a true disciple, even if you failed the two previous tests.\u201dThe ten other teenagers standing there had the color of envy in their faces. They were deeply jealous of Wang Lin.Wang Lin was very tense on the inside. The looks his parents gave him flashed through his mind again as he stepped one meter closer to the door. There were only 3 meters remaining to reach the door. Wang Lin took another step.He suddenly felt a huge force rush in his direction. Wang Lin lost control of his body and was sent flying more than ten meters away.The rest of the youths all looked at Wang Lin with mocking expressions in their eyes. They thought that Wang Lin was just like them after all, with no chance.With a bitter laugh, Wang Lin could feel the gaping wounds in his heart grow bigger. His parents\u2019 expectant eyes gradually dissipated from his mind.The man in white\u2019s eyes turned cold again and he said, \u201cFailed. Next.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 The ReturnIn the end, none of the 11 youths passed the test. There was one young girl who made it as far as Wang Lin.On that day, all of the youths that failed the test were sent back to the bottom of the mountain. The Heng Yue Sect disciples took them home one by one. The one that came to take Wang Lin home was the same youth that had picked him up. Behind him was Wang Zhuo and Wang Hao.The youth clasped his hands and said, \u201cBrother Wang Zhuo, congratulations on becoming Uncle-Master\u2019s disciple. You have a bright future ahead of you.\u201dWang Zhuo\u2019s face showed an arrogant expression. He proudly said, \u201cIt is only natural. Master said that after I have finished taking care of the mundane affairs at home, he will teach me cultivator techniques after I return.\u201dWang Hao raised his head and added on the side, \u201cI have always looked down on your arrogant demeanor. So what if you have a master? I will be able to learn how to produce immortal pills.\u201dWang Zhuo gave Wang Hao a hard stare, then he shifted his gaze to Wang Lin, who silently stood there. He smiled, and said, \u201cTie Zhu, how was it? I told you before that you didn\u2019t have the ability, but both you and your father wouldn\u2019t believe it. Now we know the result.\u201dTie Zhu raised his head, glanced slightly at Wang Zhuo, and said \u201cSir, my parents are waiting for me at home. Please take me back as soon as possible.\u201dWang Zhuo saw Wang Lin dare to ignore him and sneered. \u201cLittle bumpkin, you are better off becoming a carpenter in a little village for the rest of your life, like your father.\u201dThe immortal youth let out a faint smile as he looked at the three youths in front of him, but didn\u2019t say a single word. He waved his sleeves and brought the three along as they disappeared from the Heng Yue Sect mountain.Comparing this flight to last one, Wang Lin\u2019s mood was like heaven and earth. Before, he was full of hope, but now, he was full of despair.A little while later, the Wang Clan\u2019s house came into view. Wang Lin opened his eyes. He could see from afar the clan house that was lit up in celebration with a lively atmosphere. There were far more banquet tables than when his father had organized the feast at the village. They covered almost the whole yard.All the Wang family members were there. Even those who were away buying lumber had come back. The celebration was in full swing, full of drinking and chatter.The lead of the banquet was Wang Tianshui\u2019s older brother, Wang Tianshui, and Wang Tianshui\u2019s third brother. All the relatives surrounded the three of them to give them their congratulation. The scene was very festive.Their eyes were filled with envy, but their mouths were full of flattery. Especially towards Wang Lin\u2019s father, who couldn\u2019t help but remember the sadness from his past.Wang Lin\u2019s sixth uncle exclaimed, \u201cSecond brother, this time your son will be selected for sure. After this you don\u2019t have to be a carpenter any more. Anyone who sees you will have no choice but to call you elder.\u201dWang Tianshui\u2019s fifth uncle said, \u201cLao Er, back in the days I already knew your life wouldn\u2019t be normal. You devoted your life to Tie Zhu. Now that he is going to be an immortal, you as his father must be extraordinary.\u201d\u201cSecond brother, this time both your kid Tie Zhu and my son will be selected. Us brothers haven\u2019t met each other in 10 years. This time, we must have a drink together, no matter what!.\u201d said Wang Hao\u2019s father, as he brought over glasses of wine. He was also Wang Tianshui\u2019s third brother.Tie Zhu\u2019s father looked at all the relatives that used to look down on him. All the sorrow from his past was swept away. However, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a giant rock weighing down his heart.\u201cTie Zhu, you must be selected!\u201d\u201cSecond sister in law, this time your marriage to second brother has brought you good fortune. Having Tie Zhu as your child, who in the neighboring area won\u2019t know you?\u201d\u201cSecond sister in law, your kid Tie Zhu has more ability than my child. Ever since Tie Zhu was little, he has been very smart.\u201d\u201cTie Zhu\u2019s mother, even though we are of the same family, there are many consanguine relatives who have married nowadays. My daughter is unmarried, and is about the same age as Tie Zhu. Tie Zhu is handsome and I like him. Why don\u2019t we tie the knot between our families?\u201d Like Tie Zhu\u2019s father, his mother was surrounded by a group of female relatives who were enthusiastically chattering beside her.Wang Zhao\u2019s father held an indifferent look the whole time. He secretly desired for the Immortal to come and deliver the news that Tie Zhu had not been selected, so he could see his second brother\u2019s reaction to it.As he thought of this, he let out a laugh and toasted the relative next to him that was praising his child.The scene was bustling and full of spirit. At that moment, a sword of light appeared and landed in the courtyard. Four people came with it.The area immediately quieted down. No member of the Wang Family dared to say a word.The Heng Yue Sect disciple swept across the area and secretly sighed. He remembered when he was selected as a Heng Yue Sect disciple. His hometown was celebrating like this as well. He suddenly give Wang Lin a look of pity. He knew that the thing that this youth was about to experience wasn\u2019t something a youth could handle.\u201cHe has a ruthless path ahead of him\u2026\u201d The disciple shook his head and left in a sword of light.\u201cImmortal practitioners can\u2019t have any earthly desires, take care of what you need to, I\u2019ll come pick you up in three days.\u201d His voice echoed from the distance.When Wang Zhuo\u2019s father saw the immortal leave, he quickly rushed up to his son and asked, \u201cDid Immortal Hui Bing take you as his disciple?\u201dWang Zhuo said, with a face full of pride and arrogance, \u201cNaturally. Master has said that in ten years I\u2019ll be able to become the head of Heng Yue Sect Disciples.\u201dWang Zhuo\u2019s father was overjoyed. He patted his son heavily on the shoulders, and laughed. \u201cGood, Wang Zhuo you will be an immortal in the future! Our Wang family will have an immortal!.\u201dWang Hao\u2019s father\u2019s face also had an anxious expression while staring at Wang Hao. When he was about to ask, Wang Hao let out a sigh and said \u201cDad, you don\u2019t have to ask. Your son is already a Heng Yue Sect Disciple.\u201dWang Hao\u2019s father was ecstatic. He picked up his cup and fiercely drank. Wang Zhuo had a disgusted look on his face. He said contemptuously: \u201cThird Uncle, you gave birth to a good son. He has lost the Wang Family a lot of face. In front of everyone he flattered the immortal and then, only relying on a bribe was he able to become a helper.\u201dWang Hao raised his brow and said \u201cI\u2019m happy, so what? In the future, let us see who has stronger cultivator techniques, then we will see who has lost the family face.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father saw the depressed expression his son wore, causing his body to shudder. He had an ominous feeling.\u201cTie Zhu, what\u2026what about you?\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s mother asked, full of expectation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 InsultsTie Zhu was silent as Wang Zhuo, in a derisive tone, said, \u201cI have said before that this kid didn\u2019t have any talent. All he did was go and lose face for our family. I passed on the first test, so I didn\u2019t see him until later on. A few days later, I heard that he failed all three tests. He might as well not have gone. I would\u2019ve preferred it if fourth uncle\u2019s son had gone instead.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle frowned and said, \u201cWang Zhuo, even if you\u2019re going to become an immortal, what can you possibly know about what my son can or can\u2019t do? The audacity!\u201dThere was a flash of coldness in Wang Zhuo\u2019s eyes. He quietly laughed, but didn\u2019t say anything.Tie Zhu\u2019s father suddenly looked like he had aged more than 10 years and fell down to his seat. Tie Zhu\u2019s mother was also shocked, she couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. She asked, \u201cTie Zhu, is\u2026 is this true?\u201dTie Zhu bit his lip until it started bleeding. He fell to the ground and kowtowed a few times. He whispered, \u201cMom, Dad, Tie Zhu wasn\u2019t selected by the immortals. I\u2019m sorry, I \u2026. I will repay you both in the next life.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mother realized her son was in despair. She quickly ran and helped Tie Zhu to his feet. She whispered, \u201cChild, don\u2019t worry. So what if you weren\u2019t selected by the immortals? Next year there is the district exam. Child, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Don\u2019t do anything stupid either. Your father and mother still expect you to be at our funerals.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father snapped out of his daze. He realized the kind of mental state Tie Zhu was in. His heart trembled, and he quickly ran up to his son. Holding him, he nervously said, \u201cTie Zhu, you better not do anything stupid. Listen to your dad. Let\u2019s go home and study hard for next year\u2019s district exam.\u201dThe surrounding relatives quickly moved away from Tie Zhu\u2019s family. They all gathered around as if they were watching a show, gossiping and sharing comments about the event unfolding before them.Tie Zhu\u2019s sixth uncle quipped, \u201cI always knew that this Tie Zhu kid didn\u2019t have any talent. How could he compare to Wang Zhuo?\u201d\u201cTotally right. Since this was bound to happen, why act like he was already accepted? How shameful. Lao Er, you are this old already. How could you still do something so stupid. No wonder dad didn\u2019t give you a share of the inheritance back then.\u201d said Tie Zhu\u2019s third uncle sarcastically.\u201cIf you ask me, the story that this kid has always been smart since he was a child was fabricated. It was probably because Lao Er knew that he himself was a failure. He tried to raise his son\u2019s reputation by lying, and now he\u2019s been exposed.\u201d Said Tie Zhu\u2019s fifth uncle, whose face had turned ugly.A female relative scoffed, \u201cOut of the three children that went to test, only he failed. Tie Zhu is the worst child in our Wang Family. Second sister in law, I earlier said you had good fortune with second brother. Now it seems like your luck will keep dwindling for the rest of your life.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s fifth aunt also sneered, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right? When I went to see Tie Zhu a few days ago, I was wondering how he could compare to Wang Hao and Wang Zhuo at all.\u201dAnother female relative mercilessly said, \u201cI had already seen that that kid Tie Zhu didn\u2019t have any talent. Just look at his mom and dad. How could they give birth to anyone good? In our Wang family, only eldest brother and third brother\u2019s kids are any good. Tie Zhu, bah, just with that name he sounds like an idiot.\u201d\u201cI was totally blind back then, about to push my daughter into a pit of fire. Good thing we found out beforehand that Tie Zhu wasn\u2019t selected by the immortals. My daughter would\u2019ve hated me forever if I had her marry him. Tie Zhu\u2019s mom, let us forget about this whole thing. Since your Tie Zhu won\u2019t become an immortal, who would want their daughter to marry him? Isn\u2019t that like a toad wanting a swan\u2019s meat?\u201dIn a few moments all the relatives turned into snobs. They continuously launched a barrage of insults at Tie Zhu\u2019s family.Compared to the previous scene, it was like heaven and earth. There were even relatives who went as far as to ask for the gifts they gave back. Seeing his parent\u2019s pale faces, Tie Zhu tightened his fist. Listening to all the insults left him wishing he was dead.Wang Zhuo\u2019s father laughed inwardly, and sneered, \u201cLao Er, didn\u2019t I tell you that to become an immortal\u2019s disciple, you need fate on your side? How could there possibly be any chance unless you have talent like my son? Yet you seriously believed it would be possible. Now you made your son wish he was dead! Was there a need for this?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father couldn\u2019t hold in his anger any longer. He shouted, \u201cWang Tianshan, shut you mouth! Back in the day, father on his deathbed left me a part of the inheritance. You worked with the other relatives to steal it away from me, and now you are here insulting me. Do you really think I, Wang Tianshui, will quietly endure this?\u201d\u201cAnd all of you people as well. Earlier you were happily congratulating me, and now you are here insulting us. Our son is already in this state, yet you add insult to injury. Are you all still human?\u201dWang Tianshan paused for a moment and said, \u201cWhy bring up the past? I warned you with good intentions that your son didn\u2019t have any talent, but here you are being angry at me. Hmph, with a dad like you, the son won\u2019t be much better!\u201dAll the insults thrown at the crestfallen Wang Lin were like thorns piercing his heart. He coldly looked at everyone and engraved their faces into his heart.\u201cYou, I\u2019ll fight you to the death.\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s father couldn\u2019t hold in his anger any longer and picked up a chair. Tie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle rushed up and stopped him, whispering, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t be impulsive. Elder brother has many servants. Listen to me, don\u2019t bother with him.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle glared at Wang Tianshan and said, \u201cEldest brother, is that any way to talk? I will not listen to this any longer. If you dare to keep insulting my second brother, don\u2019t blame me for not caring about family ties. While the Wang family is big, I have made many friends during my travel. Don\u2019t push me to burn it all.\u201dWang Tianshan murmured a few words. He still feared the well connected fourth bother.\u201cLao Si, what you are saying is unreasonable. We aren\u2019t wrong in pointing out that Lao Er\u2019s son doesn\u2019t have any talent. What\u2019s wrong with us, the older generation, scolding the younger? What you\u2019re saying is too unreasonable.\u201d said the Family\u2019s third eldest uncle with discontent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 \u2013 Leaving Home\u201cThat\u2019s right! Fourth brother, we are speaking for you because you gave your spot to second bother. What Wang Zhuo said was correct, your son is stronger than Tie Zhu. He might have really gotten selected by the immortals.\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s fifth brother added on the side.Wang Zhuo, with a proud smile, gloated, \u201cTheir family brought all this upon themselves. My father and I warned them beforehand. This useless family is about as stubborn as a donkey. Now they hit a wall.\u201dWang Hao, with a pale face said, \u201cTie Zhu, he\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Wang Hao\u2019s father shot him a fierce look. He lost all confidence and kept quiet afterwards.Tie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle let out a deep sigh and said, \u201cWhoever brings this up again means he has something against me, let this be done. Tie Zhu not being selected can only be said that he wasn\u2019t fortunate enough and nothing else. Tie Zhu don\u2019t take it to heart, you can come to your fourth uncle for anything. I have no say in immortal sects, but when it comes to normal sects, your uncle still has some ability to get in you. You can go with my son, Hu Zi. I have alway planned to send him to a sect to train.Wang Zhuo chuckled when he heard that. He scornfully said, \u201cTie Zhu, I say go with fourth uncle. When you get there, you can tell them you were the trash that was rejected by the immortals. They might really take you.\u201dWang Lin slowly raised his head. He looked around, glaring at all the surrounding relatives. When his eyes finally landed on Wang Zhuo he said, \u201cWang Zhuo, mark my words. I, Wang Lin, will definitely enter an immortal school. I\u2019ll also never forget how you and your father insulted my family.\u201dWang Zhuo laughed when he heard Tie Zhu\u2019s words but before he could say anything else, Fourth Uncle shouted at Wang Zhuo, \u201c You wordy little brat! I\u2019m going to waste you right now! Let see if the immortals still want you then.\u201dWang Zhuo\u2019s father suddenly looked pale. He hurriedly stepped in front of Wang Zhuo. \u201cFourth brother, you wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201dThe surrounding relatives all held a cold smile on their faces as they watched the events unfold in front of themTie Zhu\u2019s fourth uncle laughed. He had a steely look in his eyes. In a low, deep voice, he said, \u201cReally brother? I wouldn\u2019t dare?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s father quickly stepped forward to pull his fourth brother back. \u201cFourth brother, listen to your second brother. You have a wife and kids at home, acting like this isn\u2019t worth it for you. I will forever remember what you have done for me, just bring my family home.\u201dFourth Uncle glared at Wang Zhuo\u2019s father. He then nodded at his second brother, and proceeded to leave the house with Tie Zhu and his family.Even from afar, Wang Lin could hear the relatives in the yard mocking him and his family.The family sat in Fourth Uncle\u2019s carriage as he gave them a ride home.Silence enveloped the inside of the carriage. Tie Zhu\u2019s father quietly sighed. It\u2019d be false to say that he wasn\u2019t disappointed, but Tie Zhu was still his son. He finally broke the silence. \u201cTie Zhu, this is nothing, alright? When I was forced out of the house before, I was much more despondent than you, yet I still persevered. Listen to your father. Go home and study. Strive towards a good result in next year\u2019s district exam. If you don\u2019t feel like reading, go relax with your fourth uncle.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mother gave her son a loving look and consoled him. \u201cTie Zhu, don\u2019t do anything stupid. You\u2019re my only son. If anything happens to you, I wouldn\u2019t want to live anymore. You have to be strong.\u201d As she was talking, tears rolled down her face.Wang Lin looked at his parents. He nodded and said, \u201cFather, mother, rest assured. I will not do anything silly. Don\u2019t worry, I have a plan.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mother embraced him. While holding him in her arms she said, \u201cTie Zhu, it\u2019s over. We will forget about this matter.\u201dIn his mother\u2019s warm embrace, Tie Zhu\u2019s wounded heart was slowly healing. He felt exhausted after the events of the last few days. As the carriage bounced up and down, Tie Zhu slowly drifted into sleep.He saw a dream. He dreamt that he was an immortal, flying in the sky with his parents\u2026.When Tie Zhu woke up, it was late at night. He sighed lightly as he looked around at the familiar room. His heart was resolute. Before he left the house, he took a long, deep look at his sleeping parents. He picked up a pen and paper, and wrote a letter. After taking enough dry food, he was on his way.\u201cI will not give up on the path to becoming an immortal. I must try to join Heng Yue Sect one more time! If they still won\u2019t accept me, I must at least find the location of other immortal sects.\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s eyes were filled with resolve as he left the mountain village, carrying only a bag.With the moonlight paving the road and stars marking his direction, Wang Lin made his way forward, only his long shadow for company.Three days have passed. Wang Lin was walking on a remote mountain road. He had opened his eyes back when the young immortal was holding him. He could still recall the general direction.Heading east, Wang Lin ignored the weeds that were cutting both his legs. He kept moving forward.After a week, he had already entered the inner parts of the mountains. Fortunately, there were no man-eating beasts here. Wang Lin pursued his path carefully. Today, when he looked up, he was finally able to see the familiar misty peaks on an isolated hill top.Tie Zhu was completely exhausted at this point. He took out some dried food and took a few bites while staring at the Heng Yue sect\u2019s entrance. The hairs on the back of Wang Lin\u2019s neck stood up as he heard a wild animal breathing behind him. He looked back and all the color instantly drained from his face.A large white tiger with blood-red eyes made the air feel dense. Drops of saliva dripped out of the corner of its mouth, producing dripping sounds as they hit the ground.The white tiger roared as it pounced. Wang Lin revealed a bitter smile, and without hesitation jumped off the side of a cliff. He felt the wind on his face as he plummeted down. He couldn\u2019t help but remember the looks in his parent\u2019s eyes, as well as all the relatives that taunted him.\u201cFather, Mother, your son didn\u2019t listen to you. This is goodbye.\u201dThe wall of the cliff was covered in a myriad of branches. Tie Zhu\u2019s body was getting cut by the branches as he dropped at breakneck a speed. A few moments later, in the middle of the drop, Tie Zhu felt an enormous force pulling him.Wang Lin had no control of his body as the force pulled him. Before he knew it, he was inside a cave that had been carved onto the wall of the cliff. He felt great force constantly pulling his body against the wall, after a long time the force finally disappeared and he fell down from the wall.It took him a long time to regain his senses. As Tie Zhu struggled to get back up, he noticed his clothes were torn and his body had gotten scraped all over by the branches. Pain came flooding in from his swollen right arm. Large drops of sweat streamed down, sticking to every part of his body. Wang Lin touched his arm, but he couldn\u2019t tell if the bones were broken. This injury was definitely sustained when he hit the wall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 Stone BeadTie Zhu was pale as he got up and looked around. He found that he was in a small natural cave. The sunlight peered in through the entrance of the cave, revealing a floor covered with the bones of birds and animals.On the wall behind him was a black hole the size of a fist. He couldn\u2019t tell how deep this little hole was, but on closer inspection one mystery was solved. The pulling force that sucked him into the cave earlier came from this hole. The animals that those scattered bones had belonged to were sucked in just like he had been.The suction from the hole must be spontaneous. The moment he appeared in front of this cave during his fall, the mysterious hole pulled him in and saved his life. Tie Zhu, enduring the agony of his right arm, was about to walk out of the cave when the bones on the ground suddenly started moving toward the hole. He quickly rolled to the corner of the cave without a moment\u2019s delay as he felt the wind behind him.The unimaginable sucking force suddenly came from the little hole. All the bones rattled as they flew toward the hole. Some of the bigger bones were stuck on the wall blocking, the little hole.At that moment, a bird was sucked in as it flew by the cave\u2019s entrance. It whizzed through the air until it splattered against the cave wall.After about an hour, the force stopped pulling. Wang Lin stared in horror at the corpse of the recently deceased bird. He didn\u2019t move his body at all, only sat still, while calculating the time.Half an hour later, the suction started again. This repeated several times. Wang Lin had grasped the timing of the strange suctioning hole. It would start sucking every 30 minutes for a duration of 60 minutes.Taking advantage of the time gap between suctions, Wang Lin painfully crept towards the cave entrance. As he looked below, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a bitter smile. Below him was a jungle, and the barely visible ground was covered with rocks. The cliff was very steep, there was no way for him to climb down with his broken arm. The distance from the ground measured more than a few dozen meters. If he tried to jump down, it would definitely be the end.The bag filled with food was left at the top of the mountain with no way for him to retrieve it. Right now food was the most important problem he needed to solve. As he was pondering, he suddenly remembered the suction time and rushed back to the corner of the cave.Time in the outside world seemed to pass by quickly. Wang Lin could feel his body grow weaker and weaker. He had no feeling in his arm, it was completely numb. He smiled bitter as he said to himself, \u201cBeing stuck here means a slow death, but jumping down would be instant death.\u201dHe looked at the bloody corpse of the bird that was sucked in earlier. With a bit of hesitation, he walked over, picked it up, and reluctantly took a bite. The taste was appalling. He exhaled as the raw meat in his mouth flooded his senses, but then continued to eat it.He barely chewed the meat, opting to just swallow it nearly whole. Tie Zhu felt warmth enter his stomach as it churned. He ate the bird quickly in big bites, then he stood up and took a deep breath to keep himself from puking it all out.He tossed the remains of the bird to the side and sat down against the cave wall. His mind wandered, one moment thinking about his parents, one moment thinking of his fourth uncle, one moment thinking about the mocking faces of his relatives, and one moment he even thought about the cold eyes of the middle aged man in black from the Heng Yue Sect.In a trance, Wang Lin looked at the half eaten bird corpse. Without batting an eye, he picked up the corpse for a closer inspection. He saw that within the bird\u2019s corpse there was a red bead the size of a baby\u2019s first. He was very surprised as he took it out of the carcass.Why was there a bead in this bird\u2019s body? Wang Lin\u2019s heart was pounding as he thought of a book the teacher in his village had once shown him. Some animals live to be much older, and that something called a dantian will form within their body.If one were to eat a dantian, their life would be prolonged, and their strength would increase. Even limbs that had been cut off would grow back.When he saw that description, he didn\u2019t believe it, and secretly scoffed at it, but now he couldn\u2019t help but to believe in myths and legends a little more after meeting immortals.Wang Lin\u2019s heart was pounding hard enough to fly out of his chest. If this bead was really the dantian described in the book, then eating it would not only heal his injuries quickly, but it would also make it easy to leave this place. Even passing the test to join the Heng Yue Sect should be possible, at least he would be able to pass the perseverance test.But the bead was very hard. It didn\u2019t seem edible. He used some of the ragged cloth on his body to wipe it clean, restoring its original color.A gray bead, with five clouds carved on it, was revealed. It looked very old. Wang Lin was very disappointed, unwilling to give up, he gave the bead a bite, then silently laughed at himself. \u201cTie Zhu, you are too delusional. How could some random bird that just happened to fly by have a dantian?\u201dWang Lin sighed. It was already dark outside. He felt weary and fell asleep with the bead by his side and animal bones covering the floor.Since it is fall right now, the temperature dropped very quickly, especially in the mountain area. The cold air entered Wang Lin\u2019s body. He curled up, and the night passed by quickly.The next morning, sunlight peered in from the outside of the cave as the sun rose. A few drops of sparkling dew secreted from the bead by Wang Lin\u2019s side. As the dew gathered, it dripped on to the bones nearby.After a while, Wang Lin woked up. Not only was his arm still swollen, its condition seemed to have gotten worse. Wang Lin sat on the floor, feeling very depressed.Wang Lin muttered to himself, \u201cAm I going to be stuck here my whole life?\u201d He slowly turned his head and noticed the dew that accumulated on the bones. Since he was thirsty, he carefully picked up a few bones and licked the dew off them.The sweetness of the dew was quite good. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was imagining it, but his whole body felt warm and comfortable after drinking some.Especially the injury on his arm. There was feeling of comfort and itching as the swelling lessened. Wang Lin rubbed his eyes, and closely looked at his arm. The swelling had indeed gone down. He quickly looked at the bones around him but wasn\u2019t able to find any more with dew on them.At that moment, he suddenly noticed the bead and saw drops of dew on it. He remembered that all the bones that had dew on them were next to the bead. He gently picked up the bead, with his heart pounding, and rolled the bead on his arm to evenly spreading out the dew.Waves of cool and refreshing feelings came from the arm. Wang Lin stared at his arm without batting an eye. After a while his eyes lit up. The swelling from the arm had gone down. He tried waving his arm. While there was still some pain, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201cThis stone bead must be a treasure!\u201d Wang Lin was pleasantly surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 Down the cliffFor the next few days, Wang Lin relied on the birds that were sucked into the cave and splattered on the wall for food. He spent most of his time carefully observing the stone bead. Every time dew appeared, he would smear it on his arm. He did this until his arm was fully recovered. He knew this dew was extremely valuable, so he collected some in the skull of a bird.On this day, he sprinkled the dew he had been collecting throughout the past few days on a piece of cloth and carefully warped the bead in it. After making sure it wouldn\u2019t fall off, he arrived at the entrance to the cave when the suction force stopped. He used his teeth to tear apart his clothes and tied them together, then tied one end to a rock and the other around his waist and slowly climbed down.Wang Lin had climbed down about five or six meters when his hand slipped. His body dropped quickly, but luckily his clothes were tough and gave him time to swing toward the cliff and grab onto a branch before the cloth tore.Cold sweat glistened on Wang Lin\u2019s forehead. When he looked down, he estimated that he was still 20 meters up. With one hand, he grabbed a branch and with the other hand he grabbed the the cloth and tied the cloth on to the branch, Only then did he feel relieved.He carefully moved back toward the cliff edge and then started to descend again. When he was 10 meters from the ground, the cloth had stretched to its limit, Wang Lin jumped down without a second thought.His clothes couldn\u2019t bear the weight and began to split apart, but still help lighten the fall. Wang Lin felt the wind caress his face on the way down, as well as branches breaking under him, slowing down his fall. He positioned his body just right as he landed, toes pointing downward, and rolled into a ball as he touched the ground.The ground felt like a stone knife that pierced his body, creating various deep cuts, especially a cut on this leg. It was so deep that you could see the bones.Wang Lin, with blurry vision, gasped for breath. He struggled to put the cloth that was around his neck that contained the bead into his mouth and sucked some dew that was in the cloth. After a while, he struggled to sit up and, with trembling hands, took the cloth and squeezed it above the wound on his leg as a few drops of dew came out.A cool feeling emitted from the place the wound was. After having done all this, Wang Lin fell to the ground and prayed for no beasts to attack him before he recovered.At that a moment, he heard a shout from the distance.\u201cTie Zhu, where are you?\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He listened closely and realized that it was his dad\u2019s voice. Without time to think, he used all the strength left in his body to shout, \u201cDad! I\u2019m here!\u201dA rainbow approached from the distance, it circle around the cliff near Wang Lin for a while then descended. A sword of light came down and dissipated, revealing a Heng Yue Sect disciple with Wang Lin\u2019s father in his arm, frowning at Wang Lin.When Tie Zhu\u2019s father saw his son, he immediately burst into tears. He ran up to Wang Lin and hugged him. While crying he said, \u201cTie Zhu, what were you thinking? Why did you have to be so stubborn? Have you ever thought about how your parents would live if you died?\u201dWang Lin was stunned. After thinking about it, he realized his dad misunderstood, and thought that he was trying to commit suicide. After looking at himself and seeing how battered his body was, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a bitter laugh.The Heng Yue Sect disciple, surname Zhang, gazed over Wang Lin. He looked to the cliff above and saw the clothes that had been torn earlier. With a few leaps, he climbed up until he reached the cave. He felt a force try to suck him in and showed a surprised expression. However, he quickly recovered and jumped down like the force was no big deal. He said, lowly, \u201cYour kid wanted to suicide but was saved by this natural suction force from the cave. Now that Wang Lin has been found, let\u2019s go back to the sect and have the elder make a decision.\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciple rolled his sleeves, grabbed the father son duo, and quickly left that place. After a while, they arrived at the foot of the mountain of the Heng Yue Sect, then climbed the steps and approached the peak.Coming back here like this caused Wang Lin to have mixed feelings. At the peak, there were many people with ugly expressions. The disciple Zhang quickly went up to one of them and whispered something. The old man\u2019s brow wrinkled and said with a cold voice. \u201cSince the person was found, send him to the guest room to reunite him with his mother.\u201dIn the room, when Wang Lin\u2019s mother saw her son, she immediately burst into tears and ran up to hug him. After hearing from his parents he finally knew what was going on.When he ran away from home, his parents returned to the Wang family to find his fourth uncle. The three of them feared for his safety, so they went to find Wang Zhuo\u2019s father. With the pressure of his fourth uncle, Wang Zhuo\u2019s father reluctantly got the family members to help ask the Heng Yue Sect to help.This is the first time the Heng Yue Sect has encountered something like this opted to ignore it at first. However, the reason why Wang Lin ran away from home was due to not being accepted into the Heng Yue Sect. Although the Heng Yue Sect didn\u2019t care about the life and death of a mortal, if he were really to die and the news of it spread to the villages nearby, parents won\u2019t want their kids to try to enter the sect. Concerned about the future, they sent out a few disciples to search the area. Wang Lin\u2019s father was still worried so he followed them.And that\u2019s what caused the scene before him.After a while, someone sent in some medicine. Tie Zhu\u2019s mother hastily thanked the the person who delivered it, and carefully fed it to her son. This was indeed medicine produced by an immortal sect. The effect was extremely good. After drinking it, Wang Lin felt that he had recovered quite a lot, and his wound began to ache a lot less.Wang Lin\u2019s parents were unceasingly bestowing words of comfort upon him. He wanted to explain everything to them, but he was unsure if they would believe him.At that moment, in a Heng Yue Sect hall, several elders were sitting around listening to the disciple Zhang describe how he found Wang Lin. At the end of the long table, a red faced man said disgruntledly, \u201cWhat does the life and death of a mortal have to do with an immortal like me. Look at the other immortal schools, which of them are like us who send people to find a kid who tried to suicide because he wasn\u2019t selected. This is shameful!.\u201dNext to him, a middle aged man with a cold face said, \u201cWhat elder Ma said is correct. In all the sects within the state of Zhao, only our Heng Yue Sect is like this. But if that kid really died in our mountain range, parents will fear their children would all try to suicide if they were rejected. Then, who would dare to send us their children?\u201dAn old man in robe took a sip of tea and said slowly, \u201cIn reality, isn\u2019t it because our Heng Yue Sect has declined that we must select disciples that are suitable for cultivation from mortals? If it was 500 years ago, who would care what the mortals think?\u201dFinally, an old man full of wrinkles sighed and said, \u201cIf this youth tried to suicide once, he could try to suicide again. Bah, to prevent this issue from continuing let us just make an exception and accept him as a disciple.\u201d After he finished speaking, he gave a side glance to the middle aged man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Entering the SectThe red faced old man frowned with dissatisfaction and said, \u201cElder Li, is our Heng Yue Sect really going to sink so low? To make an exception for the life and death of a mortal?Elder Li open his eyes and said with a cold voice, \u201cElder Ma, the patriarch told me to handle this matter. If it\u2019s not handled properly, and this piece of trash attempts suicide a second time and his parents spread that we forced their kid to suicide, isn\u2019t that more embarrassing? If you are willing to take responsibility on this matter, then I\u2019ll let you handle it.\u201dThe middle aged man quickly tried to make peace and said, \u201cThere is no need to argue. Why don\u2019t we let him become a disciple first, then after 8 or 10 years, when he fails to keep cultivating, we can send him back and there will be no problem.\u201dThe old man in robe responded, \u201cIf other youths follow suit, what will we do?\u201dThe middle aged man chuckled and said, \u201cThis is an easy task. After this, we have learned our lesson. When we fail people in the future, we should instill in the idea of not suiciding and that would solve this problem. As for this Wang Lin, since the matter is already this big, let us just take him as a disciple. One extra disciple doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAside from elder Li, two other elders looked thoughtfully at the middle aged man, not saying a word.The middle aged man smiled and thought, \u201cOh Wang Lin, Wang Lin. I have helped all I can. I have repaid you for the piece of metal your fourth uncle has given me. I\u2019m really curious how a mortal managed to get his type of material.\u201dWhat the middle aged man didn\u2019t know was that Wang Lin\u2019s fourth uncle had bought it from a blacksmith. He had seen many things, and as soon as he saw it, he knew it wasn\u2019t normal. This time, to let Tie Zhu join the Heng Yue Sect, he brought it out. As for what the metal was used for, he didn\u2019t know.A piece of metal changed Wang Lin\u2019s fate. When the news reached Wang Lin, he couldn\u2019t believe it. He was somehow accepted as a disciple for no apparent reason.Two days later, he saw his parents off from the Heng Yue sect. After seeing the joy on his parents faces, he decided to seriously cultivate here.However, his way of thinking was changed after his parents left. He was secretly called to the place where disciples get their work assigned and saw a shifty looking youth. The youth\u2019s face was full of contempt. He looked at him and laughed. \u201cSo you are Wang Lin, the kid that got to be a disciple by suiciding?\u201dWang Lin silently looked at the youth challenging him. The youth sneered, \u201cBoy, starting tomorrow morning you come to me for work. Your job is to fetch water, no less than ten vats a day. If you can\u2019t finish the work, then no food for you, and if you continue for 7 days then I\u2019ll tell the elders to kick you out of the sect. These are your clothes. Remember, honorary disciples can only wear gray. Once you are a true disciple, you will be assigned other colors.\u201d After he finished talking, he tossed the clothes to Wang Lin and closed his eyes.Wang Lin picked up his clothes and asked, \u201cWhere do I live?\u201dThe youth didn\u2019t even open his eyes and casually said, \u201cGo north until you see a row of houses. Give your badge to the disciple there and they will give you a room.\u201dWang Lin left and headed north to the houses. The youth opened his eyes and said, with disdain, \u201cTo rely on suicide to join, he really is a waste!\u201dWhile walking in the Heng Yue Sect, Wang Lin saw many disciples wearing gray uniforms in a hurry with pale and cold faces. Some had tools in their hands and they were all rushing about.After going straight for a while, he saw a row of houses. There were a lot more disciples in gray here, but they hardly talked to each other.After he gave his badge to the yellow-clothed disciple that was in charge, the youth impatiently pointed to a room.Wang Lin had already gotten used to the cold expressions of all the people here. He got to his room and opened the door. It was a large room with two wooden beds, a table, and two chairs. They were all very clean and were about as new as the furniture at his house.He picked the bed that looked vacant. He placed his luggage down and laid in his bed. Although he had gotten into the Heng Yue Sect, it wasn\u2019t what he was expecting. He thought that he was going to learn immortal techniques, but it seemed like his job was to fetch water.Thinking about this, he sighed and touched the stone bead in front of his chest. This was the treasure he had acquired. Wang Lin had read many books and he knew the danger of exposing it, as many people would aim for this treasure.A short while later, night fell and an extremely tired youth in gray opened the door and entered. He was stunned when he saw Wang Lin, then proceeded to pass out on his bed without saying a word.Wang Lin didn\u2019t care. He knew that he had to wake up early. He touched his stomach, then took out some sweet potatoes. His parents brought them for him to eat when they went out searching for him, and since he was accepted, his parents gave all the remaining food to him.The sweet potato was very sweet. As Wang Lin was eating, the youth woke up and eyed the sweet potato. While his mouth watered, he said in a low voice, \u201cCan I have a piece?\u201dWang Lin took out a few pieces and said, \u201cI have a lot here. If you\u2019d like, have some more.\u201dThe youth quickly picked up the food and scarfed it down, then went over to the table and poured himself a glass of water. He exclaimed, \u201cDamn it! I haven\u2019t eaten anything in two days. So what\u2019s your name?\u201dWang Lin said his name. The youth suddenly laughed and said, \u201cSo you are Wang Lin, the trash that entered the Heng Yue Sect by attempting suicide\u2026\u201d He suddenly realized what he had done and said, \u201cBrother, my name is Zhang Hu. To tell you the truth, there is no one in the sect that doesn\u2019t know about you, so please don\u2019t blame me for what I said before. In fact, I admire you for being able to enter the sect this way.\u201dWang Lin laughed bitterly. He didn\u2019t try to explain and passed over a few pieces of sweet potato.Zhang Hu quickly accepted it and took a few bites, then said, \u201c Wang Lin, you better leave some of it for yourself. You are new here. Who knows what evil things that yellow weasel will try to do. Damn it, he doesn\u2019t even treat us like humans.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Zhang Hu\u201cWeasel?\u201d Wang Lin was stunned. The first person he thought of that might fit the description was the yellow cloth disciple that laughed at him, however, he wasn\u2019t sure.\u201cAh? Did you not see him? He\u2019s the man responsible for organizing the work of the disciple. He is also an honorary disciple but has been given right to start his cultivation. Wearing yellow clothes, he doesn\u2019t look like a good guy at all. We all call him weasel.\u201d Zhang Hu explained as he drank water.Wang Lin took a bite of a sweet potato, then said, \u201cI know who it is, I saw him today. He told me to bring back 10 vats of water a day starting tomorrow or else I won\u2019t get any food.\u201dZhang Hu was stunned. After staring at Wang Lin for a bit, he asked, \u201cBrother, did you offend him before?\u201dWang Lin shook his head and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dZhang Hu showed Wang Lin a pitiful expression. \u201cWang Lin, are you thinking that the vats are like the ones you use at home? Like this big?\u201d He gestured with his handsWang Lin had a bad feeling and nodded.Zhang Hu had a bitter smile. He said, \u201cYou must have offended the yellow weasel. The vats he is talking about is the size of this room, filling up ten vats\u2026 Wang Lin I won\u2019t eat these sweet potatoes, you keep them. You\u2019ll be lucky to get food every 4 to 5 days. You are new here, and all the foraging spots in the mountain are taken. Only the elder disciples can pick them. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just eat my wild fruits.\u201d He placed the remaining sweet potatoes on the table, sighed, laid down on his bed, and fell asleep.Wang Lin felt rage surge through him, but then he thought of his parents eyes filled with expectations and forced down his rage. He laid down on the bed asleep full of rage.It was still dark on the second day when Wang Lin climbed out of bed. Zhang Hu was still snoring. Wang Lin put on his gray outfit and quickly made his way to the place he had met the weasel. Soon after he arrived, the sun emerged from the east. Yellow-clad youths opened the doors and gave Wang Lin weird looks. \u201cAt least you are on time. Get a bucket and head out east. There is a spring in the mountain, carry water from there.\u201dHe paid no more attention to Wang Lin. He sat cross-legged on the ground and breathed slowly while facing the sun rise. A barely visible white mist came from his nose, rolling like two dragons.Wang Lin eyed him with envy. He then walked into the room and looked around. Finally, behind a door he saw the 10 vats and let out a bitter smile as he walked toward the east gate.Wang Lin arrived at the location after a long walk. The scenery was quite beautiful and the sound of running water was soothing. It was a place that could sooth the heart.He had no time to appreciate the beauty. When the bucket was full, he picked it up and quickly went back up the mountain.Wang Lin kept doing this until dusk. He hadn\u2019t even filled one vat yet. If it wasn\u2019t for the sweet potatoes filling his stomach, he wouldn\u2019t have the strength to continue. His arms and legs were sore and numb. They hurt whenever he moved.Wang Lin pondered a while, then carried away half a bucket of water to a deserted area. He looked around to make sure no one was in the vicinity. He dropped the stone bead into the bucket and sloshed it around a bit. Then he took out the bead and drank the water. He immediately felt a warmth in his stomach, and the muscle pain disappeared.Although the effect was inferior to the dew\u2019s, Wang Lin was still excited. He touched his chest and adjusted the position of the bead. He decided to not let anyone know of this treasure.After he finished drinking half a bucket of water, his muscles were no longer sore and he felt full of energy. He quickly continued his job of fetching water.That night, he dipped the stone bead in another half bucket of water and drank it. To avoid suspicion, he came back with a weary look on his face.A while later, Zhang Hu came back. He still wore that overworked expression on his face. The two talked for a bit and Zhang Hu hesitantly begged for two pieces of sweet potato. He ate them and fell asleep on his bed.Time passed by quickly, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Wang Lin became a Heng Yue Sect disciple.Wang Lin found out that Zhang Hu\u2019s job was to collect firewood. He must collect enough firewood before he could eat. He had been collecting firewood the entire three years since he became an honorary disciple of the Heng Yue Sect. Three years ago, he would only eat once every three or four days, but now he has shortened it to where he could eat once every two days.According to him, the honorary disciples are to do chores for ten years and be able to eat three meals a day before they can learn even the most basic cultivation.The inner disciples are not like them. They have their own master, do not do any chores, and have their own rooms. Their only job is to cultivate.In addition, there is a person in between the inner disciples and the honorary disciples, such as Wang Hao who became a help, but he\u2019s basically a servant.These people do not need to do chores, and also practice some low-level techniques. They only need to complete the work their master assigns them. However, these people possessed very little talent and they would just spend their whole lives being helpers.As for the so called talent, Wang Lin learned from Zhang Hu that it was simply spiritual energy. Everyone has it, but in varying amounts. If one has enough spiritual energy, they can learn an immortal technique in a year, but if lacking, it would taken dozens or even hundreds of years.A man\u2019s life is limited. Someone with mediocre talent will never get anywhere in his lifetime. That is why the sect put such large important on spiritual energy.This month, when Wang Lin was fetching water, he drank a lot of water that the stone bead had been soaked in, causing his body to become much stronger. Before, it would take him six days to fill the 10 vats, now it only took three.However, in order to keep others from being suspicious, Wang Lin always got up before sunrise and leisurely walked toward the mountain with the bucket. While others were surprised he was able to finish within three days, they thought it was because he wake up extra early and went to sleep late.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 Immortal TalismanThis month, almost all of the honorary disciples came to know Wang Lin. All of them carried arrogant looks on their faces and talked viciously to him.Wang Lin ignored them. He knew that all these honorary disciples\u2019 minds were twisted. Before he came, all the honorary disciples were at the bottom. They had nowhere to vent their anger and frustration. However, now that he, who entered the sect by attempting suicide was here, they viewed him as someone even lower than them and vented by bullying him.He laughed coldly to himself. He knew that this was not something he could do anything about. In the sect, the strong were always right. Some of the honorary disciples had been here for a long time, and their bodies were all very strong. Some had even learned some immortal technique. If he were to fight back, he was bound to lose.However, Wang Lin wasn\u2019t a complete pushover. He remembered the faces of all those disciples that looked down upon him and planned to take revenge when he becomes strong enough.With this mindset, he acted like he was blind and deaf, and continued to fetch water every day, while secretly studying the stone bead.He experimented by soaking the beads in various liquids. He tried mixing the dew and dipping the bead in spring water, sweat, and even blood. In the end, he found that the dew was the best by far.But there were different types of dew. The dew that appeared on the bead in the morning was the best, followed by the dew that appeared on the bead at night. If the dew was collected anywhere else, it was not as effective.Next best was when it was mixed with spring water. Blood and sweat were the worst, they had almost no effect at all.In order to not attract any attention, he found some small gourds in the wild and hollowed them to hold some of the dew.He did not carry these gourds with him. Instead, he would hide them separately in remote locations. He would only take them out when he was fetching water and never took them back to the sect.He carried a gourd with him when he worked. Whenever he became tired, he would take a drink and instantly feel refreshed.In addition, Wang Lin found out about a strange phenomenon. Whenever the night or early morning dew appeared on the stone bead, it would look like there were many drops of dew on the bead, but when collecting them, he could only get about one tenth of that amount. The rest disappeared.As for this strange phenomenon, Wang Lin could only say that the dew was absorbed by the bead. Although his explanation was a bit absurd, he really couldn\u2019t think of anything else.Today at dusk, Wang Lin filled the remaining three vats and said to the yellow clothed discipling while he was meditating, \u201cBrother Liu, I\u2019m going to take a trip home so I won\u2019t be coming tomorrow.\u201dThe youth Liu opened his eyes and looked at Wang Lin, then snorted.Wang Lin didn\u2019t care. He learned from Zhang Hu that an honorary disciple can return home to visit relatives three times a year. All he had to do was ask elder Sun for permission.Wang Lin remembered that his father\u2019s birthday was coming up. No matter what, he must go back. After finishing his chore, he walked toward the elder in charge of the honorary disciples.Heng Yue Sect was split into six academies that were split into five subdivisions. They were metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, each with their own honorary disciples. The inner disciples and elders all lived in the main courtyard. He would often pass by them when he fetched water. He always looked at them with eyes filled with envy. After arriving there, he took a good look around, then yelled, \u201cHonorary disciple Wang Lin requests for elder Sun.\u201dA young man dressed in white casually walked forward. He looked at Wang Lin once and said proudly, \u201cYou are Wang Lin?\u201dSeeing the youth dressed in white, Wang Lin\u2019s heart tightened as he nodded.He already knew all the Heng Yue Sect disciples were ranked by the color they wore. Honorary disciples were divided into gray and yellow. The yellows were given the right to start cultivating immortal technique. Inner disciples were ranked based on their strength. From high to low are purple, black, white and red.The youth in white\u2019s mouth twitched and he gave Wang Lin a cold look before turning around and walking back into the courtyard. Wang Lin followed behind him with a deadpan face.After walking through the courtyard for a while, he arrived at a house surrounded by flowers. The youth in white lazily said, \u201cTeacher Sun, an honorary disciple is here to see you.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he stood off to the side.A hoarse voice came from the garden. \u201cYou may leave, honorary disciple come in.\u201dThe youth in white chuckled and left.Wang Lin was very nervous inside. He pushed open the gate to the garden. The moment he entered the garden, he was hit by the aroma of various medicines. He turned around and looked at the gate, wondering why he couldn\u2019t smell it outside.A voice with discontent came from a corner room in the garden saying, \u201cWhat are you doing standing there? Hurry up and say your name.\u201dWang Lin quickly said, \u201cDisciple Wang Lin here to meet elder Sun. My dad\u2019s birthday is tomorrow, this disciple wishes to return home for a visit.\u201dThe voice scolded, \u201cYou are Wang Lin? So it was you. Hmph, a person training to be an immortal caring about worldly affairs? In your lifetime, you will never become an immortal!\u201dWang Lin frowned and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cDisciple hasn\u2019t even cultivated any immortal technique, how could disciple be on the path to an immortal?\u201dThe elder paused for a while and impatiently said, \u201cYou have three days, so return quickly. This is an thousand mile immortal talisman that can be used twice. It will increase your speed greatly.\u201d Then, an ordinary looking piece of dull yellow paper floated out from the window and landed next to Wang Lin.Wang Lin picked up the immortal talisman. He knew from Zhang Hu that all the disciples that visit home receive this. The goal of the sect was very simple: show off the sect\u2019s immortal technique and treasures to attract more youths to apply.This immortal talisman was in fact of very poor quality, however, the upside was that it was very easy to use. All you had to do was stick it on your leg. For normal people, it increased their speed.However, there were many honorary disciple that collected them because they heard they could be traded for other things in the outside world. Many disciples used the excuse of going back home just to collect the talismans.After walking out of the courtyard, Wang Lin headed back to his room. After saying goodbye to Zhang Hu, he started to descend from the mountain.At this time, the stars were shining in the sky. Wang Lin wanted to head home tomorrow, but he didn\u2019t want to use the talisman and was afraid he\u2019d miss his dad\u2019s birthday, so he headed out at night.Shortly after Wang Lin left, elder Sun came out from his room to gather some herbs, but was abruptly stunned. He stared at the gate entrance. All the blue grass that had been growing there had withered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 The ElderHe walked closer. Under careful inspection, he noticed that even the purple flowers across from the blue grass had withered, but not as badly as the blue grass.He clearly remembered that the herbs were still healthy and strong at noon. How could they become like this in just one afternoon? He picked up the blue grass and inspected it. From the look of the blue grass, it seemed to have lost all its moisture, causing it to wilt. He touched the ground, but the ground was at the correct moisture for growing herbs. He was very confused.After a while, he suddenly thought, \u201cThis afternoon only one person visited me. However, he is only an honorary disciple, how could he cause the herbs to wither?\u201dThinking about it, he decided to look into this matter. Without saying a word, he flicked his sleeves and his body started flying. Shortly after, he arrived at the place honorary disciples got their work assigned.Elder Sun shouted in a deep voice, \u201cWhich disciple here is in charge?\u201d The voice was like thunder. The yellow clothed disciple that was in charge quickly came over and kneeled on the ground, kowtowing non-stop.Elder Sun impatiently said, \u201cDo you have Wang Lin\u2019s registration?\u201dDisciple Liu\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He would never have thought that such a high ranking elder would ever come asking about that piece of trash, Wang Lin. He thought of the times he bullied Wang Lin and his face paled. \u201cThis disciple\u2026 has \u2026 has brother Wang Lin\u2019s registration. Brother Wang loves to learn and is always serious with this work. This disciple \u2026 this disciple has always looked to him as a role model.\u201dThe Elder Sun didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, but in his heart he knew that this was good. The more nervous someone was when they talked to him meant the more they respected him. The title elder is in fact a really worthless title in the Heng Yue Sect. Almost all second generation disciples are called elder by the honorary disciples, but all the inner disciples call him Uncle-Master.Although he was respected in the eyes of the honorary disciples, he didn\u2019t have power in the second generation. Even the third generation didn\u2019t respect him much.Else he wouldn\u2019t be assigned the pointless job of managing the requests of honorary disciples wishing to visit home.Elder Sun asked, \u201cWhich yard does Wang Lin live in?\u201d\u201cAt\u2026at the northern Earth Division\u2019s yard\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for him to finish, Elder Sun flew away on a rainbow toward the north and disappeared in a blink of an eye.Disciple Liu became even more nervous. His intestine almost turned green. He vowed that when he saw Wang Lin again, he must not ridicule him, but instead praise him treat him like his own grandfather. After all, he was something an elder personally asked about.Elder Sun arrived at the Earth Division\u2019s yard and didn\u2019t see Wang Lin. He went to the registry to find Wang Lin\u2019s room number, then arrived at Wang Lin\u2019s room. Zhang Hu was still sleeping. He was snoring loudly and didn\u2019t even realize Elder Sun was there.Elder Sun carefully examined the room. He frowned and muttered, \u201cHe left very quickly. Hmm, I\u2019ll inspect him once he is back.\u201dWang Lin was walking in the mountain with the talisman on his leg. The talisman was really amazing. After putting it on his leg, he felt a stream of warmth fill his body. Gathered at his feet were dazzling white light, making him look like an immortal.When all the creatures in the mountain saw the white light, they all stayed away. None dare to come close.The fresh mountain air blew at Wang Lin\u2019s face. He was in a good mood as he quickly went home following the route from his memory.One night had passed, and it was the dawn of the next day. He took a mouthful of water from the gourd and was filled with energy again. He noticed he had already left the mountain. Once he reached the village, he would just have to follow the little road back home.Without stopping, he rapidly went forward. He entered a town when the sun was bright and the crowd was hustling and bustling. Wang Lin went around for a bit, buying gifts for his parents, then quickly left.When it was late, Wang Lin finally reached the village. He saw from afar a red flag with the word life on it in front of his house.Outside, there were many wagons. There was a bustling crowd.Wang Lin was stunned as he arrived at the front of his house. His arrival was too flashy. His relatives, who were here for his father\u2019s birthday, only saw a flash of white light as Wang Lin appeared.Everyone had a look of envy as they started their praises.\u201cSecond brother, Wang Lin came back. Just look at how handsome this kid is! He looks just like an immortal!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just so? Even the Immortals messed up and ended up regretting their decision and took Wang Lin as their disciple. In the future, our Wang family will depend on these three children.\u201d\u201cIt was due to my old eyes that I wasn\u2019t able to see this kid\u2019s good points, but looking at him now, what part of him can\u2019t compare to Wang Zhuo and Wang Hao? Clearly a dragon amongst men! Good, good, good!\u201d Exclaimed Wang family\u2019s 3rd eldest uncle, as if he forgot all the vile things he had said before.\u201cThis kid, Wang Lin, has always been smart since he was a kid. I have to say, even the immortals made a mistake last time, so how could us mortals not make a mistake? Wang Lin I hope you don\u2019t hate your fifth uncle, your fifth uncle apologizes to you.\u201dAll the relatives changed their expressions and revealed kind and smiling faces.Wang Lin coldly snorted to himself. At that moment, his father appeared and was surprised as he pulled Wang Lin\u2019s arm. \u201cTie Zhu, why did you come back? Didn\u2019t I tell you to stay at the Heng Yue Sect? Don\u2019t always worry about home.\u201dWang Lin looked at his dad and saw his dad\u2019s wrinkles had lessened a lot. He was obviously very happy these days. \u201cDad, don\u2019t you worry. All the disciples of the sect have three chances to visit home a year. Once your birthday is over, I\u2019ll quickly head back.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s dad proudly looked at the relatives around him and pulled Wang Lin to the door yelling, \u201cWife, look who is back!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s mother was surround by a group of female relatives. When she heard her husband\u2019s voice, she looked toward him and was surprised to see Wang Lin. She rushed over and started asking about how he had been.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 Unexpected TransformationWang Lin felt warmth in his heart. For the past month, he had to get used to people deriding him. Now that he was back home, he felt the warmth of his parents.\u201cSecond brother, Wang Lin is really an immortal disciple. Your sixth brother is blind and said a few harsh words. I hope brother won\u2019t take it too serious. You know me, I have a sharp tongue, but a soft heart. It was all for Wang Lin\u2019s own good.\u201d\u201cSecond sister in law, when I told my daughter that I didn\u2019t betroth her, she panicked and said that she absolutely must marry your family\u2019s Tie Zhu. Let us settle this marriage.\u201d\u201cLao Er, your fifth uncle is old. In the future, the Wang Family will depend on you guys. Your fifth uncle has always had an eye for your son. In my eyes, he is even more promising than your older brother\u2019s son.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s parents\u2019 faces were glowing. After the birthday party started, all the relatives praised Wang Lin non-stop. Even a few who drank too much started causing a ruckus about banding together to get back the inheritance Wang Lin\u2019s father deserved. Wang Lin\u2019s father only smiled, not taking it seriously. He knew far too well how these relatives were.Wang Lin\u2019s father no longer cared about the things of the past. He just wanted Wang Lin to become better and better, nothing else.After a lively day, when it was dusk, all of the relatives left. Wang Lin was looking at the gifts in the yard. His heart filled with emotion. He remembered reading from a book saying when one achieves success, those around him benefit as well. He finally understood those words.That night, Wang Lin\u2019s parents asked him how his life at the sect was. Seeing the anticipation in his parents\u2019 eyes, he lied to them for the first time. He described to them how popular he was, and how he practiced immortal techniques. His parents listened in awe.For his parents, no matter how harsh being an honorary disciple was, no matter how much people ridiculed him, he would endure it, because ever since he was little, he had never seen them this happy.\u201cIt\u2019s only ten years, I\u2019ll endure!\u201d Wang Lin secretly decided in his heart.Wang Lin stayed at home and spent time with his parents for two days. On the third day, his parents and everyone in the village sent him off. He put the immortal talisman on his leg and left.Even when he was far away, he could hear the voices of the villagers.It was getting dark. The sky filled with dark clouds. There was thunder in the sky, and the high humidity caused mist to appear.Wang Lin couldn\u2019t help but speed up. He arrived at the Heng Yue Sect at midnight, then went to lay in his bed. Zhang Hu was still snoring. Wang Lin tossed and turned, but couldn\u2019t fall asleep. In the middle of the night, thunder roared outside and a flash of lightning lit up the room. Wang Lin touched the bead next to his chest. When he went home, he had his mom make an inner pocket in his shirt.Want Lin took out the stone bead and studied it in the light from the oil lamp. He rubbed his eyes as he took a close look at the cloud patterns on the bead.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. I remember that last time there were five clouds, but now there are six.\u201d Wang Lin was surprised, he sat up and counted. Indeed, there were six clouds.He was very surprised and couldn\u2019t think of a reason. This increased his curiosity toward the stone bead. He put it back in his pocket, turned off the oil lamp, and went to sleep.Outside, the wind was howling, thunder was roaring, lightning was striking, and rain was pouring from the sky. The rain slammed against the window. Wang Lin was suddenly awakened by a burst of cold air. He opened his eyes and was dumbfounded.The continuous lightning lit up the room. The room was full of thick mist. The table, ground, and even the beds were wet. However, except for a damp spot where he stored the bead, Wang Lin was completely dry. He looked at Zhang Hu and saw that his body was surrounded by a white mist. His were clothes wet, his body was covered in frost, and his teeth were clenched shut.\u201cZhang Hu! Zhang Hu!\u201d Wang Lin was surprised and quickly got up and shook Zhang Hu. However, Zhang Hu showed no sign of waking up, and his breath was weak.Wang Lin was very anxious. He was about to head out to look for other disciples for help, when he suddenly stopped and touched his clothes. A doubt raised in his mind.\u201cWhy is it that even though we are in the same room, and both beds are soaked, every part of my body, except for this damp spot, is dry?\u201d Wang Lin pondered, then suddenly took out the stone bead from his breast pocket.At that moment, all of the water droplets trembled and slowly began to float. Even the white mist on Zhang Hu started to form water droplets.Lightning flashed again and Wang Lin noticed that all the water droplets looked like crystals and charged toward the stone bead in his hand.Wang Lin quickly threw the stone bead and dropped to the floor to avoid the water droplets.The mysterious bead fell in an arc and rolled to the corner after it hit the ground. All the water droplets quickly shot toward the bead and disappeared into it.A moment later, all the water in the room disappeared. Even the beds were now dry. Zhang Hu\u2019s breathing returned to normal.After a long time, the thunderstorm still raged outside, but the sky was no longer pitch black, and rays of moonlight broke through. Wang Lin stood up and hesitantly picked up the stone bead. Upon closer inspection, he noticed that it had changed.The number of clouds on it had increased to seven!The scene before had caused his curiosity for the bead to increase, but also instilled a bit of fear into him. If he hadn\u2019t woken up in time, Zhang Hu would have been frozen to death.As to why he himself wasn\u2019t affected, Wang Lin could only guess that it was because he drank a lot of water that had the dew from the bead mixed in.However, Wang Lin was very curious about what the clouds on the stone bead do. But he eliminated the idea of going outside and letting the bead absorb more water. He was afraid the scene would cause everyone to notice.After hesitating for a while, he carefully put the bead back into his pocket. Not long after, dawn came and as Wang Lin was about to leave to do his chore when Zhang Hu jumped out of bed screaming, \u201cWater! Water! The thirst is killing me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 SuspicionZhang Hu ran to the table in a daze. He tried to pour a cup of water from the container for a long time, but not a single drop came out. He rubbed his eyes and saw the bedding was crumpled into a ball, then he stared at Wang Lin and said, \u201cWang Lin, when did you come back? This\u2026did a ghost do this?\u201dWang Lin smiled, then he opened the door and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. When I got back, it was already like this. Why don\u2019t you try asking the other disciples? However, if this gets to the elders, you would have to go through the trouble of explaining this and possibly get interrogated by them.\u201dZhang Hu shook his head, and said, \u201cForget it, I won\u2019t ask. If I get questioned by the elders, it would be hard to avoid punishment.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t mind him and walked out the door. It was still raining outside, so he quickened his pace, afraid that the bead would cause some disturbance in the rain. He took a deserted path to the eastern gate. All the water that fell on him was absorbed by the bead, and he was afraid someone would notice. At first he wanted to hide it in his room, but then decided it was safer to hide it outside.Wang Lin went to one of the places that he had previously hid a gourd containing dew. It was very early in the morning and not many people had awakened yet. He made sure no one followed him before burying the stone bead there.After that, he let out a sigh. He intended to wait for the rain to stop, then come back to take his treasure back. Wang Lin left very cautiously, making sure no one else was around, and made his way to the chore house. When he got there, he was just about to pick up a bucket when the weasel faced yellow clothed disciple came out. Disciple Liu was a bit startled when he saw Wang Lin, but quickly changed his expression to one full of enthusiasm as he rushed forward to snatch the bucket from Wang Lin\u2019s grasp. He said, \u201cIf it isn\u2019t brother Wang! How was your trip home? Are your parents doing well? Your senior has missed you on these days you were gone.\u201dWang Lin was stunned, he was very familiar with that face. It was exactly same face his relatives had at the party, but Wang Lin wasn\u2019t sure what Disciple Liu was trying to do.\u201cBrother Liu, my parents are doing well. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Wang Lin carefully replied, as he wasn\u2019t sure what Liu was up to.Disciple Liu warmly said, as he puffed his chest, \u201cBrother, from now on you don\u2019t have to wake up so early. Your big brother was joking with you, telling you to fill ten vats a day, but you went and seriously believed me. From now on, you only need to fill one vat a day. Even if you don\u2019t finish in time, you can go eat when food is served. If anyone gives you any trouble, just tell your big brother!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s face changed color. He hesitantly asked, \u201cBig brother, is there some matter you wish for me to attend to?\u201dDisciple Liu\u2019s face was full of discontent, and pretended to be angry. \u201cLittle brother, how could you be so cold with your big brother? You are my little brother, naturally I should care for you. In the future, your issues are my issues. As for these chores, just do some work to say you worked. In the end, if you do good or bad is just my opinion. Since it\u2019s raining today you don\u2019t need to work. That\u2019s right Elder Sun came looking for you a few days ago. Now that your back, it\u2019s best to go check in with him.\u201d He finished speaking and watched Wang Lin\u2019s reaction carefully.Wang Lin muttered to himself and kept from laughing out loud. In his heart, he had guessed more than half the story after listening to the Disciple Liu. Elder Sun must have come looking for him after he left, and Disciple Liu must be afraid of any grudge between them, that\u2019s why he is so friendly today. He didn\u2019t bother to point out the misunderstanding, and imitated what Disciple Liu did when they first met and snorted.Disciple Liu\u2019s heart skipped when he saw Wang Lin\u2019s expression. This confirmed his own suspicion, this trash really was living the dream: to be able to get the attention of an elder. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be so arrogant. This kid looked like one that would hold a grudge. He thought to himself, \u201cHe will definitely take revenge on me later.\u201dDisciple Liu had been an honorary disciple for 13 years, and had spent 6 years at the chore house. He had never before seen an elder seeking out an honorary disciple personally. It was already a rare event for an inner disciple to be sent by an elder.It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t considered the fact that Wang Lin had offended the elder, but it was only his speculation. However, he wasn\u2019t sure. It wouldn\u2019t be an issue if he was right, but iwa scared of what would happen if he was wrong. He had been in the Heng Yue Sect for many years, and knew exactly how insignificant he was.Thinking of this, he gritted his teeth and took out a piece of yellow paper, then handed it to Wang Lin. \u201cLittle brother, when senior brother saw you last month, I ignored you. This is just a little gift not worth anything. You have to accept it. If you don\u2019t \u2026\u201dBefore Lie could finish, Wang Lin had already grabbed the yellow paper. When he saw it earlier he noticed it was the immortal talisman used when honorary disciples go home.\u201cThank you senior brother. This little brother doesn\u2019t want to be arrogant, but elder is waiting for me. We will have to catch up next time.\u201d Wang Lin said while chuckling.Brother Liu was a bit envious as he nodded. \u201cThe elder is more important, little brother should go quickly.\u201dWang Lin was calm on the surface, but on the inside, he had many doubts about Elder Sun. Why did he personally come looking for him? Wang Lin leisurely walked to the courtyard with these questions in his head. He had gone thoroughly analyzed the situation, but in the end, he couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion.\u201cCould he have found out about the stone bead?\u201d Wang Lin thought. He pondered the question for a bit. He didn\u2019t have the ability to bribe the elder, and if he didn\u2019t go, he would offend the elder, so he might as well pretend he didn\u2019t know anything. Since the bead was not on him, he stopped thinking about it and walked forward.Not long after he arrived at the courtyard and announced his presence, the same youth in white appeared and was surprised. He quipped, \u201cWhat, you have to visit home again?\u201dWang Lin raised his brow, right before he was about speak, Elder Sun\u2019s voice came from within the courtyard.\u201cQuickly, bring him here! Without delay!\u201dThe disciple in white\u2019s mouth twitched. He gave Wang Lin a thoughtful look, then headed back into the courtyard. Wang Lin followed silently.After arriving at Elder Sun\u2019s residence, the youth in white left. Before leaving, he shot Wang Lin a questioning look.Wang Lin was a bit nervous as he pushed open the gate and entered. The moment he entered, he saw an old man coming out from a room in the garden. The old man\u2019s face was full of wrinkles, his were eyes bright, and he scanned Wang Lin with a cool look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 \u2013 DiscipleUnder the elder\u2019s eyes, Wang Lin felt like he was transparent and the elder could see everything.The elder frowned. He couldn\u2019t find anything abnormal about Wang Lin, then asked, \u201cWang Lin, when did you come back?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s heart was still pounding from that one glance. He quickly replied, \u201cThis disciple came back late last night. This morning, when I went to do my daily chores, brother Liu told me Elder was looking for me.\u201dElder Sun\u2019s face was gloomy. Without a word, he grabbed Wang Lin. With a step, they disappeared in a rainbow colored cloud toward Wang Lin\u2019s room.The speed was too fast. Wang Lin felt like he was suffocating, but luckily, the trip was very short. When they arrived at Wang Lin\u2019s room, Elder Sun tossed Wang Lin to the side and scanned the room with his Divine Sense.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Elder Sun moved next to Wang Lin\u2019s bed and found the gourd Wang Lin used to store spring water.Wang Lin looked calm on the surface, but his heart skipped a beat and he quickly tried to find the right words to say.Elder Sun studied it for a long time, then he turned to Wang Lin and asked, \u201cWang Lin, what did you store in this gourd?\u201dWang Lin tried to play the fool and said, \u201cElder, this gourd is filled with spring water from the mountain. This spring water is really amazing. Every time I\u2019m tired, all I have to do is drink some and I\u2019ll immediately feel refreshed. When I was little, I read a book telling me that everything the immortals use are good. I didn\u2019t expect even the spring water to be this amazing. Elder, if you want this spring water, there are ten vats full of it in the supply house. Each of those vats are the size of a house. That water was all fetched by me.\u201dElder Sun opened up the gourd and sniffed it. Suddenly, his expression changed, and he eagerly said, \u201cWho asked you about the spring water? Quickly, tell me where you found this gourd!\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He innocently asked, \u201cElder, what\u2019s wrong with the gourd? I saw it floating down the river when I went to fetch water. I thought it looked pretty good, so I fished it out of the water.\u201dElder Sun narrowed his eyes and gave Wang Lin a deep look. He touched the gourd and thought, \u201cThere is a large amount of spiritual energy within this gourd. If a mortal drank the water stored in this gourd, while they won\u2019t be able to absorb much of the spiritual energy, it would still refresh them. He doesn\u2019t seem to be lying. This gourd is a complete waste on him. If this was used to make immortal pills, the effect should be good.\u201dThere was a high chance that the death of the blue grass and the purple night flower had something to do with the gourd. Maybe they were natural enemies. This matter couldn\u2019t be certain without further testing.Stopping his thoughts there, his expression suddenly changed and carefully looked at the gourd. He frowned and coldly stared at Wang Lin. \u201cWang Lin, you sure are bold. You dare to lie to an Elder? Looks like you don\u2019t want to stay in the Heng Yue Sect anymore!\u201dWang Lin revealed a puzzled face. He quickly responded, \u201cElder, I\u2019m not lying to you. There really are ten vats full of spring water in the supply house.\u201dWithout letting Wang Lin finish speaking, Elder Sun let out an angry laugh and said. \u201cYou\u2019re still acting innocent with me? I was asking you about the gourd. This gourd looks like it was just recently broken off its vine. Wang Lin, I\u2019ll give you one last chance to tell me where you got this gourd, or I\u2019ll kick you out of the Heng Yue Sect today!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s face revealed an angry expression. His expression showed a will to fight and cried, \u201cSo what if I\u2019m kicked out? Here at the Heng Yue Sect, all I have done is fetch water to fill those ten vats. Many times I stayed more than a week before I could eat. If it wasn\u2019t for the sweet potatoes my mom gave me, I would have starved to death already. This isn\u2019t cultivation, it\u2019s just torture!\u201d\u201cI spent a lot of effort to fish that gourd out of the river. If you want it, just take it. Why say I am lying to you? What does the gourd still having its vine have to do with me? Maybe someone broke it off the vine and tossed it in the water. You question me, but who am I going to ask about it?\u201dElder Sun looked at the remaining sweet potatoes, then looked at the gourd. He pondered a little and thought, \u201cWhile I want this gourd, to steal an honorary disciple\u2019s treasure and then drive him away would be too disgraceful. It would be bad if news of this were to spread. My reputation would be ruined, and if other people in the sect were to find out about this gourd, I wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent them from taking it. This kid is still lying to me. There has to be more gourds like this. If I can get them all, my pill creation skill will go up by another level.\u201dThinking of this, he suddenly changed into a surprised expression and exclaimed, \u201cYou sure had it rough, kid. I didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t get to eat for a whole week. Now that I know of this issue, I\u2019ll deal with it. Even honorary disciples are still disciples of the Heng Yue Sect!\u201dAfter he finished talking, he noticed that Wang Lin was still angry. He coldly laughed to himself, but kindly said, \u201cWang Lin, I want this gourd, but I want to treat you properly. Do you want to be my helper?\u201dWang Lin muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. Helper is the same as a servant. If my dad found out I that became a servant, he would beat me to death.\u201dElder Sun almost lost his temper. He wanted to beat him to death before Wang Lin\u2019s dad could. Although he was at the bottom of the second generation, if he said he was looking for a helper in the sect, all the honorary disciples would rush for the position.Swallowing his anger, he yelled, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll accept you as my disciple. I\u2019m going to go tell the patriarch right now. You pack your things, then come wait for me at my garden.\u201d After he finished speaking, he walked out of Wang Lin\u2019s room. With a step, a cloud appeared as he headed straight toward the patriarch.When he left, Wang Lin\u2019s expression darkened. He sneered inwardly, \u201cThis old man has ulterior motives. On the surface, he accepted me as a disciple, but in reality, he just wants more gourds.\u201dWang Lin pondered this for a while, then chuckled. He only wanted some gourds. There were plenty of gourds in the mountain. He just had to soak some in some water with the bead. Now that there was an opportunity to become an inner disciple, he had to take this opportunity to cultivate properly.After thinking about it, he became very excited. He packed his things and left a lot of sweet potatoes for Zhang Hu. He then started to walk toward Elder Sun\u2019s yard.This time, he didn\u2019t announce his arrival and walked straight into the courtyard. The white clothed youth, who was sitting on top of a tree, didn\u2019t stop him. He already received the news that Elder Sun had accepted Wang Lin as a disciple. The youth laughed, saying to himself, \u201cA trash master accepted a trash disciple. This is very fitting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 \u2013 CultivationAfter waiting a while in the garden, Elder Sun came back with a dark expression. His face was full of anger. Earlier, when he talked to the patriarch about the matter, some of his apprentice-brothers ridiculed him. He thought, \u201cWait until I get all the gourds and create an immortal pill that will greatly increase my cultivation. Let\u2019s see who will be laughing then.\u201dAfter entering the garden, Elder Sun saw Wang Lin and huffed, \u201cWang Lin, from today on, you are my, Sun Dazhu\u2019s, disciple. You must cultivate properly to not disgrace your master\u2019s name.\u201d He tossed out a small pouch and said, \u201cThis is the inner disciple\u2019s identification. It also acts as a bag of holding. It can hold a lot of things. Your clothes and instructions to your cultivation method are stored inside. Check it out yourself.\u201dWang Lin quickly picked it up. He was very excited, and his mind was filled with the thoughts of his parents\u2019 expectations. This time, he wholeheartedly called Sun Dazhu master.Sun Dazhu replied with a grunt. He shifted his gaze and said, \u201cFrom now on, you will live in the room in the back. You can\u2019t leave without my permission.\u201dWith that statement, he picked up a pebble and threw it at the garden gate behind him. There was only a purple light when the pebble hit the gate and it disintegrated into a fine powder.After this display, Sun Dazhu gave Wang Lin a cold look and walked into his room.Wang Lin\u2019s pupils contracted. He was terrified. He held his bag of holding and entered his room. The room was small and only contained a bed. Wang Lin didn\u2019t mind. He sat on the bed examined the bag of holding.The little gray bag didn\u2019t look that special. Wang Lin turned the bag upside down on the ground and several things fell out. There was a set of red clothes and a little booklet.Wang Lin\u2019s face lit up. He picked up the little booklet and excitedly opened it. On the first page it read: \u201cThree Stages of Qi Condensation \u201dHe read until midnight using the light of the oil lamp. He closed the book and felt he had a bit more understanding of cultivation. This booklet contained three stages of concentrating qi, which were considered the most basic stages. In the booklet, it was mentioned that there were total of 15 stages of Qi Condensation. Only after reaching the third stage could one gain access to the method for later stages.The so called Qi Condensation was to absorb the spiritual energy from heaven and earth to change the body and build a foundation for the future.This was also a test of how good one\u2019s natural talents was. The more talented one was, the faster they could absorb spiritual energy into their body. Naturally, their cultivation speed would be quick, however, if one\u2019s talent was average, then perhaps they would never reach the third layer in their lifetime. Some couldn\u2019t even reach the first layer.The Three Stages of Qi Condensation booklet became Wang Lin\u2019s treasure. He immediately memorized the method for the first three layers in his mind. He sat cross legged with his eyes closed and began to breath with the one long three short method stated in the booklet. One long means to take a deep breath, while three short means to take three short breaths that were one third the length of a normal breath. Using this abnormal breathing method allows one to quickly absorb spiritual energy into their body.The booklet indicated that the first time one practiced breathing technique, they would feel as if there are ants crawling inside their body. This was caused by spiritual energy entering the body. The booklet said not to be nervous. Just relax and imagine yourself becoming nothing, then become one with heaven and earth.After a long time, Wang Lin helplessly found that not only did he not feel anything, but he was out of breath thanks to this abnormal breathing.Wang Lin sighed. He knew that most of the disciples here had a lot of talent and that this booklet was written for them. His talent was only average. How could he compete with them?But he wasn\u2019t discouraged. After taking a few breaths, he continued the breathing technique.The night went by slowly. By the time morning came, Wang Lin still wasn\u2019t able to feel any spiritual energy enter this body. His head was dizzy from not sleeping at all that night as he got up and opened the door to go out.Outside, there was a gentle breeze that carried the scent of medication. He took a few deep breaths, but wasn\u2019t able to get rid of his exhaustion. He missed the spring water filled gourd. If he could drink some of that spring water, he wouldn\u2019t be this tired.But right now was not the time to act rashly. He was very confident in where he hid the stone bead and the gourds. He searched almost half the mountain to find a secluded location. Even if they happened upon the location, they wouldn\u2019t find his treasure.He strolled into the herb garden until he found a rock. Wang Lin sat down on the rock and started to cultivate. After a while, he felt like ants were crawling in his body. He was stunned. Right as he was about to continue, his teacher shouted, \u201cWang Lin, what are you doing? Quickly come out of there. I\u2019m telling you now; never cultivate in the herb garden.\u201dWang Lin opened his eyes and saw Sun Dazhu sullenly staring at him. He silently got up and left the herb garden.Sun Dazhu coldly snorted, \u201cYou sure know how to find a good location. I\u2019m growing my herbs here because it has the most spiritual energy in the garden, and you come and suck it away. If any of these herbs die because of this, even our lives couldn\u2019t compensate for them.\u201dWang Lin glared at Sun Dazhu and respectfully said, \u201cDisciple didn\u2019t know any better. Disciple will never cultivate here again.\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s expression returned to normal, then he added \u201cHowever, if you can find me another gourd, while I can\u2019t let you cultivate in the herb garden, I can give you a low-grade spirit stone. With it, your Qi Condensation will be lot easier.\u201dWang Lin lowered his head. A look of ridicule flashed across his face, then he said, \u201cDisciple can go check the spring in the mountains again. If my luck is good, I might be able to find another one.\u201dSun Dazhu pondered a little and said, \u201cYou go have a look. Remember, if you bring me back another gourd, I\u2019ll reward you with a low-grade spirit stone.\u201dWang Lin looked up at Sun Dazhu and asked, \u201cIs what master is saying true? If I bring back a gourd, you will give me a spirit stone?\u201dSun Dazhu had a happy look on his face as he said, \u201cYes. As long as I get a gourd, I\u2019ll give you a low-grade spirit stone.\u201dWang Lin secretly sneered, but on the surface he respectfully nodded in response.Sun Dazhu\u2019s right hand formed a seal and he muttered a few words, then he threw his arm and the gate swung open. He rubbed his beard and said, \u201cGo ahead. Leave now and come back quickly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 \u2013 GourdWang Lin left the garden without saying a word. His red uniform drew a lot of attention from the honorary disciples. Their faces were full of envy. However, when they took a closer look, and noticed who was wearing it, their expressions immediately turned weird and became even more envious.\u201cSo it turns out that the person who became an inner disciple was him! He became an honorary disciple by trying to commit suicide. What method could he have used this time?\u201d\u201cIs there a need to ask? I say he must have done some nasty things to gain the Elder\u2019s favor. That type of person is completely shameless.\u201d\u201cYeah, just look at that stupid face. Even if he became an inner disciple, he\u2019ll still be at the bottom. How could cultivation be so easy?\u201d\u201cThat piece of trash. It doesn\u2019t matter if he becomes an inner disciple, we shouldn\u2019t care. Trash is trash, and no matter where they go, they will be looked down upon.\u201d\u201cDamn it. I\u2019ve been an honorary disciple for four years and haven\u2019t seen someone as shameless as him. Why did the elder pick him? I\u2019m better than him in every way!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve only been here for four years? I\u2019ve been here for 12 years, but relied on my own skill. Look at how arrogant he is! Hmph, inner disciples constantly fight with each other, so let\u2019s wait and watch the show.\u201dAll those words were heard by Wang Lin. He scanned everyone with a cold look in his eyes. He wasn\u2019t strong enough right now, but he vowed to definitely get revenge in the future.After a while, he arrived at the east gate. He ran along the small road until he reached the spring. He washed his face with the cold water to refresh himself, then took a few drinks before sitting down and beginning to think.Elder Sun sat on a nearby tree, cursing, \u201cThis little bastard. He said he was going to find a gourd. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s really waiting here for a gourd to float by.\u201dAfter Wang Lin left, Elder Sun immediately started tailing him to see if he could see where Wang Lin had found that gourd. However, he didn\u2019t expect Wang Lin to sit down and start cultivating.The spiritual energy here was denser than it was in his room, but not as dense as it was in the herb garden. Based on his understanding, this Qi Condensation was just how much spiritual energy was in one\u2019s body. While he could only absorb a little at a time right now, this was something that could be fixed with time.What Wang Lin guessed was correct. Qi Condensation was just spiritual energy entering the body to build a good foundation for the future.Wang Lin kept up the breathing technique until noon, then got up and stretched. He still hadn\u2019t felt the sensation of ants crawling all over his body. He stood next to the spring and thought Elder Sun must not have let him go out for no reason. The elder must be spying nearby,He touched his stomach and casually walked back toward the sect. Elder Sun exploded with anger. He had been pointlessly waiting the whole morning for nothing. He muttered, \u201cBastard. This old man will play your game. If you won\u2019t succeed in one day, then I\u2019ll wait one month. If one month isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ll just wait a year. I refuse to believe you don\u2019t have another gourd.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he arrived at the herb garden before Wang Lin.After a while, Wang Lin casually walked back in. Sun Dazhu stroked his beard and asked, \u201cDisciple, did you find a gourd this morning?\u201dWang Lin sighed and shook his head. \u201cTeacher, disciple waited the whole time at the spring, but didn\u2019t find any gourd. I\u2019ll go wait in the afternoon. I might get lucky then.\u201dSun Dazhu thought, \u201cYou kept your eyes closed in meditation this whole morning. Even if a gourd had floated by, you wouldn\u2019t have seen it.\u201d But he instead said, \u201cVery good. Wang Lin, you go eat first. Then, go check it out in the afternoon.\u201dWang Lin responded with a sound. He walked into his room and noticed there was a table with 4 dishes of meat and vegetables and even soup that would make anyone hungry. He didn\u2019t ask who brought the food in, but quickly ate some and even drank all the soup before laying on his bed to take a small nap.Sun Dazhu\u2019s body appeared like a ghost. His face darkened as he thought, \u201cThis old man follows the sect rules, so I won\u2019t poison your food, but I can put in drugs that will hinder your spiritual energy absorption. With your average ability and my drugs, you will never get past the third layer of Qi Condensation. You will be forever under my control.\u201dAfter one hour, Wang Lin woke up. He straightened his clothes and walked back to the spring, then started to cultivate again. He cultivated until it was dark before getting up, and without saying a word, walked into the jungle in the mountain.Sun Dazhu, who was sitting in a nearby tree, silently followed Wang Lin.Wang Lin slowly made right and left turns in the mountain and looked left and right along the way. Suddenly, his expression became happy when he arrived at a vine full of gourds. He picked a small gourd that looked nice, then quickly left.After he left, Sun Dazhu was very confused. No matter how he looked, the gourd looked very normal. He took a few gourds with him and disappeared.Wang Lin followed the mountain road and returned back to the sect in no time. He ignored the words of all the other disciples. After entering the herb garden, he saw Sun Dazhu\u2019s sullen face glaring at him.Wang Lin immediately respectfully handed the gourd to the elder and said, \u201cTeacher, my luck this afternoon was pretty good. Although I wasn\u2019t able to find any in the spring, I walked around the mountain and found a lot of gourds. This one looked the most like the one I had before. Teacher, how is it?\u201dSun Dazhu nearly lost his temper, but swallowed it and managed to barely squeeze out a smile. He took the gourd and tossed it to the side without looking, then said to Wang Lin, word for word, \u201cThe gourd I want is the one that is filled with spiritual energy like before. Why would I want a random gourd?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t control his temper, so he ended up yelling the last few words. He wasted a whole day following this kid and was tricked by him to pick and test a few ordinary gourds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 \u2013 Chased outWhen he thought of those gourds, he just couldn\u2019t control his anger. No matter how he looked at the gourds on his way back, they looked normal. He even hollowed them out to fill with spring water. He was spotted by fellow apprentice-brother and was laughed at.Wang Lin sneered in his heart, but on the surface he wore an innocent face as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what spiritual energy is. I just heard you say that you\u2019ll give me a spirit stone if I bring you a gourd. How about you explain to me what spiritual energy is?\u201dSun Dazhu felt dizzy. He seriously looked at Wang Lin for a long time. He began to suspect that the gourd was really the only one and was picked up in a stroke of luck by this dumb kid.After pondering a little, he realized that what Wang Lin had said was reasonable. Only after reaching the first layer of Qi Condensation would one be able to detect spiritual energy in the surroundings. After thinking about it, he regretted putting drug in his food. This kid\u2019s talent was already bad, and now with the drug, it would take at least 30 to 50 years before he could reach the first layer of Qi Condensation.Sun Dazhu sighed, but he isn\u2019t willing to give up. He hesitantly took out a low quality spirit stone and tossed it to Wang Lin. \u201cThis is the promised low quality spirit stone. Take this to cultivate and quickly cultivate to the first layer of Qi Condensation.\u201dWang Lin quickly took it and returned to his room after expressing his gratitude.Sun Dazhu just stood there for a long time before sighing and muttered to himself, \u201cThis is the only way to see if he is lying.\u201dSoul Search was a simple immortal technique. The worst possible outcome for the person it was used on would be death due to their soul being shattered. The best would be becoming a retard.But this soul technique also had drawbacks. Before one reached the Core Formation stage, if used on a mortal, the user would suffer the same damage as the target.If one was in the Core Formation stage, then it was not an issue. However, it could only be used three times in one\u2019s lifetime, and every time it was used, the user would lose one level of cultivation.Wang Lin sat crossed legged in his room. No matter how he observed the stone, it didn\u2019t seem special at all. However, when he was holding it, he felt his mind become very clear. He started cultivating.The night passed by. Wang Ling sighed. He still didn\u2019t get the feeling of ants crawling in his body. No sign of spiritual energy in his body. He smiled bitterly. At that moment, someone pushed open the door. Sun Dazhu walked in with a dark expression, carrying a bowl of black liquid.\u201cDrink this!\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He cautiously looked at it. Before taking it, he asked, \u201cTeacher, what is this?\u201dSun Dazhu saw Wang Lin\u2019s expression and became angry. He shouted, \u201cDo you really think I would harm you? If it wasn\u2019t to help you reach the first layer of Qi Condensation, do you really think I would spend the whole night and waste precious herbs to make this drug?\u201dWang Lin hesitated and saw Sun Dazhu\u2019s unkind gaze. He took the bowl and gulped the drug down.After he finished drinking it, he felt a burning feeling coming from his stomach. It spread to his whole body, making him feel thirsty. It was as if he was being baked in a fire.His vision turned black. He dropped the bowl and felt as if he was about to fall asleep.\u201cQuickly cultivate. I\u2019ll help you absorb.\u201d Sun Dazhu reluctantly put his hand on Wang Lin\u2019s chest.A cool feeling entered Wang Lin\u2019s head, clearing his mind. He quickly started to cultivate. Sun Dazhu sadly looked at the bowl on the floor. He muttered a few words, then took out a few low quality spirit stones and placed them around Wang Lin. He thought, \u201cBoy, this time I\u2019m investing a lot into you. In the future, you better repay me for all this.\u201dAfter a little while, the feeling of ants crawling in his body came. Sun Dazhu could clearly feel Wang Lin\u2019s body condensing the spiritual energy from the drug. A joyous expression appeared on his face.Just at that moment, a foul Qi appeared within Wang Lin\u2019s body and quickly destroyed the condensing Qi.Sun Dazhu\u2019s face was bitter. He knew that the source of the foul Qi was the Qi shattering grass he had placed in Wang Lin\u2019s food yesterday. After all the spiritual energy from the drug was used up, there still wasn\u2019t any Qi condensed in Wang Lin\u2019s body.Sun Dazhu sighed. He stared at Wang Lin with mixed feelings.Wang Lin opened his eyes. His body felt light and very comfortable. He was about to thank Sun Dazhu when he noticed the elder\u2019s bitter face. Sun Dazhu left without saying a word.Wang Lin was stunned. He didn\u2019t know what was going on with Sun Dazhu. He walked out and shouted, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go to the spring and see how my luck is today!\u201dSun Dazhu didn\u2019t say a word, but the gate to the garden silently opened. As he walked out, Sun Dazhu still followed behind him, unwilling to give up.One month quickly passed. In that month, Wang Lin went to the spring to cultivate every day, and Sun Dazhu followed him every day. He became more and more disappointed each day.Throughout the month, he gave Wang Lin drugs everyday to help him condense his Qi, but they all failed. Sun Dazhu\u2019s temper became worse and worse.The most important thing Sun Dazhu noticed was that the spiritual energy in the gourd slowly disappeared. After only a month, the spring water that filled the gourd came out as just spring water.Finally, the gourd became the same as a normal gourd. Sun Dazhu was disappointed. After analyzing it, he guessed that this was a normal gourd, but was somehow charged with spiritual energy. This kid must have just stumbled upon it by pure luck. The chances of him having more gourds like this was very low.He was more and more convinced that this was correct, causing his heart to ache. This month, he didn\u2019t do anything but spy on Wang Lin and made medication for him. Now, all that effort had been wasted. He angrily called Wang Lin over. He reprimanded him, and with a wave of his sleeve, threw him out of the yard.Every time he saw Wang Lin, he would get angry. Now, he was out of sight and out of mind. After a while, he had completely forgotten about that disciple.He thought again. Even though Wang Lin had been taking medication the whole month, it would still take eight to ten years for Wang Lin to reach the first layer of Qi Condensation, unless he kept taking the medicine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 \u2013 Nine CloudsWang Lin was also very happy. Although he was kicked from the yard and many honorary disciples ridiculed him throughout the month, he had learned a lot about cultivation. He learned that there were 5 stages: Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, and Spirit Forming.In the entire Heng Yue Sect, there were only two Core Formation stage experts. They both lived in the mountain peak, the place with the highest quantity of spiritual energy. They were always behind closed doors, training, and never bothering with the matters of the sect. There were only ten people in the sect who had reached the Foundation Establishment stage. They held the second highest positions and got to enjoy special privileges, such as using any magic treasure they wish.Aside from those people, everyone else was stuck at the Qi Condensation stage. Even Sun Dazhu was only in the 5th layer of Qi Condensation.Cultivation was not only very hard, but also consumed a lot of time. If one possessed inadequate talent, they wouldn\u2019t have enough years in their lifetime to cultivate. Foundation Establishment was even harder than Qi Condensation, as one not only needed enough spiritual energy, but also luck and perception to succeed.Wang Lin knew the importance of spiritual energy. He wanted to quickly recover the stone bead.He may still not have had any spiritual energy in his body, but he believed that as long as he kept drinking the water enhanced by the bead, the process would speed up. The so called Qi Condensation was just collecting spiritual energyFrom Sun Dazhu\u2019s reaction, the water the stone bead had been soaked in must contain a large amount of spiritual energy. Thinking about this, Wang Lin became very excited, and forgot about the spring water where he hid the stone bead. There were three gourds full of dew. Those must contain even more spiritual energy.If he drank them, it wouldn\u2019t be worse than the whole month of medication he was taking, most likely even better. That was why he didn\u2019t feel bad about being kicked out. In fact, he felt excitement.He was an inner disciple, so he didn\u2019t have to live in the main courtyard. He could live in any of the five other court yards. He picked a remote house close to the east gate of the courtyard.Inner disciples got different treatment depending on the color of their clothes. He learned from Sun Dazhu in the past month that on the 10th of every month, every inner disciple could go and pick up a fragment of low-grade spirit stone and a Qi Gathering Pill.After saving up 10 spirit stone shards, one could go to any elder to exchange them for a whole low quality spirit stoneAfter Wang Lin cleaned up his house, he didn\u2019t immediately set out to find the stone bead. He was afraid that Sun Dazhu was still spying on him. He continued his normal routine of cultivating at the spring during the day, and continued to cultivate in his home at night.In fact, Sun Dazhu was unwilling to give up. He spied on him for 10 more days before he finally gave up.One month later, Wang Lin sneaked out in the middle of the night. After making many left and right turns in the mountain, he retrieved the stone bead and gourds without anyone noticing.After being careful for a few days, he noticed that there were no abnormalities, and was finally able to relax. He no longer went to the spring, but stayed home to study the stone bead all day.Wang Lin touched the bead and immediately noticed that the number of clouds had increased from seven to nine. It must have been because of the high humidity in the mountain, allowing the bead to absorb a lot of water.As for the three gourds, as Wang Lin opened them, he found that the dew inside them had become sticky, especially the one that contained the morning dew. It had almost become jelly-like.Wang Lin looked at the stone bead, then at the three gourds. He started to become excited. If the stone bead needed to absorb water, what if the water from the three gourds was used? Would it cause the 10th cloud to appear?His heart skipped a beat. The bead was already really small. Currently, the nine clouds covered almost the entire bead. There was only a fingernail sized space left on the bead. Wang Lin guessed that that\u2019s where the 10th cloud will be.We pondered a little. In his heart, he really wanted to know what would happen once it had ten clouds. There was no more space for an 11th cloud, so the 10th must be the final one.But today was the day to pick up the spirit stone fragment. Wang Lin noticed it was getting dark outside. He stored the stone bead and gourds in his bag of holding before leaving the room.He now knew the sect very well. After a while, he arrived at the main courtyard. He quickly sprinted toward the pill house before it got dark.Before he got there, he heard a familiar voice from the distance.\u201cApprentice-sister Zhou, master allowed me to go into closed door training for three months to charge for the first layer of Qi Condensation, but I keep thinking of you. I wasn\u2019t able to calm my heart the whole time! I wanted to quickly reach the first layer of Qi Condensation just so I could see you. Last night, I finally reached the first layer of Qi Condensation, so I rushed out to gather this flower for you in the mountains. Look at how pretty the flower is. There was a huge snake guarding the flower, so I spend a lot of effort to obtain it. Look, even my elbow was injured because of it.\u201dWang Lin frowned and stopped. He sneered in his heart and kept going.Then, came a crisp female voice. \u201cApprentice-brother Wang, my family is a family of doctors. This flower is clearly a very common flower called Asuka. I see many of them when I climb up the mountain. This is the first time I heard a snake would guard it. If it\u2019s true, then our Heng Yue Sect would be filled with snakes. Apprentice-sister Zhou, don\u2019t believe him.\u201dAt that moment, Wang Lin walked into the pill house\u2019s courtyard. There were four others in there, two male and two female, all wearing red.One of the males looked very handsome and well groomed. He was very embarrassed and was about to retort, but then he noticed Wang Lin. Suddenly, he stared at the door with an expression of disbelief and said, \u201cWang Lin! You\u2026 Why are you here, you should be at home doing carpenter work with your father!\u201dOne of the girls on the side said, \u201cWang Lin? Ah, so you\u2019re the one that became an honorary disciple by trying to commit suicide, then became an inner disciple by sucking up to Elder Sun!\u201d Her shiny black hair was in a ponytail. She had thick eyebrows and big black eyes. She was very pretty.The other two\u2019s faces were full of shock, stares locked onto Wang Lin. One of the girls had large, child-like eyes, decorated by beautiful eyelashes. Her eyes were like two crystal balls, and they showed a look of interest.Wang Lin\u2019s face was deadpan as he scanned the people in front of him. The moment he heard the girl\u2019s voice, he realized it was the girl who was ridiculing Wang Zhuo. But looking at her, she looked very familiar. Wang Lin thought carefully and remembered that she was the one that had been picked during the disciple selection a few months ago. After recognizing her, he deduced that the other one must\u2019ve been Apprentice-sister Zhou, to whom Wang Zhuo was trying to give the flower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 \u2013 Qi Gathering PillThe last man was a youth about 20 years old. He had a long, horse-like face. He raised his chin and said, with a look of disdain, \u201c Apprentice-brother Wang, you have been in closed door training for three months, so you don\u2019t know. This Wang Lin is the biggest joke in the sect right now. Just as Apprentice-sister Xu said, he used those methods to become an inner disciple.\u201dAfter Wang Zhuo heard that, he laughed out loud. \u201cYou really scared me for a second there. So that\u2019s how you entered the sect. Even if you enter here, you\u2019ll probably never reach the first layer of Qi Condensation. Why even come here and tarnish the Wang Family\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cApprentice-brother Wang, what you said is wrong. While talent is important, what\u2019s more important is perseverance. Cultivation is already going against the heavens. If one doesn\u2019t have perseverance, it doesn\u2019t matter, no matter how talented they are.\u201d The girl named Zhou said, with a voice that shook the heart.As she took a few steps closer to Wang Zhuo, the girl named Xu said, \u201cWhat Apprentice-brother Wang said isn\u2019t wrong though. This Wang Lin looks so dumb. He doesn\u2019t look like a cultivator at all.\u201dWang Lin chuckled. He understood that the situation between them was complex. Wang Zhuo liked this girl named Zhou, but the girl named Xu liked Wang Zhuo, so she was trying to destroy their relationship earlierHearing Wang Lin\u2019s laughter caused Wang Zhuo to be very dissatisfied. He snorted and said, \u201cWang Lin, I advise you to leave the Heng Yue Sect for your own good. If you don\u2019t, if you don\u2019t die, you\u2019ll definitely be crippled at the disciple competition in the end of the year.\u201dWang Lin heard from Sun Dazhu that there was a disciple competition at the end of the year where the winner could get a magical treasure. The competition was divided into two levels. In one of them, all the disciples in the sect fight for the top spot, and in the other, all of the new disciples fight to be the king of the newcomers.Wang Lin casually retorted, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. Why are you worrying about the life and death of trash like me?\u201dWang Zhuo coldly laughed. \u201cI worry because we are relatives. Since you won\u2019t accept my good intentions, don\u2019t blame me for not going easy on you in the competition.\u201d His eyes flashed cold after he finished talking.Wang Zhuo had looked down upon Wang Lin\u2019s family ever since he was little. Although he had never met Wang Lin, he had always heard from his dad that Wang Lin\u2019s father always sucked up to grandfather in order to steal a large portion of the family inheritance, and even disgraced his father. It was only because all the other family members weren\u2019t blind that they were able take his father\u2019s inheritance back. In Wang Zhuo\u2019s eyes, Wang Lin\u2019s family was a disgrace to the Wang Family. Like father, like son.Although, after growing up, he had realized that things weren\u2019t exactly as his father had described, but he had been very arrogant since he was little. He sometimes even looked down on his own dad, not to mention everyone else.The girl named Xu pondered a bit, then asked Wang Zhuo, \u201cYou are relatives?\u201dThe other two were also surprised. This was the first time that they heard about this. It seems these two were relatives.The girl named Xu saw that Wang Zhuo\u2019s face was unfriendly, so she quickly said, \u201cBrother Wang Zhuo, don\u2019t be angry. He simply doesn\u2019t understand your good intentions. You are a good person, and smarter than him. Don\u2019t expect him to understand your good intentions. Once he\u2019s suffered a bit, he\u2019ll know how good you were to him. My family has relatives like him too. In fact, every family is like this. Not everyone can be as excellent as you. In fact, I understand how you feel. You really wish for him to be better.\u201dWang Zhuo blushed from what the girl named Xu said. He stared at her, not sure if she was complimenting or ridiculing him.After Wang Lin heard what the girl said, he burst out laughing. \u201cWang Zhuo, looks like I misunderstood you. You are good to me. I, Wang Lin, will remember this. Thank you.\u201dAs he was talking, the pill house\u2019s door opened. A youth with a bright face walked out. It was Wang Hao.After he walked out, he coughed to get everyone\u2019s attention, and said, with a smiling face, \u201cToday\u2019s Qi Gathering Pills are still in the furnace. Once they are done, I\u2019ll call you guys in one by one.\u201dWang Zhuo stared at Wang Hao, gritting his teeth, but he really couldn\u2019t offend him right now. Wang Hao was still the third Senior Apprentice-brother\u2019s helper, in charge daily matters in the pill house. If Wang Hao complained to this master, then his own monthly supply would be reduced a lot.After Wang Hao finished speaking, he scanned the area and was surprised to see Wang Lin. He pulled Wang Lin to the side and said, \u201cElder Brother Tie Zhu, congratulations on becoming an inner disciple. I heard all about your matter. I originally wanted to come and talk with you, but this place is too strict. I don\u2019t like what the others say about you. Once you cultivate some techniques, you can get revenge on all those who looked down upon you.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s heart felt warm and he smiled. \u201cWang Hao, thank you.\u201dWang Hao sighed. \u201cBack then, I wanted to stay a few days with you, but my dad gave me a look to stop me. It looked like he didn\u2019t want me to get mixed in. Elder Brother Tie Zhu, please forgive me.\u201dWang Lin shook his head. He said, \u201cThere is no point in talking about the past. Right now, I just want to quickly cultivate to the first layer of Qi Condensation.Wang Hao\u2019s eyes spun. While no one was watching, he stuffed something into Wang Lin\u2019s hand and winked at him. Then, a cold voice came from the room.\u201cPill helper, still not coming back?\u201dWang Hao replied and quickly rushed back into the pill house.Wang Lin tightly held on to the thing in his hand. He looked at what was in his hand and saw three transparent pills. He secretly placed them in his bag of holding. Not afraid of getting dirty, he sat down cross legged and started to cultivate.One of the four others that were there saw Wang Lin sit down, then also sat down and started to cultivate, while the other three stood to the side.Wang Zhuo was trying to get on the girl named Zhou\u2019s good side, but the girl name Xu was disrupting him the entire time.Time slowly passed, and the sky became dark. As the moon rose, the door to the pill house opened. Wang Hao looked worn out as he walked out with a tray in his hand.5 low quality spirit stones and 5 transparent pills were on the tray.People went out one by one after getting their portion. Wang Lin went last. He smiled and cusped his hands at Wang Hao, then left.He remembered Wang Hao\u2019s kindness in his heart. The three pills Wang Hao gave him were Qi Gathering Pills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 \u2013 Scattering TechniqueAfter returning to his room, he immediately closed the door. He didn\u2019t use the Qi Gathering Pills, but put kept them in his bag of holding. He was about to start an experiment with the stone bead.He cautiously took out the three gourds and the stone bead, then pondered a little and revealed an uncertain expression. He was weighing the pros and cons, because without the dew, his future cultivation speed will be very slow.But the mysterious clouds on the stone bead made Wang Lin very curious. After thinking for a while, he made his decision. He could always collect more dew, it would just take some time. However, if the tenth cloud appeared, it could cause a change to the bead. Maybe then, the water the bead soaks in will contain even more spiritual energy.After he thought about this, he immediately took out the gourd that contained the best morning dew. It took him a long time to get the jelly out of the gourd.After a while, all the dew had been poured out. There was half a stone bowl of greenish liquid containing a very refreshing smell. After smelling it, Wang Lin\u2019s body relaxed.He was afraid that the smell would attract the attention of the hidden experts in the sect, so he quickly threw the stone bead into it. After a while, it absorbed a bit of the liquid.Wang Lin was a bit disappointed. He was hoping that there would be a sudden change. However, the stone bead was absorbing the smell from the liquid. Wang Lin pondered a bit, then put the stone bowl next to his bed. He sat down on his bed and started to cultivate.The one long and three short breathing technique was now easy for Wang Lin. Although in the past two months he hadn\u2019t condensed any spiritual energy, he had become used to the breathing technique. He would breath like this even when he wasn\u2019t cultivating.The night passed and Wang Lin opened his eyes to check on the stone bowl. He saw that half of the liquid had been absorbed by the stone bead.He was not discouraged, and put the bowl back under his bed. After hesitating for a while, he took out a Qi Gathering Pill and put it in his mouth. He felt heat immediately come from within his body.In the month with Sun Dazhu, he had experienced this process every day. He quickly started cultivating. He cultivated until night came. Wang Lin slowly let out a white breath and smiled wryly. \u201cThis Qi Gathering Pill is just like Sun Dazhu\u2019s drugs, also made from some herbs containing lot of spiritual energy. Every time I eat them, my body feels relaxed and full of energy. I also don\u2019t feel hunger, but I still can\u2019t condense any spiritual energy.\u201dHe sighed. Wang Zhuo could achieve the first layer of Qi Condensation in three months. His expression remained the same, but had mixed feelings in his heart. Talent; it\u2019s the most important part of cultivating.But with Wang Lin\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. He had the mysterious bead. He wasn\u2019t lacking any spiritual energy. Although he couldn\u2019t condense any spiritual energy now, he would definitely succeed with time.\u201cTime\u2026.\u201d Wang Lin bit his lip and sighed. He took out the stone bowl from under his bed. There was only a little bit of liquid left, but the tenth cloud still hadn\u2019t appeared.He immediately took out other gourd and poured the liquid into the bowl. There was some extra liquid left over, so Wang Lin drank it and continued to cultivate.The heat that appeared in his body this time was stronger than all the previous times. He could feel the heat moving in his body. He quickly felt very thirsty, but continued to cultivate.After a short while, Wang Lin felt that something was wrong. The heat didn\u2019t dissipate like before, but started to gather more and more as he breathed. He felt like his body was a balloon that had reached its limit.Wan Lin was afraid, so he stopped cultivating, but the pain of swelling stayed. He opened his eyes and immediately found out in horror that all this blood vessels were swollen, like there were worms under his skin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t know that the drugs he ate before didn\u2019t generate much spiritual energy, and even with the spiritual energy he gathered from nature using the breathing technique, he couldn\u2019t make up for how much spiritual energy was lost due to his talent.Plus, at the most important moment, the Qi Scattering Grass would prevent him from successfully condensing the spiritual energy.But now he drank the dew that contained much more spiritual energy than the drugs, much more than what he lost due to his talent. If he didn\u2019t cultivate, they would just dissipate after a while, but now, his spiritual energy would rise as if it were fire being fed by oil when he cultivated.He knew he messed up, but he didn\u2019t know what to do. He could only watch as his blood vessels expanded. When his blood vessels were at their limit, an idea entered his head. Without much time to think, he gritted his teeth and started to cultivate with the one short and three long breathing technique.He thought that since one long three short was gathering spiritual energy, then the reverse must be scattering spiritual energy.Wang Lin\u2019s guess was more or less correct. Most cultivators knew this breathing technique because this was the step before Foundation Establishment.With his breathing, streams of spiritual energy exited from every part of his body. It was all sucked in by the stone bead under his bed.As time passed, the swollen feeling gradually lessened. His blood vessels also returned to normal. What was releasing from his body now was no longer spiritual energy, but some dark Qi that the stone bead didn\u2019t absorb that dissipated in the air.This lucky coincidence allowed Wang Lin to remove the Qi Scattering Grass from his body.If one wanted to force out the Qi Scattering Grass, one method was to use a lot of spiritual energy to force out it all out. This was the method Sun Dazhu was using, but he had a change of heart about Wang Lin and didn\u2019t want to lose any more of his herbs, so he gave up.The second method was to use the scattering technique, which was to remove all the spiritual energy from one\u2019s body, then start cultivating from the start. The reason Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t use this method was because Wang Lin already had almost no spiritual energy, therefore, he couldn\u2019t even use the technique.The scattering technique lasted a whole day and night. Wang Lin was so tired, he collapsed on his bed. He knew that he was able to save himself this time, but in the future, he mustn\u2019t carelessly drink the dew.He was extremely tired, so he fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 Tenth CloudAfter an unknown amount of time, Wang Lin opened his eyes and saw that it was dark outside. He got off his bed and stretched for a while. His body didn\u2019t feel very different. He took out the stone bowl from under his bed and was surprised to see that the tenth cloud had finally appeared on the bead.Wang Lin was thrilled. He looked at the bead and quickly ran out of the house. He went and gathered spring water before quickly returning. He placed the stone bead in the water and mixed it around.After he did all this, he drank the spring water and tasted it for a while, but there wasn\u2019t any change like there was before. He looked at the bead with some disappointment on his face, then tried to bite it, but it was still hard as a rock.He even squeezed a drop of blood onto the bead, but there was still no change.He hesitated and gritted his teeth for a while, then took the stone bowl and slammed it on the stone bead. He believed that once it had ten clouds, there would be some sort of change.After a bang, the stone bowl broke. Even Wang Lin\u2019s hand was numb, but there was no sign of damage to the stone bead at all.He used everything he could think of, but the stone bead didn\u2019t seem to have any change after obtaining the tenth cloud. Feeling heartbroken, he threw the stone bead to the side.After a while, he unwillingly walked over to pick it up. After staring at it for a while, he started to feel sleepy. He was stunned. He had just woke up, why would he feel sleepy? He rubbed his eyes and continued to stare at the bead.Slowly, he became even more drowsy. The bead became more and more blurry before he finally fell to the ground, asleep with the bead still in his hand.He had a dream. In his dream, he arrived at a space without boundary. There were no stars, but there were glowing objects all around him. Although he was dreaming, his mind was very clear. He wondered why he would be dreaming of this.Wang Lin didn\u2019t feel like there was anything wrong with his body here. However, he didn\u2019t know how to wake up to escape this place. In his helplessness, he walked around aimlessly in this boundaryless area for a long time.After an unknown amount of time, when he was really tired, the surroundings started to shake. It felt like his body was being torn apart. With a scream, he opened his eyes.He looked around and noticed that he was still in the room. Wang Lin took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He was happy that the strange dream finally ended. Suddenly, his expression became really odd. He looked at the bead and noticed that all the clouds had disappeared. Instead, there were little words inscribed on the bead.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Lin was stunned and quickly took a closer look. The words looked really strange, an uncommon font. He had always loved reading, and thought for a long time, trying to patch the words with words he had read. He was able to guess a few words.Wang Lin held the bead and muttered to himself, \u201cThis seems to be a number in written form. It doesn\u2019t hold any meaning.\u201d Suddenly, a thought flashed through his head and he remembered the strange dream.\u201cWas that related to the bead?\u201d Wang Lin pondered a little and immediately lied down on his bed, trying to force himself to fall asleep. But he was still full of energy, so he couldn\u2019t do it.He remembered that the last time he fell asleep was from staring the bead. So he started to stare at the bead without blinking once. Soon, he became drowsy and fell asleep.The boundary-less space appeared again. Wang Lin revealed a thoughtful look. This time, he didn\u2019t wander around, but started to jump up and down repetitively.As time passed, he managed to jump higher and higher. At the start, he was only able to jump about half a meter, but now he was able to jump over 1 meter. After his entire body was worn out, the feeling of being torn apart appeared again.Then he woke up.The moment he woke up, he got off the bed and jumped. He jumped up really high, exactly like how he had jumped in his dream.Wang Lin was astonished. Soon, an excited expression appeared on his face. He took a few deep breaths to contain his excitement and began to pace around the room. His expression constantly changed. Sometimes a puzzled expression, sometimes a deep in thought expression, and sometimes a troubled expression. Sweat dripped from his forehead.Wang Lin muttered, \u201cIf it\u2019s just exercising in my dream, then it is useless, I can exercise in reality. It doesn\u2019t need to be in my dream.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not right. This bead absorbed so much liquid filled with spiritual energy before the tenth cloud appeared, it can\u2019t be useless. There must be some other use, there must be. But what could it be?\u201d Wang Lin forgot about everything around him and wholeheartedly devoted himself to the bead.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d He stopped. It seemed like he had grasped an idea. He asked himself, \u201cCould it be time?\u201dAfter thinking about it, he couldn\u2019t control his emotions anymore. He wanted to excitedly scream a few words. He clenched his fists. His body trembled as he looked at the bead.\u201cIf if it really related to time then I \u2026 I, Tie Zhu, will become an immortal no matter how bad my talent is!\u201d Wang Lin took a few deep breaths before he returned to normal. Without saying a word, he took out the oil lamp and filled it with oil. He sat on his bed holding the stone bead and started to calculate time.After 5 hours, the lamp went out.Wang Lin quickly refilled the lamp with oil. He stared at the bead and went back into the dream.This time, he didn\u2019t practice jumping, but he sat cross legged on the ground, counting time.One hour, five hours, ten hours, twenty hours, thirty-five hours, fifty hours!The feeling of his body being torn apart appeared again. When Wang Lin opened his eyes, the oil lamp was about to go out.\u201cTen times the time. Ten times the time passed in the dream.\u201d Wang Lin excitedly stood up, holding the bead tightly.For the first time, he was confident in his cultivation.It was already really late. Wang Lin contained his excited heart and didn\u2019t immediately start to use the bead to start cultivating. He was afraid that if he started using the bead in the morning, he would be found out by someone. When that happened, he would not be able to keep it, so he put the bead back into his bag of holding and left the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 CultivationAfter gathering a lot of spring water from the mountain, Wang Lin began to make spiritual energy-filled spring water. When it was ten at night, he locked his door. As a precaution, he tied one end of a rope to the door and the other end to his arm so he would know right away if someone opened it.After drinking few large gulps of spring water, he felt his body heat up. He then stared at the bead to enter the dream.In the endless dream space, Wang Lin sat crossed legged as he started to cultivate. When he was cultivating, the lights all around him became more gentle. Wang Lin wasn\u2019t aware of this, but the lights entered his body.After staying there for a day, all the spiritual energy from the water was gone. But this time, he could clearly feel the difference in his body. Before, when he would finish Sun Dazhu\u2019s medication, he felt heat. However, in the most critical moment, all the spiritual energy would scatter.But this time was different. Even though they still scattered, there was still a sliver left in his body. Although it was not a lot, Wang Lin gained a lot of confidence from those results. After considering it for a while, he couldn\u2019t figure out why it was different. So in the end, he could only speculate that it was because of the mysterious stone bead.Because he couldn\u2019t leave the dream of his own will to get more spring water, he could only continue to cultivate for a long time. In the end, he realized that there was a difference between the dream space and outside. Outside, even though he had been cultivating for more than a month, he would feel refreshed and very comfortable after cultivation.But here, after the spiritual energy from the spring water had all dissipated, he didn\u2019t have the refreshed and comfortable feeling, Instead, when he kept cultivating, he felt short of breath.After hesitating for a while, Wang Lin guessed that it was related to the existence of spiritual energy. There was no natural spiritual energy in the dream space.The more he thought, the more he felt he was correct. He frowned, thinking, \u201cIf there was only a way to bring in the spring water from outside, it would be all good.\u201d Thinking about it, his heart suddenly skipped a beat as he looked at his own body and revealed a puzzled expression.Wang Lin was very puzzled by the red disciple uniform he had on. He quickly checked the pocket where his bag of holding was and found that it missing.\u201cClothes can appear in the dream space, but the bag of holding couldn\u2019t appear.\u201d He bitterly thought about it and decided to experiment on what items could or couldn\u2019t be brought into the dream space once he leaves.Time passed by quickly. After 50 hours had passed, the feeling of being torn apart appeared and woke Wang Lin up.He still had a question in his heart. Why could he only stay in the dream for 5 hours? With that question in mind, he filled a gourd with spring water and carried it on his shoulder, ready to enter the dream again.But this time, no matter how he stared at the bead, he didn\u2019t feel the usual drowsiness. Wang Lin was frightened. After thinking for a long time, he contained the fear in his heart and sat down to cultivate.Gradually, as his breathing steadied, the natural spiritual energy was absorbed by his body. As it dissipated, some remained in this body. However, this was still far from the first layer of Qi Condensation.He spent the whole day cultivating. He kept drinking the spring water to keep his body filled with spiritual energy.In addition, he always held the stone bead, hoping to enter the dream space again, but failed to do so every time.Night came. He opened both his eyes and could feel that the spiritual energy in his body had increased by a little. If it was normal, he would be very excited, but he was restless. He looked at the bead again and suddenly felt drowsy. Wang Lin revealed a happy expression as he looked away to expel the drowsiness.He stood up and rubbed his chin while pacing around the room, pondering over what had happened before and after he entered the dream. He finally found the problem.The first two times, he entered with almost no time in between. The third time was 5 hours after the second, and the fourth time was a whole day after the third.Following this logic, there were some restrictions on entering this dream space. To be safe, one should wait 5 hours after a use to guarantee entrance.After resolving that issue, Wang Lin began to prepare to test what he could bring into the dream space. He ended up gathering a lot of things, including three gourds. One was a gourd with some remaining dew, one was empty, and one was filled with spring water.He even put a piece of the broken stone bowl into his pocket. In addition, he took out a sweet potato and a cloth from his bag of holding and bound them to his body before entering the dream again.In the dream space, Wang Lin quickly checked his body. The sweet potato, broken stone bowl, and cloth were all there, but the three gourds and his bag of holding weren\u2019t.He concluded that, without a doubt, there was no spiritual energy within this dream realm, so any normal item, in other words, any item without any spiritual energy, could be brought in.The three gourds and the bag of holding all contained some spiritual energy, therefore, they couldn\u2019t be brought in.Letting out a sigh, Wang Lin began to think bitterly. He couldn\u2019t bring the gourd in there, and the few gulps he took from the gourd before going into the dream space weren\u2019t enough to last him the full duration of his stay.After thinking about this, an idea flashed through his mind. He felt like he had an idea, but couldn\u2019t grasp it. The feeling of an idea just outside of his reach made him go deep into his thoughts, organizing his ideas one by one.After a long time, his expression turned happy as he grasped one key point; the spiritual energy filled water couldn\u2019t be brought in, but the spiritual energy that entered his body didn\u2019t disappear.It was that you couldn\u2019t bring objects with spiritual energy in there, but if he thought carefully, he might find a way.After 50 hours had passed, he quickly left his room and searched the mountain until he found a few wild gourds and took them home.He believed that the three gourds from earlier couldn\u2019t be brought into the dream space because they had been soaked in the spiritual energy water for so long, that the spiritual energy had fused with the gourdsNow, he was filling the freshly picked gourds with spiritual energy water. He might be able to trick the bead to bring them into the dream space.After five hours, Wang Lin entered the dream space with four gourds on his shoulder. After entering the dream, Wang Lin was surprised to find that all the gourds were still with him.He opened them and saw that the water was still inside. He took a drink and found them to still be filled with spiritual energy. Without a word, Wang Lin drank a few mouthfuls and started to cultivate.Every time the spiritual energy in his body dissipated, he drank more spring water. Soon, slivers of spiritual energy started to gather in his body, moving his body toward the first layer of Qi Condensation.The lights in the surrounding area started to silently enter his body again.With Wang Lin\u2019s talent, without the mysterious bead and the spiritual energy water, it would\u2019ve been many years before he could achieve the first layer of Qi Condensation. Adding the Qi Scattering Grass to the equation, it would take thirty to fifty years before he would succeed.Taking Sun Dazhu\u2019s medication every day for a month sped up the process. Wang Lin also unknowingly used the Qi Scatter Technique, which got rid of the Qi Scattering Grass. But even then, it would still have taken him ten years. But now, Wang Lin wasn\u2019t lacking any spiritual energy. He had this stone bead that allowed him to train 10x more. The first layer of Qi Condensation was now in sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 \u2013 Qi CondensationTime had flown by while he was in the Heng Yue Sect. Wang Lin had been cultivating in the dream space for the past two months. He had thoroughly studied the capabilities of the stone bead.The dream space could be entered three times a day. Each time was about fifty hours, adding up to about six days.Two months had passed in the real world, but he had cultivated for a whole year.Wang Lin couldn\u2019t feel it before, but cultivating was a very boring and dry process. With the help of the spiritual energy spring water, he didn\u2019t need to eat all. All he did every day was cultivate.He repeated the one long three short breathing technique as the spiritual energy entered his body. If it wasn\u2019t for his parents\u2019 looks of hope that kept popping up in his mind, he believed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand this tedious cultivation.Especially when he thought about how Wang Zhuo was able to reach the first layer of Qi Condensation in three months. Wang Lin would always feel dissatisfaction in his heart. He almost never left his house. He was completely devoted to his cultivation.Wang Lin was the joke of the Heng Yue Sect. Although there were many people who made fun of him, only a few paid any attention to him.Sun Dazhu had almost forgotten about Wang Lin. Every time he thought of Wang Lin, he would become furious and do his best to filter those thoughts out of his mind.Thanks to all these factors and with Wang Lin hiding his precious stone bead in his clothes before he fell asleep, these last two months had passed by peacefully, without anyone finding out about his stone bead.In those two months, the amount of times Wang Ling had consumed the spring water couldn\u2019t be counted anymore. Basically, any time he felt he was lacking spiritual energy in his body, he would drink a few big gulps.If Sun Dazhu knew of this, his heart would be filled with pain. He would likely kill this disciple with one slap. In the entire cultivation community in the country of Zhao, who else could cultivate like Wang Lin, drinking spiritual energy filled spring water every day? Only a few old monsters of sects in the mainland could possibly have similar privileges. They would have to take over a mountain with an abundance of spiritual energy to achieve results similar to what the spiritual energy water brought Wang Lin.spiritual energy held an important place in all cultivators\u2019 hearts. Although in the country of Zhao there wasn\u2019t an overabundance of spiritual energy, it was enough for the few sects that existed. If other cultivators knew of how Wang Lin was using spiritual energy, their hearts would ache to death.If Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy spring water would be used to make immortal pills, it would increase the success rate. Although making immortal pills was all about the ingredients, a bit of extra spiritual energy could work wonders.With the help of the endless reservoir of spiritual energy contained within the bead, the quantity of spiritual energy in Wang Lin\u2019s body had increased more and more.Today, when Wang Lin was cultivating in the dream space, he could clearly feel the spiritual energy move within his body. With his breath, two long white dragons came from his nose.A feeling of ants crawling in his body arose. It felt as if water was washing every part of his body. Black liquid that smelled very bad excreted from his pores.Soon, the black liquid soaked his clothes. Wang Lin didn\u2019t care about it at all. He was currently in a wonderful state, as if he could see the spring water rushing inside him while the spiritual energy slowly changed his body.After an unknown amount of time, Wang Lin opened his eyes. There was a light in his eyes that was never there before.His mind was clear and his heart was as calm as water without a single ripple. His childhood flooded through his mind. His father\u2019s loving look when he was learning to talk, his mother\u2019s supporting words when he was studying all night, his parents\u2019 looks of expectation when he entered the Heng Yue Sect, his relatives\u2019 ridiculing faces, and the villagers\u2019 admiring looks. He saw all of these things calmly, as if he was a stranger.Much later, he took a deep breath. His heart felt bitter. When he had stepped into the first layer of Qi Condensation, he gained a hint of understanding.According to the Three Stages of Qi Condensation, the first layer of Qi Condensation was like a gate. Once one opened the gate, they could enter the ranks of cultivators and would cut themselves off from the world, giving up worldly affairs.Everyone would experience this when they entered the first layer of Qi Condensation. He didn\u2019t know how others handled it, but he could cut off all worldly affairs except for his parents\u2019 love.With a sigh, Wang Lin dusted his shirt and stood up.With bright eyes, he looked around and could already feel that there was a difference in the dream space. Like before, he couldn\u2019t tell if there was anything weird with the glowing lights around him. but now he could feel spiritual energy moving within them. Even though he couldn\u2019t see the exact movement, compared to before, he was like a blind man who had become able to see.While watching, the feeling of being torn apart appeared again. Although there was still pain, it was a lot less and wouldn\u2019t result in cold sweat anymore.Wang Lin opened his eyes. He sat on his bed, thinking for a while, and immediately opened the gourd. When he looked inside, he could now see the spiritual energy that filled the spring water.He let out a smile. After reaching the first layer of Qi Condensation, he could feel the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. He took a deep breath. Wang Lin suddenly found that his body was sticky and let out a laugh. It was mentioned in the Three Stages of Qi Condensation that after reaching the first layer of Qi Condensation, the filth in the body would be expelled. It was a necessary stage for the body\u2019s transformation.Wang Lin opened his door. It was now afternoon outside. His steps were quick as he left through the east gate and arrived at a downstream location. He took off his clothes and jumped into the river to wash his body. The dark filth was very greasy and took a long time to scrub off.After he finished washing, he lied down on a rock. He remembered a technique in the Three Stages of Qi Condensation.It introduced an immortal technique called Attractive Force Technique. This was considered one of the most basic immortal techniques and could be used as long as one had reached the first layer of Qi Condensation.The Heng Yue Sect unified the country of Zhao 500 years ago. Although it had declined, it still contained many immortal techniques. Every disciple would be sent to the Scripture Library to choose one of many techniques, but most elders recommended sword cultivation technique.Sword cultivation technique was to focus the entire cultivation on the sword. Although cultivation would be difficult in the future, it was very powerful early on, and easy to control. The Attractive Force Technique was the basis for controlling flying swords.Besides the Attractive Force Technique, there were two more techniques recorded in the Three Stage of Qi Condensation. They were Fireball and Earth Splitting Technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 \u2013 Malicious ThoughtsWhile thinking about the three techniques, Wang Lin became excited. In an attempt to produce the Fireball technique, he formed the seal with his hand. However, forget about fire, not even a spark appeared. After a long time, he frowned and tried again.Time and time again, he was ultimately met with failure. He only managed to produce a spark one time.Wang Lin laughed bitterly. \u201cTalent\u2026it\u2019s always talent!\u201d He then practiced the Earth Splitting technique on a nearby rock. Although the results were better than what he achieved while attempting the Fireball technique, the crack was only the size of his pinky finger. This kind of technique was good for tricking mortals, but in a real battle, they were useless.Finally, he practiced the Attraction Force Technique. He was still not satisfied with the result.But considering that the success rate of the Attraction Force Technique was the highest, Wang Lin put all his effort into practicing Attraction Force. To put it simply, Attraction Force was really just controlling objects from a distance.If one could control Attraction Force well, and has reached the second layer of Qi Condensation, they could practice the Repelling Technique. After one broke through the third layer and went into the fourth layer, they could go to the Sword Spirit House to select a flying sword.After practicing for a long time, Wang Lin started to head home before it got dark. Now that he had reached the first layer of Qi Condensation, his eyesight and hearing had improved greatly. After entering through the east gate, he heard some familiar voices as he passed by the chore house.\u201cBrother Liu, when you first arranged for me to gather firewood, you said 100 pounds was enough to finish the task. Why is it 1000 pounds now? I, Zhang Hu, am not new, and over these past few years I have done much to please you. Do you really want to force me out of the sect?\u201d\u201cZhang Hu, don\u2019t say that I\u2019m making this hard on you. It is almost the end of the year, and even your brother here hasn\u2019t had a good time. But you, instead of working, have come here to give me a sob story. When I brought the firewood that you gathered to the pill house, I was scolded. I took them back and checked them. You little bastard, you really are smart. In the 100 pounds of wood, there was at least 30 pounds of water.\u201dZhang Hu was furious. He loudly said, \u201cNot possible. You\u2019re falsely accusing me. Wasn\u2019t it because a few days ago, I saw Zhao FuGui give you an immortal talisman so you could pick an easier task for him? What\u2019s the big deal? Among the honorary disciples, who doesn\u2019t know how you act? As for trying to force me off the Heng Yue Sect, you really f*cked up, you bastard. I\u2019m not doing this anymore. I\u2019m going to tell the elders.\u201d\u201cZhang Hu, you forced me to do this. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself for being unlucky to have seen something you shouldn\u2019t have. Zhang Hu, stay here. If the elders know of this, your entire family could die with you.\u201dDisciple Liu\u2019s cold voice came out of the room and Zhang Hu let out a scream. After hearing it, Wang Lin was surprised and kicked open the door.Wang Lin first saw the youth named Liu\u2019s hideous face. He was in the middle of thrusting a dagger toward Zhang Hu, who had a frightened expression and whose body was against the wall.Wang Lin saw that he didn\u2019t have enough time to help Zhang Hu. He quickly started to use the Attraction Force Technique. Luckily, it was successful this time. An invisible hand held down the attacker. However, the dagger had already cut Zhang Hu\u2019s chest. Blood poured out from the wound.The youth named Liu was extremely frightened. His whole body felt powerless as an invisible force held his body, preventing the dagger from being pushed down anymore.Zhang Hu\u2019s face was pale. Sweat filled his forehead. He looked at Wang Lin and quickly crawled to the side.The youth named Liu was shocked, and immediately started to struggle. Wang Lin\u2019s forehead started to sweat hard, as if he was starting to lose control.This was the first time Wang Lin used the technique on a person. Obviously, he couldn\u2019t control it well. Adding on to that, the person was struggling, so he had difficulty maintaining control. Wang Lin\u2019s body trembled. Seeing that Zhang Hu wasn\u2019t in danger anymore, he relaxed a bit and the Attraction Force Technique also loosened up.Seeing that Liu was about to struggle free, Zhang Hu revealed a strange expression. He looked at Wang Lin, then at brother Liu. His expression turned ruthless. He picked up a wood-cutting axe and walked toward brother Liu.Brother Liu\u2019s face filled with fear and he struggled harder. Zhang Hu gritted his teeth and muttered to himself, \u201cNot a man without poison. Brother Liu, you forced me to do this. You wanted to kill my whole family?\u201d\u201cZhang Hu what are you going to do?\u201d Wang Lin was surprised, and the Attraction Force Technique lost its effect.The moment the youth named Liu regained control of his body, Zhang Hu slammed down the axe toward brother Liu\u2019s head. Brother Liu was too late to dodge. A sound like that of a watermelon being broken momentarily filled the room. Brother Liu\u2019s body twitched on the ground before it stopped moving.The axe in Zhang Hu\u2019s hand fell to the ground. He looked at the bloody corpse with a complex expression.Wang Lin was stunned. That was the first time he had seen such a bloody scene. After a long time, he bitterly started to ask, \u201cZhang Hu, you\u2026\u201dZhang Hu looked up at Wang Lin. His face looked distorted, revealing a grim look. He said, word for word, \u201cWang Lin, you saw as well. I didn\u2019t want to kill him. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I would have been killed by him. He forced me to do all that, he forced me!\u201dWang Lin remained silent. He hadn\u2019t for expected his to happen.Zhang Hu took a deep breath. His face revealed a determined expression. He walked next to the corpse and searched it for a while. He took out a bag of holding containing hundreds of the talismans that honorary disciples used to visit their families. In addition to those, there was a thread-bound booklet. Zhang Hu glanced through the book and put it away in his clothes.Afterward he searched the room. He eventually found a secret compartment under the bed. Inside it was a piece of yellow paper.Pondering a little, he turned toward Wang Lin and said, \u201cWang Lin, today you saved me. I, Zhang Hu, will always remember this. As for the Heng Yue Sect, I won\u2019t be able to stay any longer. When the sect finds disciple Liu\u2019s body, they will investigate and find me in the end. I\u2019m going to take these things. As for this disaster-causing immortal talisman, it must be a treasure, or else this youth named Liu wouldn\u2019t have tried to kill me.\u201d With that, he handed the yellow paper to Wang Lin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t take it. He let out a sigh and bitterly smiled. \u201cYou\u2026why must you do this. If you hadn\u2019t killed him\u2026\u201dZhang Hu frowned. He said, \u201cWang Lin, don\u2019t talk about this anymore. I have suffered enough in these past few years. If you still consider me a friend, take this immortal talisman.\u201dWang Lin bitterly took the talisman. He didn\u2019t say any more.\u201cWang Lin, I\u2019m going to leave. This has nothing to do with you. If the sect investigates, they will only find me. By then, I will have already left the Heng Yue Sect. Hmph, the country of Zhao is very large. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be an honorary disciple my whole life.\u201d Zhang Hu\u2019s expression was complex. After a long time, he slowly turned and left the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 \u2013 VisitWang Lin stared at the spot Zhang Hu had just been standing in. After a long time, he let out a sigh while holding the yellow paper in his hand. After coming to the Heng Yue Sect, Zhang Hu was his first friend, but now this happened.\u201cThis immortal talisman is the cause of this disaster!\u201d Wang Lin stared at the talisman. His eyes suddenly changed as he noticed what was different about it. Although this yellow talisman looked just like the talismans disciples get when they go to visit their families, the amount of spiritual energy in it was much higher than the other ones. In addition, there was a sense of danger coming from the talisman. Wang Lin was surprised. Although he didn\u2019t know what it was, he knew that it was a treasure.Hesitating slightly, Wang Lin put away the yellow paper. Looking at the corpse on the ground, he let out a sigh. If this corpse wasn\u2019t taken care of, with Zhang Hu\u2019s speed, he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the Sect.Luckily, there was enough room in the bag of holding to hold the corpse. Wang Lin then organized the room and wiped away the blood. He quietly went into the mountain and disposed of the body, then carefully made his way back to his room.After lamenting about what happened, he decided to not think about Zhang Hu anymore. He took out the immortal talisman and began to study it.On the first look, the talisman looked exactly like the ones disciples used when visiting home, but upon closer inspection, one could tell from the material and the ink that it was vastly superior than the talismans disciples used to go home.Wang Lin squeezed the immortal talisman. He pondered a little. He wasn\u2019t sure of the exact usage of this talisman. Since the day that he had almost died from drinking the dew, he had been very careful about things belonging to immortals. He didn\u2019t dare to carelessly use them.Plus, the characters on the talisman revealed a hint of danger, causing him to be even more cautious. After hesitating for a bit, he put away the talisman. He decided to study it later.After doing all of this, he took out the mysterious bead and entered the dream space.This time, he didn\u2019t focus all his time on cultivation, but spent some learning the Attraction Force Technique.He felt that the Attraction Force Technique was very useful after using it on brother Liu. That was why he was so determined to practice it.He first used the gourd as a target. He tried using the Attraction Force to grab the gourd. After numerous tries, he finally succeeded. He immediately stopped using the Attraction Force and started from the beginning.Wang Lin\u2019s thought process was very simple. He felt that he must be able to freely use the Attraction Force. If he tried to use it 10 times, it must succeed 10 times, or else, no matter how strong it was, it couldn\u2019t be used in key moments.He calculated a bit. Given his current condition, he could succeed 3 out of 10 times. With only 4 successes so far, it was far from measuring up to his own standards.The time spent in the dream flew by. Without Wang Lin realizing, the feeling of being torn apart came. After coming back to reality, he wasted no time at all. As he opened his eyes, he drank more spring water and started to cultivate. When there was sufficient spiritual energy in his body, he took a deep breath as the contents of the Three Stages of Qi Condensation appeared in his head.Aside from the laws for each of the three stages of Qi Condensation, there were also two very important chants.These chants were the real core of Qi Condensation. There were 15 layers of Qi Condensation. Aside from the first layer, which one could obtain by themself, all the other 14 layers required a chant to enter the next layer.For example, if he had already completed the first layer, and even mastered the second layer\u2019s cultivation method, he could only stay in the first layer if he didn\u2019t succeed the second layer\u2019s chant.Wang Lin muttered the chant in his mind. The spiritual energy in his body started to change. At first, the change was small, but soon, it felt like boiling water was flowing through his body.It seemed that there wasn\u2019t enough spiritual energy as it intermittently spread throughout his body, causing soreness, numbness, itchiness, pain, and the like all over his body. He also had an illusion that his body was full of holes. All of this was caused by the spiritual energy.There was a very prominent line in Three Stages of Qi Condensation; the opening chant for each layer won\u2019t always succeed.Talent, spiritual energy, and chance all played key roles. Some people would be able succeed in one try, while some people would need ten or hundreds of tries.After a long time, the feeling in his body slowly dissipated. Wang Lin was covered in sweat, and the spiritual energy in his body was all gone. But Wang Ling knew from the book that the lack of spiritual energy was only temporary and would recover after meditating for a while. He failed to open the second layer, but Wang Lin was not discouraged. This time, he was just testing it out. It just showed that he didn\u2019t have enough spiritual energy at that moment to enter the second layer.After all, he had just achieved the first layer. There was no rush. He still had the spring water with him, so he could just cultivate until he reached the limit of the first layer before attempting to reach the second layer again. That would increase his chances greatly.With this plan, Wang Lin started to cultivate night and day. The spiritual energy in his body started to slowly accumulate, and his mastery of the Attraction Force Technique also increased.He tried the chant for the second layer many times, but all of them ended in failure.In reality, half a month had passed, but three months had passed in the dream space. Today, Wang Lin was cultivating, waiting for the time to enter the dream space again. He saw that it was still early. He hesitated for a bit, then started the chant for the second layer to experience it again.He couldn\u2019t even remember how many times he had experienced it. Every time, it ended with him being worn out and all the spiritual energy in his body gone without success.Two hours later, Wang Lin raised his head. He was worn out again, and all he spiritual energy was gone from his body. He muttered to himself with a wry smile, \u201cFailed again. Entering the second layer is too hard!\u201d Suddenly, his eyes darted toward the door.A cold voice came through the door. \u201cApprentice-brother Wang, come out to see me.\u201dThe voice sounded familiar. Wang Lin got up and opened the door to see a 27 or 28 year old youth in black standing outside with a cold air about him.\u201cBlack clothes!\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s heart tightened. He recognized that he was the same person that brought him, Wang Zhuo, and Wang Hao to the Heng Yue Sect, and also the person who brought his father to find him near the cliff.But Wang Lin remembered that he was wearing white clothes back then. Now, after a few short months, he had risen up to black clothes! He suddenly remembered the day when they were testing at the foot of the mountain. The person who took Wang Hao as a helper said that the man in front of Wang Lin now had reached a critical point in their cultivation, and took over as the examiner to avoid distracting him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2013 ChoresAmong purple, black, white, and red, black represented a really high cultivation. Wang Lin couldn\u2019t see through his cultivation, so he respectfully said, \u201cWang Lin greets brother Zhang. Congratulations to senior on reaching black clothes.\u201dThe black clad youth looked at Wang Lin and slowly said, \u201cMe successfully breaking into the fifth layer of Qi Condensation does relate a bit to you. If I hadn\u2019t found that cave while looking for you, I wouldn\u2019t have broken through so quickly.\u201dWang Lin was stunned and asked, \u201cBrother Zhang, that hole with the suction force in the cave could help cultivation?\u201dThe black clad youth nodded and said, \u201cWhen you reach the peak of the fourth layer and need to use the chant to enter the fifth layer, go there yourself and you will see the effect.\u201c He glanced at Wang Lin and said, \u201cBrother Wang, it can\u2019t be helped since your talent is mediocre, but since you are a disciple now, you must cultivate diligently. I see that you have no spiritual energy in you at all. You haven\u2019t even reached the first layer of Qi Condensation. I\u2019m afraid that out of all the inner disciples, you are the only one.\u201dWang Lin was stunned but wryly smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll take Apprentice-brother\u2019s advice to heart. I will double my effort in cultivation.\u201d He suddenly changed the subject and asked, \u201cBrother Zhang, what is the reason you\u2019re here today?\u201dThe black clad youth chuckled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious. The honorary disciple in charge of the chore house disappeared. Someone saw you go there that day, so I came here to ask you about it.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal and laughed, \u201cI have an inkling of what happened. Normally, I don\u2019t go near the chore house, but half a month ago, I passed by it and an honorary disciple was talking behind my back, so I taught him a lesson. Maybe he got scared of me and left the sect.\u201dBrother Zhang nodded his head, half laughing. He looked at Wang Lin and said, \u201cA disgusting honorary disciple is not important. Today, I came to you because the elders have decided that an honorary disciple shouldn\u2019t be in charge of the chore house, so they wanted an inner disciple to take over. But no inner disciple wants to go, they are all busy cultivating.\u201dWang Lin wryly smiled, \u201cI understand. It seems the task has been assigned to me.\u201dBrother Zhang smiled slightly and said, \u201cPack your things and head there today. Right now, the chore house is really messy. You have to get it back in order.\u201dHe cusped his hands at Wang Lin, took a step, and a sword appeared under his feet. The sword emitted rainbow colors as he rode it away.Wang Lin revealed a frustrated expression. He didn\u2019t want to go to the chore house. The people there were too nosey; it would be too easy for his secret to be exposed. Also, there would be a lot of work that would disrupt his cultivation. But now, he couldn\u2019t not go. With a belly filled with anger, he packed his things and arrived at the chore house.After arriving there, he reached a decision in his heart. He couldn\u2019t stay in the chore house for too long. He had to mess up everything in the chore house so that every honorary disciple would go to the elders to ask for a replacement.With this idea in mind, Wang Lin cleaned up disciple Liu\u2019s room. Besides the bed and the table, everything that was useless was thrown outside.While he was doing this, a few disciples arrived at the chore house. They had learned that Wang Lin was now in charge of assigning chores, so many of them were nervous. The faces of the few that ridiculed Wang Lin the most were pale and their hearts pounded.Some had intentions of helping Wang Lin clean up, but after being glared at, they all obediently stood in the yard.After he finished cleaning, Wang Lin casually sat down on a chair. He coldly looked at the 100 plus honorary disciples before him. He knew that the Heng Yue Sect had a lot of honorary disciples. This was only a fraction of them. In the next few days, there would be more honorary disciples coming back to report on their work.\u201cYou will now chop 500 pounds of firewood!\u201d Wang Lin casually pointed at a person. He remembered that that person had secretly ridiculed him.That person was stunned. He immediately cried, \u201cBrother Wang I \u2026 I used to work in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know how to chop wood.\u201dWang Lin rolled his eyes. He snorted, \u201cNow it\u2019s 1000 pounds a day!\u201dThe boy suddenly kneeled to the ground and started crying. \u201cBrother Wang, you are a good person. I shouldn\u2019t have ridiculed you back then. But please, don\u2019t be so vindictive I \u2026 I \u2026 I can\u2019t possibly do 1000 pounds, how about 500 pounds?\u201dThe surrounding people all looked at each other. They all knew Wang Lin would make things difficult, but this was clearly revenge.There were a few honorary disciples in the crowd that shouted in discontent. \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t listen to him. Let\u2019s go find an elder and have them carry out justice. Wang Lin is too overbearing.\u201d\u201cCorrect. Let us go find the elders to get another inner disciple to be in charge of this place. If they don\u2019t listen to us, we will kneel and never get up.\u201d\u201cTrue. Let\u2019s go, everyone. Don\u2019t stay here. This Wang Lin has a villainous look. He doesn\u2019t even remember that he entered the Sect by trying to commit suicide. Such a disgrace.\u201dThe sound the dissatisfied voices grew louder and louder. Soon, everyone left the yard while shouting insults. They all had looks of grievance as they went toward the courtyard, all shouting things like, \u201cWang Lin doesn\u2019t want us to live anymore.\u201dWang Lin was relaxed in his heart. He didn\u2019t stop them and hoped that they would succeed. This way, the elders would get mad and make someone else take over so he can concentrate on cultivation.The remaining ten or so people were hesitating. They wanted to leave, but if this thing failed, wouldn\u2019t it mean that they had completely disrespected Wang Lin?Wang Lin wasn\u2019t in a rush. He waited for the result from the main courtyard. A moment later, all the honorary disciples gloomily came back, one by one. This time, they were no longer shouting, but had eyes filled with despair and silence.Wang Lin saw their expressions and knew that they had failed. He was very disappointed in his heart. It seemed he had to make an even bigger commotion. Thinking about it, he scanned the people here and said, \u201cAll of you who secretly mocked me, listen to me. I am here today to get revenge. If you\u2019re dissatisfied, go to the elders. If you can get me removed from this position, I will have to thank you.\u201dOne of the disciples begged, \u201cBrother Wang, you are a great person. Please forgive us.\u201d\u201cYes, Brother Wang, we were blind back then. Please give us a break. I \u2026 I\u2019ll kowtow to you.\u201d\u201cBrother Wang, they all mocked you back then, but I never did. I even defended you. I \u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2013 Locked DoorWithout waiting for that person to finish, someone on the side angrily said, \u201cZhao Xiao Er, back then, you mocked him the loudest. Brother Wang, don\u2019t listen to him.\u201dZhao Xiao Er\u2019s expression changed. He angrily said, \u201cZhao Xiao San, I am your older brother, you backstabbing bastard. Go back to your room and see how I\u2019m going to beat you up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m loyal, Brother Wang. You\u2019re a kind person, please give me some easier work.\u201d\u201cBrother Wang, don\u2019t listen to those two brothers. They are known for this two man act. Who knows how many honorary disciples they cheated? Apprentice-brother, I\u2019m the person who has never said a bad thing about you.\u201dA very pretty female honorary disciple delicately said, \u201cBrother Wang, this apprentice-sister has always had a weak body and can\u2019t do any hard labor. How about I come and give you a massage every night? Is that ok?\u201dAmong the honorary disciples of the Heng Yue Sect, there weren\u2019t many female disciples. Only about ten percent were female. After all, in the test of perseverance, males had a better chance.The few female honorary disciples were, of course, well received by everyone. Based on their looks, some even got favored by inner disciples.Then, another female honorary disciple threw a pretty look at Wang Lin and flirtatiously said, \u201cApprentice-brother, brother Liu never gave me any hard work, I only ever came to serve him at night. I know a few other apprentice-sisters. I\u2019ll take them to see you tonight, ok?\u201dEveryone was desperately trying to tell Wang Lin that they had never said anything bad about him. After listening for a very long time, Wang Lin ran out of patience and shouted, \u201cAll of you, shut up. What a mess this is.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he pointed at a person and said, \u201cYou, 20 vats of water. If you\u2019re unhappy, go to the elders.\u201dThat person\u2019s body quivered. He opened his mouth to talk, but saw the impatience in Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. He immediately smiled and nodded his head.\u201cYou, wash 500 kg of clothes every day. Remember, if you\u2019re dissatisfied, go find the elders.\u201d The person who was pointed at swallowed hard and almost passed out. He muttered, \u201c500 kg, that\u2019s like all the clothes in the sect added together\u2026\u201d\u201cYou, clean the whole sect! Same thing, if you\u2019re dissatisfied go find the elders!\u201d\u201cYou, clear the outhouses. If I see one fly in there, you can living in there.\u201d\u201cYou, go gather 500 pounds of herbs a day. If you mix weeds in there to trick me, I\u2019ll kick you out of the sect! All of you listen, if you\u2019re dissatisfied go find the elders!\u201d For some, while the workload was hard, it was still bearable. However, for the last few he pointed at, their legs grew soft and immediately collapsed on the ground.All the honorary disciples wore pitiful expressions. The entire Heng Yue Sect might not even have 500 kg of herbs in the mountains.\u2026\u2026Based on Wang Lin\u2019s memories of the people that had mocked him, he pointed at them one by one and carefully thought about what jobs to give them. He wasn\u2019t tired at all and finally finished assigning all the work. He lounged around for a while and thought that the chores that he assigned were impossible to finish. What could the honorary disciples do other than go complain to the elders? But just in case the elders decided not to do anything, it\u2019d be better to make this mess even bigger, to let them know that it was a big mistake to make me, Wang Lin, in charge of the chore house.Thinking about it, he pointed at a person he didn\u2019t know and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. Your job is to keep track of everything. Make a list of all the gifts given to me. Record their names and time of gift. If you try to be greedy, I\u2019ll kick you out of the sect!\u201dThat person was so surprised he immediately fell to the ground and kowtowed to Wang Lin. He repeatedly said that he would remember to do it correctly and not make a mistake.All the honorary disciples were dumbfounded. Before, disciple Liu was secretive about it, but this Wang Lin was boldly asking for bribes.A moment later, an honorary disciple stepped forward and took out three talismans used for visiting home. He presented them to Wang Lin and said, \u201cBrother Wang, this is me paying my respects to you.\u201dWang Lin replied with a sound. He put the talismans away and asked, \u201cWhat job were you assigned earlier?\u201d\u201cGather 20 vats of water a day!\u201d The person nervously replied.Wang Lin slowly said, \u201cThen, do 5 vats a day instead\u201dThat person was surprised and immediately expressed his thanks.Following that person\u2019s lead, everyone else got up and were about to step forward when Wang Lin slowly stood up and said, \u201cAll of you leave. You all need to follow the proper process of giving gifts. Write down your current job and your desired job on a piece of paper, then send it to the person I appointed to manage this. You can only do it only once in 10 days.\u201dAfter he finished, he went back into his room and closed the door.The people in the yard where sighing. Some even had anger in their eyes. Their stomachs were full of curses directed at Wang Lin, but none of them said them out loud. They all dispersed with long faces.After they left, Wang Lin came out of the room and explored the entire chore house. He found a remote door to a storage room.The storage room was not large. After Wang Lin cleaned it up, although he was disappointed, this was the most secluded place here. He cleaned up to make some space, then locked the door and entered the dream space.Time flew by. Wang Lin had already been in charge of the chore house for two months. In those two months, besides assigning jobs to the honorary disciples for the first few days, the rest of the time he focused on his cultivation. As for the chores of the honorary disciples, he didn\u2019t care at all. If they didn\u2019t do their jobs, all he had to do was snort coldly and they would offer him gifts.Wang Lin was very annoyed during those two months. His cultivation was constantly getting interrupted by the honorary disciples. He didn\u2019t know what the other inner disciples and elders were thinking. He messed things up this much, but they still hadn\u2019t sent a replacement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 \u2013 Wang Hao\u201cDo I need to be even more unreasonable?\u201d To leave the chore house, Wang Lin was ready to go all out. He really wanted to see what the limits of the elders were.Privately, among the honorary disciples, besides the two words trash and shameless, he gained another title; the Black Hearted King.Compared to disciple Liu\u2019s nickname, weasel, it was on a whole different level.After Wang Lin had practiced for a year in the dream space, the spiritual energy in his body had increased many folds. He had reached the limit of the first layer. No matter how much he cultivated, his spiritual energy no longer increased. Thus, one night, he started to try the chant to enter the second layer.After failing so many times, his hard work wasn\u2019t a waste as he finally broke into the second layer.The pores on his body were oozing black grease. After washing himself, Wang Lin looked at himself and saw that his eyes were like lightning. He looked very different from before.He rubbed his chin and thought, \u201cThere is only the chant for the third layer left. If I go back to Sun Dazhu to ask for the chants for the later layers and he finds out I reached the second layer, he will definitely question me about how it happened. If I can\u2019t properly explain it, then it will bring me a lot of trouble.\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Wang Lin still couldn\u2019t think of a good idea. He couldn\u2019t help but frown.With a sigh, Wang Lin began to practice the Attraction Force Technique. After this year\u2019s time of practice, Wang Lin could now succeed 10 out of 10 times. Since he reached his current degree, he decided to try it on something harder. He found a large rock in the chore house and began to practice.Another month had passed. What Wang Lin had done at the chore house caused all the honorary disciples to complain non-stop. It was winter time and the sect started to prepare for the yearly inner disciple competition.This year was the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s honorary disciple competition that happens every 10 years. If one ranked in the top three, they would become an inner disciple. All the honorary disciples were polishing their fighting skills and secretly plotting.Therefore, things related to the chore house were delayed as everyone was too busy.Wang Lin was very disappointed that he was still in charge of the chore house. As for the inner disciple competition, he didn\u2019t plan to participate. If he had the time, why not spend it cultivating in the dream space instead?Today, it started to snow on the Heng Yue mountain. From a distance, it seemed like a land of snow.Wang Lin wasn\u2019t cultivating, but stood quietly in the yard. The Attraction Force technique activated as if there was a giant hand moving around, pushing away all the snow so none would land on him.Looking toward where his home was, he remembered that his parents would have the stove burning to keep the house warm around this time of year.He would sit next to the stove reading. Dad would be on the side carving, and mom would be storing pickled vegetables.Sometimes, he\u2019d be tired from reading and sit next to his dad, watching him carve. When he was in high spirits, he would go and help his dad. There was a lot of joy between them.Wang Lin remembered that under his bed were some wooden tops. He would sometimes take them out and play with them on the ice with the neighborhood kids.Thinking about all this, Wang Lin took a deep breath. A cultivator needs to sever all mortal ties, and all of these were thoughts that would disrupt cultivation. Wang Lin closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his mind was clear. He couldn\u2019t sever all his mortal connections, so he hid them deep in his heart.While he was reminiscing, his expression suddenly changed. He was now in the second layer of Qi Condensation and had wakened his ability of divine sense. All of this was described in the Three Layers of Qi Condensation book.With a scan of his divine sense, he noticed that Wang Hao was coming in his direction. A moment later, the door opened. Wang Hao walked in, wearing a leather cap and leather coat. He looked at Wang Lin, surprised, and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, aren\u2019t you cold? Wearing this little and still standing outside.\u201dWang Lin chuckled, \u201cI calculated that you would come and see me so I came out to welcome you, you little rascal.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel cold at all. After reaching the second layer of Qi Condensation, he noticed that his body was a lot stronger than before.Wang Hao chuckled. He walked in and carefully looked at Wang Lin and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, how come I feel you\u2019re a bit different from a few months ago?\u201dWang Lin said, \u201cThat\u2019s natural. I have reached the second layer of Qi Condensation and can be considered an immortal!\u201dWang Hao\u2019s mouth twitched. He went into the room and said, \u201cDon\u2019t boast. Our talents are at about the same level. I have received help from immortal pills and still haven\u2019t reached the first layer. But for you to reach the second layer? Impossible.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t try to clarify. Sometimes, when he told the truth, people wouldn\u2019t even believe him, and if he lied, then he might end up causing others to be suspicious. In the end, his relationship with Wang Hao wasn\u2019t deep. Better to be on guard.To trust someone at first sight was not something that Wang Lin was capable of.\u201cWang Hao, how come you have time to visit me today? Is the pill house not busy?\u201d Wang Lin returned to the room and poured Wang Hao a cup of hot water.Wang Hao took the hot water and blew it a few times before taking a sip. He smiled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone to the pill house to pick up your things in the past few months. I\u2019ve been saving your portion, and came to deliver it to you today.\u201d As he was talking, he took out a small package and put it on the table.Wang Lin revealed a faint smile. He didn\u2019t even look at the package, but looked at Wang Hao. He didn\u2019t believe Wang Hao only came to deliver a package.Wang Hao was embarrassed after being stared at and said, \u201cTie Zhu, I heard you\u2019ve been doing pretty well at the chore house these past few months.\u201dWang Lin poured himself some water. He took a sip and said, \u201cWang Hao, just say what you need to say. If I can help, I definitely will!\u201dWang Hao\u2019s expression was awkward. He moved closer and mysteriously said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, I always knew you were a smart person. Speaking honestly, I know you have a lot of the talisman the honorary disciples use to visit home. Can you lend me some?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Snow WaterWang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal. He asked, \u201cHow much do you need?\u201dWang Hao hesitated and said, \u201cAt least 200.\u201d\u201cThat much? What do you need it for?\u201d Wang Lin was stunned. He did have 200 talismans. He had received almost 500 from bribes.Wang Hao sighed and said, with a bitter face, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, in two months it will be the inner disciple competition. While I can participate, I don\u2019t have any chance of winning. But I refuse to give up. That bastard Wang Zhuo has already reached the first layer of Qi Condensation and I heard that he is attempting to reach the second layer.\u201d\u201cHow does he cultivate so quickly?\u201d Wang Lin hadn\u2019t see Wang Zhuo in a while and was quite surprised. It seemed that talent really mattered.Wang Hao revealed an angry expression and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only because he has a good master. His master didn\u2019t care about the price and begged my master for a batch of Foundation Establishment pills. Those are very precious pills within the sect. After eating the pill, cultivation speed increases drastically.\u201dWang Lin nodded and asked, \u201cWhat does this have to do with you borrowing talismans?\u201dWang Hao muttered, \u201cOf course there is a connection. You don\u2019t interact with others much, but a month before the competition, all the inner disciples will hold a small exchange. There, everyone takes out their treasures to exchange for the final preparation. I heard from some seniors that attended it before. They said that during the exchange, anything can be used, like flying swords, magical treasures, pills, etc.\u201dAfter Wang Lin heard this, his heart started pounding. He didn\u2019t have much interest in flying swords or magical treasures, but the chants for the Qi Condensation stages were important to him. Thinking that he might be able to obtain them at the exchange, he pondered for a while and said, \u201cThe inner disciples trust each other that much, to just do these exchanges?\u201dWang Hao laughed and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, you have asked an important question. There is one rule during this exchange, and that\u2019s also the requirement to enter the exchange. That is, have a disguise pill. After taking the disguise pill, unless someone is at the foundation stage, no one can recognize you.\u201dA thought flashed through Wang Lin\u2019s head. \u201cYou are borrowing all these talismans for that pill?\u201dWang Hao was stunned. He nodded and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu is really smart. That is true. This pill is controlled by my master, and around this time of year, he starts to privately sell them. The price is 200 talismans.\u201dWang Lin considered a bit and said, \u201cThis exchange seems quite interesting. I want to go check it out as well.\u201dWang Hao quickly said, \u201cSure, as long as you have a disguise pill, you can attend. My goal this time is a Foundation Establishment pill. I heard that this time, there is a disciple selling them.\u201dWang Lin waved his right hand and took out 400 talismans from his bag of holding. He made them into 4 bundles of 100 talismans each.Wang Hao\u2019s eyes lit up, then stored them in his bag of holding. \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, there is still about half a month of time. I\u2019ll come and find you then. We can go together.\u201dWang Lin nodded. They talked for a while and Wang Hao left.After Wang Hao left, he contemplated it for a while. Wang Lin attached great importance to this exchange, as this was a chance for him to get the chants for the later Qi Condensation stages.But he didn\u2019t have anything valuable, and all the talismans were used on buying the disguise pill. After pondering for a long time, he decided to bring some spiritual energy filled Spring Water. That should be able to attract some people.With the help of the pill, no one would know his identity.After making up his mind, Wang Lin no longer thought about this matter. Right now, he couldn\u2019t enter the dream space, so he started to practice the Attraction Force Technique on the large rocks in the chore house.He had already practiced the Attraction Force over ten thousand times in the dream space. He had become more and more skilled at it. If it was used on a gourd, then the success rate was 10 out of 10. Now, in everyday life, as long as he moved his hand, he could grab small objects.If the size was too big, the success rate would lower, but with his spiritual energy still growing, and after he entered the second layer, the Attraction Force Technique was starting to show its true power.After practicing on the large rocks for a few hours, it was dark and snowing outside, but Wang Lin didn\u2019t immediately enter the dream space. He stood at the doorway and stared at the snowflakes as he started to ponder.Throughout the month, while cultivating at the second layer, Wang Lin noticed a problem. The effects of the spiritual energy filled Spring Water had decreased. Although the decrease was very small and could be made up, it brought him endless worry.He was afraid that, as his Qi Condensation stage got higher and higher, one day, the spiritual energy filled Spring Water would lose its effect.While soaking the mysterious bead in liquid dew was the best, followed by spring water, dew collection was far too slow. There was not enough to use, and there was none in the winter. The spring water was the easiest and most practical to get and he had an endless supply, however, if one day, the spring water is no longer effective, Wang Lin needed to have something to replace it.He slightly moved his hand and activated the Attraction Force Technique. Chunks of snow formed into a dragon and charged into a large pot in the room.After a short while, Wang Lin had filled half the pot. He stopped the Attraction Force Technique and came next to the pot. He formed a seal with his right hand. After more than ten tries, he finally formed a baby-sized fireball. The fireball emitted a lot of heat and quickly melted the snow.After all of the snow had melted, he wiped the sweat off his forehead. Continuously using two techniques had made him very tired.There wasn\u2019t much snow water in the pot. He threw the mysterious bead into pot and took it out ten minutes later.He now had a very good understanding of the mysterious bead. Soaking it in spring water for 10 minutes was the limit. He had tested soaking it for longer, but found that as long as it was in for at least ten minutes, the effect remained the same.He took a drink of the water, then closed his eyes and carefully examined the change in the spiritual energy in his body. A moment later, he opened his eyes and muttered, \u201cThe effect is a lot better than spring water, but still below dew. It can be used!\u201dHe immediately took out countless gourds. They were all the gourds that he had gathered in the mountains. After working for the entire night, all the snow in his yard was gone. That snow filled up a small portion of the gourds with spiritual energy water.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 \u2013 ExchangeIn the next few days, besides training in the dream space, Wang Lin had been busy collecting snow to melt for water. If not for the fear of the spiritual energy escaping, he would have used vats, so he used gourds instead. It was good that he had enough gourds. After only a few days, he had accumulated a few hundred gourds filled with snow water. He calculated that the snow water that he had collected in those gourds was enough for him to use in the dream space for a long time.After storing the snow water, Wang Lin went back to cultivating. Although the spring water\u2019s effect had dropped, it was still useful.In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. Over those ten days, Wang Lin had drunk more spring water than he ever had before. Good thing the spring water dissolved into spiritual energy in his body, otherwise, there was no way his stomach could handle that much water.The amount of spiritual energy needed for the second layer was much greater than the first layer. In fact, Wang Lin had already cultivated for more than 9 months in his dream space.If it was the first layer, after cultivating for 9 months with this much spiritual energy, he would have achieved some good results, but now, even though he felt that his body contained much more spiritual energy, he still wasn\u2019t able to reach the results he desired.The day that Wang Lin agreed with to meet with Wang Hao had come, so Wang Lin didn\u2019t enter the dream space. Around midnight, it started to snow, and Wang Hao entered Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense.Shortly after, Wang Hao opened the door, but didn\u2019t come in. He quickly said, \u201cMaster took a long time to refine pills and delayed me. Come quickly, the exchange is about to start.\u201dWang Hao hurried toward the exchange and Wang Lin hastily followed.The two walked in the snow and wandered out of the sect\u2019s courtyards and into the mountains.The current road was very slippery, so Wang Hao walked very slowly. His body was shaking. He whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s with his damn weather? If I fell down the mountain here and died, even if I was I ghost, I would want some justice!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s body was now very light. He didn\u2019t share Wang Hao\u2019s discomfort at all. In fact, he felt that the weather was pretty good. He thought that, after the exchange was over, he could collect a lot more snow water.After walking for a while, Wang Hao stopped. He secretly handed Wang Lin a green pill and whispered, \u201cWe are almost there. I came here a few days ago. It\u2019s only a few turns away. Let us take the pill now, so no one will know our identities.\u201dWang Hao took out a similar pill swallowed it. A thick black fog appeared and covered Wang Hao\u2019s body. A gruff voice came out from the fog and said, \u201cHow is it? Can you tell who I am?\u201dWang Lin scanned Wang Hao with his divine sense and found that he felt as if there was a barrier of mud blocking him. That made him feel like the pill was safe to take. He laughed and said, \u201cThis pill is really amazing!\u201d Then he took the pill and a similar thing happened to him as well.The two quickly walked forward. After making a few turns, they arrived at an open area.The open space was very large. Dozens of people stood there, covered in black fog like them, in silence.After Wang Lin and Wang Hao arrived, they found an empty space and stood there without moving.Not long after, seeing that no one else was coming, one person stepped forward, coughed once, then hoarsely said, \u201cTime is up. This time, I will host the exchange again. Just as before, I\u2019ll go first.\u201d After he finished talking, he pulled out a little silver sword and said, \u201cThis flying sword doesn\u2019t belong to the sect. It\u2019s one that I obtained myself and it\u2019s very powerful. I want only 500 talismans.\u201dEveryone started to talk about the sword amongst themselves for a while, then someone walked forward and, without a word, handed over 500 talismans and finished the trade.Another began to say, \u201cI have this piece of magical jade that could release a skill similar to earth split three times. I only want 10 Qi Gathering Pills.\u201d He took out a piece of jade, waved it and put it away.Someone not far from Wang Lin immediately said, \u201cI\u2019ll exchange with you!\u201d As he was coming out, another person quickly said, \u201cI\u2019ll trade 12 pills for that piece of jade!\u201dThe first person hesitated and stared hard at the second person without a word. He felt that 10 pills was the limit.Soon after, people came up one by one, showing off their stuff, and the scene became lively, especially when people fought over a certain item. Whoever had the highest bid won.\u201cI have a technique here that, as long as you\u2019re above the second layer of Qi Condensation, you can use it to hide your cultivation for a short period of time, unless the person is already at the Foundation Establishment stage. I know that this thing is pretty useless. I only want 10 \u2026 5 Qi Gathering Pills for it.\u201d The person who said it was very hesitant.Everyone laughed. This technique really was useless. All of the disciples wanted to show off their cultivation, because the higher the cultivation, the better their treatment. Who was that bored, to want to hide their cultivation? If it lasted longer, then it would at least have some use, but it only lasted for a short period and cost so much; 5 Qi Gathering Pills.Seeing that no one wanted it the person sighed. Just as he was about to put it away, Wang Lin called out, \u201cI\u2019ll trade 5 Qi Gathering Pills for it.\u201dThe person in the middle was stunned. They quickly became excited and came up to exchange.Holding the thing containing the technique, Wang Lin was stunned. He had never seen this type of thing before. He quickly scanned it with his divine sense and the method for the technique quickly appeared in his mind.This thing might be useless for others, but it was very useful to him, even though it could only hide cultivation for a short period of time.A voice suddenly rang out. Despite it being hoarse, it was still filled with pride. \u201cOne Foundation Establishment pill. State your offer!\u201dWang Hao immediately became excited and quickly said, \u201c20 Qi Gathering Pills!\u201d\u201c1000 talismans plus a flying sword!\u201d\u201c2000 talismans!\u201d\u201c30 Qi Gathering Pills plus 500 talismans!\u201d\u201cA piece of skill jade, a flying sword, 10 Qi Gathering Pills and 500 talismans!\u201dThe crowd loudly shouted their offers. They clearly viewed the Foundation Establishment pill as an item of great importance. Wang Lin had heard about this Foundation Establishment pill from Wang Hao. After taking the pill, its effect would stay in the body for two months. In those two months, the rate in which one absorbed spiritual energy would be increased by several times. It was something every disciple under the 7th layer of Qi Condensation desired.That pill was very precious, even in the sect. Every disciple normally only had two chances of obtaining it; when a disciple was promoted to black cloth rank, they could receive one, and when they get promoted to purple cloth they would receive two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 \u2013 Main TextWang Lin had no interest in this Foundation Establishment Pill at all. Seeing the price already so high, he sighed for Wang Hao. It seemed that Wang Hao wouldn\u2019t be able to get this Foundation Establishment Pill.While thinking this, he heard Wang Hao shout, \u201c230 Qi Gathering Pills! This is my limit. Any more and I\u2019m not trading!\u201dThe scene quickly became silent. 230 Qi Gathering Pills was already a very high price. Not many could beat it. But the Foundation Establishment pill was simply too rare, and few were willing to give theirs up.The person selling the Foundation Establishment pill smiled. He arrogantly said, \u201cWith just 230 Qi Gathering Pills, you want to trade for my Foundation Establishment pill? If the price is under 2000 Qi Gathering Pills, I\u2019m not trading!\u201dWang Lin quickly listened to his voice. After pondering for a while, he secretly guessed that this person was Wang Zhuo, but he was not sure, because he was completely hidden by the black fog.Wang Hao shrugged and didn\u2019t say a word. Everyone present was stunned by that person\u2019s arrogance.The person in charge coughed and said, \u201cOk everyone, since that person doesn\u2019t want to trade his Foundation Establishment Pill, let us move on and continue the exchange.\u201dBefore long, another person came out and presented their goods. Soon, it was Wang Lin\u2019s turn. He stepped forward, took out a small bottle, and said, \u201cA mysterious liquid that could match 1 drop to 1 qi gathering pill. There are about 100 drops in here. I only want the chants for the 4th layer or later.\u201d After he finished talking, he opened the bottle. Everyone could sense the spiritual energy within it.Many people became mesmerized. Although Qi Gathering Pills were filled with spiritual energy, it was still a finished product. This liquid had many more uses, like refining more pills.Even when refining treasures, like a flying swords it would help increase its spiritual power.Someone immediately said, \u201cI\u2019ll trade the chant for the 4th layer with you!\u201dWang Lin raised his brow and said, \u201cOnly the 4th layer?\u201dAnother person shouted, \u201cHow about the chants for the 4th, 5th, and 6th layers to trade for that mysterious liquid?\u201dWang Lin pondered a little. He shook his head and said, \u201cI want the chants for the 4th through 15th layer.\u201d\u201cBrother, aren\u2019t you making this too difficult for us? Even second elder apprentice-brother Can Jie, who won last year\u2019s competition, is only at the 6th layer, and they only have the chant for 7th, 8th, and 9th layer. From the 10th to 15th layer, only a few elder apprentice-brothers have them!\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He hesitated for a while. Suddenly, a voice from not far away said, \u201cIf you have 200 drops of that liquid, I can give you the chant for layers 4 through 9!\u201dEveryone looked toward the voice and saw a man wearing purple walking toward the disguised Wang Lin. He was only about 20 years old, but had a cold expression. When he arrived, he looked at the surroundings and everyone was shocked. They respectfully said, \u201cSecond elder apprentice-brother Can Jie!\u201dThe purple clothed man didn\u2019t pay any attention to them, but said to Wang Lin, \u201cDo you have 200 drops?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s face hardened and his pupils shrank. He was getting an extremely dangerous feeling from this person, far exceeding anyone else that he had met in the Heng Yue Sect.Even master Sun Dazhu and brother Zhang couldn\u2019t compare to him.Wang Lin respectfully replied, \u201cThis liquid is something I found by accident. Besides these 100 drops, I have a few dozen left to use for myself. I don\u2019t have that much.\u201dThe purple clothed man pondered a little. He tossed out a piece of jade and said, \u201cFine. Give me the rest of the liquid and these chants are yours!\u201dWang Lin took the piece of jade and scanned it to make sure it contained what he needed. He took out another bottle and placed the two bottles on the ground. He didn\u2019t get closer to the purple clothed man.The purple clothed man looked at Wang Lin, then waved his hand. The two bottles flew towards him. After scanning them with his divine sense, he said, \u201cIf you get more of this liquid, come look for me in the back mountains. It doesn\u2019t matter if its Foundation Establishment pills, flying swords, skill jade, or even the chant for the 10th layer or later. I can get them all!\u201d After he finished speaking, he turned around and left.Wang Lin\u2019s eye became narrow and his gaze became cold. The last thing that purple clothed man said was simply too vicious. If it was the people in the crowd, they might not have immediately realized, but Wang Lin had always been smart, so he could always see the deeper meaning in things.The words the guy said meant that anyone could take the mysterious liquid to him to trade. That placed Wang Lin in a very dangerous position.Although he couldn\u2019t see other people\u2019s eyes, he could feel that there were people secretly watching him.But after Wang Lin decided to bring out the spring water, he had already prepared for this possibility, so he didn\u2019t panic and calmly checked his surrounding.The crowd quickly continued the exchange until it was over. As people left, there were people who were filled with joy, as well as many filled with disappointment.Wang Lin did not leave with Wang Hao, but placed a dozen or so talismans on his legs and rushed out. He disappeared in the blink of an eye.Wang Hao was a smart person and understood why Wang Lin did this. He quickly used a talisman and left the exchange ground.The disciples that revealed some good treasures all did the same and quickly left.The several disciples that had malicious thoughts toward Wang Lin after seeing the mysterious liquid were all taken by surprise. They wanted to chase, but only saw a shadow. They cursed a few times and left.Some of the higher cultivation level disciples didn\u2019t go and blatantly try steal things. This was, after all, an exchange between disciples of the same sect. If killing and stealing really occurred and was found out by the other\u2019s master, then there would be dire consequences.As Wang Lin was running, he kept placing more talismans on his legs. The speed the talismans gave stacked, so, with a few dozen talismans on his legs, he quickly returned to the sect courtyard.The person he was the most afraid of was the purple clothed man. He didn\u2019t immediately return to the chore house, but hid in an empty room.Only when daylight appeared and the disguise disappeared did Wang Lin carefully leave the room. Luckily, along the way back, there was nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 \u2013 TrainingWith the chants all the way up to the 9th layer, Wang Lin could continue his cultivation. He returned to his reclusive lifestyle, while heavy tension loomed over the Heng Yue Sect.All of the inner sect disciples were preparing for the competition. If they could reach the top, then magic treasures, pills, talismans, spirit stones, and more will be rewarded to them.What made their eyes green with envy was that this time, the sect took out one of its big treasures, the Two Moon Ring, as the reward for first place.This Two Moon Ring belonged to a senior of the sect from 300 years ago. It contained great defensive power.Therefore, all of the inner disciples were secretly preparing their strength.As for the newcomer competition, since there were only a handful of new inner disciples, everyone predicted that the winner of the newcomer competition will be Wang Zhuo.As for the honorary disciples, they became even more hostile toward each other. The competition to become an inner disciple was a chance to turn their lives around. Everyone was secretly preparing for it.This tense atmosphere had nothing to do with Wang Lin at all. In addition to cultivation, he also practiced the attraction technique. The day before the end of the month, he left the chore house and headed straight for the main courtyard.The technique to hide his cultivation level was activated. The spiritual energy in his body quickly disguised itself to the level of the first layer of Qi Condensation.He found that the people at the chore house were too annoying and kept him from cultivating properly, so he wanted an excuse to go to a quiet place to cultivate.After arriving at the main courtyard, he walked in. A while later, he stepped in front of Sun Dazhu\u2019s herb garden and respectfully said, \u201cDisciple Wang Lin requests to meet master.\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d The herb garden\u2019s gate didn\u2019t open. It seemed Sun Dazhu really didn\u2019t like this disciple.Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal. He respectfully said, \u201cDisciple\u2019s cultivation is too low, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to win in the competition and lose master face, so I would like to refrain from participating.\u201dSun Dazhu sneered, \u201cHmmm, it seems you are still a bit self aware, you little brat. Look at elder Xu\u2019s disciple, Wang Zhuo. So young, yet already at the peak of the first layer, and could enter the second layer at any time. Even if you went, it would be useless. The others could kill you with their finger. I even heard you guys are relatives. How could there be such a big difference?\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t care and said, \u201cWang Zhuo has been smart since he was young, and he\u2019s naturally talented. He\u2019s not someone this disciple could compete with.\u201dSun Dazhu pondered for a while and asked, \u201cDid you find any more gourds in the past half year?\u201dWang Lin shook his head, revealing a look of helplessness, and said, \u201cThis has really been strange. I have been to the mountain multiple times, but haven\u2019t seen any gourds.\u201dSun Dazhu coldly said, \u201cDo you have anything else to say? If not, then scram. Every time I see you, I get angry!\u201d Every time he laid eyes on Wang Lin, he couldn\u2019t contain his anger. He wished he could just kill Wang Lin with one hand so the others wouldn\u2019t laugh at him.Wang Lin bowed and respectfully said, \u201cMaster, disciple is really bored from staying up here in the mountains and would like to leave until after the new year. What do you think?\u201dSun Dazhu refused and said, \u201cLeave the mountain? You can\u2019t. I almost forgot until you mentioned it, but in four years is the competition between the other sects. This time, the head already ordered that after the new year, most of the inner disciples will go into intense closed door training. You should go so you don\u2019t ruin my name in the intersect competition.\u201d\u201cIntense training?\u201d Wang Lin was stunned.\u201cEvery 20 years, there must be a competition between the sects. That has been the rule for hundreds of years. Although Xuan Dao Zong is friendly with our Heng Yue sect on the surface, we secretly have a lot of disagreements. For the past 100 years, we have always lost to them, which is very disgraceful. That\u2019s why there will be this intense training. You listen to me well. If after four years you haven\u2019t made any advancement and make me lose face during the competition, I\u2019ll kick you out of the Heng Yue Sect no matter what!\u201d After saying that, Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t explain anymore.Wang Lin secretly let out a sigh. It seemed that training outside the sect won\u2019t be possible. Seeing that Sun Dazhu\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t friendly, he nodded and took his leave.After returning to the chore house, Wang Lin pondered a little. Since he couldn\u2019t train outside the sect, let\u2019s use this intense training to properly cultivate.The next day, the competition began. The scene was very lively. Wang Lin didn\u2019t go. He used this time to cultivate and solidify his foundation in the second layer.In the next few days, Wang Lin found out from the gossip of the honorary disciples that among the inner disciples, apprentice-brother Zhang got first place, but only because no purple ranked disciple participated.As for Wang Zhuo, he unsurprisingly became the king of the new disciples. He became even more arrogant and no longer viewed disciples his age as people on his level.A week later, in the morning, a bell rang throughout the sect. It rang five times. That meant that all inner disciples must quickly gather outside the main hall.Wang Lin couldn\u2019t hear the bell from inside the dream space. It wasn\u2019t until the furious Sun Dazhu kicked open the chore house\u2019s door and woke him. He quickly put away the bead and opened up the door to the secret training room, only to see Sun Dazhu\u2019s furious face, shouting, \u201cWang Lin are you deaf? Did you not hear the bell? You bastard! All of the inner disciples participating in the intense training are there but you! You made me lose face before elder apprentice-brother! You\u2026 you make me so mad!\u201dWang Lin raised his brow and remained silent.Sun Dazhu gave Wang Lin a hard look. He knew that this was not the time to scold his disciple, because the head and apprentice-brothers were all waiting. Without a word, he grabbed Wang Lin and stepped onto the seven colored cloud and flew into the sky.At top speed, they arrived in front of the main hall. Sun Dazhu mercilessly threw Wang Lin to the ground. Sun Dazhu said, in a low whisper, \u201cWang Lin, follow me in. If you make me lose face again, I\u2019ll go against the sect rules and kill you!\u201d Those last words by Sun Dazhu were filled with killing intent. He was already at his wit\u2019s end with this disciple. He later decided that he must find a reason to kick his disciple out of the sect.Wang Lin rubbed his shoulder. If he hadn\u2019t already reached the second layer of Qi Condensation, then that fall would have broken his arm. He lowered his head and whispered, \u201cDisciple obeys.\u201dSun Dazhu snorted. He tidied his clothes and walked into the main hall. Wang Lin took a deep breath and suppressed his anger as he walked into the hall as well.The Heng Yue Sect main hall was the most grand place within the sect. It was a wide hall with dozens of status of sages of the sect. The entire hall was filled with a sense of awe.After Wang Lin followed Sun Dazhu into the hall, dozens of gazes suddenly gathered on him. He had difficulty breathing and quickly lowered his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 \u2013 Back MountainMore than 40 inner disciples stood inside the hall. There were disciples of black, white, and red rank, but no purple. All of these disciples had serious expressions. Among them, Wang Lin could see many faces that he knew, like Wang Zhuo, the girl named Xu, the girl name Zhou, apprentice-brother Zhang, and such.Right in front of them sat two rows of more than 10 elders, all with cold expressions. Right in the middle sat a person, about 40 years old, wearing a blue gown, with eyes like lightning. He said, \u201cJunior brother Sun, this is your disciple?\u201dSun Dazhu quickly put up a smiling face and said, \u201cElder apprentice-brother, this is my disciple, Wang Lin. He entered the sect late, so he doesn\u2019t know the meaning behind the bell ringing 5 times.\u201dA red faced man sitting on the right sneered, \u201cThe disciple is really like his master. He\u2019s kinda dumb, just like you were back then.\u201dA man on his side laughed. \u201cApprentice-brother isn\u2019t correct. Junior brother Sun at least had some talent, so he was much stronger than his disciple.\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s face changed between red and white for a while. He gave Wang Lin a hard look. He snorted and ignored Wang Lin and went to sit down.The man in the blue gown frowned. He looked at Wang Lin one more time before forgetting about him and said, \u201cAs said before, these 4 years of intense training must provide results. We must win in the competition against Xuan Dao Zong. Starting today, you will be entering the back mountain. Everyone will be provided with their own cultivation place. This time, the sect will provide 10,000 qi gathering pills for you all to use. None of you may leave the mountain during this time.\u201dAll of the inner disciples replied in unison.The man in the blue gown nodded and continued to say, \u201cI hope that in four years, one of you will become a purple clothed disciple. Purple clothed disciple means a core disciple far more important than inner disciples. Forget it, experience it for yourself. Now, all of you, go to the back mountain and someone will lead to you the cultivation ground.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he waved his sleeves and a white light shot out from them. After circling the hall once, he growled, \u201cOpen!\u201dThe white light suddenly expanded and soon engulfed all of the inner disciples.\u201cGo!\u201d Following the growl from the man in the blue gown, the white light sparkled and disappeared from the main hall.Wang Lin felt a warm sensation in his body. After the blink of an eye, he found himself inside a valley. This place had much more spiritual energy than the other places. Sounds of water could be heard from all sides. He scanned the area and found the other inner disciples chatting with each other.This valley had no plants. It was a cliff with many holes carved into it, like a bee hive. Some of the holes were sealed with giant rocks.Suddenly Wang Lin noticed that someone was watching him. He turned around and saw Wang Zhuo smiling at him coldly.At that moment, a youth came out from one of the holes in the cliff. He was wearing purple clothes and coldly looked at everyone. He said, \u201cFellow apprentice-brothers and sisters, this is the back mountains of the Heng Yue Sect. As for back mountain, it\u2019s not really the back of the Heng Yue Sect, but a cultivation ground for inner disciples built by several Soul Transformation stage experts 500 years ago. This place has much thicker spiritual energy than normal. Since you are here, you must concentrate on cultivating, or else don\u2019t blame us seniors for kicking you out of the back mountain.\u201dWang Lin recognized this purple clothed youth. He was the person that bought Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy liquid . It was rumored that he was already at the 6th layer of Qi Condensation and that he was very unpredictable.Wang Lin lowered his head. This kind of scheming he understood well because he put him into a dangerous situation before.\u201cI have the chants for the 7th layer and below. If you reach that level, but don\u2019t have the chant, come to me. Once I check you, I\u2019ll give it to you. As for where you will be practicing, any one of these caves that isn\u2019t sealed can be chosen. Here are bottles of Qi Gathering pills. Each bottle contains 50 pills and will be refilled once a year.\u201d After he finished speaking, he waved his hand and 50 white bottles appeared on the ground.Some of the inner disciples stepped forward and took a bottle, then started to look for the entrance to the cultivation area.Wang Lin took a deep breath. Because he took a disguise pill back then, that person didn\u2019t know his identity, so he went up and took a bottle. Zhang Kuang stood at the side, looking at the inner disciples take the bottles one by one, when he suddenly saw Wang Lin. He had a strange look on his face and said, \u201cWhats your name? How come you haven\u2019t even reached the first layer of Qi Condensation? Who is your master?\u201d [E/N: Apparently, his name changed from Can Jie to Zhang Kuang. Whatever.]Wang Lin stopped and turned around. He respectfully said, \u201cSenior brother, my name is Wang Lin. My master is Sun Dazhu. My talent is lacking, that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t reached the first layer yet.\u201dZhang Kuang was stunned. He smiled. \u201cYou are Wang Lin? I heard about you before. Although talent is important, perseverance is also key. Since your talent is lacking, you must work even harder!\u201dWang Lin quickly promised.\u201cThis cliff is too high for you since you\u2019re not even at the first layer. I\u2019ll give you a lift.\u201d Zhang Kuang waved his sleeves. An invisible force appeared under Wang Lin\u2019s feet and pushed him until he was in front of a cave.Wang Lin respectfully thanked Zhang Kuang. After he turned around and entered the cave, his face quickly darkened. If he hadn\u2019t met this apprentice-brother before, he would have been thankful, but after seeing his true nature, he would, of course, not take this small favor to heart.The cave wasn\u2019t large. There was only a stone bed and a lever on the wall. Wang Lin walked over and pulled the lever. Suddenly, a roaring sound could be heard as a giant rock fell down and completely sealed the cave.After carefully examining the cave again and finding nothing wrong, Wang Lin was very satisfied with the place. When he looked for Sun Dazhu, he wanted to look for a place to cultivate outside of the sect. Although he was rejected, the current situation lead him to a place that was pretty close to his original plans.The only downside was that there was no source of water inside the cave. Wang Lin\u2019s cultivation mainly relied on the spiritual energy liquid. But in his bag of holding, he had collected a lot of snow water, so it should be enough for him to use for a while.He also heard sounds of water inside the valley. As long as he was a bit cautious, water shouldn\u2019t be an issue.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 QuarrelAfter thinking about it, he took out the mysterious bead and started his first closed door training.Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, 2 years had passed. During those two years, Wang Lin was either cultivating or practicing his attraction technique, but he didn\u2019t feel lonely at all.Even though it had been two years in the real world, in reality, he had been in closed door training for 13 years.The spiritual energy here was very rich. He was very impressed. Although it couldn\u2019t compare to the spiritual energy liquid, whenever he was waiting in the real world, he found the spiritual energy to be at least twice as dense as it was outside of the back mountains.Starting from the second layer, his cultivation became very slow. After cultivating in the dream space for more than 6 years, he reached the limit of the second layer. He then started to tackle breaking into the third layer. After countless tries, he finally broke through.But what was causing him confusion and distress was that in the 7 years after, even though he had already reached the peak of the 3rd layer, he couldn\u2019t enter the 4th layer, no matter how hard he tried. It was not that he lacked spiritual energy. He felt a mysterious force stopping him every time he reached the critical point.And this 3rd layer of Qi Condensation was also weird. It was unlike the 1st or 2nd layer, where once he reached the peak, he couldn\u2019t condense any more spiritual energy.Although Wang Lin felt that he had reached the limit, the 3rd layer didn\u2019t seem to have a limit. If he continued to cultivate, his spiritual energy would continue to increase and keep transforming his body.This caused Wang Lin to be very surprised, but no matter how hard he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t find an answer.Today, all of the snow water had been used up. He only had one gourd of spiritual energy liquid left. That gourd had been with him for a long time. It was one of the three that Wang Lin buried in the mountains. He used two of them to make the 10th cloud appear on the bead, and considering that he almost died the last time he took a gulp of it, he had been very wary of it and kept it in his bag of holding.After a bit of hesitation, Wang Lin didn\u2019t take out that gourd. Based on his calculations, the amount of spiritual energy in that gourd had already reached a terrifying state. He could always use it once he reached a higher level of Qi Condensation.He stood up and stretched his body. He walked to the lever and pulled. With a roar, the stone door opened. Sunlight poured into the cave and blinded Wang Lin. After he got used to the light, he came out of the cave and took a deep breath.Looking down, there were a lot of people chatting in the valley. It seemed that a lot of these people found cultivation dull and came to socialize.After pondering a little, he activated the technique to hide his cultivation level to the first layer of Qi Condensation. He waved his sleeves and jumped forward. His body slowly floated down to the ground.In the 13 years that he had spent in the dream space, he had completely mastered the attraction technique. He didn\u2019t even need to say the chant anymore, he only needed to will it to use it.Like now, he was using the attraction technique on his body. Although it could be said that once the attraction technique reached a certain level, it was doable, that was only when one moved slowly. The moment it speeds up, it becomes difficult.But Wang Lin felt so confident now, that even if he needed to fly quickly, he wouldn\u2019t lose control. Without more than 10 years of practicing the attraction technique, this would be impossible.But who had the time to waste on practicing for 10 years on this low level technique? All of cultivators were racing against time. If they had the time, why not practice some higher level techniques?In order to not attract attention, Wang Lin slowly landed in the valley. Right as he landed, he could hear the sound of ridicule. \u201cThe sun really came out from the west side. Even the trash, Wang Lin, has reached the first layer of Qi Condensation and can finally come down from the cliff without help.\u201dWang Lin turned his head. He indifferently looked at Wang Zhuo. There were also a few people sitting next to him. They were all inner disciples.A 24 to 25 year old white clothed youth laughed. \u201cWang Lin, you shouldn\u2019t be here. You should be mixed with those honorary disciples back in the chore house. At least there, you can feel high and mighty, but here, you are the worst of all of us.\u201dWang Lin scanned with his divine sense. Wang Zhuo was the same as him, reaching the peak of the third layer, and the white clothed youth had reached the peak of the 4th layer. He could break through it at any time.Wang Zhuo proudly said, \u201cWang Lin, you sure were smart 2 years ago. You knew you weren\u2019t my match, so you just gave up. But let me tell you, trash will always be trash. You will never match up to me. I was the top newcomer two years ago, what are you?\u201dThe white clothed youth beside him laughed. \u201cJunior brother, go fetch me some water from the river there. Your senior brother is feeling good, so I might give you some pointers.\u201d As he was speaking, he threw a bottle. It landed at Wang Lin\u2019s feet.Wang Lin remained silent and looked at the white clothed youth.The white clothed youth said, with a dismissive look, \u201cWhat does this mean? You want to fight? Let me tell you, second apprentice-brother already said that inner disciples can\u2019t fight with each other. If you don\u2019t act properly, don\u2019t blame me for teaching you a lesson.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. All of you shut up!\u201d A shout came from the cliff. Soon, a shadow appeared like lightning, revealing apprentice-brother Zhang\u2019s shadow. He frowned and looked at everyone and growled, \u201cWang Zhuo, Sun Hao, the two of your aren\u2019t cultivating, but are here bullying a junior who is only at the first layer of Qi Condensation. Is this really that interesting?\u201dThe two\u2019s expression quickly changed. They quickly shot Wang Lin ugly looks and lightly snorted. Afterwards, they didn\u2019t say any more. They clearly feared marital brother Zhang.Apprentice-brother Zhang\u2019s gaze turned to Wang Lin and equally harshly said, \u201cWang Lin, you really shouldn\u2019t have come, but since you\u2019re here, you should properly cultivate. In the world of cultivation, power is everything.\u201dWang Lin nodded. He hesitated a bit and asked, \u201cApprentice-brother Zhang, I have a question. After reaching the peak of the first layer of Qi Condensation, why, no matter what I do, can\u2019t I break into the second layer?\u201dWang Zhuo snorted and said, \u201cWith your talent, don\u2019t even think about reaching the second layer in your lifetime!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 Four YearsApprentice-brother Zhang gave Wang Zhuo a cold look and said, \u201cThe key to breaking through really does have a lot to do with your talent. Some people only need a few attempts to succeed, while others need hundreds or thousands of years or never even break through in their life.\u201dWang Lin revealed a melancholy expression and suddenly asked, \u201cApprentice-brother Zhang, is breaking through every layer this difficult? Is breaking from the 2nd to 3rd and 3rd to 4th as hard?\u201dApprentice-brother Zhang nodded, \u201cYes. The later the stage, the harder it is especially, the 3rd to 4th and 5th to 6th layer.\u201dApprentice-brother Zhang\u2019s answer also attracted a few other disciples. A female disciple suddenly asked, \u201cApprentice-brother, what is so difficult about going from the 3rd to 4th layer? I\u2019m currently in the 3rd layer.\u201dWang Lin knew the person that talked. It was the girl named Zhou that Wang Huo was pursuing.Apprentice-brother Zhang pondered a while and said, \u201cFine. Just today, I\u2019ll tell you guys about the two bottlenecks you will face below the 6th layer of Qi Condensation. The first bottleneck is from the 3rd to 4th layer. For some people, it\u2019s very easy, but for others, it\u2019s something they might never get past in their entire life. The key has nothing to do with talent, but in one\u2019s ability to understand the meaning behind the phrase \u201cthe road is merciless\u201d.\u201dHe gave everyone a thoughtful look and continued, \u201cImmortals need to cut away their mortal ties. If you can do it, then the 3rd to 4th layer is easy, if not, then it becomes hard. As for the bottleneck at the 5th to 6th layer, that is a change in the quality of spiritual energy in your body. spiritual energy slowly changes your body, and at that point, it starts making deeper changes. This requires a large amount of spiritual energy, so it became a bottleneck that blocks a lot of people.After Wang Lin finished listening, he was stunned and silently pondered.The other inner disciples all had different expressions and continued to ask questions. It wasn\u2019t until it became dark that everyone dispersed.Wang Lin wandered into the valley, following the sound of water, frowning. Soon, a lake appeared before him.A faint scent of spiritual energy was emitted from the water. Wang Lin went and drank some of the water. Although it couldn\u2019t match the spiritual energy liquid, it still contained enough to help increase his spiritual energy.So he took out gourds and filled them with water, one by one. After a long time, he finally filled all of the gourds and turned around. His pupils immediately shrank as he saw second apprentice-brother standing a distance away, behind him, like a ghost. When he was filling the water he was constantly scanning the area with this divine sense, but didn\u2019t find anything. However, it seemed that Apprentice-brother Zhang had been there for a long time. Wang Lin\u2019s heart sank.Zhang Kuang\u2019s eyes lit up and said, \u201cBrother Wang, the river does contain a lot of spiritual energy, and is good for your cultivation, but I see you have a lot of gourds prepared already. Did you already know you would need them before you came here?\u201dWang Lin put away his things without any change in his expression and said, \u201cMaster had previously informed me that the river would help my cultivation, so disciple has prepared a lot.\u201dZhang Kuang stared at Wang Lin for a while and said, \u201cIt\u2019s normal for Sun Dazhu to know this. You should go back and practice. To be able to reach the first layer in only two short years, it seems junior brother is really determined. That\u2019s good. I hope that when I seen you again, you will be at the second layer.\u201dWang Lin clasped his hands and left. Only after he returned to his cave did he finally relax a bit. His clothes were soaked in sweat. Good thing he trained himself to constantly use the technique to hide his cultivation level, otherwise, if Zhang knew that he had already reached the 3rd layer, he would definitely become suspicious. If Zhang tried to kill him, he wouldn\u2019t have the power to fight back.Wang Lin quietly reminded himself, \u201cImmortals are the same as mortals. There are many different types. In fact, the immortals are much more cruel than mortals, so I must not let anyone know I have this mysterious bead.\u201dAfter pulling the lever to seal the cave again, Wang Lin sat down crossed legged and started to cultivate again.The principle of cutting off all mortal desires and ties was to prevent these things from distracting them from their cultivation, but after entering the Heng Yue Sect, Wang Lin found that most of the immortals not only do not cut themselves off from their desires, but become even worse.As a result, the term \u201ccut off mortal desires\u201d was a very vague expression, but according to Brother Zhang, it was the key to go from the 3rd to 4th layer, which seemed to be a contradiction.After being puzzled for a long time and still not finding any clues, Wang Lin knew that he could never cut the ties with his family. The lucky part was that the 3rd layer wasn\u2019t like the first two layers. Even though he couldn\u2019t break through, his spiritual energy still increased. In the end, he gave up trying to break through the to the 4th layer quickly and just kept building his spiritual energy up.Time quickly passed. One year, two years. Without knowing, two more years had passed. Wang Lin had been in closed door training for 4 years now. He only left the cave once more to refill with water to make into spiritual energy water for this cultivation.Four years in the real world resulted in 25 years in the dream space. Including the time from before the closed door training, Wang Lin had been cultivating for 27 or 28 years already.His Qi Condensation level was still stuck at the 3rd layer, but the amount of spiritual energy in his body was still increasing.It was the last day of the 4 years of intense training. Outside, an arrogant voice shouted, \u201cFellow apprentice-brothers and sisters, the 4 years are up. Come out quickly. The head is here, preparing to send you all back.\u201dAll of the caves on the cliff opened up. The inner disciples made their way out from them one by one.Wang Lin felt, with this divine sense, that these 40 plus people all had great harvests while training here in the past 4 years.Wang Zhuo had already reached the peak of the 5th layer and was ready to break into the 6th layer. There were many others in the same situation. Everyone\u2019s cultivation had increased a lot.The girl named Xu was at the 3rd layer, and as for brother Zhang, he was already at the 6th layer!He vaguely felt that his cultivation was different from everyone else\u2019s. Just now, when he used his divine sense to scan everyone, it seemed as if no one else noticed.The girl named Zhou had already said that she reached the 3rd layer two years ago, but under Wang Lin\u2019s scan, he observed that she was still at the 3rd layer, with no growth at all.Wang Lin had a guess. It seemed others\u2019 3rd layer weren\u2019t like his, without a limit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 \u2013 Light SpeckAfter analysing the situation in great detail, he felt that this had something to do with him cultivating in the dream space. He had experienced many of the bead\u2019s mysteries in these past 4 years.When cultivating in the dream space, he could feel that those glowing orbs released a light that got absorbed by his body.As for those glowing orbs, he had analysed them for a while, but still hadn\u2019t found their exact use.Wang Lin no longer used the technique to conceal his cultivation level, as 4 years of cultivation in a place like the back mountains was a good enough reason to explain it all.No one else knew that 20 years ago, in dream space time, he had already reached the 3rd layer.Also, for the past 20 plus years, he had been constantly practicing his attraction technique and it had reached a terrifying level.In fact, no one in the country of Zhao would spend 20 years practicing such a basic technique.Suddenly, a white light appeared silently from the sky and covered everyone. The warm feeling came again, but this time, Wang Lin noticed a difference.There were faint flashes of strange symbols in the light. The symbols came together to form a whirlpool that quickly pulled everyone in, and they disappeared from the valley.When they reappeared, they were in the main hall. The sect head sat there, still wearing the blue gown. Next to him sat several elders.In the moment, several powerful divine senses scanned them. The sect head smiled. He nodded and said, \u201cFor years have passed and I\u2019m very pleased that all of you have made considerable progress. Very good. Now, all disciples that reached 5th layer or higher, stay. The rest of you, go and tell your masters of your harvest in these 4 years. In three days, Xuan Dao Zong will be here. This time, we must win. As for the changes in clothes, it will all be done after the competition with them.\u201dThe people all replied in unison. All of the disciples below the 5th layer left. Wang Lin looked around and didn\u2019t see Sun Dazhu.After leaving the hall, Wang Lin made his way to Sun Dazhu\u2019s herb garden. He sent out his divine sense and found that the seal on the gate didn\u2019t stop him at all, so his divine sense went into the garden and he found Sun Dazhu there, cultivating. Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t notice his divine sense at all.This seal that terrified him before now seemed to be filled with flaws. He now felt that if he wanted to break this seal, he could easily do so.Wang Lin withdrew his divine sense and respectfully called out, \u201cDisciple Wang Lin is here to greet the master.\u201dAfter Sun Dazhu heard this, he hesitated for a while. After thinking for a long time, he somewhat remembered that he had accepted a disciple called Wang Lin 4 years ago. Then, he sent Wang Lin to the intense training. He was not sure if that trash had made any improvements.Due to his curiosity, he opened the gate to the garden and arrogantly said, \u201cCome in then.\u201dWang Lin walked in. Sun Dazhu examined Wang Lin and exclaimed, \u201cYou managed to get to the 3rd layer?!\u201dWang Lin nodded and respectfully said, \u201cDisciple has trained hard in these 4 years and barely made it into the 3rd layer.\u201dSun Dazhu blinked a few times. He seemed to remember why he had accepted Wang Lin as his disciple. He remembered that he was going to wait until this disciple reached the first layer and use the soul searching technique, but after hesitating for a while, he decided to give up. After all, it had been so many years, and the backlash of lowering his own cultivation didn\u2019t seem to be worth it.Sun Dazhu glanced at Wang Lin and said, \u201cFine. Since you reached the 3rd layer now, you are a true disciple of Sun Dazhu, and since you are my only disciple, starting today, you can come back and live here again. In a few days, there will be the competition with Xuan Dao Zong. You can follow me there and broaden your horizons. Also, since you reached the 3rd layer, did you practice the attraction technique?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal as he replied, \u201cDisciple has practiced the attraction technique, but still feels very unfamiliar with it.\u201dSun Dazhu nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s natural. To be frank, these basic techniques are all about practice. The more you practice, the better you will be at it. Your master practiced it for a whole year and that could be considered the longest in the sect, see.\u201d As he was speaking, he moved his hand and a small colorful sword appeared and circled around the room before landing back in Sun Dazhu\u2019s hand.\u201cAfter practicing the attraction technique and reaching the second layer, one can start practicing the drive technique. The drive technique is what moves this sword. Of course, to reach this level, you must have at least have reached the 4th layer, but with the competition so close, we can\u2019t have you making a joke out of the sect. Your cultivation is low, so the chance of you going up is low, but you can\u2019t lose the sect any face. A flying sword can still be controlled with the attraction technique. I\u2019ll give you a token, so go to the sword shrine and pick out a good flying sword to wear and to show off at the competition.\u201d Sun Dazhu finished talking and tossed a token toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression became strange. He opened his mouth for a long time, but didn\u2019t know what to say.Seeing Wang Lin\u2019s expression becoming strange, Sun Dazhu snorted and said, \u201cDon\u2019t think of this as a small matter. You must look good, because if you make me lose face, I won\u2019t forgive you. Back then, your master did the same thing. Just holding a flying sword earned my master a lot of face.\u201dWang Lin wryly smiled and said, \u201cDisciple will definitely look fierce, master. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 \u2013 WealthSun Dazhu nodded his head in satisfaction and said, \u201cYou can keep this token. It will allow you to freely enter and exit this garden. But remember, you aren\u2019t allowed to touch any of the herbs without my permission.\u201dWang Lin nodded. He knew that Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t like him, but seeing how he had already reached the 3rd layer, Sun Dazhu at least recognized him as a disciple. Wang Lin respectfully left.Not long after, he arrived at the sword pavilion in the main courtyard. He was here many years ago, and being here again made him remember the scene from back then.Outside the sword pavilion sat a disciple in white. He looked like he was 30 years old and kinda chubby. Wang Lin didn\u2019t recognize him, so it seemed he didn\u2019t participate in the intense training.He looked at Wang Lin and exclaimed, \u201cJunior brother, you are only at the 3rd layer. What are you doing here? This is a place only disciples of the 4th layer or higher can enter.\u201dWang Lin remained silent. He took out the token Sun Dazhu gave him and tossed it over.After the fat disciple received the token, his face became strange, as if he was trying to hold back a smile. Soon, he couldn\u2019t hold it back any longer and burst out laughing. \u201cIt seems to be Elder Brother Sun\u2019s tradition. I had forgotten about this. Elder Brother Sun has this tradition that at everyone competition with another sect, he likes to show off a flying sword.\u201dWang Lin became embarrassed, especially thinking about Sun Dazhu\u2019s serious expression before. He warily smiled.The fat man laughed for a long time. He forced down his laughter and waved his hand saying, \u201cJunior brother, you can go. I recommend the sword 3 from the right. That flying sword is really amazing. The first time I saw it, I thought it was the most amazing flying sword in the country of Zhao.\u201dWang Lin quickly thanked the man and made his way toward the pavilion. When he was 5 meters away, he suddenly detected waves of energy from the pavilion, seemingly to try to prevent him from entering.Seeing this, the fat man realized that he forgot to turn off the formation set around the pavilion. He wanted to tell Wang Lin, but right when he was about to speak, he suddenly stopped as if there was a fishbone stuck in his throat. His eyes grew large and stared at Wang Lin with a look of disbelief.Wang Lin felt the resistance and remembered the shame from back then. He snorted and kept moving forward, 5 meters, 4 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters, 1 meter!Despite the resistance increasing, it wasn\u2019t able to stop Wang Lin at all and he easily stepped into the sword pavilion. After entering the room, he used his divine sense and found that the room he was currently in was very strange. It seemed his divine sense was restricted to only 3 meters in range.The fat man immediately jumped up with a shocked expression on his face. He was the disciple in charge of managing the sword pavilion, so he knew the power of the formations very well. Not to mention inner disciples, but lot of the elders couldn\u2019t force their way in like Wang Lin just had.Only when recruiting disciples was the power of the formation weakened hundreds of folds, so that the swords\u2019 energy could be released to see if there were any matches.\u201cIs the formation broken?\u201d The fat man couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. He think the formation had to be broken, so he moved up to test it himself.Just when he entered the 5 meter range, he felt a very strong pressure that made him feel like he was a leaf in the turbulent sea. He was mercilessly thrown out. His body flew black and made an arc as he fell. He coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood after he landed on the ground. After a long time, he recovered his senses. His was face filled with fear. He exclaimed, \u201cNot\u2026 not broken!\u201dWang Lin easily entered the room. Once inside, he saw that there were many flying swords of various lengths, all releasing powerful sword intent.Wang Lin scanned each sword one by one without stopping, until he finally saw the sword that the fat man said was the most amazing looking sword in the country of Zhao.Aftering seeing it, Wang Lin was speechless. It could really be considered the most amazing looking flying sword. It shouldn\u2019t really even have been regarded as a flying sword, but more like a rectangular sign.It was two palms wide, 1 meter long, and the whole body shined with a golden light. The reason for the golden light was not because this was some sword with a magical spell, the golden light was there because the entire sword was coated with gold.Also don\u2019t think that the coat of gold was there just to hide some amazing sword under, it was just regular iron.On the handle were two large diamonds, and even the sword tassel was made from thin strips of gold.In short, taking this sword out to show people would really amaze them, and maybe even make them think it was an amazing sword.Wang Lin stroked his chin. He is really optimistic about the sword. If anything else, at least if he ever needed money in the future, he can sell it for a lot of money.On the flying sword there was a sign that read, \u201cThis sword\u2019s name is Wealth. It was made by a sect elder 500 years ago and said to have unimaginable power. But in reality, this sword has been broken and rebuilt many times. However, because the elder had done much for the sect, his last will was to leave the sword here in hopes that it finds someone fitting in the future.\u201d\u201cWhoever chooses this sword must treat it well. If it breaks, it must be immediately repaired. If it\u2019s sold, then the person who sold it will be kicked from the sect!\u201dWang Lin couldn\u2019t hold in his laughter. He picked up the sword and said, \u201cI\u2019ll chose you then, but I, Wang Lin, am a poor man, so if you break, don\u2019t expect me to put you back together!\u201dAfter putting the flying sword away in his bag of holding, he left the room. The fat man outside looked nervous. Instead of the mocking laughter from before, he respectfully sent Wang Lin off.Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense was restricted inside the pavilion, so he didn\u2019t see what happened to the fat man, so he was surprised at why the fat man suddenly became so respectful.After returning to Sun Dazhu\u2019s garden, Wang Lin took out the sword. Sun Dazhu was stunned, and after mumbling to himself for a while, he glanced thoughtfully at Wang Lin and said, \u201cWhen I saw this sword before, I didn\u2019t have the guts to take it, but it seems you have guts. Good. Take this sword with you to the competition in three days and show it off to the elders.\u201dThree days later, the bell in the Heng Yue Sect rang nine times. It echoed for a very long time through the mountain. The head, all the elders, and many disciples all stood outside the main hall.They saw a black dot appear in the sky. The black dot got closer and closer to them, until they saw it was a thousand foot long centipede. The centipede was completely black. It seemed to step on black clouds as it thunderously roared towards them.All of the Heng Yue Sect inner disciples took a deep breath their eyes filled with fear. Some of the female disciples\u2019 faces became pale and their legs became weak.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about it? Although this thousand foot long centipede looks scary, if everyone here struck it with a sword, it will still die!\u201d The red faced man next to the sect head shouted. His voice was very loud. It seemed he wanted the people on the centipede to hear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 GuestAnother elder stared at the centipede and whispered, \u201cHmph, the Xuan Dao Sect is always like this, trying to bully my Heng Yue Sect because we don\u2019t have a spirit beast. If there is a chance, we must kill that spirit beast, then we\u2019ll see how they will show off.\u201dThe sect head coldly snorted. A purple sword suddenly appeared before him. The sword flew into the sky and became a giant purple dragon. It coiled above the Heng Yue Sect and roared at the centipede.The thousand foot centipede suddenly stopped and didn\u2019t dare to continue. Suddenly, a loud laugh could be heard from the top of the centipede.\u201cHuang Long, it is rumored that this purple sword contains the soul of a dragon. It seems that that rumor is not fake. Friend, I\u2019m here now, and if we win again, the Heng Yue Sect must keep their promise and return the 137 treasures that were stolen from us, as well as give us 200 flying swords as compensation.\u201dThe sect head\u2019s expression remained normal. There was no trace of anger. He indifferently said, \u201cFriend Ouyang, if the Xuan Dao Sect wins this time, the Heng Yue Sect will naturally do as promised, but if you guys lose, then you must hold back on your technique to control spirit beasts.\u201dWhile he was speaking, the purple dragon slowly dissipated and turned back into a purple sword. It returned to sect head Huang Long\u2019s hand.The thousand foot centipede started to move forward again. It circled above the Heng Yue Sect as it slowly descended. The inner disciples all pulled back to make room.All of the elders had frowns on their faces from seeing the disciples recoiling.After the centipede landed, it remained motionless. Dozens of people jumped down from the centipede\u2019s back. Besides three elders, everyone else was very young.The Xuan Dao Sect had both male and female disciples. It seemed like they were making fun of the Heng Yue Sect because they knew that the Heng Yue Sect didn\u2019t have many purple clothed disciples, so every one of them was wearing purple. Another thing that surprised the Heng Yue Sect disciples was that every single Xuan Dao Sect disciple was good looking. The males were very handsome and the females were all very beautiful.Especially the male and females disciple in the front. The male was extraordinarily handsome and full of masculinity. His long sleeves and hair fluttered in the wind, with a flying sword on his back that made him look even cooler. His appearance completely enchanted a few of the female inner disciples.The female disciple wore full purple with hair long like a waterfall, bright red lips, and with beautiful eyes could move anyone\u2019s heart. Even Wang Lin couldn\u2019t stop his heart from beating faster when he saw her. He became very surprised as he carefully looked at her and quickly became more cautious.Seeing all the disciples with memorized looks in their faces, one of the elders finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and shouted, \u201cWhen did the Xuan Dao Sect started practicing charm arts? It is simply too despicable.\u201dThis shout quickly awakened many of the inner disciples. All of them had a surprised expressions.One of the three elders of the Xuan Dao Sect laughed and said, \u201cThis must be elder Dao Xu. My name is Qin Gu Lei. You should take a closer look. My two disciples here didn\u2019t practice any charm arts, but were born with water spirit roots. I can see that among all of the Heng Yue Sect disciples, none of them are of such a pure spirit root. All of them are a mixture of all 5 elements. No wonder you can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201dAll of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s elder\u2019s expressions became unsettled. After a long time, sect head Huang Long\u2019s expression remained the same as he changed the subject and said, \u201cFriends of the Xuan Dao Sect, first, rest at our sect. The competition will begin in three days.\u201dElder Ouyang nodded. Smiling, he said, \u201cVery good, our Xuan Dao Sect has had these competitions with the Heng Yue Sect for many years, but although there are some disputes, there is no need to hurt our relationship.\u201dAmong the many elders of the Heng Yue Sect, a very old man walked out. His face was full of wrinkles and he somewhat looked like he had no energy. He lightly chuckled and said to Ouyang, \u201cGood friend Ouyang. It\u2019s been 20 years, do you still remember me?\u201dElder Ouyang laughed out loud and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already seen you, old friend Song Dao You. This time, you must let me have some more of your homemade wine. I didn\u2019t have enough because you were too stingy last time. You only brought out one jar!\u201dElder Song smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m stingy, it\u2019s that when you start drinking wine, it\u2019s too scary. No matter how many jars I bring out, it\u2019s not enough.\u201dAs the two started talking, the other two elders of the Xuan Dao Sect found familiar faces and started chatting as if the unfriendly words before were never said.As they talked about things that were happening in cultivation world of the country of Zhao, the eyes of the disciples of both sects were really opened.Things like: the Wu Feng Sect had a male disciple that seduced the Misty Sect\u2019s head female disciple and made her pregnant. The Mist Sect\u2019s head went to the Wu Feng Sect for justice, but came back with a baby.Or like the Heaven Sect, where some disciples abandoned the sect and joined the He Huan Sect. After some of them started to spread the benefits of joining the He Huan Sect, more and more disciples abandoned the Heaven Sect. This made the Heaven Sect\u2019s head so mad, that he sent out a kill order for any disciple that abandoned the sect.Or about some genius baby being born, and finally about the Misty Sect\u2019s Core Formation expert\u2019s birthday being in a few months, so all the friendly sects would send people to attend and such.Wang Lin listened for a long time and started to have a very blurred impression of the cultivation world in the country of Zhao. At one point, he suddenly felt someone looking at him. He turned his head and saw that female disciple from the Xuan Dao Sect looking at him a faint smile on her face.Wang Lin nodded his head and secretly put up his guard. He didn\u2019t believe that he had the charm to attract someone\u2019s attention among all the disciples present.Liu Mei was the leader of the inner disciples at the Xuan Dao Sect and was very confident in her innate charm ability. Within the Xuan Dao Sect, almost no one her age could resist. But that ordinary looking youth was the first to recover, which surprised her. She couldn\u2019t help but take a few more looks, but no matter how she looked at Wang Lin, he was only at the 3rd layer and was nothing out of the ordinary.As the elders talked, the disciples of the two sects also started to chat with each other to prepare for the competition that was to come. All of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples seemed to have a mysterious fog that hid their cultivation level.Wang Lin was also surprised that he became interested in the Xuan Dao Sect. This technique seemed similar to the disguise pill, but on a higher level.The Heng Yue Sect disciples seemed to focus all their attention on that male and female, all of them with their own ideas, but Wang Lin noticed a strange phenomenon; all of the disciples of the Xuan Dao Sect, from the looks in their eyes, all seemed to shown signs of respect to a middle aged man in the back.After giving that person a thoughtful look, Wang Lin withdrew his gaze, lowered his head, and remained silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 CentipedeThe Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples were also all secretly evaluating the Heng Yue Sect disciples, especially the ones who were at the 6th layer and higher. Wang Zhuo\u2019s looks and his peak 5th layer cultivation also made the Xuan Dao Sect disciples keep him in mind.As for Wang Lin, he was only at the 3rd layer, so they completely ignored him.Everyone aside from Liu Mei that is. She paid a little attention to him.As the two sect\u2019s elders talked to each other, they were also secretly looking at each other\u2019s disciples. The Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s three elders became more and more happy as they saw the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s disciples. They thought that if these were all the disciples the Heng Yue Sect had, they would win this exchange for sure.But they had secretly been in conflict with the Heng Yue Sect for many years and knew that they were very cunning. They would save the killing blow until the most crucial moment. Even though there were quite a few disciples of the 6th layer present, all of them were new faces, and all the ones that participated last time weren\u2019t in sight.Those were the people who they needed to focus on during this exchange.The sect head, Huang Long, scanned the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples. His gaze paused on the male and female with the pure water spirit roots. He secretly sighed in his heart. In the past 500 years, the Heng Yue Sect had really fallen without a successor. Even the Xuan Dao Sect, which was an unknown, small sect only 500 years ago could constantly beat the Heng Yue Sect. He originally thought that they would win this time, but two single element spirit root disciples had appeared this time, which made him very worried.\u201cDo we really need the purple clothed disciples to come out? They are currently in training\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Huang Long\u2019s gaze fell on the disciple all the way in the back and he finally made a decision.\u201cFine. Since they sent this disciple, then it\u2019s time for our core disciples to come out as well.\u201dThinking about this, he laughed and said, \u201cFriend Ouyang, the disciples must be tired from the trip. Let them go rest first. Us few old guys should have a good time. Come into the main hall.\u201d He waved his hand to welcome them into the main hall with a smile on his face.Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s three elders nodded and followed him into the main hall.The Heng Yue Sect\u2019s elders followed in behind them. Elder Xu was the last one. He turned to the disciples and said, \u201cWang Zhuo, you\u2019re in charge of taking care of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples. If there are any issues, teacher won\u2019t forgive you!\u201dWang Zhuo seemed to be prepared for this. He respectfully said, \u201cTeacher doesn\u2019t have to worry. I will properly take care of Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s fellow apprentice-brothers and sisters.\u201dElder Xu smiled at the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples and said, \u201cDisciples of the Xuan Dao Sect, if you have any needs, you can ask Wang Zhuo. This old man is old, so I won\u2019t bother you young ones. You all should get to know each other more. The future of the cultivation world belongs to you all.\u201d After he finished speaking, he walked into the main hall with a faint smile.The moment the elders left, the disciples immediately became more relaxed. Some of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s female disciples went up to the male with the water spirit root and started to make small talk. Their eyes were filled with admiration.Besides the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s 6th layer disciples appeared some Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples. They made small talk about their experiences.As for the other disciples, they all started to talk with each other. There were also many disciples who looked up to the unmoving centipede in amazement.Wang Lin looked at the scene and didn\u2019t want to join in. He went off to the side and sat down on some steps. Looking at the blue sky and white clouds while bathing in the sunlight felt very comfortable.There were many other disciples like Wang Lin that didn\u2019t like the crowds, like the female named Zhou. She saw Wang Lin and casually walked over.\u201cJunior brother Wang, I want to congratulate you on reaching the 3rd layer. There aren\u2019t many inner disciples as hardworking as you.\u201d The female named Zhou said with a smile. She sat down on the steps without a caring if it was dirty or not.Wang Lin chuckled. He shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like what you said at all. I see that most of these people are painstakingly cultivating as well.\u201dThe female named Zhou looked at the clouds. She sighed and said, \u201cJunior brother Wang, don\u2019t sell yourself short. During the 4 year of intense training, almost all the inner disciples came out very often, but I rarely saw you. Cultivation is a very boring thing to do. Junior brother Wang, to be honest, I admire you. To reach the 3rd layer in 4 years takes a lot of perseverance!\u201dWang Lin rubbed his nose and smiled, \u201cSenior Sister Zhou, didn\u2019t you also reach the 3rd layer?\u201dThe female named Zhou sighed and gloomily said, \u201cI reached the 3rd layer three years ago, but now, all the disciples who were weaker than me back then have surpassed me. Maybe it\u2019s because I can\u2019t cut off my mortal ties.\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while and said, \u201cThe road is ruthless. If senior sister Zhou wants to advance, you must understand this phrase.\u201dThe female named Zhou looked at Wang Lin with her beautiful eyes. Revealing her beautiful teeth, she said, \u201cJunior brother Wang, I can see that you have already reached the peak of the 3rd layer and can break through at any time. I think that you will soon surpass me too.\u201dWang Lin stared at the breathtaking beauty. He wryly smiled and said, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to break through any time soon. These mortal ties aren\u2019t something I can cut easily.\u201dThe female named Zhou was stunned. She hesitated and asked, \u201cJunior brother Wang, it\u2019s rude of me to ask, but what mortal ties can you not cut?\u201dWang Lin shook his head and didn\u2019t answer. His mind was filled with thoughts about his parents.The female named Zhou saw that Wang Lin was reluctant to answer. She sighed and said, \u201cI can\u2019t cut the ties with my family. Cultivation is too ruthless. Maybe I\u2019m not fit for this.\u201dWang Lin was about to speak, but he suddenly turned his head and saw Wang Zhuo staring at him and the female name Zhou with an evil gaze.At that moment, they heard Wang Zhuo\u2019s voice. \u201cBrothers and sisters of the Xuan Dao Sect, you all said this centipede likes to eat live animals. Let us, the Heng Yue Sect, take care of it for you during your stay. I have a junior brother, you see. Cultivation is just a waste of time for him, so making him catch live animals to feed this centipede is a much more fitting job for him.\u201dThe male disciple with the water spirit root hesitated and said, \u201cBrother Wang Zhuo, this is a bit improper. The centipede\u2019s nature is wild. If a stranger were feed it, that person might be in danger.\u201dWang Zhuo said, with a gentle expression, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother Liu. How could a cultivator back down because of danger? You are our guests. These chores should be left to us, the Heng Yue Sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2013 Centipede\u2019s PoisonSome of Wang Zhuo\u2019s companions agreed and one of them said, \u201cThis is true. Friends of the Xuan Dao Sect, leave it to us.\u201dAll of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples hesitated. The disciple named Liu wanted to use the elders as an excuse, but at that moment, the middle aged man in the back lightly coughed. The disciple named Liu\u2019s face twitched. He nodded and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we will trouble the Heng Yue Sect.\u201dWang Zhuo smiled. He turned toward Wang Lin and loudly yelled, \u201cJunior brother Wang Lin, the job of feeding the centipede will be left to you. You need to be careful.\u201dHearing Wang Zhuo\u2019s words, all of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples turned their heads to look at Wang Lin. They all had strange expressions on their faces. How could they still not understand the meaning behind it all? This Wang Lin must have offended Wang Zhuo.Among the Heng Yue Sect disciples, one person laughed and said, \u201cI was wondering who brother Wang Zhuo was talking about. As I expected, it\u2019s junior brother Wang Lin.\u201dSomeone else continued, \u201cThis job is really fitting for him. With his lack of talent, it\u2019s really a waste of time for him to cultivate. There is no chance for him to compete in the exchange.\u201d\u201cThere really is no one else more fitting for these chores than him. Junior brother Wang Lin, you must do your job properly and not lose the Heng Yue Sect any face.\u201dHearing the laughter, the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples understood that not only had Wang Lin offended Wang Zhuo, but, because of his lack of talent, had also became the target of mockery among the other disciples.This kind of thing happened in every sect, so it was not a big deal. As a result, all of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples categorized Wang Lin as trash.The female named Zhou that was sitting next to Wang Lin frowned. She shot Wang Zhuo a disgusted look. She whispered to Wang Lin, \u201cJunior brother Wang Lin, if I hadn\u2019t come, he wouldn\u2019t have targeted you. I\u2026\u201dWang Lin shook his head. Wang Zhuo hadn\u2019t just been targeting him for a few days. Ever since the first day they met and onwards, Wang Zhuo had always made an effort to ridicule him. The rest of the sect had looked down on him due to the fact that he got accepted by trying to commit suicide and then became an inner disciple due to Elder Sun.Most importantly, he was only at the 3rd layer, making him the weakest among these disciples.Power was everything. Wang Lin eyed the thousand foot centipede that was lying on the ground. He didn\u2019t care and pretended like he hadn\u2019t heard any of itNot long after, Wang Zhuo assigned a few disciples to lead the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples to their rooms to rest.The Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciple with the water spirit roots named Liu glanced at Wang Lin before he left and gently said, \u201cYou must be brother Wang Lin. Our Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s centipede has a wild nature. When you feed it, you mustn\u2019t get too close, or you will be injured.\u201dWang Zhuo looked at Wang Lin with a cold smile. He didn\u2019t bother him anymore after that. Soon, everyone dispersed from outside the main hall.The female named Zhou frowned. She talked with Wang Lin for a bit more, then left.Looking at the deserted area, Wang Lin stood up and walked toward the centipede. He stopped 10 feet away from it and carefully examined the spirit beast.Upon a closer look, this thousand foot centipede was an enormous beast. The body was formed by many sections, and between each section were rings with thorns pointing out like countless swords. There were also faint black spots all over its body, and its head had two massive pincers sticking out.In addition, what attracted the most attention were the two long red whiskers that moved without wind, as if they were two very long snakes.As if it knew Wang Lin was looking at him, it opened and closed its eyes, giving Wang Lin a cold glance. Wang Lin immediately felt a cold sensation sweep by.Wang Lin\u2019s body felt cold, but the movement of spirit power in his body immediately dispersed the coldness.The thousand foot centipede revealed a surprised expression. It gave Wang Lin a deep and thoughtful look, then closed its eyes and ignored Wang Lin. Wang Lin revealed an interested expression. No wonder this was a spirit beast, it even had human-like expressions.While musing this, he left at a brisk pace for the mountains. Using his divine sense, he easily captured some small animals and came back.Along the way, Wang Lin saw some of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples being lead by some senior disciples. When they saw Wang Lin with the small animals in his hands, they laughed, which drew the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples\u2019 attention.One of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s female disciples, who looked very pretty, with a face that looked so delicate, it felt as if it could be broken by a drop of water, laughed. \u201cJunior brother, all of those small animals you caught won\u2019t be enough to feed the thousand foot centipede. You should go catch a large worm. Those are the centipede\u2019s favorite.\u201dOne of the inner sect disciples immediately tried to suck up and said \u201cJunior sister Ouyang, this dumb kid is like a mute. There is no need to talk to him. You didn\u2019t know this, but he isn\u2019t qualified to cultivate. He failed all of the entrance tests and then tried to commit suicide, which forced the elders to accept him as an honorary disciple.\u201dWang Lin was familiar with the person who talked. He was the one that ridiculed him back during the training period, Sun Hao.Someone from the Xuan Dao Sect quickly asked, \u201cHonorary disciple? But I see him wearing red. He should be the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s inner disciple.\u201dSun Hao loudly laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet. This kid used some lowly method to gain the favor of one of the elders and was quickly raised to an inner disciple. But even so, with his talent, he will only be laughed at for the rest of his life.\u201dWang Lin glanced at them and left. He arrived back near the centipede and threw the small animals next to it.The moment the small beasts saw the centipede, they immediately fell to the ground, trembling in fear.The centipede opened its eyes and didn\u2019t even look at the small animals. He spat out a black gas. The moment the black gas touched the small animals, there was a sizzling sound.In a blink of an eye, the small animals turned into a pool of blood. The centipede sucked the blood into its mouth.Wang Lin took a few steps back. His eyes lit up. Centipedes typically contain poison, and these poisons were their greatest weapon.As a child, he read a book that mentioned that the poison of a centipede was related to its size. Simply said, the larger the centipede, the stronger the poison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 Old FriendThe centipede before him was one hundred feet long. The poison it contained must have reached an unimaginable level. Wang Lin wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with centipedes. Many of the children caught centipedes to play with, and many used them to feed their chickens.Sometimes, they would accidentally be bitten by the centipede, but all they needed to do was wash the wound with a lot of water, then at most lay in bed for a few days and they would be fine.There was even a time where he collected centipedes for their poison. The doctor at the village said that if the centipedes\u2019 poison was used properly, it could be used to cure illnesses. In the early days, his father couldn\u2019t afford to buy wood for his work, so he went up to the mountains to chop wood and let the cold air enter his body. This caused him to almost lose his life.At that time, the prescription made by the doctor contained centipede poison.Although his father\u2019s illness was cured, the illness left its roots in his father\u2019s body. Every time it rained, his father would be in a lot of pain. The prescription the doctor gave to help with the pain contained centipede poison as well, so Wang Lin had caught a lot of centipedes for his father.Until now, Wang Lin still remembered what happened back then.Looking at the hundred foot centipede, Wang Lin stroke his chin. If the small centipedes\u2019 poison could help his dad\u2019s illness, then the poison from this centipede might just remove the root of the problem once and for all.But the centipede before him was simply too large, and Wang Lin was just too small compared to it. He was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get any poison and hurt himself in the process.Suddenly, Wang Lin remembered a method for obtaining centipede poison. This method was passed down through the generations. It was to make a pill to feed to the centipede. Once the centipede consumed said pill, it would spit out poison.Thinking about it, he stared at the centipede and walked toward the pill house. The pill house contained the most materials in the sect. He also hadn\u2019t seen Wang Hao in 4 years, so it would be good to check up on him.It was already getting dark when Wang Lin arrived at the pill house and saw Wang Hao carefully exiting from the side door. Wang Hao saw Wang Lin and gestured him to be silent. He motioned him to go outside.Wang Lin was stunned. He sent out his divine sense and found the 3rd elder staring at the pill furnace with a serious expression on his face.After walking away for a while, Wang Hao saw that Wang Lin had silently followed him out. He grabbed Wang Lin and quickly ran. After running away for a while, he finally let out a breath.Wang Hao was short of breath. He warily looked toward the pill house and quickly asked, with a glint of hope, \u201cWang Lin, I heard you went to the intense training four years ago. What layer are you at now?\u201d\u201cThe 3rd layer\u2026what is this?\u201d Wang Lin scanned Wang Hao with his divine sense and found that Wang Hao was already at the first layer, but the spiritual energy in his body was very strange. The spiritual energy wasn\u2019t flowing properly, but moving in an odd path.Every time the flow circulated through Wang Hao\u2019s body, it would take away a bit of Wang Hao\u2019s life essence from his organs and absorb it.In this state, Wang Lin was afraid that it wouldn\u2019t be long before Wang Hao ran out of life essence and died.Wang Hao bitterly smiled and said, \u201cYou saw through it?\u201dWang Lin nodded and said, \u201cWang Hao, tell me what this is about.\u201dWang Hao tightened his fist and said, while grinding his teeth, \u201cBack when we went to the exchange, I always regretted not being able to get the Foundation Establishment pill. Later, master, bah, Lu Yunie gave me a Foundation Establishment pill to repay me for being his helper. I was very surprised at the time. He also gave me a cultivation method and told me that it was better than the one the sect gives. I didn\u2019t think too much about it and cultivated with it.\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath and asked, \u201cWhat? Let me see!\u201dWang Hao took out a thread bound book and threw it to Wang Lin. He continued, \u201cBut after I practiced it for 2 years, my body became weaker. Although I can manage to condense spirit power in my body, I can\u2019t use it. Later, I secretly bribed a disciple to look it up for me and found that the cultivation method Lu Yunjie gave me is called Fire Furnace Trial.\u201dWang Lin opened the book and looked through it. The more he read, the more shocked he became. What was in the book was completely different from what was inside The Three Layers of Qi Condensation. Instead of using the spiritual energy to refine the body, it gathered spiritual energy into a swirl. This swirl would expand as one gathered spirit power, and it would soon be able to absorb the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth to refine the body from the outside, achieving something similar to Qi Condensation.In simple terms, Qi Condensation was to slowly refine the body from the inside.And the latter was a high handed method. If one was lucky, the swirl would expand outside the body before the body collapsed and achieve Qi Condensation, and if not, then the body would be destroyed before the swirl expanded to outside the body.Wang Hao said, with his teeth grinding, \u201cThis Fire Furnace Trail cultivation method, the archives in the sect held some copies of this. It is said to have been obtained from the extinct country of Lu. Only 2 out of 10 cultivators would survive using this method. It\u2019s all based on luck.\u201dWang Lin asked the important question, \u201cWhat benefit would Lu Yunjie gain from all this?\u201dWang Hao\u2019s eyes grew cold. He darkly said, \u201cHe wants to use me as a pill furnace. When the disciple of the archives gave me the information, it was recorded that the moment someone dies from cultivating the Fire Furnace Trial, if a certain method is used, a pill that extends one\u2019s life for 3 years can be created.\u201dWang Lin took in a cold breath and thought that this 3rd elder Lu Yunjie was too cruel.Wang Hao\u2019s expression was bitter. He harshly said, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to talk about this with the other elders and the sect head, after all, I\u2019m Lu Yunjie\u2019s helper. Under the sect rules, my life is no longer mine, but Lu Yunjie\u2019s. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to be his helper. Ah, it is too late to regret it now. Lu Yunjie found out that I know the secret and threatened me with my parents. Now, I have no control over my life. Every day I must take several Qi Gathering pills and the swirl in my body grows larger by the day. Based on my calculations, I only have about a year left to live.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 Li ShanWang Lin pondered for a while and said, \u201cWhat plans do you have? Do you need my help for anything?\u201dWang Hao sighed and said, \u201cYou are only at the 3rd layer. You can\u2019t help me because Lu Yunjie is already at the 6th layer. Also, because he can produce pills, he is loved by the elders. I have already given up hope. Wang Lin, in these few years at the Heng Yue Sect, you are my only friend and my big brother. If you become stronger in the future, you have to avenge me!\u201d Wang Hao tightened his fists after he finished speaking.Wang Lin stared at Wang Hao and nodded.Wang Hao bitterly smiled and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, did you need me for something? While I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019ll help you as much as I can. Do you want some Qi Gathering pills? I have a lot of them.\u201dWang Lin looked at Wang Hao. He gave up on asking Wang Hao for the materials he needed and shook his head. He wanted to help Wang Hao, but the enemy was at the 6th layer. Wang Lin was not confident at all.Although his divine sense was different from others\u2019 and he had practiced the attraction technique for more than 20 years, he had never fought with any other human, so he couldn\u2019t say for sure how strong he was.Wang Hao saw that Wang Lin stayed silent. He bitterly patted his clothes and said, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, you have more talent than I do. Thinking back to when we were taking the test, it feels like a dream. Time passes by too quickly\u2026.\u201d Wang Hao sighed and turned to leave with a gloomy expression. He slowly disappeared from Wang Lin\u2019s view.\u201cIn this cultivation world, the strong prey on the weak\u2026.\u201d Wang Lin pondered this deeply in his heart as he stared at the sky.At that moment, Wang Lin had an epiphany.The so called epiphany wasn\u2019t one where he suddenly gained understanding and his cultivation suddenly increased, but more like knowledge being poured into one\u2019s brain. What was increased here wasn\u2019t one\u2019s cultivation or soul, but one\u2019s understanding of heaven and earth.Realizing the cruel nature of the cultivation world was his epiphany. To be a cultivator, one must have the attitude of a cultivator.Wang Lin mumbled as he let out a sigh, \u201cIs the strong preying on the weak really the mentality a cultivator must have?\u201dHis body moved and he disappeared from where he was.When he was on his way back to the herb garden, Wang Lin\u2019s expression suddenly changed as he looked at the guest rooms that the Xuan Dao Sect disciples were staying at and thoughtfully walked toward it.Before he even entered, he heard an exaggerated voice from inside.\u201cI have to say, brothers of the Heng Yue Sect, this flying sword I have is one of the peerless treasures of the Xuan Dao Sect. It is called the Noon Money Sword. You guys ask around yourselves to know how much trouble I spent stealing this sword. If any of you wants to buy this, then you have to make a vow to not use this in the exchange in 3 days, or I\u2019m not selling it.\u201dSomeone immediately asked, with doubt, \u201cIs this treasure really as amazing as you say it is?\u201d\u201cI, Li Shan, would never lie. If you guys don\u2019t believe me, then forget it. I can sell this flying sword anywhere.\u201dWang Lin already found this place to be unusual, as a lot of disciples from both sects were gathered here. When he walked closer, he saw a 20 something year old disciple of the Xuan Dao Sect holding a sword made of coins that was glowing blue, talking bombastically about the sword.The Xuan Dao Sect disciples in the surroundings all had weird expressions on their faces. One of them couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He coughed and said, \u201cWhat Junior Brother Li Shan said is correct. This Noon Money Sword is indeed a treasure of our Xuan Dao Sect, but I have to say that the one in Junior Brother Li Shan\u2019s hand is a fake. However, it still has some uses.\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciples talked among themselves. Then, a 5th layer disciple walked forward. Wang Lin remembered that this disciple was named Zhao. Disciple Zhao walked up to Li Shan and they talked among themselves until they made an exchange, both with smiles on their faces.Among the inner disciples, there were people who knew about the sword and mockingly said, \u201cIt is just a simple iron sword with some broken spirit gold and someone dared to try to sell it? It seems the Xuan Dao Sect is worth only so much.\u201dLi Shan immediately retorted, \u201cWhat this brother said is incorrect. My elder apprentice-brother even said that this was a fake, but your Heng Yue Sect still had someone who bought it. This type of thing is best to buy for the sake of novelty.\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciple who bought the sword laughed and said, \u201cBrother Li Shan, what you said is wrong. I didn\u2019t buy this sword to collect, but to give it to my dad. My family raises pigs, so this sword would be perfect for killing pigs.\u201dLi Shan didn\u2019t get mad and said, smiling, \u201cSince you already bought it, I don\u2019t care what you do with it. Ok, I still have another treasure. It\u2019s called the invincible dark stinking thunderball! This thing really is a treasure. I\u2019m not lying. We can even do a live test.\u201dWith that, he took out a black ball and threw it at a wall. With a boom, cracks appeared on the wall. There was a dark mist on the spot the ball hit and it emitted a foul odor.Li Shan said, with a proud and smiling face, \u201cHow is it? This invincible dark stinking thunderball is my own personal hidden weapon. Although the power isn\u2019t strong, if it lands on someone, this sludge is something even I can\u2019t wash off. Especially the smell, it\u2019s something I made after gathering dozens of beasts. Anyone would be disgusted by it.\u201dEveryone was stunned and stared at each other with their mouths wide open. A few of the female disciples pinched their noses and took a few steps back. Wang Lin was also surprised. He sent out his divine sense and his expression suddenly turned strange.The disciples of the Xuan Dao Sect all felt really awkward, but Li Shan was known in the Xuan Dao Sect for making weird things. No one dared to mess with him because no one wanted to get hit by one of those stink bombs.The invincible black sludge stink bomb was really famous in the Xuan Dao Sect. Secretly, it could almost match one of the sect\u2019s real treasures.\u201cSo how was it? This time, I\u2019m showing you all hidden my ace, but I still have to say the same thing I said before; you can\u2019t use it in the exchange in 3 days, or I won\u2019t sell it to you.\u201d Li Shan revealed a serious expression, but secretly laughed in his heart, \u201cYou silly brats, the more I say you mustn\u2019t use it, the more likely you guys will use it in the exchange. Hehe, there will be a good show to see. The elders will definitely praise me and even give me a few magical treasures.\u201dWith that, his eyes lit up and he began to shout.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 \u2013 Low LifeWith that, his eyes lit up and he began to shout.\u201cFellow brothers of the Heng Yue Sect, there is an old saying: \u201cKilling people only takes a nod of the head\u201d. But I have to ask everyone; how could killing people be as satisfying as disgracing them? By disgracing them, they would stink for 10,000 years. Think about it, when you are fighting with your rival and you use this, even if you don\u2019t win, you still come out with more face than them.\u201cOr when escaping, if you have this move, it also works wonders. If you run into a crowded area, how would he still have the face to chase after you?\u201d\u201cAlso, if you encounter a love rival, this could also be a deciding move. Hehe, if anyone dares to steal your woman, use this on them and then he would never have a chance as she would never want to be around the stink.\u201dLi Shan\u2019s advertising moved a lot of the inner sect disciples, especially when he talked about how it could be used against love rivals. That really resonated with some of the disciples.This thing was really a top quality item to get rid of love rivals.Li Shan\u2019s gaze turned shifted toward Wang Lin in the distance. He knew that Wang Lin was considered trash in the Heng Yue Sect. People like him were big customers for Li Shan. The trash back in the Xuan Dao Sect had already been cleaned out by him, so, when he saw Wang Lin, he excitedly continued:\u201cThis bomb is especially useful for brothers with lower cultivation. With this stink bomb in hand, who would dare to bully you again? If anyone dares to bully you, throw one at them. I, Li Shan, can promise you that you can walk tall in the sect without anyone daring to bother you.\u201d With that, Li Shan secretly laughed in his heart. No one daring to bully you was impossible. It was more like it would invite a beating.Li Shan saw that he had almost won many people over. He quickly tried to seal the deal. \u201cThis stink bomb is a really good self defense weapon for the people with lower cultivation. Today, I\u2019ll have a sale. Buy two, get one. Consider it a gift from me. When we meet again in the cultivation world, don\u2019t forget to take care of me.\u201dAmong the disciples that were moved by everything he said, one asked, \u201cIs this item really as amazing as you say? Take out a few more and let me randomly test one. If it\u2019s really that good, I\u2019ll buy a few to play with.\u201dLi Shan took out a dozen of the stink bombs from his bag of holding and gently placed them on the ground, as if he was afraid they would explode, and said, \u201cYou must keep in mind to be careful with this treasure. Gently pick it up and place it down. When using it, just toss it. When it meets any resistance, it will explode.\u201dThe inner disciple that had spoken up was Sun Hao.Sun Hao stepped up and randomly carefully picked up one of the stink bombs and examined it in his hand.Li Shan\u2019s expression remained normal, but he quietly mocked him in his heart. \u201cLittle brat, think you can understand it? Besides the sect\u2019s elders, not even the senior brothers are able to see through its secret.\u201dSun Hao looked at it for a long time and wasn\u2019t able to find anything special about the stink bomb. He threw the stink bomb into a distant clearing and as the bomb flew in an arc, the moment it was about to hit the ground, Li Shan thought in his mind, \u201cExplode!\u201dWith a bang, the stink bomb exploded, making the ground black and filled with a foul odor.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. No one knew that his divine sense had covered the area. When the stink bomb exploded, he detected a fluctuation of spirit power from Li Shan.When Li Shan threw the stink bomb the first time, it was the same. Wang Lin chuckled, but he didn\u2019t point it out and kept on watching.Li Shan said, smiling, \u201cHow was it? These stink bomb are really powerful right? But I, Li Shan, am an honest man, so I\u2019ll say the ugly stuff now. This treasure doesn\u2019t explode all the time. To make it explode requires a certain throwing technique. Once you guys have bought it, you can figure it yourself, so don\u2019t come to me about it.\u201dSun Hao walked up to Li Shan and whispered something to him. They walked over to the side and he took out quite a few things.Li Shan thought about it for a while and took out 10 stink bombs to exchange.Li Shan whispered, \u201cYou normally only get 3 free for buying 6, but since you are the first buyer, I\u2019ll throw in one more for free.\u201dAfter one person traded for them first and even tested it, a few other inner disciples came up and bought a few.Every time Li Shan finished his sale, he would always add a few words. Things like \u201cThis thing isn\u2019t guaranteed to succeed all the time\u201d, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, practice it a few more times.\u201d If there was any question, they could come and ask him and he could teach them the throwing technique.When saying this, Li Shan laughed in his heart, \u201cYou guys will try several times and fail, then try a different one and succeed after one or two tries. I\u2019m only going to be here for a few days, so by the time you guys suspect me, I\u2019ll be long gone.\u201dBut there were still many disciples who were cautious and didn\u2019t buy any.After a while, there were only a few stink bombs left. Li Shan proudly looked at the Heng Yue Sect disciples and thought, \u201cA bunch of idiots. Hmph, if you guys don\u2019t use it in the exchange in three days, then all you\u2019ll have done is get cheated by me, but if you do use it, then there will be something good to watch. These stink bombs are completely under my control. Other people can\u2019t even explode it using a hammer! I really can\u2019t wait for the exchange in three days.\u201dHis gaze swept the surroundings and he noticed Wang Lin\u2019s faint smile. He was stunned. His eyes turned and he said, \u201cBrother, why don\u2019t you buy a few to play with? With your cultivation, these are truly fitting for you. If anyone bothers you, just throw one at them.\u201dWang Lin looked at Li Shan and revealed a mocking expression.Li Shan was surprised. That look made him feel as if Wang Lin had seen through his secret. He carefully looked at Wang Lin and saw that Wang Lin was only at the 3rd layer. Being called trash couldn\u2019t have been for no reason, so he thought that it must\u2019ve been his own imagination.Wang Lin lightly smiled. He nodded and said, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll exchange for 2, but I don\u2019t have any treasures. Only talismans from the sect.\u201dLi Shan hesitated for the first time. He made sure Wang Lin was only at the 3rd layer before he finally relaxed and took out three stink bombs. He smiled and said, \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll give you face and sell them for talismans. Buy two, get one. These stink bombs will give you an extraordinary feeling, haha.\u201dFinished speaking, he thought, \u201cI\u2019m wasn\u2019t lying when I said it will be an extraordinary feeling. As long as you hold on to the stink bombs, even if you don\u2019t use it during the exchange, if I ever meet you again, I\u2019ll let you know what the extraordinary feeling is like. Something you will remember for life, haha.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Strange Old ManWang Lin put away the stink bomb and looked at Li Shan. He said, \u201dBrother Li Shan, I won\u2019t bother you anymore, so please continue selling.\u201dLi Shan nodded. He revealed a friendly expression and said, \u201cBrother, you must be careful with those stink bombs. Remember, they don\u2019t always work because they require a certain throwing technique. If you don\u2019t succeed, don\u2019t say I lied to you.\u201dWith that, he continued to tout to the other people.\u201cFellow brothers, I still have another treasure. This is a keepsake from the He Huan Sect. With this, you can go to the He Huan Sect to get a beautiful girl. This is something I got through a lot of painstaking effort, but I\u2019ll sell it based on our friendship. Fellow brothers of the Heng Yue Sect, you mustn\u2019t miss out on this chance.\u201dWang Lin chuckled. He turned around and headed back to the herb garden. Not long after, he had arrived at the garden. He scanned the garden and found that Sun Dazhu was not there, so he sat down cross legged in his room and took out the three stink bombs to examine them.After a long time, Wang Lin revealed an interested expression. These stink bombs appeared transparent under his divine sense, as if there were no secrets they could hide.To say it plainly, there was a trace of Li Shan\u2019s divine sense in the stink bombs that allowed him to detonate them at will.Wang Lin never knew that divine sense could be used like this. After carefully mimicking it, he overlapped the divine sense in the stink bombs with hisHe didn\u2019t destroy Li Shan\u2019s divine sense, but surrounded it. If he wished to, he could destroy it at any time.The use of divine sense on this stink bomb inspired Wang Lin. He pondered a little and took out the mysterious bead.\u201cIf divine sense can be used like this, can it be used the same way on the bead?\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and his divine sense quickly gathered on the mysterious bead.After a long time, Wang Lin frowned. The stone bead looked like it hadn\u2019t changed, and under his divine sense, it looked the same as always as well.He pondered for a moment, then he took the stone bead and left the herb garden. At the fastest speed, he went to a secluded place in the mountains and entered the dream space.The moment he entered, he knew that time was of the essence and he quickly spread out his divine sense.One minute, three minutes, ten minutes, thirty minutes\u2026There was no change. Wang Lin rubbed his chin and muttered, \u201cCan I really not leave my divine sense inside the mysterious bead?\u201dAt that moment, one of the glowing objects suddenly began to shine brightly, then finally dimmed.Wang Lin was stunned. Then, like a chain reaction, other glowing objects started to dim. Soon, all of the glowing objects in the dream space dimmed, until there was no light remaining and the dream space became completely dark.Wang Lin was shocked. He carefully observed for a long time and couldn\u2019t find anything unusual.An old voice suddenly appeared. \u201cI don\u2019t need to observe anymore. With your Spiritual Movement stage, trying to see through the heaven-defying bead is just wishful thinking!\u201dWang Lin was startled and his pupils shrank. He had been in the dream space for dozens of years and this was the first time he had heard someone else speak.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He suppressed the shock in his heart. He clasped his hands and respectfully said, \u201cJunior\u2019s name is Wang Lin, and senior is?\u201dWang Lin was a smart man. He didn\u2019t think that the person had suddenly appeared, but had been there all along and had observed him for the 30 years he had been in here.\u201cAs a junior of this small country, you don\u2019t have the need to know this old man\u2019s name. You used nearly 30 years of time with my help and the help of the stone bead, and only reached the Spiritual Movement stage. That is truly disappointing. Especially your perception. You only now thought of using your divine sense to scan the bead! Hmph!\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while. He had observed the stone bead with his divine sense before, but just hadn\u2019t observed for as long as now.\u201cYour way of doing things really annoys me. Cultivating is a heaven-defying act. If anyone goes against you, you should kill them. I have observed you in these few years that you been at this dog shit sect. If I were you, I would have killed all of them already. Hmph. If anyone dared to insult me, I would destroy them completely, especially that Wang Zhuo. He really gets on my nerves. With my temper, I would have taken his soul and thrown it into purgatory and then wiped out his family. I really like that Zhang Hu in your sect. Quite vicious. Also, that junior Liu really suits this old man\u2019s tastes\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression became odd. He wryly smiled, \u201cSenior, I\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me. I haven\u2019t finished speaking. Hmph, your small sect also has quite a few good looking ladies. You really don\u2019t know how to enjoy yourself. If it were me, I would have caught them and refined them for their soul. Hehe, the taste really makes me reminisce about the past. I haven\u2019t tasted it in over 30 years\u2026\u201dWang Lin was dumbfounded and couldn\u2019t speak for a long time.\u201cBrat, can you work a bit harder? Hurry up and reach the Soul Transformation stage so this old man can come out. Sigh\u201dWang Lin hesitated. He was somewhat confused and asked, \u201cSenior, what is Soul Transformation stage? Also what did you mean when you said I was at the Spiritual Movement stage.?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you think for yourself? Always asking about everything. Forget it! For a little cultivator from only a rank 3 cultivation country, even if you think until your head explodes, you won\u2019t figure it out. Hmph. Listen well brat, I\u2019m talking about the cultivation realm of a rank 5 cultivation country. In a rank 3 cultivation country like yours, there are only 4 realms: Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation and Nascent Soul. As for the Spirit Forming stage, it would be a thing of legends in your eyes.\u201d\u201cOnce someone reaches the Spirit Forming stage, then your country\u2019s rank will be increased to a rank 4 cultivation country. With that, the country will be provided the appropriate resources from the Cultivation Alliance and the country will also gain the right to fight for cultivation stars outside the country. The country would also need to undertake missions to protect the alliance.\u201d\u201cSimilarly, if a Soul Transformation appears in a rank 4 country, it would be raised to a rank 5 country and so on. As for the Spiritual Movement stage, it is a stage commonly used in rank 4 country or higher. It is similar to the Qi Condensation stage, but has a broader range.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 \u2013 Exchange (1)Wang Lin bitterly smiled and said, \u201cSoul Transformation is simply too far away for junior.\u201d\u201cBullshit. With me, who is from a rank 6 country, helping you, what is the Soul Transformation stage at all? Although I can\u2019t go out, I have been using my Nascent Soul Essence to help you cultivate for these past 30 years, otherwise, with your lack of talent, how could you have reached this stage in 30 years?\u201d\u201cAnd because you absorbed my Nascent Soul Essence, besides people on the same cultivation level as me, no one else can see through your cultivation.\u201d\u201cAlso, with the heaven-defying bead in your hands, what do you have to be afraid of? It took me painstaking effort to obtain this bead when it appeared in the cultivation alliance, resulting in me losing my body. My soul would\u2019ve destroyed if I hadn\u2019t escaped into this bead. Originally, I wanted to find another body to use, but this damned heaven-defying bead\u2026it seems that if someone without a body enters it, they can\u2019t leave.\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. When I first saw you, I wanted to take over your body, but this heaven-defying bead is like a cage that prevents me from leaving.\u201d\u201cI studied this bead for many years. This bead must have an owner before many of its effects can be used and I can be released.\u201d\u201cWhen I obtained this bead, I was being hunted, but I had some time to study it. It must absorb the essence of the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth before it would identify an owner. But even so, the owner has to have reached the Soul Transformation before they can get me out of here. Ah, little kid, show some compassion and cultivate faster! Then help me find a good body to use. I, Situ Nan, will remember your kindness, and with my protection, you can live a safe and comfortable life!\u201dAt the end, Situ Nan\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t as aggressive as before, but filled with regret.Wang Lin pondered a little. Right when he was about to speak, Situ Nan\u2019s voice came again.\u201cBrat, someone came. I\u2019ll help you leave.\u201dSuddenly, the tearing feeling appeared. Wang Lin\u2019s body shook and he opened his eyes.He sent out his divine sense and found two disciples, one male and one female, quietly walking toward Wang Lin\u2019s direction. About 30 meters away from Wang Lin, the two stopped and started to kiss and flirt with each other. Soon, they both took off all their clothes and their moans echoed in the surroundings.Wang Lin was very familiar with these two disciples. Both of them were at the back mountain. He curiously looked at them for a while, especially at the female disciple, before he reluctantly left.Back at home, Wang Lin thought about what Situ Nan had said. Wang Lin didn\u2019t fully believe his words, but he had really learned a lot about how the cultivation world worked. Wang Lin didn\u2019t believe he would lie about those things.Three days later, the exchange between the Heng Yue Sect and Xuan Dao Sect officially began.This was a long standing tradition between the two sects, so there wasn\u2019t too much fanfare. The location was set on the pine mountain peak of the Heng Yue Sect.An arched stone bridge connected the two peaks of the mountain. Wang Lin had seen the peak of Pine Peak Mountain from a distance, but could never get a clear look because of the clouds.Pine Peak Mountain was one of the important locations of the Heng Yue Sect. It had high spiritual energy density, like the back mountain, and was where the two Core Formation elders went to cultivate.On top of the Pine Peak was a large stone platform prepared for this exchange. It was surrounded by 8 large pillars of white jade with the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s 500 years of history carved onto them.After arriving here, a majestic air radiated from the white jade pillars and immediately transformed into killing intent that pierced the bones.\u201cFriend Huang Long, every time I see these white jade pillars, it feels different. No wonder this is a treasure of the cultivation country of Zhao.\u201d Old man Ouyang sighed and waved his hand to destroy the killing intent.Behind him, all of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples were shocked. In that moment, the killing intent made them feel as if they had entered a battlefield. They felt almost crushed by this feeling, until elder Ouyang dispersed it.\u201cFellow cultivator Ouyang, this is a treasure our founder personally made. Within 100 meters of the white pillars, any none Heng Yue Sect disciple will be pressured by a killing intent. I believe elder Ouyang understands, so please excuse us.\u201d Huang Long\u2019s face remained calm. His hand formed a seal and a gentle light shot out from the white jade pillars. Like large hands, the lights moved the clouds that covered the peak away. The killing intent also disappeared.Before him, all the inner disciples cracked their knuckles.Elder Ouyang turned and talked with the other two elders before saying, \u201cNo worries. According to the old rules, we will send the first person. Liu Feng, you can go!\u201dLiu Feng was the male with the pure water spirit roots. He smiled, then took a deep breath and arrived on the stage like lightning. He said, in a clear voice, \u201cXuan Dao Sect\u2019s Liu Feng asks the Heng Yue Sect for pointers.\u201dWang Lin stood behind Sun Dazhu with the flying sword on his back, wearing his red disciple clothes. He looked quite majestic.Sun Dazhu was very satisfied with his disciple\u2019s appearance. Ever since Wang Lin had reached the 3rd layer, whenever he looked at Wang Lin, he was no longer as annoyed as before. Although he was far from liking Wang Lin, he was at least starting to see Wang Lin as his disciple.Of course, all of this depended on whether or not Wang Lin could manage to get past the 3rd layer. If after 8 to 10 years Wang Lin was still stuck at the 3rd layer, then Sun Dazhu would probably hate Wang Lin again.In these three days, Wang Lin almost never left home. He spent most of that time in the dream space, talking with Situ Nan.After a number of conversions, he came to some understanding about Situ Nan. Situ Nan was the rank 6 country of Suzaku\u2019s number one expert. His cultivation was at an unimaginable level, he would kill anyone that annoyed him, steal anything he wanted, and was extremely arrogant.Because of the appearance of Liu Feng, the scene became very quiet. The sect head, Huang Long, looked at Liu Feng and said, \u201cZhao Long, you go!\u201dZhao Long was a very silent disciple. He was one of the disciples that had reached the 6th layer after the intense training.The Heng Yue Sect sent out a 6th layer disciple in the first round. This was a rare occurrence in the exchanges.Elder Ouyang didn\u2019t mind and said, \u201cLiu Feng, for this fight, I\u2019ll allow you to use 50% of your power.\u201dThe moment he said those words, the people of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s expressions all changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 \u2013 Exchange (2)\u201cToo showy. Apprentice-brother Zhao, beat him up and make the sect proud!\u201d\u201cLet that pretty face see how strong our Heng Yue Sect is. Go, brother Zhao!\u201d\u201cThe Xuan Dao Sect is too arrogant. Brother Zhao, you must make him look miserable! They even dared to say something like only use 50% of their power!\u201d\u201cThe Xuan Dao Sect is too cunning. They already have an excuse ready for when they lose. I\u2019ll be watching, brother Zhao! Go!\u201dAll of the Heng Yue Sect disciples were riled up. Those words by the Xuan Dao Sect Elder hurt their self-esteem.The elders of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s faces all darkened. They stayed silent, but theirs eyes became cold and their gazes toward the Xuan Dao Sect became less friendly.Sun Dazhu chuckled. He smiled and whispered to Wang Lin, \u201cDisciple, watch this carefully. This exchange will be more intense than before. This is the first time the Xuan Dao Sect has dared to be so arrogant.\u201dWang Lin looked around at the angry inner disciples and then looked at Liu Feng. There was still a layer of black fog on his body that prevented Wang Lin from seeing his cultivation level.Liu Feng stood on the stage and gently said, \u201cBrother Zhao, since our sect elder has spoken, I\u2019ll only use 50% of my power in this fight.\u201dZhao Long was of medium height. His complexion was dark and his body looked very strong. Instead of a cultivator, he looked more like a warrior in the mortal world.He cautiously looked at Liu Feng. He clasped his hands and said, \u201cBrother Liu, please!\u201d When he finished speaking, he took a step, then blooming white lotuses appeared one by one around him and floated around his body.Slivers of sword qi appeared on the white lotuses. Sounds of wind hitting Zhao Long\u2019s clothes could be heard, but there was no wind.Sect head Huang Long smiled. \u201cZhao Long\u2019s lotus blade has already reached the mid rank. Very good.\u201dThe red faced elder proudly said on the side, \u201cHaha, sect head, Zhang Long is my favorite disciple. His talent is very good and he is very hard working. This lotus blade is something he picked out himself from the sword pavilion. After 5 years, he has already reached the mid rank.\u201dElder Xu smiled and said to the surrounding disciples, \u201cThe lotus blade is known for its attack power. You inner disciples should take this opportunity to learn from him.\u201dWang Zhuo narrowed his eyes. He didn\u2019t show it on his face, but he thought, \u201cLotus blade? Hmph, I know it as well. Give me 5 years and I\u2019ll be stronger than him.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhao is usually so quiet. I didn\u2019t expect him to have already reached such a level with the lotus blade.\u201d Sun Hao secretly envied him and watched carefully.On the stage, Zhao Long shouted, \u201cBrother Liu, this lotus blade of mine is very powerful. You have to be careful.\u201dAt that moment, the lotuses floating around Zhao Long started to rapidly spin and sword qi rained down on Liu Feng.Liu Feng\u2019s expression remained calm. He quickly moved backward and formed a sign with this hand and shouted, \u201cWater screen!\u201d At that moment, the sky darkened and specks of light appeared. They were water droplets.The water droplets gathered like lightning in front of Liu Feng, forming a screen of water. It shined rainbow colors and looked very pretty.Elder Ouyang faintly smiled and said to the disciples behind him, \u201cHeng Yue Sect\u2019s Lotus Blade is a very hard technique to master. You all have to remember, if you meet this Lotus Blade, you mustn\u2019t try to take it head on, but avoid it, unless you\u2019re like Liu Feng, who has a pure water spirit root and can control the water at will.\u201dAll the disciples nodded in agreement, all except the middle aged man in the back, who had a look of disdain on his face.On the stage, the sword qi raining on Liu Feng hit the water screen. Zhao Long\u2019s face sank. This water screen was too strange. The moment the sword qi landed on it, they disappeared without any effect.He frowned and was about to use the same technique again, but he saw Liu Feng let out a smile. Liu Feng said, \u201cBrother Zhao, you try and take on this lotus blade!\u201dThe water rippled and sword qi shot out from the water screen toward Zhao Long. The same technique, the same sword qi.Zhao Long\u2019s expression changed. He quickly moved backwards, but the sword qi was too fast. He grinded his teeth and threw out yellow talismans from his bag of holding. The yellow talismans lit up without any fire and turned into a black mist.The sword qi landed on the black fog and dissipated. The black fog managed to block most of the sword qi before disappearing, but some sword qi still got through it and pierced Zhao Long\u2019s body.Zhao Long was launched into the air by the sword qi. He coughed out blood as he was flying in the air. He finally crashed into the ground. After struggling for a while, he failed to get up.There were many small holes throughout this body, however, none of them were that serious, so he wasn\u2019t in any life threatening danger.Liu Feng had a very proud expression on his face. He stepped off the stage and said, \u201cDisciple listened to teacher and only used 50% of his power on the water rebound.\u201dThe red faced elder quickly moved. His body turned into a red mist and landed next to Zhao Long\u2019s body. His expression darkened as he patted Zhao Long\u2019s body a few times and fed him some precious pills. After that, he said, \u201cA very good water screen reflect. Only someone of 8th layer or higher can break through it. My disciple isn\u2019t that strong yet, so defeat is normal!\u201dOne by one, the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples revealed looks of joy as they talked amongst each other.\u201cJust a 6th layer disciple and he thinks he can fight with brother Liu Feng. I knew instantly that we were going to win round 1.\u201d\u201cSo true. Brother Liu\u2019s water screen is very powerful, even the elder can\u2019t stop praising it. They must be dreaming if they think they can break it.\u201d\u201cTrue. The Heng Yue Sect\u2019s disciples are getting weaker year after year. In these past few days, I checked out the inner sect disciples and none of them are a threat to us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not completely true. None of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s purple clothed disciples have appeared yet. I heard from the elder that those are the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s core disciples.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2013 Exchange (3)Like the Xuan Dao Sect disciples, the Heng Yue Sect disciples had all joined in the last 20 years and had never seen such a bloody scene before.All of them remained silent and felt uneasy in their hearts.Sect head Huang Long\u2019s expression remained sullen. He stayed silent for a long time. He could easily see that this Liu Feng was at the 6th layer, but didn\u2019t expect him to have such a powerful technique. His water screen couldn\u2019t be broken unless the attacker was at least at the 8th layer.This was only the first round and it was already like this. There was bitterness in his heart. The Heng Yue Sect had really fallen. He looked at his fellow apprentice-brothers and saw that all of them had bitter expressions on their faces as well.Sun Dazhu sucked in a breath of cold air. \u201cMother f*cker! A disciple is even more powerful than me. How does the Xuan Dao Sect get disciples like this? How come I\u2019m not this lucky?\u201dWang Lin gave Liu Feng a deep look. He clearly saw what had happened. Although he was able to see through Liu Feng\u2019s cultivation when he used the water screen, Wang Lin was still shocked by the technique.Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s elder Ouyang smiled and loudly said, \u201cFriend Huang Long, in this second round, it\u2019s your turn to send out a disciple first.\u201dHuang Long\u2019s gaze swept across each inner disciple. Each of the disciples lowered their heads, hoping not to be selected.Seeing this, Huang Long became very angry. As he was about to speak, Sun Hao clenched his teeth and said, \u201cSect head, although disciple isn\u2019t a genius, I\u2019m willing to fight in the second round.\u201dThe few elders\u2019 expressions all changed, and elder Xu frowned and said, \u201cSun Hao, you are only at the 4th layer, don\u2019t mess around!\u201dSun Hao hesitated for a while and said, \u201cDisciple\u2026disciple has a new technique. Although I can\u2019t win, I can still make them look bad.\u201d He thought in his heart, \u201cRight now, no one wants to go, so if I go up now, I can leave a good impression with the sect head. Even if I can\u2019t win with this stink bomb, I won\u2019t look bad. Sorry brother Li Shan, I bought this from you and now I\u2019m using it on you guys. I guess it can be called karma.\u201dIn these past few days, he felt that he had gained a good understanding of how to use the stink bombs. He tried it himself and failed, but after going to brother Li Shan, he finally succeeded a few times. Although, due to lack of time, he didn\u2019t get to practice more, he felt that with a few tries, he could make it work.Huang Long pondered a while and sighed. He nodded and said, \u201cYou can go. Let me see your new technique.\u201dSun Hao straightened his body and stepped onto the platform. He said, \u201cHeng Yue Sect disciple Sun Hao asks the Xuan Dao Sect for guidance.\u201dWhen Li Shan saw Sun Hao, his lungs almost burst from laughing. When he saw that elder Ouyang was about to appoint a disciple, he quickly stepped up and said, \u201cElder, disciple Li Shan is willing to go up and spar with him.\u201d He even winked as he was talking.Li Shan was a disciple that caused elder Ouyang many headaches, but Ouyang also knew that Li Shan was very cunning and wouldn\u2019t do anything that was disadvantageous to him. Elder Ouyang knew that if Li Shan was willingly going up, he was 100% confident in himself, so he let him go.Li Shan excitedly went up to the stage. His heart was about to burst with excitement. He thought, \u201cOh Sun Hao, Sun Hao, you\u2019ve brought this upon yourself.\u201dWhen Sun Hao saw Li Shan come up, his expression became strange.Li Shan loudly said, \u201cBrother Sun Hao, come and show me your newest technique. I, Li Shan, will stand here and take your attack.\u201dSun Hao hesitated a bit. He had already reached the level to use flyings words. His hand formed a seal and a red sword quickly flew out and floated around him, revealing a cold light.\u201cGo!\u201d The flying sword rapid flew toward Li Shan and Sun Hao took this time to take out several stink bombs. He shouted, \u201cSee my new technique!\u201dLi Shan let out a loud laugh. He easily dodged the flying swords and thought in his heart, \u201cExplode!\u201dThe stink bombs in Sun Hao\u2019s hands exploded with a bang before he even threw them. A putrid stench spread out to the surroundings. Sun Hao stood there, covered in black ash, dumbfounded.He couldn\u2019t understand why these stink bombs exploded before he even threw them. Did he use too much force earlier?Li Shan let out a sigh and said, \u201cBrother Sun Hao\u2019s move is too strong. What is it called? Self destruct? I already told you before, you need to be careful with the stink bomb, but you used too much force grabbing them and they exploded.\u201dAll of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples roared with laughter and sounds of ridicule could be heard.Even the Heng Yue Sect disciples wanted to laugh, but they didn\u2019t dare to as it might anger the elders.Huang Long angrily waved his hand. A wave of wind blew the stench away and even flew the dumbfounded Sun Hao off the Pine Peak back to the Heng Yue Peak.Elder Ouyang smiled and said, \u201cThat Sun Hao misused his technique, so we don\u2019t know his real strength. Let\u2019s call this a draw.\u201d After he finished speaking, he gave Li Shan an approving look.Huang Long gloomily said, \u201cA loss is a loss. How is it a draw? Continue.\u201dElder Ouyang laughed and said, \u201cNo less from the largest sect 500 years ago. Xu Mu, you go up!\u201dA disciple walked out from the Xuan Dao Sect. He was about 24 to 25 years old. He clasped his hands together on the stage and didn\u2019t say more.Huang Long didn\u2019t call out any inner disciples, but took out a piece of jade and gently crushed it. The moment it was crushed, a flash of blue light appeared on the stage. Three people walked out of the shining blue light.These three people wore purple clothes. The moment those three appeared, they released a very strong pressure that shocked the inner disciples.Elder Ouyang\u2019s expression slightly changed and he carefully examined those three.The middle aged man standing in the back of the Xuan Dao Sect suddenly turned to them. His eyes lit up and displayed an urge to fight.When the three men appeared, they coldly looked at the audience. One of the 40 year old middle aged men said, \u201cXuan Dao Sect? Hmph, 20 years ago, I, Lu Song, lost, but this time, I won\u2019t.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s pupils contracted. Among the three people, he only knew one of them: second apprentice-brother Zhang Kuang.Huang Long plainly said, \u201cLu Song, this time, you go.\u201dLu Song nodded. The other two besides him moved off the stage and stood next to Huang Long.\u201cLu Song! Fifth senior brother Lu Song! I heard he was at the 6th layer 20 years ago. This time, our Heng Yue Sect will win for sure!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2013 Exchange (4)\u201cHe is Lu Song. I heard from the elders that he is the number one genius in the Heng Yue Sect! Xuan Dao Sect is going to lose for sure!\u201d\u201c5th senior bother, go! I will follow your example!\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciples all cheered with excitement. All of the confidence they lost from the first two losses had started to come back. Some of the female disciples became love struck and felt dependent on Lu Song.Huang Long also smiled faintly. He thought that since Lu Song had come out this time, he would win this round for sure.Wang Zhuo jealously looked at Lu Song and softly snorted.Even the Xuan Dao Sect disciples were filled with shock. Lu Song\u2019s fame was something they had heard of as they grew up in the past 20 years. Although Lu Song ultimately lost in the exchange, he still left a deep impression in the elders\u2019 minds.Elder Ouyang\u2019s face darkened. He said, \u201cXu Mu, I\u2019ll allow you to remove ancestor\u2019s seal to use your full power.\u201dXu Mu\u2019s expression became serious. He opened up his shirt and revealed a yellow talisman on his chest.The elders of the Heng Yue Sect were stunned. After carefully looking at the talisman, they all revealed shocked expressions.Huang Long asked, \u201cFriend Ouyang, this talisman\u2026\u201dElder Ouyang\u2019s eyes lit up. He indifferently said, \u201cHuang Long, this is something that I\u2019ll explain to you at another time. In this exchange today, I\u2019ll add another condition. If our Xuan Dao Sect wins this time, you have to lend us the Heng Yue Mountain for 500 years!\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions changed. Huang Long narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cAre you joking, friend Ouyang?\u201dElder Ouyang shook his head. He said, \u201cHuang Long, as you can see, this talisman can\u2019t be created by someone not of the Nascent Soul stage. To tell you the truth, an ancestor of the Xuan Dao Sect returned from the battlefield of a rank 4 country and told me that all of the ancestors of the Heng Yue Sect have died!\u201dHuang Long\u2019s expression changed. After pondering for a long time, he said, \u201cElder Ouyang, stop this nonsense, otherwise, don\u2019t blame the Heng Yue Sect for not showing mercy!\u201dElder Ouyang smiled and said, \u201cOur Xuan Dao Sect hasn\u2019t take this mountain by force yet because of our friendship, so we will give you guys a fair chance in this exchange. If the Heng Yue Sect wins this time, then we will leave you guys be. I already passed my message. Huang Long, let us continue this exchange.\u201dThe inner disciples of the Heng Yue Sect were all confused, but all of them felt giant rocks weighing down their hearts. Even the sky felt like it had darkened.Wang Lin was alarmed. It seemed that what Situ Nan said was true. The cultivation world really was separated by ranks.Sun Dazhu\u2019s face was pale and his eyes were dull. He muttered to himself, \u201cOver\u2026it\u2019s all over\u2026 all of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s ancestors are dead. Before, we could at least rely on the ancestors to intimidate the other sects and barely hold on, but now that the ancestors are dead, it\u2019s all over. Damn it, if it wasn\u2019t for the rank 4 countries invading 500 years ago to steal the dragon star and resulting in the country calling away all its Nascent Soul cultivators, the Heng Yue Sect wouldn\u2019t be in the state it\u2019s in now.\u201dHuang Long saw his fellow brothers\u2019 and inner disciples\u2019 uneasiness. He suppressed the unrest in his heart and shouted, \u201cEveryone in the Heng Yue Sect, stop panicking. Whether this is true or not will be checked by the Core Formation elder. What are you all worrying about? Lu Song, continue the exchange!\u201dLu Song, who was on the stage, was also shocked by Ouyang\u2019s words, but he regained his composure. He opened his mouth and spat out a purple fog. The fog grew until it became a giant hand and grabbed toward Xu Mu.Xu Mu\u2019s expression slightly changed. He didn\u2019t say a word and slammed his bag of holding. Six golden balls flew out and went toward the hand. Lu Song coldly smiled. His hand formed a seal and the giant hand waved in the air, causing an evil wind that moved the golden balls off course.This evil wind also caused the spiritual energy in Xu Mu\u2019s body to go out of control. He quickly shouted, \u201cExplode!\u201dThe six golden balls simultaneously exploded. The explosion released shock waves that blew all of the audience back a bit.Lu Song snorted and mocked, \u201cA small trick!\u201d The giant hand formed a fist. Ignoring the explosion, the fist quickly slammed down.Xu Mu\u2019s face was pale. Seeing that the hand was about to land on him, he clenched his teeth and took out a yellow talisman. The talisman looked plain. Xu Mu bit his tongue and sprayed out some blood.The blood mist in the air quickly transformed into liquid and formed a blood dragon. Xu Mu didn\u2019t bat an eye and formed a seal with his hand. The blood dragon twisted and turned. It formed into a strange image that imprinted onto the talisman.The yellow talisman suddenly started to glow a glaring light, as if it were a small sun. The fist dissipated in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.After Wang Lin saw this, he was shocked. He had one of those talismans as well.\u201cIt is a magic talisman!\u201d Lu Song frowned. He waved his sleeves and two white dragons flew out. The white dragons flew around once and charged at Xu Mu at lightning speed.Xu Mu let out a pitiful laugh. He used all of his energy to resist the giant fist that came down on him. He had no energy to stop those two white dragons at all.Seeing that the two white dragons were already showing their ferocious teeth at the most dangerous moment, a cold snort came from the Xuan Dao Sect disciples.Shortly after, a black rainbow shot out from the Xuan Dao Sect and easily surrounded the two white dragons. With a cracking sound, the two white dragons quickly disappeared and turned into two silver swords. The black rainbow tightened again and broke the two swords in half.Lu Song\u2019s expression suddenly changed. The flying swords linked to his soul were broken, which caused him to cough out a mouthful of blood. His face revealed a horrified expression. The giant hand above Xu Mu\u2019s head dissipated as well, since Lu Song couldn\u2019t keep his concentration.Xu Mu quickly left with the yellow talisman with the look of him getting lucky today. Lu Song also walked off the stage with a bleak expression.Huang Long\u2019s face sank. He shouted, \u201cXuan Dao Sect, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d The elders beside him also became enraged. Some of the more ill tempered elders already took out their treasures, ready to fight.The inner disciples also saw what was going out and became angry. The remaining two yellow clothed disciples all looked at the middle aged man standing in the back of the Xuan Dao Sect.It was him who let out that cold snort earlier.Elder Ouyang turned back and looked at the middle aged man. He warily smiled and said, \u201cThis 3rd round is won by the Heng Yue Sect. As for what just happened, I\u2026\u201d\u201cOld man Ouyang, don\u2019t say anymore pointless words. This Heng Yue Sect is only mediocre!\u201d The middle aged man standing in the back slowly walked forward. As he took a step, the ground suddenly split and the crack extended all the way to the stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 \u2013 Entering the Stage (1)Meanwhile, his body moved and he appeared on the stage. He looked at the Heng Yue Sect disciples with an arrogant expression and said, \u201cAll you Heng Yue Sect inner disciples can all come at once. I, Zhou Peng, will take you all on!\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciples went into an uproar. Even the Heng Yue Sect elders revealed frowns.None of the people from the Xuan Dao Sect said anything. They only revealed respectful looks. It seemed that this person\u2019s status was not low in the Xuan Dao Sect.Elder Ouyang coughed and shouted, \u201cFriend Huang Long, this is Zhou Peng. He is our Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s head disciple! Let this one match decide it all. If one of your Heng Yue Sect disciples can last 10 seconds, then the Heng Yue Sect has won.Zhang Kuang\u2019s eyes lit up. He moved his body, landed on the stage, then heavily said, \u201cSuch an arrogant kid. I\u2019ll test you!\u201dZhou Peng let out a laugh and said, \u201cYou? You appear to be at the 6th layer of Qi Condensation, but you\u2019re hiding your true strength. You\u2019re actually at the 8th layer. You are not strong enough.\u201d As he was speaking, a cold light flashed across his eyes. He waved his right hand, then a black snake suddenly leapt out and grew into a giant python.This python\u2019s large head looked coldly at Zhang Kuang\u2019s terrified face. It opened its mouth and inhaled, which produced an unimaginable suction force.The suction was very strange. It only effected Zhang Kuang and no one else.Zhang Kuang didn\u2019t have the power to resist. Before he could even use any techniques, his body acted like a kite with its string broken and was sucked toward the python.Zhou Peng sneered. He raised his right hand and grabbed Zhang Kuang\u2019s neck. He said, \u201cGo back and train for a few dozen years before coming back to look for me!\u201d With that, he threw Zhang Kuang out with his right hand.The last remaining purple clothed disciple went to catch Zhang Kuang, but wasn\u2019t able to counteract the force, so they both slid on the ground for a very long distance before finally stopping.Zhang Kuang\u2019s face was very pale. His eyes were closed and his body constantly trembled. On his neck was a black handprint, as if there was a hand firmly clamped on his neck.The purple clothed disciple that caught him had a look of horror on his face and was silent.Huang Long\u2019s heart was very bitter. The Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s head disciple was simply too strong. Based on what happened just now, this person was at least at the 10th layer. He surely had a talisman hiding his cultivation level, so the exact level wasn\u2019t known.Then, he looked at the surrounding inner disciples. Huang Long let out a sigh. Even the head disciple, who was with the Core Formation elders, didn\u2019t have a good chance of winning, because he was only at the 10th layer. If he loses the fight, then the Heng Yue Sect will have completely lost!Huang Long wryly smiled. \u201cFine. It seems my Heng Yue Sect has no hope. Quickly, tell the two ancestors about what old man Ouyang said so they can make a decision. If what he said is true, then there is no hope in keeping the Heng Yue Peak.\u201dZhou Peng arrogantly looked at the surrounding people and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201dAll of the Heng Yue Sect disciples became dumbfounded. None of them spoke up and all of them lowered their heads at Zhou Peng\u2019s gaze, because none of them wanted to go up.Zhou Peng sneered. He looked down upon them in his heart. However, as his gaze was sweeping over the disciples, he was stunned when he noticed that there was a 3rd layer disciple who wasn\u2019t afraid of his gaze.Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm as he looked at Zhou Peng.Zhou Peng stared at Wang Lin and coldly asked, \u201cWhat? Do you want to come up?\u201dZhou Peng\u2019s words attracted everyone\u2019s attention. When they realized that Zhou Peng\u2019s words were directed at Wang Lin, all of their expressions became strange.Huang Long let out a sigh. Wang Lin was only at the 3rd layer and normally wouldn\u2019t be noticed among the disciples, but now, although his cultivation was low, his bravery was commendable.Zhou Peng, seeing that Wang Lin didn\u2019t respond, sneered, \u201cOut of the 4 battles, there is still one left. The Heng Yue Sect is such a large sect, yet no one dares to come up. I\u2019m very disappointed! Do none of your inner disciples dare to come up?\u201dElder Xu, who was standing next to Huang Long, said, \u201cSorry, junior brother Sun. Wang Lin, you go!\u201dSun Dazhu was stunned and immediately realized what was going on. He angrily said, \u201cDao Xu, although you are my senior brother, you can\u2019t disgrace me like this! My disciple is only at the 3rd layer! Letting him go up will only make me lose face! Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you are thinking! Their sect\u2019s head disciple is too strong, so you all are afraid that your disciples will be defeated, shamed, and hurt, so you are sending in my disciple as a scapegoat. My disciple has always been considered trash at the school, so, even if he loses, you guys can make an excuse. I refuse to agree to such a disgraceful thing.\u201dDao Xu frowned. He really did have such thoughts in mind, but Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t give him any face and said all of that in front of the Xuan Dao Sect.He sneered. His eyes looked at the sect head Huang Long and sent some messages.Huang Long sighed and said, \u201cJunior brother Sun, don\u2019t bother saying more. Wang Lin, you go up!\u201dSun Dazhu angrily threw his sleeve to the size and looked up into the sky with a mocking smile on his face.Wang Lin clasped his hands and respectfully exclaimed, \u201cAs you command!\u201dWith that, he took a deep breath, then slowly walked forward and onto the stage.All of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples started to jeer loudly at him.\u201cHeng Yue Sect, you have no shame, sending a waste to compete with our eldest martial brother.\u201d\u201cOur eldest martial brother doesn\u2019t even need to deal with with this trash! I can kill him with just a thumb!\u201d\u201cEldest martial brother, they have already given up. Just send someone else to deal with him. He is honestly pretty pitiful. Be a good person and just send him off without hurting him.\u201dElder Ouyang looked at the two elders and revealed a look of disdain. He laughed and said, \u201cI really got to know the true Huang Long and Heng Yue Sect today!\u201dHuang Long\u2019s face sank. Without a word, he waved his sleeves and left. He didn\u2019t have any hope in Wang Lin. He only sent Wang Lin up to be fodder to end the last match. In this exchange, he had already accepted defeat.After all, even if he lost, then if word of it were to spread, it was not so bad, but if word got out that no one even dared to fight, then it would be too disgraceful.None of of the other inner disciples dared to go up, so he could only send Wang Lin.Behind him, all of the elders of the Heng Yue Sect shook their heads and turned around to leave.Even the inner disciples started to move their feet, unwilling to stick around and lose more face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 Entering the Stage (2)Zhou Peng arrogantly laughed and said, \u201cWang Lin, I can knock you down with one breath, so steady yourself!\u201d With that, he sucked in a breath. His body was like a bottomless pit. The clothes of all the spectating disciples started to make flapping sounds, as if they were about to be blown off.Wang Lin had never fought with anyone before, so to say he was not nervous would be wrong. He concentrated all of his power into his attraction technique and fanned out.For insurance, he took out a stink bomb. He quickly dissolved Li Shan\u2019s divine sense from it and threw it out.With a bang, the stink bomb exploded and Zhou Peng\u2019s body was thrown out from the black smoke. His body heavily slammed into the ground. He was covered in black sludge and wore a dumbfounded expression just like Sun Hao.The giant python floating in the air also disappeared.This bang surprised the people from the Heng Yue Sect. They subconsciously turned their heads, then froze in place. Everyone present was silent.Huang Long was dumbfounded. He thought, \u201cThis \u2026 this\u2026\u201d His heart was in complete chaos and his ears buzzed. It was as if there was thunder raging right next to his head.\u201cNo way! When did Wang Lin became this strong?! His opponent was the head disciple of the Xuan Dao Sect!\u201d Dao Xu rubbed his eyes in disbelief.Brother Zhang, the one who brought Wang Lin to the Heng Yue Sect, also revealed a shocked expression. He thought, \u201cThis is the junior brother Wang, the one I keep telling to work harder? He is only at the 3rd layer. How did this happen\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is Wang Lin? The one that entered the sect by trying to commit suicide\u2026the piece of trash?\u201d The red faced elder was shocked. He opened his mouth, but forgot to breath.\u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d Another elder named Song stood there, frozen.Wang Zhuo was stunned. His face hardened like a wax statue\u2019s and he keep repeating in this head, \u201cWang Lin? Trash?\u201d He shook his head. He felt weightless and kept telling himself that this was a dream, an illusion.The female disciple named Xu\u2019s small hand covered her mouth and she muttered, \u201cHow can this be\u2026 when did Wang Lin became so strong\u2026 he is clearly only at the 3rd layer.\u201dSun Dazhu touched his head and muttered, \u201cThis is an illusion. I must be hallucinating! How can there be an illusion in broad daylight? Is this my disciple?\u201dThe female named Zhou stared at Wang Lin. Her mind was completely blank.Zhang Kuang had already woken up, but he was afraid of losing face, so he had been pretending to be knocked out. However, he couldn\u2019t pretend anymore as he stared at Wang Lin. His pupils shrank and he thought, \u201cYes, its him! It must be him!\u201d\u201cDreaming! I must be dreaming!\u201d The middle aged man who accepted the metal from Wang Lin\u2019s fourth uncle bit his tongue.Lu Song\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t as strong as theirs. This was the first time he had heard Wang Lin\u2019s name. He looked at Wang Lin and thought, \u201cWhen did such an expert appear among the inner disciples? Hmph, why didn\u2019t the elders just send him up instead of sending me first?!\u201d\u201cDid I test wrong back then? Does Wang Lin have really good talent?\u201d The pill house\u2019s 3rd elder thought, as he was still shocked by the scene before him.All of the inner disciples were still frozen. They all exhibited dumbfounded expressions.The people of the Xuan Dao Sect weren\u2019t doing any better. Elder Ouyang\u2019s eyes widened. Zhou Peng was their secret ace, known as the number one genius in the cultivation world of Zhao. His true power was that of 13th layer of Qi Condensation, but he actually lost? If the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s elders made a move, then it would be fine, but this was someone even the Heng Yue Sect considered trash! It must be because Zhou Peng was careless, it must be!The other two elders looked at each other. They were unable to use their voices. This battle was simply too strange. They were so flabbergasted that they were unable to talk at the moment.Liu Feng gave Wang Lin a deep look. He was secretly glad he didn\u2019t go up, or he would have suffered the same fate, but he couldn\u2019t understand why Wang Lin was called trash in the Heng Yue Sect when he was so strong. After looking at the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s people\u2019s reactions, it didn\u2019t seem like they were faking it. Was it really because senior Zhou Peng was careless? No matter how much he looked at Wang Lin, he was only at the 3rd layer.All of the other disciples had thoughts similar to Liu Feng\u2019s and thought that senior brother Zhou Peng was just careless. They refused to believe that he was truly defeated by Wang Lin.Liu Mei\u2019s delicate face also became erratic. Her thoughts were very different from everyone else\u2019s. On the first day, Wang Lin had already caught her eye, and now, she looked at Wang Lin with deep interest.Among all the present people that were shocked, Li Shan could be considered the 3rd most shocked person. His body softened and he fell to the ground, muttering to himself, \u201cOver, it\u2019s all over! I sold him the stink bomb and he used it on Senior Martial Brother! Senior brother lost so fast, he must already be thinking about how to deal with me!\u201d\u201cLi Shan, Li Shan, why didn\u2019t you realize Wang Lin was pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger? Wang Lin, you are too despicable, too shameful, too sinister! This time, you have really put me in a terrible position\u2026. how will I be able to stay at the Xuan Dao Sect? Senior brother will definitely not forgive me!\u201d\u201cNo, I must think of a way to wash off that black sludge and wash away that stink\u2026I\u2026. this black sludge is my most proud invention! There is no cure other than half a year in the bath!\u201d\u201cAnd that stink is something I developed to steal away other people\u2019s girlfriends. Even I wouldn\u2019t touch it. The only way to get rid of it is to stand at the wind tunnel for a month. There is no other way\u2026.I\u2019m finished\u2026.finished!\u201dAt that moment, Zhou Peng woke up. He was knocked unconscious by the stink and shouted, \u201cLi Shan! I\u2019m not gonna forgive you for this!\u201dLi Shan couldn\u2019t stand this kind of blow. He cried, \u201cSenior brother, I was wrong! Senior brother, please forgive me! I\u2019ll never try to profit by cheating again!\u201dZhou Peng\u2019s face was full of anger. He moved like lightning while carrying the black sludge and the foul smell with him. He instantly made his way back onto the stage and madly shouted, \u201cWang Lin, that didn\u2019t count! I wasn\u2019t ready and you attacked early! We are going to fight again, and this time, you are not allowed to attack early!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 \u2013 Entering the Stage (3)Wang Lin was also shocked and didn\u2019t recover for a long time.Zhou Peng was in rage because he thought that he had been careless earlier. How could a mere 3rd layer kid beat him? This time, he didn\u2019t say a word and summoned the giant python again. He formed a seal with his hand and the python was about to open its mouth.Wang Lin\u2019s attraction force was sent out again. The python let out a whining sound as it disappeared. Zhou Peng\u2019s right cheek was swollen. He coughed out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying again.The moment he landed, he charged back onto the stage. His hair was completely disheveled. Ignoring the blood in the corner of his mouth, he ripped off his clothes and removed the yellow talisman from his chest. His cultivation suddenly rose and his hair flowed in the air in a strange manner.\u201cWang Lin!!! That didn\u2019t count! I didn\u2019t use my real strength! Lets fight\u2013\u201dWang Lin was now confident in his strength. Without waiting for Zhou Peng, he used the attraction technique and swiped him again.Pa! Zhou Peng, who was still raging, was hit in the face again and he coughed up more blood. This time, he didn\u2019t immediately get up. The spiritual energy in his body was in chaos. He struggled, but couldn\u2019t get up, and the sense of shame drowned him. He wasn\u2019t able to catch his breath and passed outEveryone was completely silent. Besides the deep breathing of the surrounding disciples, there was no other sound.Huang Long finally recovered from the shock and his face revealed a look of ecstasy. The more he looked at Wang Lin, the more he liked him. He thought, \u201cThis Wang Lin is my Heng Yue Sect\u2019s lucky star. This brat has already become this strong and he didn\u2019t want to fight. He really needs some scolding! I also need to carefully question him on how he did it.\u201dSun Dazhu took a deep breath. He finally recovered a bit and thought, \u201cWang Lin must have some secret. That gourd must not have been the only one! Wang Lin, you have deceived me well! Hmph!\u201dDao Xu was stunned. The first time could be considered luck, but the next two fights were real fights. What shocked him the most was that after the Zhou Peng took off the yellow talisman, his cultivation climbed to the 12th layer, which was same as him, but was still sent off the stage with one slap by Wang Lin\u2019s attraction technique.What level has this Wang Lin achieved? He stared at Wang Lin for a long time. No matter how much he checked with his divine sense, he couldn\u2019t see through Wang Lin\u2019s cultivation.The red faced elder finally recovered and thought, \u201cWhen Wang Lin was accepted into the sect, it was I who approved him. Hmph, it seems my eyes weren\u2019t wrong!\u201dThe middle aged man who accepted Wang Lin\u2019s fourth uncle\u2019s piece of metal also thought, \u201cFate! This is fate! It seems me and this kid have some fate, or I wouldn\u2019t have pushed for him to join the sect. I have done a good deed for the Heng Yue Sect! I have to talk with the sect head later.\u201dStanding next to him was a yellow faced middle aged man. He nodded and thought, \u201cWhen I tested this kid before, I knew that his perseverance was great. It seems he is not normal. Hmph, if he wasn\u2019t stolen by Sun Dazhu, he would be my, Zhang Rencai\u2019s, disciple!\u201dWang Zhuo\u2019s mind was finally clear now. He was no long floating on a cloud, but bitterly thought, \u201cIt turns out he was this strong\u2026all those times I mocked him\u2026he must be thinking of ways to get revenge on me\u2026what do I do?!\u201dThe female named Zhou\u2019s eyes lit up. She was completely convinced that Wang Lin had been hiding his strength. She remembered when she thought that he was still at the 3rd layer and she said all those emotional things to him. Her face turned red. She thought, \u201cThis Wang Lin is really\u2026 he is already so strong, but lied to me when he said he was only at the 3rd layer. Later, I must get an answer out of him! Hmph!\u201dThe female named Xu blinked many times while staring at Wang Lin, then looked at Wang Zhuo and thought, \u201cHow can he compare to brother Wang Zhuo? Right now is the time for brother Wang Zhuo to show off, but this Wang Lin is too strong! He was able to send the other sect\u2019s head disciple off stage with one slap not once, but three times. He really vented for us all.\u201dOne of the inner disciples secretly laughed and checked out few of the surrounding disciples and thought, \u201cThis Wang Lin turned out to be pretending to be a pig planning to eat a tiger this whole time. Too devious. Fortunately, I never mocked him before, or it would have been really bad. Hehe, I\u2019ll be able to see many good shows from all these people that used to mock him a lot.\u201dOne of the disciples that mocked Wang Lin a lot thought, \u201cIt\u2019s over! I used to point and laugh at him so much, but now he can kill me with just one finger! Your cultivation is already so high, but you still pretend to be so weak! Too shameless! Alas, this Wang Lin is known to hold grudges among the nameless disciples and was nicknamed the Black Hearted King. I should go and suck up to curry some favor later\u2026\u201dAnother disciple that used to mock Wang Lin a lot nervously thought, \u201cThis Wang Lin must be a cool headed genius. That must be why he didn\u2019t even bother to respond when he was the object of my ridicule! This must like how when a dog bites a person, a person won\u2019t bite the dog back. Right, it must be like this. Brother Wang Lin is a genius, how could he bother with someone like me?\u201dThe pill house\u2019s 3rd senior brother sucked in a breath of cold air. His expression was unsettled as he thought, \u201cThis is bad. I heard that this guy and Wang Hao are relatives and that their relationship is pretty good\u2026 How to deal with this? If this was three days ago, I could have let Wang Hao go and not have angered him, but now\u2026ah Wang Hao has already become like that. If he goes and finds Wang Hao, that means I have to face his anger\u2026This Wang Hao can\u2019t be kept alive! If I let him go, then he might come back at me for revenge! After the exchange is over, I\u2019ll go kill him and pretend he died from something else!\u201dLu Song lowered his head and looked at the purple clothes on his body. He bitterly laughed and thought, \u201cThe inner disciples of the Heng Yue Sect are about to go into an upheaval. This Wang Lin is not simple. His schemes are very deep. He probably has been keeping his cultivation hidden just for today. Hehe, I\u2019m afraid Wang Lin\u2019s name will spread across the cultivation world of Zhao soon. I must make him a friend and not an enemy!\u201d With that, he decided on how he will treat Wang Lin in the future.Zhang Kuang\u2019s face was filled with a bitter look. When he got the spirit water, he just thought it was water containing a lot of spiritual power, so he didn\u2019t go after Wang Lin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2013 Entering the Stage (4)But, after he compared the spirit water to the spring water in the back mountain, he found out that not only did the spirit water contain several times more spiritual energy, but it also had some other uses. After his careful analysis, he found out that the spirit water could help one retain a youthful look!If it was regularly taken, then one could look young forever. He only took a few drops and immediately noticed this effect. This realization made him very excited.It has to be said that only after one reaches the Nascent Soul stage would they live forever, but, when that happens, it has already been hundreds, if not thousands, of years.Zhang Kuang knew that if this spirit water was taken out to exchange with other sects, they would go crazy for it, especially the female cultivators at the Foundation Building or Core Formation stages.But when he went to check again, he had already lost Wang Lin\u2019s shadow. There were only a few dozen inner disciples in the Heng Yue Sect . He checked them all, but couldn\u2019t find one that was similar.He was depressed for a long time because of this. He had also checked up on Wang Lin, but after finding that Wang Lin was only at the 3rd layer, he didn\u2019t think it was Wang Lin.But now, he was 100% sure that that person was Wang Lin. This confirmation had no logical reason. It was purely based on his intuition.\u201cThis Wang Lin has already reached such a high cultivation level! Good thing I didn\u2019t do anything to him back then. Alas, the secret of the spirit water must be buried in my heart. It doesn\u2019t matter if Wang Lin is really that person or not, because the cultivation world is too cruel. Not to mention fellows from the same sect, even brothers would kill each other. With Wang Lin\u2019s cultivation, I won\u2019t be able to fight back at all!\u201d Zhang Kuang decided to never mess with Wang Lin.He also involuntarily remembered that back in the back mountain, he thought that Wang Lin wasn\u2019t even at the first layer and gave him a lift. He wondered what Wang Lin thought about that back then.There was that time at the river in the back mountain too. While thinking about it, Zhang Kuang shivered. He was glad that he didn\u2019t do anything back then, or it would have been over for him.It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t wonder about how Wang Lin had become so strong, but, with Wang Lin\u2019s current cultivation level, he immediately stopped himself. He felt that if he kept thinking about it, he would throw his life away.Brother Zhang, who had always scolded Wang Lin to train harder, felt very perplexed. He looked at Wang Lin and gloomily said, \u201cThis Wang Lin is someone I personally brought over from the Wang family. He is clearly a normal youth. When he tried to commit suicide, it was I who saved him as well. It\u2019s been five years and so much has changed. He is now the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s number one disciple. Fate is simply too cruel! I have painstakingly cultivated for 10 years and have only reached the 6th layer.\u201dIf the Xuan Dao Sect was surprised before, they were now shocked!Zhou Peng could explain the first time as him being careless, but, on the second and third times, he was again and again sent flying, each time with one move. Especially that third time. Zhou Peng removed his yellow talisman and used his full cultivation, but was still beat with one move.This caused all of the Xuan Dao Sect people to be stunned.Liu Feng\u2019s jaw fell and he didn\u2019t regain his senses for a long time. He was convinced that Wang Lin was the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s ace. He thought, \u201cSenior brother wasn\u2019t careless before, but was simply weaker than Wang Lin. However, senior brother is already at the 12th layer. What level of cultivation has Wang Lin reached?\u201dLiu Feng muttered, in a tone of disbelief, \u201cCould he have already reached Foundation Building?\u201dThe female disciple named Ouyang, who laughed at Wang Lin before for trying to feed the centipede small animals, was also stunned. The senior brother she admired the most lost\u2026Liu Mei\u2019s eyes lit up even more. She had become even more interested in Wang Lin. She secretly thought, \u201cHe indeed has many secrets. I realized that something was wrong three days ago, when he was the first person to recover from my charm technique.\u201dSeveral other disciples couldn\u2019t even say a word because senior brother was their hero, an expert, but now, this expert was beaten by someone else, and beaten in one move, without any chance of fighting back. This caused them all to begin to doubt the techniques taught at the Xuan Dao Sect.Elder Ouyang\u2019s expression was like Huang Long\u2019s expression when the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s disciples lost all those battles before. His face was very bitter. He deeply looked at Wang Lin and was shocked. With his 14th layer cultivation, no matter how he looked at Wang Lin, he could only see that Wang Lin was at the 3rd layer.\u201cHe\u2026is he really a Heng Yue Sect inner disciple\u2026 has he already reached Foundation Building? How else would I be unable to see his cultivation level?\u201dThe other two elders\u2019 faces were also very pale. The three matches Zhou Peng fought made them understand Wang Lin\u2019s power.This was when one of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples suddenly whispered, \u201cWhat technique did he use? Why do I feel like he used the attraction technique?\u201dA disciple on the side started to analyze with a serious expression. \u201cAttraction Technique? Not possible. That is the lowest level of technique. How could it contain that much power? If you ask me, it must be some lost ancient technique. You see him waving his hand like it\u2019s the attraction technique, but that must be used to cover up this ancient technique! This Wang Lin is too sly!\u201d\u201cBut from how I see it, it looks exactly like the attraction technique. I often practice it myself. I could wave my hand and make objects fly any way I want\u2026 just like what happened to senior brother.\u201d Another disciple added, but, on those last few words, his voice became very faint.Another disciple said, while rubbing his chin, \u201cForget it. You try and do what Wang Lin just did. This can\u2019t be the attraction technique, it can\u2019 be!\u201dThe other disciples started to discuss what technique Wang Lin used. Some even went and directly asked the three elders.Elder Ouyang and the other two elders bitterly laughed. He sighed and said, \u201cThis is not the attraction technique. I have never seen such a powerful attraction technique. From what I saw, this must be the long lost Dragon Capture Hand!\u201d\u201cDragon Capture Hand!\u201d The other two elders were stunned. They had never heard of this Dragon Capture Hand, but they couldn\u2019t see through what technique Wang Lin used either, because it just looked too similar to the attraction technique.Elder Ouyang let out a dark sigh and thought, \u201cThis old man can\u2019t see through it either. If I say I don\u2019t know, it will lose me too much face, so I can only make something up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 \u2013 Entering the Stage (5)The discussion of what technique Wang Lin used also happened among the Heng Yue Sect disciples.Wang Lin stood on the stage, unable to calm his excited heart. He was able to beat Zhou Peng down with his attraction technique three times, causing his confidence to grow. His gaze swept across the Xuan Dao Sect disciples like Zhou Peng did before and said, \u201cToday\u2019s exchange is not over. Who is going to come up next from the Xuan Dao Sect?\u201dAll of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples looked at each other. They all lowered their heads, unwilling to look at Wang Lin, just like how the Heng Yue Sect acted before with Zhou Peng.All of the Heng Yue Sect disciples forgot the title \u201ctrash\u201d they gave Wang Lin. They all cheered and shouted:\u201cXuan Dao Sect\u2019s trash, how coming none of you are coming out after seeing how strong our senior brother Wang is? You were all so arrogant before. How come none of you are coming out now?\u201d\u201cWhere did all the drive you guys had before go? Quickly, send someone up so our senior brother Wang can teach them a lesson, then we\u2019ll see if you guys will act cocky again!\u201d\u201cLiu Feng, you looked so strong before. Come on out! Do you dare to fight with my senior brother?\u201d\u201cAll that the Xuan Dao Sect has left is trash. None of them dare to come out. Brother Wang is invincible!\u201d\u201cLi Shan, you ***! You sold us those stink bombs with bad intentions, but we all saw through it, especially senior brother Wang Lin. Have you learned your lesson?\u201d\u201cDid you guys all see? The Xuan Dao Sect is so scared of brother Wang Lin that none of them dare to come out.\u201d\u201cSenior brother, I mocked you before, but I\u2019m here to apologize to you now, before everyone else. You are now my boss! If you tell me to go east, I definitely won\u2019t go west!\u201dThe scene suddenly became more lively. All of the Heng Yue Sect disciples became excited and started to shout loudly. The earlier battles between the two sects were too depressing for them, but Wang Lin\u2019s performance gave them hope.By coincidence, the title of senior brother was given to Wang Lin.Elder Ouyang\u2019s face turned red, then white. He finally felt what Huang Long felt earlier. Then, he finally said, \u201cYang Yi, you go!\u201dA tall and thin youth reluctantly walked up. Before he got on the stage, a Xuan Dao Sect disciple shouted, \u201cSecond senior brother, go! Go and give Wang Lin a\u2026\u201dBefore he even finished talking, he noticed all the other disciples were looking at him with strange expressions, especially Yang Yi, who gave him a hateful look. The look made him so scared, he didn\u2019t dare to finish that sentence.Yang Yi secretly cursed in his heart, \u201cThis moron, Wang Lin, is so strong that he is able to beat senior brother with one move, yet old man Ouyang still made me come up. So shameful. And I don\u2019t know how many stink bombs that bastard Li Shan sold him either. That Li Shan, I\u2019ll have to teach him a lesson once we go back.\u201dWhile thinking that, he turned to Li Shan and shot him a fierce gaze. He then clasped his hands and respectfully said, \u201cBrother Wang, I am Yang Yi. Brother is very handsome and has such high cultivation! You will definitely become famous in the cultivation country of Zhao! Having the chance to battle with brother is really a privilege!\u201dWang Lin glanced at Yang YI, but didn\u2019t say a word.Yang Yi didn\u2019t feel embarrassed. He said, \u201cBrother Wang, we are only here for a friendly exchange between the two sects. How about we fight by touch* to determine the winner? If I can last 100 seconds, then it\u2019s my win.\u201dJust as he finished, he immediately regretted it and said, \u201cNo, 50 seconds. Actually, let\u2019s do 30 seconds\u2026no let\u2019s go with 20 seconds.\u201dAll of the Heng Yue Sect disciples finally decided that they must properly suck up to Wang Lin, or they just wouldn\u2019t feel safe.\u201cGet off the stage! You\u2019re the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s second senior brother, yet you\u2019re so shameless! Brother Wang, don\u2019t listen to him!\u201d\u201cYang Yi, are you still a man? From 100 seconds to 20 seconds? Get off the stage and send in someone else. You\u2019re not worthy of fighting our senior brother!\u201d\u201cHow could the Xuan Dao Sect send out such a person?! Simply too shameful!\u201dHuang Long\u2019s smile became wider. The more he looked at Wang Lin, the more he liked him. He turned to Sun Dazhu and said, \u201cJunior brother Dazhu, this disciple of yours is very good!\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s body trembled. His body felt several pounds lighter. Since when did the sect head call him junior brother Dazhu with such intimacy? \u00a0He proudly said, \u201cThat is true. I\u2019ve had my eyes on Wang Lin from the moment he came into the sect! Hehe, good thing no one fought with me for him. Hmph, when I took him as my disciple, quite a few people even mocked me!\u201dDao Xu\u2019s and the red faced elder\u2019s, along with a few other elder\u2019s, faces turned red and were about to speak.However, Huang Long fiercely looked at them and said, \u201cJunior brother Dazhu, you have done a great service for the Heng Yue Sect! Don\u2019t worry, your elder brother will deal with this matter for you!\u201dSun Dazhu was talking proudly, but, secretly, he was even more shocked and his eyes contained a cold light.On the stage, Yang Yi didn\u2019t even have time to bother with what the other sect\u2019s disciples were saying. He was carefully examining Wang Lin. He was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t agree to his suggestion.Wang Lin looked at Yang Yi and said, \u201cOk!\u201dYang Yi secretly became excited. He had always been a calm person. He was not arrogant like Zhou Peng. He thought, \u201cWang Lin, although your Dragon Capture Hand is strong, and I can\u2019t compare to senior brother, I specialize in speed! Hmph, let\u2019s see if you can catch me in 20 seconds. It will surely be my win!He clasped his hands toward Wang Lin, then quickly took out a piece of white jade and crushed it. Suddenly, white light appeared around his body and increased his speed. He shot toward the side.He deliberately avoided Wang Lin. His objective wasn\u2019t fight him, but to use his speed to waste time.Wang Lin revealed a mocking smile. His divine sense was far above Yang Yi\u2019s and he was easily able to keep up with the speed. His attraction technique was sent out and he slowly took out a stink bomb.The moment Yang Yi saw the stink bomb, his face changed greatly, and he increased his speed.Li Shan stared dumbfoundedly at the stink bomb in Wang Lin\u2019s hand as he muttered to himself, \u201cMartial Brother Wang, Elder Brother Wang, Grandpa Wang! Please don\u2019t use it anymore! I have already angered senior brother. If I anger second senior brother as well, my life will be over\u2026\u201d*Basically is you fight but on a critical blow or something you don\u2019t hit them but stop by just before hitting them after breaking through their defenses.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 \u2013 Entering the Stage (6)Unfortunately for him, his prayers didn\u2019t come true. Wang Lin\u2019s eyes flashed, then his attraction technique formed a hand and caught Yang Yi. Then, an stink bomb was tossed into the air. It flew in an arc and landed on Yang Yi\u2019s head.Yang Yi felt the space tighten around him as if the air around him was sucked out and a force was pressing him from all sides, making him unable to move. He could only stare as the stink bomb fell toward him.With a bang, Yang Yi was hit by the stink bomb. His entire face was black and his body emitted a disgusting stench.He couldn\u2019t be bothered with his face being black or with the stench. His face was filled with horror. When he felt the the squeezing force loosen a bit, he used all the power in his body to break free. His heart pounded as he thought, \u201cThis Dragon Capture Hand is too strong. I\u2019ll lose no matter what. Fine, let\u2019s go all out!\u201dWang Lin faintly smiled at Yang Yi and said, \u201cThere are still more than ten seconds left. You can continue.\u201dYang Yi gritted his teeth and spat out a mouthful of red light. The red light grew large and turned into a long, sword-shaped red light and flew toward Wang Lin with strong sword qi.Meanwhile, he moved again and threw out handfuls of talismans. The talismans all grew and activated techniques that rained down on Wang Lin.Wang Lin sneered. He activated his attraction technique and formed a hand. He waved it and destroyed all of the talismans in the air. He then created another hand and grabbed the red light.The red light dissipated and revealed its true form. A red flying sword! The flying sword was stopped in mid air and continued to struggled. Wang Lin scanned the flying sword and found that it had a piece of divine sense inside, just like the stink bomb. He easily erased the divine sense left on it and used a bit more force with his attraction technique. With a cracking sound, the flying sword split in half and fell to the ground.Yang Yi\u2019s expression changed greatly and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He took a few steps back and said, \u201cBrother Wang\u2019s ancient technique, the Dragon Capture Hand, is very strong, but I don\u2019t admit defeat! What defeated me was not you, but your ancient technique!\u201dWang Lin was stunned, but he let out a smile. \u201cAncient technique Dragon Capture Hand? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it!\u201d\u201cHmph, you don\u2019t have to deny it. Your Dragon Capture Hand has already been seen through by my uncle-master!\u201d Yang Yi walked down from the stage and all of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples got out of the way. The smell on his body was simply too awful.Elder Ouyang\u2019s face reddened slightly. He coughed and stiffly said, \u201cJunior Wang Lin, the technique you used is really the Dragon Capture Hand. These ancient techniques are very unpredictable and powerful. I\u2019ve only ever heard of it in some old texts myself. I never thought that the Heng Yue Sect still had a technique that has been lost for thousands of years. No less from a powerful sect from 500 years ago!\u201dAs he kept speaking, even he himself began to believe it. Even though it was not the Dragon Capture Hand, it must\u2019ve been an ancient technique, or it would not have been so powerful.Wang Lin was dumbfounded. He had practiced this attraction technique for more than 20 years in the dream world, so its power would not be weak.This was only a small matter. What was important was that these fights made Wang Lin realize his current strength. Situ Nan said before that Wang Lin was at the half circle of the spirit movement stage, which was the 14th layer of Qi Condensation in the cultivation country of Zhao. This meant that he was one step away from reaching the peak of Qi Condensation.As for why he felt like he was still at the 3rd layer, even Situ Nan couldn\u2019t guess what was wrong. Wang Lin had once brought up what Brother Zhang said about cutting one\u2019s mortal ties, but,with a face full of disdain, Situ Nan told him that there was no such thing. That was only a rumor spread by the juniors of these small cultivation countries. Cultivation was a heaven defying act. These small things don\u2019t matter at all.He stated that, in his home country, there was a cultivator at the spirit severing stage, but he couldn\u2019t let go of his family ties, so he stayed home and enjoyed life with his family, and, in the end, he still reached Spirit Transformation after a number of years.This lifestyle becomes very dull after a long time. After all, a cultivator\u2019s life span is much longer than an average person\u2019s, so, to normal people, it looks like cultivators don\u2019t care about these things.Situ Nan finally concluded that this had something to do with the heaven defying bead. Because Wang Lin cultivated so much in the heaven defying bead\u2019s space, it caused a desynchronization between the dream space and the real world, so, while Wang Lin\u2019s true strength was at the 14th layer, his body only showed that he was at the 3rd layer.After a while, the desynchronization will be gone, so it was not a big deal.With the power of the 14th layer of qi condensation and more than 20 years of hard work on the attraction technique, no wonder its power would cause people to have crazy guesses.Huang Long narrowed his eyes and said to Wang Lin, \u201cWang Lin, is the technique you used really some ancient technique?\u201d He was currently not in the mood to find what the name of the technique was, but he wholeheartedly wanted to make the Xuan Dao Sect lose face.Wang Lin shook his head and smiled, \u201cSect head, the technique junior used is clearly the attraction technique. As for the Dragon Capture Hand, disciple has never heard of it before.\u201dHuang Long secretly praised Wang Lin for being smart. He looked toward the three Xuan Dao Sect elders and laughed. \u201cFriend Ouyang, I can tell you that this technique is not the Dragon Capture Hand, but the most basic technique of my Heng Yue Sect: the attraction technique. Your disciples can\u2019t even defend against the most basic technique of my Heng Yue Sect, and you guys are making up this Dragon Capture Hand to justify it.\u201dElder Ouyang was pretty embarrassed, but, on the surface, he couldn\u2019t back down. He retorted, \u201cFriend Huang Long, you don\u2019t have to deny it. Hmph, I already saw through it. This is the Dragon Capture Hand!\u201dDao Xu let out a laugh and said to sect head Huang Long, \u201cSect head, I think that name is pretty good. How about we change the attraction technique\u2019s name to the Dragon Capture Hand?\u201dHuang Long\u2019s eyes lit up and gave Dao Xu a praising look. He said \u201cGood! From now on, my Heng Yue Sect\u2019s attraction technique will be renamed to the Dragon Capture Hand. I\u2019d like thank the Xuan Dao Sect for the name!\u201dElder Ouyang and the two other elders\u2019 faces were full of bitterness. They shook their heads in silence.Wang Lin stood on the stage, pondering. After the last two matches, he had gained great confidence in his strength, but the opponents were too weak to test his full power. Although his spiritual energy was at the same level as someone at the 14th layer of Qi Condensation, he was a bit short in terms of technique. He only had proficiency in the attraction technique.In order to test how strong he truly was, he suddenly said, \u201cFellow senior brothers of the Xuan Dao Sect, all of you can come up at once.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 \u2013 Entering the Stage (7)All of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples became furious. They all secretly cursed Wang Lin for being too arrogant, but none of them dared to go up. Elder Ouyang and the other two elders were also frowning and looking at Wang Lin with unfriendly gazes.Wang Lin raised his head and let out a laugh. His current demeanour was exactly the same as Zhou Peng\u2019s before. He asked, \u201cXuan Dao Sect, are you all too scared to even all come up at once?\u201dAll of the Heng Yue Sect disciples became very excited and started to cheer loudly.\u201cIs the trash of the Xuan Dao Sect too scared to come out? Where did all of that arrogance go? Come out!\u201d\u201cSenior brother Wang Lin is invincible! Punch the Xuan Dao Sect! Kick the Xuan Dao Sect! Even his spit can drown the Xuan Dao Sect!\u201d\u201cYour senior brother was not good enough! Your second senior brother was also not enough! Do you guys have a third senior brother? All of you, come out together!\u201d\u201cLiu Feng, come out and die!\u201dThe Heng Yue Sect disciples became even more rowdy and Huang Long\u2019s smile became wider and wider, until one of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore finally shouted:\u201cWang Lin, you are too arrogant! It is you who wants all of us to come up! Fellow martial brothers, let\u2019s all go and beat him up!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This is his request, so it\u2019s not against the rules. Elders, let us all go up!\u201d\u201cElder, this Wang Lin is too arrogant! Let us all go up!\u201dThe Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciples asked to go up one by one. Elder Ouyang clenched his teeth and said, \u201cSince the Heng Yue Sect requested it, then, whoever wants to go, go up!\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, three disciples immediately jumped onto the stage. Soon, 7 to 8 more disciples came onto the stage. There were even a few female disciples amongst them. With a shout from someone, all of them took out their magical treasures and attacked Wang Lin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t mind at all. He activated the attraction technique. He created a few giant hands and swept them at the crowd of people. Suddenly, several people were sent flying. Then, he took a few steps back and the giant hands grabbed the Xuan Dao Sect disciples like they were flies and threw them into the distance.Screams came from the crowd. The Xuan Dao Sect disciples were thrown from the stage one by one and were unable to get up after they landed.The more Wang Lin fought, the more he got used to it. His control of the attraction technique became even more refined and, after a while, there were only three people remaining. One of them was Liu Feng.Wang Lin let out a laugh and took out the last stink bomb.Liu Feng\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He didn\u2019t care about the other two anymore. He shouted, \u201cBrother Wang, have mercy! I surrender, I surrender!\u201d As he was speaking, he quickly backed up and stepped off the stage. He had already seen what happened to Zhou Peng and Yang Yi, so he didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen to him.The last two people were Xu Mu and Li Shan.Xu Mu saw that things weren\u2019t going well. He quickly surrendered and awkwardly got off the stage.Li Shan\u2019s face was filled with grief. He loudly shouted at Wang Lin, \u201cWang Lin, come. Use your last stink bomb on me!\u201d With his strength, he would normally not be the last person left, but, when he got on the stage, he immediately played dead. Although he was stepped on a few times, it was worth it for the sake of his future in the sect.Li Shan planned this well. If he was also hit by the stink bomb, like senior brother and second senior brother, then he might get their pity and his beating might not be as bad.Wang Lin faintly smiled at him. He put away the stink bomb and said, \u201cThis is a treasure, so it shouldn\u2019t be carelessly used. You can get off the stage.\u201dWith his attraction technique, he grabbed Li Shan like a small baby chick and threw him off the stage.Elder Ouyang and the two other elders were furious. They wished there was a crack in the ground for them to burrow in right now.Huang Long\u2019s face was bursting with joy as he said, \u201cFriend Ouyang, who is the winner between the exchange of our two sects?\u201dElder Ouyang snorted and said, \u201cYour Heng Yue Sect has good fortune to have such a good disciple. This exchange is your win! But, what I said before is true. All of your Heng Yue Sect Nascent Soul ancestors are dead! All of the things you want are in this bag of holding. Goodbye!\u201dWith that, he waved his sleeve and a bag of holding flew out. Huang Long caught the bag of holding with a thoughtful expression.Elder Ouyang let out a shout and, soon, a black cloud arrived at his location.Wang Lin looked closer and found that it was the thousand foot centipede.Without a word, elder Ouyang took one step and jumped onto the centipede. All of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples flew onto the centipede with looks of shame, anger, and many other expressions.Seeing the other about to leave, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he made a decision. He shouted, \u201cFellow peers of the Xuan Dao Sect and elders, I have an unreasonable demand!\u201dWith that, his body flew forward with the attraction technique and stopped before the centipede.Elder Ouyang\u2019s expression remained unwavering. If it was any other disciple of the Heng Yue Sect, he wouldn\u2019t bother, but this Wang Lin\u2019s power was too amazing, so he suppressed the discontent in his heart and said, \u201cSpeak!\u201dWang Lin looked at the thousand foot centipede and honestly said, \u201cI would like to borrow some poison from the centipede. I hope elder Ouyang will agree!\u201dBefore elder Ouyang could speak, all of the Xuan Dao Sect disciples became furious. One of them shouted, \u201cWang Lin, don\u2019t push us too far!\u201d\u201cWang Lin, this centipede is one of the guardian spirit beasts of our Xuan Dao Sect! How could its poison be just lent to you because you ask!?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too arrogant! Elder, this person is too disrespectful to our Xuan Dao Sect! I request the elder to teach him a lesson!\u201dThe other two elders both couldn\u2019t stop sneering.Elder Ouyang stared at Wang Lin with an eerie smile. \u201cJunior, scram. I can\u2019t be bothered with you!\u201dHuang Long and the other elders of the Heng Yue Sect all stepped onto their flying swords and flew up next to Wang Lin. Huang Long said, in a clear voice, \u201cFriend Ouyang, your Xuan Dao Sect is too stingy. It\u2019s only the centipede\u2019s poison. It\u2019s not like he is asking for its life!\u201dElder Ouyang\u2019s expression darkened. He looked around and his gaze fell back on Huang Long. He said, \u201cFriend Huang Long, taking a bit of the poison is not a big deal, but for a junior to dare to be so arrogant is too disrespectful toward our Xuan Dao Sect!\u201dHuang Long hesitated for a moment. He really didn\u2019t want to embarrass the Xuan Dao Sect too much, because the news they brought was just too shocking. If the news were true, then the balance of power in the cultivation country of Zhao was going to be shuffled.Wang Lin hesitated for a while. He was definitely going to get the poison from this centipede. He said to elder Ouyang, \u201cElder Ouyang, I only want a bit of the centipede\u2019s poison. I promise I won\u2019t hurt him. If you agree, I\u2019m willing to exchange something for it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 FinishedElder Ouyang gave Wang Lin a scornful look. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re only a little junior. What right do you have to trade with me? If you take out the treasure left behind by the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s founder, I might exchange one drop of poison with you!\u201dWang Lin frowned. He secretly sneered. Then, he activated his attraction technique to full force and grabbed.Elder Ouyang\u2019s face instantly changed. \u201cJunior, you dare!\u201d With that, he waved his sleeve and an old looking flying sword came out. The moment the flying sword came out, wind started to gather and formed a giant sword in the air. The sword swung down.The moment the sword appeared, a hint of killing intent appeared in elder Ouyang\u2019s eyes. This disciple was simply too strong and he will become a threat to his Xuan Dao Sect in the future. He wanted to take this opportunity to destroy his cultivation.Huang Long\u2019s face darkened. He realized what Ouyang\u2019s intent was and immediately took out his sword. Wang Lin let out a laugh. His attraction technique reached its limit and the invisible hand he created turned visible.Two large hands that emitted white light appeared. Swirls of light appeared around the hands and all of the clouds surrounding them scattered.One of the giant hands grabbed hold of the neck of the centipede. The other hand rose up and blocked the sword that was coming down.The sword that was swinging down slowed down until it was stopped in mid air. Elder Ouyang\u2019s face was all red as he revealed a look of horror.The other two elders clenched their teeth. Disregarding their status, one spat out a rainbow colored light that turned into a rainbow colored ribbon. It shot toward Wang Lin.Meanwhile, the other elder threw out a piece of jade. Eight ghostly fireballs appeared and shot at Wang Lin.A strong heat wave reached Wang Lin, but his expression didn\u2019t change at all. He created another hand with his attraction technique. That hand created a swirl of wind around him, causing the ghostly fire to fade.All of this happened very quickly. Huang Long let out an angry roar and formed a seal with his hand. His flying sword, the Purple Moon, flashed toward the rainbow colored ribbon.Using this time, Wang Lin quickly moved toward the thousand foot centipede. With his attraction technique holding the centipede, no matter how hard it struggled, it couldn\u2019t break free. Wang Lin placed his right hand on the centipede\u2019s head and activated his spiritual energy. The centipede let out a painful howl and coughed out a black mist.All of this lasted only a few seconds. No one even had the time to react yet. Both sects\u2019 elders stood on each side of the centipede, ready to fight. When Dao Xu saw the centipede cough out the poison, he was afraid that Wang Lin wouldn\u2019t have anything to hold the poison, so he waved his sleeve and threw out a white bottle. He shouted, \u201cDisciple Wang Lin, use this to hold the poison!\u201dAfter that, he took his flying sword and started fighting the Xuan Dao Sect elder that let out the ghostly fire.The three elders of the Xuan Dao Sect were all furious that they were stopped by the Heng Yue Sect elders and were unable to stop Wang Lin.When Wang Lin saw that the centipede coughed out the poison, he quickly moved back a bit. He took the bottle and used his spiritual energy to move the poison into the bottle.Elder Ouyang furiously shouted, \u201cHeng Yue Sect, you\u2019ve gone too far!\u201dHuang Long secretly sighed. He put away his sword and backed away. The other elders all did the same.Wang Lin\u2019s face showed hints of regret. This centipede\u2019s poison could be the cure for his father\u2019s illness, so he was determined to get it no matter what. He clasped his hands and said, \u201cElder Ouyang, this centipede\u2019s poison is very important to me. I have something that can be considered a fair trade for it.\u201d With that, he threw out a very normal looking jade bottle. The bottle was filled with the river water he had stocked up on from the back mountain.Elder Ouyang\u2019s face was sullen. He was about to speak when carefully scanned the jade bottle. He frowned and said, \u201cI heard that, 500 years ago, several Nascent Soul cultivators of the Heng Yue Sect created a cultivation ground with spiritual energy several times higher than normal. I guess this liquid came from there?\u201dWhen the cap on the bottle was opened, a strong aura of spiritual power leaked out. Huang Long gave the jade bottle a look, then rubbed his beard. He said, \u201cThis brat. He even brought out a bottle of river water.\u201dElder Ouyang grunted. He weighed the bottle in his hand, then said, \u201cFriend Huang Long, your Heng Yue Sect has a very good disciple. Goodbye!\u201dWith that, he glanced at Wang Lin. After pondering for a while, he sent a message to Wang Lin, \u201cNephew-disciple Wang, I can let this matter about the centipede\u2019s poison go, but the Heng Yue Sect no longer has any Nascent Soul ancestors behind them, so stay at your own risk!\u201dWith that, he touched the thousand foot centipede. The centipede glared at Wang Lin and flew north.At that moment, Wang Lin noticed that, on top of that centipede, there was a pair of attractive eyes looking at him.He was stunned. His mind was still echoing with the words of elder Ouyang. As for the owner of that pair of attractive eyes, after looking at the person once, he didn\u2019t even take it to heart.After the Xuan Dao Sect had left, the entire pine peak was silent. Huang Long\u2019s eyes swept the area. Smiling, he said, \u201cToday\u2019s exchange is won by my Heng Yue Sect! All inner disciples will be rewarded! All of you can go to the pill house to get a bottle of spiritual energy gathering pills. You all have to follow Wang Lin\u2019s example.All of the inner disciples started to cheer one by one. As of now, no one dared to call him trash anymore.Wang Zhuo\u2019s heart was in chaos. He said to Xuan Dao, \u201cTeacher, disciple wants to go into the life and death passage. I will no longer concern myself with other affairs.\u201dDao Xu let out a sigh. Wang Zhuo was his favorite disciple, so he knew of the issues between Wang Lin and Wang Zhuo. He pondered for a while, then nodded and said, \u201cFine. You can take this opportunity to hide from Wang Lin as well.\u201dWang Zhuo let out a bitter smile, but didn\u2019t say word.Huang Long spoke again. \u201cAll of you can leave. Wang Lin, come with me.\u201dWang Lin nodded. His gaze swept the crowd and landed on third elder brother Lu Yun. He said, \u201cThird elder brother, wait a moment!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2013 QuestioningLu Yunjie shivered. He forced a smile and said, \u201cWang\u2026brother Wang do you need something? If you need some spiritual energy gathering pills, I still have a lot left and can give some to you.\u201d\u201cThird brother, there\u2019s something I want from you: your helper, Wang Hao.\u201d Wang Lin stared at Lu Yunjie. Before, he was not confident enough to go against Lu Yunjie, so he didn\u2019t help Wang Hao. But, after this battle, he had a much better understanding of his own power.Lu Yunjie\u2019s expression become unsettled. He bitterly laughed in his heart. He clenched his teeth and said, \u201cWang Lin, that Wang Hao is my helper and is very important to my pill creation, so I can\u2019t agree!\u201dHuang Long stood at the side, very puzzled, and shouted, \u201cLu Yunjie, it\u2019s only a helper. How important can he be?\u201dLu Yunjie\u2019s face was very bitter. He decided to bite the bullet and said, \u201cSect head, disciple can\u2019t obey. Wang Hao has already\u2026.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression quickly changed. He moved like lightning toward the Heng Yue Peak.Huang Long and the other elders were all confused and followed behind. Dao Xu grabbed Lu Yunjie as he followed Wang Lin.Soon, Wang Lin arrived above the pill house in the main courtyard. He scanned the the area with his divine sense and quickly found Wang Hao\u2019s weak life force in the back room. The moment he entered the room, his anger reached its limit.In the large room was a giant pill furnace with Wang Hao sitting cross legged inside. His life force was growing weaker and weaker.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even blink. He moved his hand and sent out his attraction technique to grab Wang Hao. As the hand formed by the technique came closer to the pill furnace, a rainbow colored light came out from the furnace and collided with the hand.Wang Lin coldly snorted. Immediately, the power of the attraction technique reached its peak and broke the rainbow colored light. Wang Lin gently grabbed Wang Hao and placed him on the ground.His placed his right hand on Wang Hao\u2019s forehead and remained silent.At that moment, Huang Long and the other elders arrived as well. The red face elder looked at the pill furnace, then at Wang Hao. His expression suddenly changed and he shouted, \u201cFire Furnace Trail!\u201dDao Xu carefully looked at Lu Yunjie, who was in his hand. He threw him on the ground and said, \u201cLu Yunjie, you sure have guts! Although this Fire Furnace Trial isn\u2019t banned, you can only use it on people outside the sect, and never on anyone inside! Did you forget?!\u201dLu Yunjie\u2019s face was completely pale. He kneeled on the ground and whispered, \u201cDisciple came, joined the sect, and became your disciple at age 15. It has been 25 years and disciple is still stuck at the 6th layer. Disciple is unwilling to give up. Once this Fire Furnace Trial is complete, the pill can not only extend my life, but will also give me a chance to break through, so I had to try, no matter what. This Wang Hao is my personal helper. According to the sect rules, I can do whatever I wish, and he is not part of the sect, so I have done nothing wrong!\u201dWang Lin opened his eyes. Before, Wang Hao\u2019s life was in critical condition, but after he sent spiritual energy into Wang Hao\u2019s body, he was able to save Wang Hao\u2019s life. After he heard Lu Yunjie\u2019s words, he let out a few snorts.Huang Long frowned. On one side was the genius Wang Lin, and on the other side was a faithful disciple of 25 years, Lu Yunjie. He found this decision very hard to make. After pondering for a while, he made a decision and said to Dao Xu, \u201cJunior brother Dao Xu, you are in charge of disciplinary actions. How do you want to deal with Lu Yunjie?\u201dThe moment Dao Xu heard this, he immediately understood sect head\u2019s decision and said, \u201c Lu Yunjie will go into seclusion for 20 years.\u201dHuang Long nodded and turned to Wang Lin. He kindly said, \u201cWang Lin, from now on, this Wang Hao will become an inner disciple. Consider it making it up to him. From now on, you can\u2019t go look for Lu Yunjie for trouble anymore. After all, you are all in the same sect.\u201dWang Lin glanced at Lu Yunjie and said, \u201cDisciple obeys!\u201dHuang Long waved his sleeves and said, \u201cOk, since the thing is resolved, Dao Xu, you deal with the matter here, including Wang Hao\u2019s retreatment. Wang Lin, you follow me.\u201d With that, he walked out of the room and then floated into the air.Dao Xu looked at Wang Lin and smiled, \u201cDisciple nephew Wang Lin, don\u2019t worry and leave Wang Hao to me. As long as he is still alive, I\u2019ll find a way for him to recover.\u201dWang Lin slightly nodded. After taking a look at Wang Hao, whose face had recovered a little, he left the pill house and followed Huang Long.Wang Lin had been thinking this whole time. He understood fully well why sect head Huang Long wanted to talk to him alone. Before long, Huang Long brought Wang Lin into the main hall. Then, he suddenly shouted, \u201cWang Lin, you sure have guts!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm and said, \u201cSect head, if you have something to say, just say it.\u201dHuang Long grunted and said, \u201cDuring that exchange, what technique did you really use?\u201dWang Lin chuckled and said, \u201cAttraction technique. If sect head doesn\u2019t believe me, you can have a closer look.\u201d With that, he activated the attraction technique and grabbed all the tables and chairs in the main hall. After making them circle the room a few times, he put them back to where they were.Huang Long carefully examined the technique, then began to ponder. After a long time, he suddenly asked, \u201cBefore, you were obviously at the 3rd layer and, even now, you still look like you are at the 3rd layer. How do you have so much power? What level are you at exactly? Wang Lin, tell me the truth!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s face revealed a bitter expression and said, \u201cDisciple doesn\u2019t really understand. I just kept on cultivating and it became like this. As for what level I have reached, disciple doesn\u2019t know.\u201dHuang Long stared at Wang Lin and said, in a deep voice, \u201cWang Lin, you\u2019re still not going to tell me?\u201dWang Lin wrily smiled and said, \u201cDisciple really doesn\u2019t know.\u201dHuang Long secretly sighed. He didn\u2019t want to pressure Wang Lin too much because, no matter what, Wang Lin was still a disciple of the Heng Yue Sect, and he had also just done the sect a great service. He will also very likely become a star among the inner disciples. Thinking about it, his expression became friendly and said, \u201cWhat was in that bottle you gave to the Xuan Dao Sect?\u201dWang Lin chuckled. He waved his right hand and took out two small bottles. He handed them to Huang Long and said, \u201cSect head is talking about this? Sect head should know these better than me. It\u2019s just the river water from the back mountain.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 \u2013 ElderHuang Long looked at the bottles and let out a snort. \u201cThe river water from the back mountain is not allowed to be taken out. I\u2019ll be taking these two bottles. You can go and rest. Remember to come meet me tomorrow and I\u2019ll take you to the scripture library to find a suitable cultivation technique for you,\u201d he said.After Wang Lin heard this, he became very excited. On his way out, he respectfully said goodbye. Although his current cultivation was high, his only technique was the attraction technique.After Wang Lin left, Huang Long turned. He respectfully bowed and said, \u201cElder Shangguan, do you think what Wang Lin said was true? And how should we deal with him?\u201dA skinny old man wearing a blue robe walked out into the main hall. His face was very gloomy.\u201cHow much of it is true? Huang Long, can you not tell that that little guy didn\u2019t say a single word of truth?\u201dHuang Long revealed an embarrassed expression. This was one of the ten foundation building elders. In the cultivation world, strength was what mattered the most. Him being the sect head and his fellow martial brothers being elders was only a front put up for the outside world.The rule of the Heng Yue Sect was that if one reached the Foundation Building stage, they could become an elder and enjoy that role\u2019s privileges. If one achieved Core Formation, then they would become one of the true elders of the Heng Yue Sect, and if one reached Nascent Soul, then they would be considered an ancestor of the Heng Yue Sect.Normally, the ten foundation building elders were in closed door training, but, after hearing the shocking news from the Xuan Dao Sect, Huang Long quickly found the ten elders to tell the two Core Formation true elders about this matter.Wang Lin\u2019s appearance was very unexpected for Huang Long, so he took the chance to bring Wang Lin here to question him and have the Foundation Building elders question him as well.Elder Shangguan took a look at the bottles in Huang Long\u2019s hand. He scanned them with his divine sense, then said, \u201cThis little brat did say one thing that was true. This is indeed the river water from the back mountain, and, if consumed every day, it will help with cultivation.\u201dHuang Long hesitated for a while. \u201cElder Shangguan, do you think the technique Wang Lin used was really the attraction technique?\u201d he asked.Elder Shangguan looked at Huang Long and said, \u201cI saw his matches and I can confirm that the technique he used really was the attraction technique.\u201dHuang Long\u2019s expression changed greatly. \u201cIs it really the attraction technique? But how could it be so powerful that it could even catch magical treasures?\u201d he asked.Elder Shangguan coldly snorted and said, \u201cAny technique, after practicing for an extensive period of time, will have some special effect, although it\u2019s nothing to Foundation Building cultivators. This attraction technique is the most basic technique in the cultivation world. Do you still not understand that the more basic the technique, the longer its history?\u201dHuang Long quickly nodded in agreement.Elder Shangguan pondered for a while, then said, \u201cThis child\u2019s cultivation is indeed at the 3rd layer, but he has way too much spiritual energy in his body, so I can\u2019t clearly check it all. My guess is that his power is that of 14th layer Qi Condensation, so he should be able to reach the Foundation Building stage soon. It is ok for a disciple like this to have his secrets, because the sect is in a very dangerous state. Hmph, the Xuan Dao Sect really deserves to be called a small sect. Sending some Qi Condensation juniors as elders and daring to try to win Wang Lin over in front of us with voice transmission!\u201dHuang Long was stunned. He didn\u2019t ask further about the voice transmission, but asked, \u201cHuang Long obeys. Elder Shangguan, regarding matters about the ancestors\u2026\u201dElder Shangguan let out a sigh. A scowl appeared on his face. He shook his head and said, \u201cThe ancestors haven\u2019t sent back any messages in 30 years, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 Alas, this is not something you can do anything about. If the Xuan Dao Sect really wants the Heng Yue Peak, then there is nothing we can do. The country of Zhao is a large place and will have a spot for our Heng Yue Sect. Once the two true elders break into Nascent Soul, hmph, all of this humiliation will be paid back.\u201dHuang Long let out a bitter smile and silently nodded.As for Wang Lin, after he walked out of the main hall, all of the inner disciples made way for him and were full of respect. This treatment was completely opposite compared to the day before.\u201cStrength, in the cultivation world strength is all that matters.\u201d Wang Lin felt a bit emotional as he walked back to Sun Dazhu\u2019s garden.The moment he entered, he immediately saw Sun Dazhu walk up with a smile on his face. \u201cGood disciple, teacher has been waiting for you for a long time. Here, have some top quality recovery tea teacher made for you. It will make you feel much better once you\u2019ve drank it.\u201dWith that, he picked up a cup from the stone table in the garden and handed it to Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression became a bit odd. Sun Dazhu\u2019s behavior changed too quickly, causing Wang Lin to be stunned for a bit.Sun Dazhu saw Wang Lin\u2019s expression. He awkwardly smiled and said, with a sincere look in his eyes, \u201cWang Lin, as your teacher, I wasn\u2019t every good and we had a lot of misunderstandings.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t take the cup. He scanned the tea with his divine sense and found fluctuations of spiritual energy. He said, \u201cDisciple is tired, so I won\u2019t be drinking this tea.\u201dSun Dazhu quickly said, \u201cTired? Then you must get some rest. The place you were staying at before is too small. From today on, you can live in my room.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm, but he was very cautious in his heart. It has to be said that, within the sect, Sun Dazhu was the one that would be most suspicious of him, so Wang Lin shook his head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t be staying for long. I\u2019ll return to the back mountain to go into closed door training in a few days.\u201dSun Dazhu opened his mouth to say something, but Wang Lin quickly said goodbye and left. Sun Dazhu looked at the tea in his hand. His eyes were filled with a cold light.Wang Lin suddenly turned around with a faint smile on his face and thoughtfully looked at Sun Dazhu.Sun Dazhu\u2019s face suddenly stiffened and he said, \u201cGood disciple, is there anything else?\u201dWang Lin revealed a sarcastic expression. He took a few steps forward and said, \u201cTeacher, you look very nervous.\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He took \u00a0two steps back and regained his composure. \u201cTeacher is indeed nervous. You, the disciple, are much stronger than me. I am only at the 5th layer of Qi Condensation,\u201d he said.Wang Lin looked at the tea and said, \u201cTeacher, drink this tea for disciple.\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s expression suddenly changed and he forced a smile. \u201cWhat is this? If you don\u2019t want to drink it, I\u2019ll just dump it.\u201d With that, he threw the cup to the ground and moved back a few more steps, until his feet were at the gate.\u201cTeacher, drink it.\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm. He activated his attraction technique. The cup that was falling to the ground stopped and floated toward Sun Dazhu. Wang Lin let out a sigh. He knew that Sun Dazhu had hostile intentions. There was indeed something wrong with the tea.Sun Dazhu\u2019s expression became unsettled. After pondering for a long time, he suddenly frowned and said, \u201cWang Lin, it seems you still have misunderstandings about your teacher. You believe there is something wrong with this tea? Fine, I\u2019ll drink it.\u201dSun Dazhu picked up the tea and drank it. Then, he threw the cup on the ground and said, with discontent, \u201cIs that ok? The sect head has asked me to talk to him. It will be bad if I\u2019m late. If there is anything else, let\u2019s talk afterward.\u201d With that, he turned to leave.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he moved his body. Sun Dazhu\u2019s expression changed and he quickly backed up, but how could his 5th layer cultivation compare to Wang Lin?In a moment, he arrived next to Sun Dazhu. His eyes lit up and he slapped Sun Dazhu\u2019s chest Before, when Sun Dazhu drank the tea, he realize that Sun Dazhu didn\u2019t really drink the tea, but surrounded it with spiritual energy.With that slap, Sun Dazhu\u2019s spiritual energy was scattered and the tea quickly dissolved into Sun Dazhu\u2019s body.Sun Dazhu\u2019s expression suddenly changed to one containing a hint of fury. He quickly said, \u201cWang Lin, what are you doing? Do you want to kill your teacher? If you kill me, the Heng Yue Sect will not forgive you!\u201dWang Lin remained silent. He sent out his divine sense and found that the tea had completely dissolved in Sun Dazhu\u2019s body. Then, he felt slivers of wires making their way from the tea to Sun Dazhu\u2019s head.Sun Dazhu also felt that something was wrong, but before he could speak, the wire-like object had already reached his head. Instantly, his grim expression started to relax.Wang Lin stared at Sun Dazhu and immediately realized that something was off. Sun Dazhu\u2019s expression seemed a bit dull.He pondered a little, then asked, \u201cTeacher, disciple is not trying to kill you, but you try to act against me. However, if teacher really did drink the tea, I wouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201dSun Dazhu\u2019s expression stayed dull. He quickly said, \u201cThe tea should not be drunk.\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He carefully examined Sun Dazhu for a while, then asked, \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be drunk?\u201dSun Dazhu said, with a dull expression, \u201cThere is Three Thread Nematode Grass in the tea.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat effect does the Three Thread Nematode Grass have?\u201d he asked.\u201cThe ability to control the person who drunk it for a short period of time. It is a key ingredient for making puppets.\u201dKilling intent flashed across Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy did you want me to take it?\u201d he asked.\u201cEver since I found out that you had those gourds, I had some doubts in my heart, so I took you in as my disciple. Originally, I wanted to get you to the first layer so I could use the soul searching technique on you, but I had already given you the Spiritual Energy Scattering Grass, so I thought it would take you more than ten years to reach the first layer and gave up on that idea. In the competition, you suddenly showed great strength, so I thought you must have had more of those gourds, and even other secrets. I want to increase my cultivation as well, so I thought of giving you this tea.\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath and asked, \u201cWhat is the Spiritual Energy Scattering Grass? Also, have you told anyone else about me? And why didn\u2019t you use this Three Thread Nematode Grass on me before?\u201d\u201cSpiritual Energy Scattering Grass is used to help remove all of your cultivation. As for the matter about you, I never told anyone. I didn\u2019t want anyone besides me to steal the gourds, and, after that, things changed too suddenly, so talking now would end up hurting me instead, so I decided to act.\u201d\u201cAs for the Three Thread Nematode Grass, I didn\u2019t have it before. I got it from another cultivator when I left the mountain last year. That cultivator said that if it\u2019s used on a cultivator below Foundation Building, it has a 90% success rate. I originally wanted to use it on Lun Yunjie, to get some pills out of him.\u201dWang Lin became furious and sneered. \u201cWere you not afraid of me finding out?\u201d\u201cIn order to find the secret you hold, I can\u2019t worry about too many things. I\u2019m already old. If i don\u2019t improve, then I will never be able to reach foundation building in my lifetime. In fact, I wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to come back today, so I decided to gamble and prepared this tea. If you came back, I would offer you the tea, and if you didn\u2019t, I assume you would be with the sect head and will live in the back mountain most of the time, so I wouldn\u2019t have another chance to act.\u201dA cold light flashed across Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. He coldly asked, \u201cBefore, you said that the sect head was looking for you. Is that true?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe moment Sun Dazhu\u2019s word came out, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he slammed his hand on Sun Dazhu\u2019s head. Blood started to pour out from Sun Dazhu\u2019s orifices and he fell on the ground.Wang Lin stared at Sun Dazhu\u2019s body. He felt an indescribable feeling. This was the first time he had killed anyone, and it was his teacher.After pondering for a long time, Wang Lin put away Sun Dazhu\u2019s body. He walked out of the Heng Yue Sect with a dull expression until he reached a mountain, then threw the body down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 \u2013 AncestorAfter returning to his room, Wang Lin sat cross legged on his bed. He spread out his divine sense and left a trace of it around his room in order to detect anyone who was trying to probe in with their divine sense.After that, he took out the mysterious bead and began to think. Around three days ago, all of the cloud images on the bead disappeared and were replaced by the image of a leaf.In regard to this, Situ Nan said that the heaven defying bead had enough water element and now needed wood element. Because of this, he had urged Wang Lin multiple times to leave the Heng Yue Sect to get material with wood element and quickly fill the heaven defying bead with it.Wang Lin had gained an understanding of his current power. He was currently at the 14th layer of Qi Condensation. However, he was curious about how he didn\u2019t need any of the chants and just progressed this far through cultivation. He suspected that it had something to do with Situ Nan.While holding the bead, he entered the dream space. Right as he was about to enter, he quickly put the bead away.The moment he entered the dream space, Situ Nan said, with discontent, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill those people in the competition earlier? If it was me, I would have killed all of the males and sucked dry all of the females, then used that centipede to make wine. It would be very nutritious. But one thing you did that suited my taste was killing that Sun Dazhu. Not bad. Just like me in my youth. Wang Lin, you have to remember that the cultivation world is a cruel place. The strong consume the weak. If you keep up your naive thinking, then I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t live for long.\u201dWang Lin pondered for a long time. \u201cSenior, should the next step be to prepare for Foundation Building? Junior doesn\u2019t know any chants to enter Foundation Building.\u201dSitu Nan snorted and said, \u201cI know the chant, but entering the Foundation Building stage is the true step into the world of cultivation and is very difficult. You should find a secluded place to go into closed door training in to help increase your chances of breaking through. Also, your spiritual spring water and snow water won\u2019t be enough anymore. When you enter Foundation Building, you need a lot of spiritual energy, so you better prepare some spiritual dew.Wang Lin nodded and said, \u201cThe dew is easy to get. It just requires a lot of time.\u201dSitu Nan sighed and said, \u201cThe Spirit Movement stage, which is also the Qi Condensation stage, is to use the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to refine the body. This has all been laying the foundation for the Foundation Building stage. As of now, you can already attempt to break into the Foundation Building stage, but I recommend you wait until you reach the 15th layer. Your talent isn\u2019t that good, and even though I\u2019ve been using my own essence to help you in these past few decades, entering the Foundation Building stage is a heaven defying act. If I still had my body, I would be able to just barely help you through it, but I can\u2019t do much now.\u201d\u201cIn addition to this, your means of attack is too simple. Just one technique won\u2019t do. But sadly, all the techniques I have require you to be at least at the Foundation Building stage to use. You should quickly reach the Foundation Building stage so I can pass the Underworld Ascension Method to you.\u201dWang Lin was stunned and said, \u201cUnderworld Ascension Method?\u201dSitu Nan proudly said, \u201cCorrect. Hehe, even in my home, a rank 6 country, it is still a top quality method. Unfortunately, it requires a place with a lot of yin element, or the cultivation will be too slow, but the cold spiritual energy it creates is incredibly powerful. Hmph, once you have reached the peak of this method, you can even fight against the experts of rank 7 countries. This is settled. Tomorrow, you can go to the scripture library of this small sect and see what they have, but, once you reach Foundation Building, you must practice the Underworld Ascension Method.\u201dWang Lin pondered for a bit and nodded.\u201cAlso, Wang Lin, it\u2019s best that you don\u2019t put the heaven defying bead in your bag of holding. Place it as close to your chest as possible, so I can still communicate with you when you\u2019re not in the dream space, and you can enter the dream space through me.\u201dTime slowly passed as Situ Nan talked. After two days in the dream space, Wang Lin woke up.He sat cross legged and put the bead close to chest, then took a drink of the spiritual liquid and cultivated all night in silence. The next morning, Wang Lin opened the door. His body floated into the air as he moved toward the main hall.The moment he arrived in the air of the main hall, Huang Long walked out and let out a kind smile when he saw Wang Lin. The smile on his face was much warmer than it was yesterday. He said, \u201cWang Lin, come with me.\u201dWith that, he waved his sleeves and jumped into the air. Wang Lin quickly followed behind. After a while, they arrived at a sub peak of the Heng Yue Mountain, the pine peak.When they passed over the area where the competition was held yesterday, Huang Long didn\u2019t stop, but flew straight past it and went deeper into the pine peak, until he stopped in front of some strange rocks and said, \u201cWang Lin, this is a restricted place in the Heng Yue Sect. This is where the Core Formation true elders and Foundation Building elders cultivate, so don\u2019t carelessly spread out your divine sense, or you might offend them.\u201dWang Lin immediately agreed.Huang Long took a deep breath. He took out a piece of purple jade and threw it into the air. Then, he formed a seal with his hand, swiped his hand through the air, and whispered, \u201cOpen!\u201dThe piece of jade quickly started to shine and a circle started to expand from it, forming a circular passage wide enough for one person to pass through.Huang Long didn\u2019t say a word and walked inside. Wang Lin hesitated a little and followed him in.The moment he entered, his eyes blurred. When his eyes cleared up, he saw a few old and tall buildings. The buildings gave off a very heavy aura, making him feel like he couldn\u2019t breath in here.Meanwhile, 7 to 8 powerful divine senses came out and scanned him. Then, a slow and ancient voice came out:\u201cSo you are Wang Lin. Not bad.\u201dWang Lin became alert and respectfully said, \u201cDisciple Wang Lin greets elder.\u201d And at the same time, Situ Nan\u2019s voice echoed in his mind, \u201cThis place makes it look much more like what a small sect should be. 2 Core Formation and 10 Foundation Building cultivators, not bad.\u201dHuang Long\u2019s expression suddenly changed and growled, \u201cWhat, elder? This is ancestor!\u201dWang Lin was stunned. The voice came again. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Sect customs are useless here. Wang Lin, this time, you have done a great deed for the sect, so you can choose any technique you like in this scripture library. This scripture library can\u2019t be compared to the one in the courtyard. This is where the real techniques of the Heng Yue Sect are stored. There are more than 10,000 techniques inside this library. If you were to take this library and compare it to all of the other sects in the country of Zhao, there is no other sect with a larger collection. You must not be too greedy and you must pick the right one! Huang Long, you can take him there now.\u201dIn Wang Lin\u2019s mind, Situ Nan scornfully said, \u201cA mere Core Formation as ancestor? When I was young, all of the Core Formation cultivators tried to suck up to me, and some of the female Core Formation cultivators would even take off their pants to try to sleep with me.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal, as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything Situ Nan just said.Huang Long quickly and respectfully responded. He pulled Wang Lin to one of the buildings. This building gave off a very ancient atmosphere. It looked like an old library.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u2013 CalamityOutside the building, Huang Long stopped and whispered to Wang Lin, \u201cHere is the scripture library. You can go inside. On the first floor are mainly techniques for the Qi Condensation stage. You can look around in there, but focus your attention on the second floor, because that\u2019s where the techniques for foundation building stage are. I\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201dWang Lin was a bit nervous. He took a deep breath and walked inside. This building had four floors. On the first floor were numerous pieces of green jade, floating on shelves and emitting green light.Situ Nan mocked, \u201cThere is no need to look. What kind of things are there? These are all low quality techniques. Back then, I won\u2019t even bother to look at them.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t rush up to the second floor or listen to Situ Nan\u2019s words. He walked to each piece of jade and checked out what techniques were inside them. His hand also formed seal to test out the techniques.Wang Lin picked up a piece of jade and closely looked at it. \u201cTop quality technique \u2013 Fire Dragon.\u201dSitu Nan immediately said, \u201cPiece of shit top quality technique. This is clearly the low quality fire control technique. My soul fire technique is a real top quality technique.\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He put it down and picked up another one.\u201cTop quality technique \u2013 Earth Escape.\u201d\u201cTrash, complete trash! Where I come from, you can get this from anywhere and they dare to call it a top quality technique! My five element escape is a real top quality technique!\u201d\u201cTop quality technique \u2013 Wind Blade.\u201d\u201cThis is still trash! I know Howling Gale. It is 100 times more powerful!\u201d\u201cNine day thunder formation.\u201d\u201cWhat is all all crap? It is clearly just a bad thunder technique. Why give it such an powerful sounding name? Trash!\u201d\u201cImmortal transformation.\u201d\u201cThis is kind of interesting, but still trash. I know greater immortal transformation. It is 100 times more powerful.\u201dSitu Nan mocked each technique one by one, making Wang Lin frown even more. He finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and went to the second floor.There weren\u2019t as many jades on the second floor, just a few dozen jade floating in the air.Situ Nan lazily said, \u201cAll of these are low quality. There is no need to look at them.\u201dWang Lin wrily smiled and thought, \u201cYou are a senior from a rank 6 cultivation country, of course none of these techniques are good enough for you.\u201dSitu Nan urged, \u201cWang Lin, you don\u2019t need to look at this. Quickly find a place to go into closed door training in, and, once you reach foundation building, you can leave this small sect.\u201dThe previous mood of anticipation had all been destroyed by Situ Nan, so Wang Lin walked out of the scripture library, frowning.When Huang Long saw Wang Lin leaving, he was stunned and asked, \u201cYou picked that quickly? You have to carefully choose. This scripture library contains the best techniques in the cultivation country of Zhao. Other people don\u2019t even have the qualifications to enter. You shouldn\u2019t waste it.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression was a bit odd. Situ Nan\u2019s mocking and elder\u2019s praise caused a large conflict in his heart. He said, \u201cDisciple has already chosen.\u201dHuang Long frowned and was about to ask him which technique he chose when the the entire pine peak suddenly started to shake.\u201cI am Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s Pu Nanzi. Juniors of the Heng Yue Sect, quickly come out and greet me.\u201dHuang Long\u2019s expression suddenly changed. At that moment, more than ten figures rushed out from the surrounding buildings. The two figures in front were the most noticeable. One of those two had a red complexion with eyes that were clear and piercing.Next to him was a old woman. Her face was full of wrinkles and was very gloomy. She coldly looked at Huang Long and Wang Lin, then silently looked into the sky.Behind those two were ten elders, all with bitter expressions on their faces.Situ Nan\u2019s seriously said, \u201cWang Lin, there is a nascent soul cultivator outside. The Heng Yue Sect is in big trouble now. You should find the chance and escape. With me here, I can temporarily make it so that he can\u2019t sense you. Hmph, if I had my body, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid of a mere Nascent Soul.\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath. His expression was very unsettled.The red faced old man loudly said, \u201cSenior Pun Nan, I don\u2019t know why you have come to my Heng Yue Sect. Please tell us.\u201dA tall figure appeared in the air. His face was very dignified and said, in a low voice, \u201cIf it was 500 years ago, I would be intimidated by the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s defense formation, but, looking at it now, it is only so so. After I have broken this formation, I\u2019ll talk to you juniors.\u201dWith that, he waved his hand and a small black colored hill appeared. This small hill started moving and created wind, which soon created a giant tornado. Both of his hands formed a seal and a few very complex words came out of his mouth.The giant hill slammed down toward the ground. A light screen appeared between the pine peak and the Heng Yue peak. The light screen formed a concave bowl and blocked the blow for the Heng Yue Sect.\u201cNo less from a great sect from 500 years ago. This defensive formation will have some advanced techniques behind it. It can spread the power of the impact around, but I have to see without a nascent soul to maintain it how many of my attack can it take.\u201d Pun Nanzi let out a cold smile, his hand quickly moved and formed another giant tornado and slammed down again.The red faced man\u2019s expression became pale. He swiped in the air before him and created a rift. He quickly went into the rift and the people behind him followed.Huang Long quickly whispered, \u201cWang Lin, follow closely.\u201d With that, his body shot like an arrow and went into the rift.Wang Lin took a step and closely followed behind them.At that moment, the tornado smashed down again. A thunderous roar appeared when the tornado hit the light screen. Rainbow color lights shone from the light screen, which was barely holding up.Wang Lin entered the rift. After he exited the rift, he appeared again on the stage on the pine peak. Right now, the red faced man and the old woman sat on top of one of the 8 white jade pillar. Their hands formed many different seals while chanting some complicated chants..On the other six white jade pillars sat six other foundation building elders. Each of their faces were bitter and unsettled.The old woman said, \u201cHuang Long, quickly, gather all of the inner disciples here. The greatest disaster my Heng Yue Sect will face is this.\u201d With that, she spit out a mouthful of core energy into the white pillar.Huang Long\u2019s body shook. Without a word, he charged toward the bridge back to the Heng Yue Peak.\u201cHmph. It was able to withstand two attacks. Break for me on this third attack!\u201d Pun Nanzi let out a cold snort. He spit out a mouth full of Nascent Soul energy into the small hill and it grew 10 time its size, covering the sky over pine peak.With a bang, one of the white jade pillars broke and the foundation building elder on top of the white pillar bleed from his orifices and fell onto the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2013 Powerful\u201cBreak for me! Break! Break!\u201d Pun Nanzi\u2019s expression became serious. His hands were constantly swinging as the giant tornado slammed against the mountain.All of the people in the surrounding towns and villages were too scared to go outside, so they hid in their houses. The more brave people looked out of their windows and saw a giant mountain floating in the air, constantly slamming down.Another white jade broke and another Foundation Building elder coughed out a mouthful of blood and fell down.Pun Nanzi took out a purple gourd. His hand formed a seal and he spoke some complicated chants. The gourd trembled and red liquid came out of it. The moment the liquid appeared, it lit on fire and surrounded the tornado.\u201cBreak!\u201d Pun Nanzi let out a roar and slammed the flaming tornado down. With a boom, numerous cracks appeared on the light screen and began to spread.Two more white jades broke and two more elders fell down.Of the eight white pillars, only 4 remained. Aside from the two Core Formation elders, the two Foundation Building elders\u2019 faces were completely ashen and their bodies trembled. They had clearly reached their limit.Huang Long had already brought all of the inner disciples here. All of their faces were filled with shock and fear. Wang Hao was also among them. His face was still pale, but a lot better than before. When he saw Wang Lin, he walked up to him and stared dumbfounded into the sky, unable to say a word.Pun Nanzi\u2019s face was dark as he floated in the sky. This defense formation\u2019s strength was beyond his expectation. He knew that this formation wasn\u2019t at full powerful. If there was a Nascent Soul cultivator controlling it, it would be a lot more powerful.Right now, this formation could only defend and do nothing else, but, if there was a Nascent Soul cultivator here, its power would be terrifying.As the red faced elder watched his Foundation Building juniors fall one by one, his heart bled. He shouted,\u201cSenior Pun Nanzi, your Xuan Dao Sect has always had a good relationship with our Heng Yue Sect. Do you really want to kill us all?\u201dPun Nanzi snorted and said, \u201cLiu Wenju, you went from being just a junior 500 years ago to a core member of the Heng Yue Sect and have even reached Core Formation. It is a shame to destroy this formation. If you open it yourself, things will be easier for you all.\u201dThe Core Formation expert, Liu Wenju, hesitated and the old woman suddenly shouted, in an angry voice, \u201cSenior Pun Nanzi, I can\u2019t obey!\u201dPun Nanzi let out a crazed laugh. His face sunk and he shouted. \u201cFine! This defense formation, break for me!\u201d With that, he waved his hand and the giant tornado rose high in the air. His face turned red as he spat out more Nascent Soul energy and the tornado grew even larger.\u201cFall!\u201d Pun Nanzi\u2019s hand seal changed and he signaled the tornado to go down.The giant tornado released buzzing sounds as it pushed down a bit more.With a cracking sound, the cracks in the light screen increased and another white pillar broke as another Foundation Building elder fell.The giant tornado fell another inch and the last Foundation Building elder coughed out a mouthful of blood and fell down.\u201cBreak!\u201d With Pun Nanzi\u2019s shout, the giant tornado pressed down and sunk three inches. The pine peak shook. With a thunderous roar, the entire mountain sunk dozens of meters into the ground.The stone bridge connected to the Heng Yue Sect broke in half and fell down the cliff.Meanwhile, the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s defense formation finally couldn\u2019t hold out anymore and shattered into tiny pieces and disappeared.The last two white jade pillars broke and Liu Wenju and the old woman fell onto the ground with bitter expressions, unable to say a word.Pun Nanzi let out a cold snort. He slowly floated to the ground and the giant tornado still floated in the air, releasing a powerful pressure.After Pun Nanzi landed, he said, with a cold expression, \u201cWho here is Wang Lin?\u201dWang Lin had already backed up into the crowd of inner disciples. He never thought that the first thing this Nascent Soul expert would do was look for him.All of the surrounding disciples\u2019 gazes turned to him. Pun Nanzi scanned the group and his gaze fell on Wang Lin. He raised his brow and figured that this must be Wang Lin. Before, his junior Ouyang had mentioned Wang Lin many times and said that their losses were entirely due to Wang Lin. He really wanted to recruit Wang LinPun Nanzi had always wanted the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s land. This time, he thought that, with Zhou Peng, they would win for sure and would take over the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s land without openly using force.But this Wang Lin\u2019s appearance disrupted his plan and forced him to appear and forcibly take the land.Pun Nanzi\u2019s demeanor was cold as he asked, \u201cYou are Wang Lin?\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath. He clasped his hands and respectfully said, \u201cDisciple is Wang Lin, and he greets senior Pun Nanzi.\u201dPun Nanzi nodded his head. He turned to Liu Wenju and the Core Formation old woman and said, \u201cThe Nascent Soul ancestors of the Heng Yue Sect have all died fighting in another country. You guys no longer have the ability to keep this Heng Yue mountain. Instead of letting another sect steal it, why not give it to my Xuan Dao Sect?\u201dLiu Wenju gave the old woman a bitter look and said, \u201cSenior, please consider the good relationship between the two sects and not\u2026\u201dWithout letting Liu Wenju finish speaking, Pun Nanzi interrupted him and impatiently said, \u201c\u201dLeave! Besides the people, nothing else can leave! If you keep bugging me, I don\u2019t mind wiping out the entire sect!\u201dThe old woman became furious and was about to charge in when Liu Wenju stopped her. He took a deep breath and respectfully said, \u201cJunior obeys, but this Heng Yue Mountain has been our sect for thousands of years and junior doesn\u2019t have the right to give it away. Junior can only agree to lend it. If in the future\u2026\u201dPun Nanzi sneered. He once again interrupted and said, \u201cLend? That\u2019s fine. Lend it to my Xuan Dao Sect for 100,000 years.\u201dAll of the inner disciples were furious, but none of them dared to display it. They all felt very depressed and stayed silent. Some of the disciples began to think about themselves.Pun Nanzi\u2019s face swept the area and landed on Huang Long. He said, \u201cYou. Leave behind your Purple Moon Sword. My junior Ouyang has his eyes on it.\u201dHuang Long endured the humiliation and clenched his hands. He looked toward Liu Wenju and the old woman. When he found that they were waiting for him, he let out sigh, took out the sword, and threw it on the ground.Pun Nanzi grabbed with his right hand and the purple moon sword flew into his hand. The moment the sword entered his grasp, a purple gas came out of the sword and formed into a giant dragon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u2013 Sect ScattersThe dragon roared at Pun Nanzi and attacked him.Pun Nanzi sneered. He flicked the sword and said, \u201cAnimal, restrain yourself!\u201dThe dragon\u2019s body shook and immediately lost its will. It reluctantly returned back into the sword. The sword stopped glowing.Liu Wenju and the old woman looked at each other and let out a sigh. She said, \u201cFine. All Heng Yue Sect disciples, listen to my order: follow me off the mountain.\u201d With that, she took a look around and let out another sigh before floating up into the air.Pun Nanzi narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cMy Xuan Dao Sect is going to recruit more disciples. If anyone wishes to join, they can stay here.\u201dThe ten Foundation Building elders\u2019 faces all turned strange. Besides the two who were next to the old woman, the other eight didn\u2019t follow her.Liu Wenju\u2019s expression changed. He wanted to say something, but ended up staying silent. He let out another sigh, then shook his head and stood next to the old woman.The old woman suppressed the anger in her heart and shouted, \u201cEveryone has their own path. If anyone doesn\u2019t want to follow us, I won\u2019t force you.\u201dAmong Haung Long\u2019s generation, all of the elders hesitated and, in the end, besides Huang Long, Dao Xu, and the red faced elder, none of the other elders moved. Only those three moved and stood next to the two Core Formation elders.Among the dozens of inner disciples, only about 10 or so flew next to the Core Formation elders. Wang Zhuo hesitated for a long time. He didn\u2019t dare to look at Dao Xu as he raised his foot and put it down. Ultimately, he didn\u2019t follow.The female named Zhou hesitated for a while, but didn\u2019t follow. As for the female named Xu, she saw that Wang Zhuo didn\u2019t move, so she pulled back the step she took forward.Wang Hao could already walk. He wrily smiled and said to Wang Lin, \u201cBrother Tie Zhu, I\u2019m not going to go anywhere. I plan on heading home and helping my dad. Don\u2019t worry, brother Tie Zhu, I\u2019ll take care of your family.\u201dWang Lin hesitated. He had too many secrets and, if he joined the Xuan Dao Sect, there would be too many uncertain dangers, so, after pondering for a while, he started to move.At that moment, Pun Nanzi\u2019s eyes lit up as he stared at Wang Lin. He suddenly said, \u201cWang Lin, you stay!\u201dWang Lin was stunned and respectfully said, \u201cSenior Pun Nanzi, why do you want junior to stay?\u201dPun Nanzi raised his head and said, \u201cIf I tell you to stay, you stay. What\u2019s with all the questions?!\u201dLiu Wenju hesitated for a while and suddenly said, \u201cSenior Pun Nanzi, this Wang Lin is my Heng Yue Sect\u2019s head disciple, so I would like to request senior not to make it hard on him and let him leave with us.\u201c He had heard a few things about Wang Lin and also observed him for a bit. He was really unwilling to give up this future Foundation Building disciple.Pun Nanzi grunted and said to Wang Lin, \u201cThe Heng Yue Sect only exist in name. Are you going to follow them as they drift around the world? If you join my Xuan Dao Sect, your future will be much brighter. You decide for yourself what you want. You wouldn\u2019t want rumors to spread, would you? Rumors saying that my Xuan Dao Sect not only stole the mountain, but the disciples a well.Pun Nanzi was confident that, unless this Wang Lin was retarded, he wouldn\u2019t follow the Heng Yue Sect.Wang Lin pondered a little. Without a word, he clasped his hands, rose into the air, and stood next to Huang Long.Pun Nanzi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cUngrateful brat!\u201d he said.Liu Wenju and the old woman gave Wang Lin thoughtful looks. They waited for a while longer, but after seeing all of the disciples of the Heng Yue Sect with their heads down, the old woman let out a sigh and said, \u201cFine, let\u2019s go.\u201dWith that, she flew off into the distance. The other ten or so people followed her with bitter expressions.The people of the Heng Yue Sect followed the two Core Formation elders and flew away from the Heng Yue Sect like homeless dogs.Along the way, no one said a word. Besides anger, they were filled with a sense of loss.After flying for a long time, until the sky darkened, Liu Wenju and the old woman debated for a while, then landed on the side of a mountain.The old woman let out a sigh. She looked at the people around her. Besides the two Foundation Building elders, everyone else was at the Qi Condensation stage. There were only four people from Huang Longs generation and 12 people from Wang Lin\u2019s generation. She bitterly smiled and forced herself to calm down. She said, \u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t lose heart just because the Heng Yue Sect has met this disaster. Things always change in the cultivation world. Today, he stole the Heng Yue Mountain from us, but, once I and ancestor Liu reach Nascent Soul, we will be able to take it back!\u201dAmong the two Foundation Building elders was elder Shang Guan, who observed Wang Lin in the main hall a few days ago. He let out a dry cough and said, \u201cAncestor Wang is correct. The more miserable we feel now, the higher our fighting spirit will be. We must carve this humiliation into our hearts. If we are successful in the future, we must take back the mountain!\u201dThe other Foundation Building elder had a wide face and body. His face was filled with worry as he looked at the remaining disciples and said, \u201cWhen disaster came, everyone flew in different directions. In the end, only you guys were willing to follow us from Heng Yue Sect.\u201d he sighed.Among the inner disciples that followed, aside from brother Zhang and Lu Song, Wang Lin didn\u2019t know the names of any of them, but they looked familiar.There was also a little fatty, which was the person he met outside the word pavilion.Liu Wenju took a deep breath and said, with a serious expression, \u201cThere is no point in dwelling on the past. The most important thing right now is to find a place to house our sect. Many years ago, I built a house at a snake-like mountain thousands of kilometers from here. For now, let\u2019s go live there.\u201dThe old woman pondered for a while. She nodded and said, \u201cThat is good. Once we reach it, we must go into closed door training and reach Nascent Soul within 100 years.\u201dLiu Wenju\u2019s gaze shifted. He said to the two Foundation Building elders, \u201cShang Guan and Song Yu, you two stand guard while I and ancestor Wang recover the spiritual energy used on maintaining the formation. Then, we can carry all of you to move faster.\u201dShang Guan and Song Yu quickly did as they were told.Liu Wenju took out a few pieces of green jade. He tossed them into the air and they began emit a green light. His hand formed a few seals and the green jade suddenly shook and created a dome of green light that covered everything within a 20 meters radius.After that, he sat down cross legged and held a spirit stone in his hand and began to cultivate. The old woman did the same and began to cultivate to recover her spiritual energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 \u2013 Sect MourningHuang Long touched his bag of holding and looked toward the Heng Yue Sect with a complex expression. Dao Xu stood at his side and said, \u201cSect head, there will be a time when we will take back the Heng Yue Mountain.\u201dHuang Long bitterly smiled and said, \u201cThe purple moon sword was given to me by ancestor Liu when I became the sect head. I told him that as long as the sword is there, I\u2019ll be there, but now, alas.\u201dThe red faced elder named Ma darkly said, \u201cSect Head, the Xuan Dao Sect had a Nascent Soul cultivator. Not fighting him was the logical thing to do. There is no need to feel remorse about things like this. The cultivation world has always been like this. Back when the heng Yue Sect was powerful, we did the same thing.\u201dHuang Long secretly sighed and didn\u2019t say a word.Wang Lin sat down cross legged in the corner, looking at the Heng Yue mountain. All of this happened too quickly and he was still in a state of shock, but he was mostly worried about his parents.After pondering for a while, he still couldn\u2019t set aside his worries. He was afraid that the Xuan Dao Sect disciples would go find his parents for revenge. Thinking about this, a cold light appeared in Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. Although he didn\u2019t want to kill people, if they wanted to hurt his parents, he wouldn\u2019t mind killing them.Situ Nan proudly boasted, \u201cThis is the right way, Wang Lin. Hehe, you should have been like this a long time ago. It\u2019s only killing people, what\u2019s the big deal? I have 10,000 ways for people to wish they were dead.\u201dWang Lin frowned and said to Situ Nan, \u201cKilling people is no the solution to this problem. If I kill one, there will be another, unless I kill all of the disciples of the Xuan Dao Sect.\u201dSitu Nan kept trying to push him. \u201cWhat\u2019s so difficult about that? I\u2019ll teach you a technique, the puppet technique. Then, you can capture someone and reform them into a loyal puppet. How\u2019s that? With this, you will be able to live worry free.\u201dJust as Situ Nan finished speaking, the fat youth from the sword pavilion came up to Wang Lin and sat down next to him. He wrily smiled and said, \u201cHead senior brother, my name is Huang Dashan. In the future, please take care of junior here.\u201dWang Lin glanced at the other, but, before he could respond, the black clothed disciple named Zhang came and said, \u201cHuang Dashan, if you have time, you should cultivate more instead of asking someone to take care of you.\u201dHuang Dashan wrily smiled and said, \u201cThe sect is gone. Among the inner disciples left, senior brother Wang Lin is the strongest. No matter how much I cultivate, I won\u2019t be able to beat him, so I might as well be his underling.\u201dBrother Zhang turned and looked at Wang Lin. He remembered when he brought the three disciples up to the mountain to be tested to join the sect. He secretly sighed and said, \u201cWang Lin, your progress has really been unexpected. I truly admire you.\u201dWang Lin let out a wry smile, but was unable to say anything. He always had a lot of respect for brother Zhang. Brother Zhang was one of the few inner disciples in the sect that not only had never mocked him, but even encouraged him.At this point, Lu Song walked toward the three, frowning, and said, \u201cZhang Dekun, we haven\u2019t seen each other for several years and you have finally reached the 6th layer. Do you still remember the promise from 10 years ago?\u201dBrother Zhang\u2019s eyes lit up. He stared at Lu Song and said, \u201cOf course I remember.\u201dLu Song let out a sigh. He sat down next Wang Lin, then patted Wang Lin\u2019s shoulder and said \u201cWang Lin, the Heng Yue Sect exist only in name. I\u2019ll say something ugly. If you had stayed at the Xuan Dao Sect, you would have a much better future than coming here with us.\u201dWith that, he bitterly smiled at brother Zhang and said, \u201cZhang Dekun, your stubborn temper is still the same as ever. What\u2019s the point of that 10 year promise when the sect doesn\u2019t even exist anymore? Sigh.\u201dWang Lin looked at Lu Song. He moved his shoulder to get away from Lu Song and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t elder brother Lu Song also not stay at the Xuan Dao Sect?\u201dLu Song shook his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me elder brother. According to the rules, I should be calling you elder brother. Hehe, if I were stay there, I would have no future, because I have offended too many people in the Xuan Dao Sect.\u201dZhang Dekun coldly said, \u201cNot only have you offended people from the Xuan Dao Sect, you have offended a lot of people in the Heng Yue Sect as well.\u201dLu Song raised his head. He looked at Zhang Dekun and sighed. \u201cJunior brother Zhang, before I became a core disciple, I was a very hated person, but that was in the past. What use is there in talking about it now? Back then, there was only one slot for a core disciple that year, and I had to help. I offer my apologies to you, junior brother Zhang.\u201dZhang Dekun\u2019s face remained cold and he didn\u2019t say a word. During the competition for the core disciple slot that year, he was up against one of Lu Song\u2019s relatives. Before the fight, Lu Song appeared and injured him, causing him to lose the fight.Lu Song told him that he was not convinced then he could find Lu Song in 10 years to fight again.Lu Song honestly said, \u201cBrother Zhang, I\u2019ll do my best to make up for what happened 10 years ago, but, currently, the sect is in hardship, so us inner disciples should band together. Forget the disciples under 5th layer. Between us four, Huang Dashan is at the 5th layer, Zhang Dekun is at the 6th layer, and I\u2019m at the 8th layer. So, what layer are you at Wang Lin?\u201dWang Lin saw that everyone was looking at him. He for pondered a little, then honestly answered, \u201c14th layer of Qi Condensation.\u201dThe moment the words were said, the three people next to him all sucked in breaths of cold air. They all knew Wang Lin was strong, but they didn\u2019t expect him to be this strong.Lu Song\u2019s mouth dried up. He wrily smiled and said, \u201cCongratulations elder brother Wang. You will soon reach the Foundation Building stage. When that happens, I\u2019ll have to call you elder.\u201dZheng Dekun gave Wang Lin a deep and thoughtful look before letting out a sigh, while Huang Dashan\u2019s eyes lit up.The other surrounding inner disciples carefully observed the four. The few with sharper ears heard what Wang Lin said. Their eyes were filled with even more respect towards him.Lu Song took a deep breath and said, \u201cSenior brother Wang Lin, from now on, we are the top disciples in the Heng Yue Sect. You will be the Elder Senior disciple, I\u2019ll be the second disciple, Zhang Dekun will be 3rd and Huang Dashan will be the 4th. We should from now our share our experience and form a group. What do you think?\u201dWang Lin pondered for a little. Before he could say anything, Huang Dashan quickly said, \u201cWhat second senior brother said is correct. That is how it should be.\u201dZhang Dekun hesitated for a while. He nodded and said, \u201cThere should be leaders among the inner disciples. This will help the elders and make it so that they have less things to worry about.\u201dWhen Wang Lin saw that the other two had already agreed, he nodded in agreement. He didn\u2019t really care about this matter as he had other plans.Just at that moment, Liu Wenju and the old woman opened their eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 \u2013 (Untitled)Liu Wenju got up and took out a piece of jade. He threw it into the air and quickly formed several seals with this hand. He then spit out a mouthful of core energy and the jade started to spin in the air.The old woman named Wang also tossed out a piece of jade. It fused with the first jade. The jade kept spinning and released rainbow colored light. The rays of rainbow colored light fell onto the ground and covered everything within a ten meter radius of the jade until it formed a disc of light.Liu Wenju looked at Wang Lin\u2019s group of four and said, \u201cThe four of you, aside from Wang Lin, will be in charge of protecting the other inner disciples because there will be powerful fluctuations, so be careful not to fall off. Also, Huang Long and you three, you will be in charge of 2 disciples each. Shang Guan, you two and Wang Lin will be in charge of keeping balance on the sides.With that, he stepped onto the disc and the old woman followed behind.The others immediately followed Liu Wenju\u2019s order and took charge of a disciple and walked onto the disc. The two foundation building elders and Wang Lin formed a triangle while standing at the edges.Liu Wenju took a deep breath. His hand formed a seal and he shouted, \u201cRise!\u201dThe surroundings started to tremble. The light disc began to rise, then it flew off into the distance at a very fast speed.This speed was several times faster than flying swords. A moment after it started moving, the inner disciples couldn\u2019t withstand it anymore. If there was no one helping them, they would have fallen off already.All of the force the inner disciples were experiencing got transferred to Shang Guan, Song Yu, and Wang Lin via a mysterious method.Wang Lin felt a huge force hitting his body. He almost fell off, but he used his attraction technique to stabilize his body. Even so, he felt his body tremble as if he was going to be thrown off.He looked at Shang Guan and Song Yu and found that the two elders were very relaxed and didn\u2019t look even a bit strained. Wang Lin secretly sighed and thought, \u201cNo wonder they are foundation building elders, not something I can match.\u201dSitu Nan dismissively said, \u201cThis is nothing special. It is simply an air travel technique. Back when I used the air travel technique, I could carry 10,000 people and didn\u2019t need people to keep balance!\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He said, \u201cThere is no need to compare yourself every time. I already know you are powerful.\u201dSitu Nan snorted and said, \u201cWhen I had my body, I wouldn\u2019t even bother with a junior like you. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that you\u2019re the only person who can hear me, I wouldn\u2019t even talk to you.\u201dNot long after, the light disc\u2019s speed became even faster. Wang Lin barely managed to keep his body stable. He secretly complaining the whole time. Then, a dark cloud suddenly appeared in front of them.This dark cloud was very strange. Lights arched within the cloud and its speed was also very fast. It looked like it was about to collide with the light disc. Liu Wenju\u2019s face sank and he said, \u201cShang Guan, Song Yu, Wang Lin, you three, keep yourselves steady!\u201dWith that, he took a deep breath and formed a seal. The light disc paused for a bit, then quickly moved in an arc around the black clouds.This sudden stop and start of the light disc caused an enormous amount of pressure on everyone on board. Almost everyone immediately fell down. Some of the inner disciples were even sent flying and one of them flew in Wang Lin\u2019s direction.Wang Lin was already barely able to keep his body steady. With the sudden stop and start, the burst of force made his body unstabilized and caused him to move back.A cold energy came out of the mysterious bead on his chest and entered this body. After the energy made its way through his body, it helped stabilize his body on the disc.The moment the inner disciple that was thrown out arrived in front of Wang Lin, he could see the fearful look on that disciple\u2019s face. Without a word, Wang Lin grabbed the disciple\u2019s hand and, with a spin, threw him back into the disc.After doing all of that, he let out a breath. He knew that that cold energy was from Situ Nan. Just when he was about to thank Situ Nan, he heard a voice from the dark cloud.\u201cFellow cultivators of the Heng Yue Sect, have you all met my Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s ancestor, Pun Nanzi?\u201dWang Lin turned his head. He saw a giant centipede come out of the black cloud. In front was elder Ouyang and behind him were 7 or 8 people, all sneering at them.Three of them released powerful auras and coldly looked at Liu Wenju and the old woman named Wang.The person who just spoke was a black faced man among the three powerful ones.Liu Wenju\u2019s face was very grim. He didn\u2019t say a word and quickly made the light disc fly even faster, pulling away from the dark cloud without even turning his head around. Soon, the large dark cloud was only a dark spot in the sky.After a long time, the scene on the ground started to change. Patches of desert started to appear, reflecting the change in location. The light disc circled the area for a bit, as if it was searching for something. Suddenly, it sped to the north until it reached the peak of a mountain and slowly landed on it.The moment the light disc landed on the ground, all of the inner disciples fell to the ground and started puking. Their faces were very pale.Wang Lin also felt very dizzy and his chest felt tight.Liu Wenju formed a seal and sent out a technique. The entire mountain shook and a crack appeared in the mountain. Without a word, Liu Wenju jumped into the crack.The old woman named Wang looked around and followed him in.The remaining people all entered the crack with the support of the elders. After they all entered, the crack slowly closed.The moment he entered, Wang Lin swept the entire cave with his divine sense and found that there was nothing there except for a few stone rooms.Liu Wenju waited until everyone came in and said, with a serious expression, \u201cMost of you have reached a cultivation level where you don\u2019t need to eat anymore. As for those of you who are too low and need to eat, there is food in the stone room over there that should last for several years. Me and your ancestor Wang will go into closed door training and won\u2019t bother with other matters. Listen to the elders for your arrangements.\u201dThe old woman named Wang said, with a depressed voice, \u201cMy Heng Yue Sect will go into closed door training for 100 years, then we will wipe away all our disgrace. From now on, if any of the disciples need the chants for reaching the next layer, they can get it from the elders. For the next century, unless there are any major events, none of the disciples are allowed to leave. Huang Long\u2019s group of three, you guys should also go into closed door training and try to reach foundation building as soon as possible.Huang Long\u2019s group of three nodded in agreement.Liu Wenju\u2019s gaze swept across the inner disciples and said, \u201cLu Song, you are in charge of all the inner disciples. Wang Lin, you follow me. I\u2019ll arrange a special place for you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u2013 (Untitled)The old woman named Wang nodded and said, \u201cWang Lin, if you have any questions, you can come and ask us at any time.\u201dWang Lin hesitated for a while, then said, \u201cDisciple has one request that I hope ancestors will agree to.\u201dThe old woman named Wang knitted her eyebrows and said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dWang Lin raised his head and said, \u201cDisciple wants to go out once.\u201dThe old woman quickly refused. \u201cYou must focus on reaching Foundation Building first. You can\u2019t go out.\u201dWang Lin raised his brow and said, \u201cDisciple must go out to do something. Once I finish, I can focus on cultivation.\u201dThe old woman gave Wang Lin a harsh stare and was about to speak when Liu Wenju pulled her and warmly said, \u201cYour ancestor Wang is worried about your safety outside. Can you tell me what are you going to do outside?\u201dWang Lin honestly said, \u201cDisciple hasn\u2019t see his parents in many years, and this closed door training will probably last a very long time, so I would like to go home and see my parents first.\u201dLiu Wenju pondered for a bit. He and the old woman looked at each other. Then, he took out a piece of jade and said, \u201cOk, go quickly and return quickly. This piece of jade can take one hit from a Core Formation cultivator. Only use it when your life is in danger.\u201dWang Lin was surprised. He quickly took it and put it away in his bag of holding. The number of treasures he had was simply too low. The only two he had were the talisman from Zhang Hu and this piece of jade.\u201cThis is the technique to open up the formation here. Remember it well.\u201d Liu Wenju took out another piece of jade, then walked into a room for closed door training with the old woman.After saying his goodbyes to everyone, he used the technique to open up the formation. He took a deep breath and jumped out of the cave.After he left the cave, he didn\u2019t pause, but jumped into the air, activated the attraction technique around his body, and flew upwards.Situ Nan said to Wang Lin, \u201cYou finally left. Do you plan on returning?\u201dAfter pondering a little, Wang Lin said, \u201cI will not be returning any time soon. After I settle the matters at home, I have my own plans.\u201dSitu Nan said, \u201cIf my guess is correct, once you give the heaven defying bead enough wood element, its ability to slow time will increase greatly. Right now it is 10 times, but once the wood element is filled, it might be 100 times. By then, your cultivation speed will increase greatly.\u201dAs the two talked, Wang Lin flew at a very fast speed, leaving a red trail behind him.After a day, he entered the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s southern mountain range. He was afraid of attracting attention, so he slowed down a bit. On the second day, he arrived at the small village.From a distance, the village looked about the same as before. There wasn\u2019t too much difference besides his own house. It turned from one house to a three room house with a giant \u201cFortune\u201d sign on the main gate. Although there was barely any light, sounds of dogs and roosters could be heard.Smoke floated from the village early in the morning as everyone got up to cook breakfast.Wang Lin stood at the village entrance, staring at his own home. Five years had passed in the blink of an eye, but he could still clearly feel his parents\u2019 hopeful gazes.He hesitated a little, but he didn\u2019t go in. He circled the village for a bit, then found a place to sit down and cultivate with the trees hiding his body.He wasn\u2019t sure if the people from the Xuan Dao Sect would come kill his parents as a form of revenge on him, so, before he settled the matter, he didn\u2019t want to go home and worry his parents.Time slowly passed by and in the blink of an eye, Wang Lin had lived outside of the village for a month.In this month, Wang Lin kept his divine sense spread at all times. On a certain day, a cold light flashed across Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cSo, they came after all.\u201dTwo sword lights quickly flew toward the village. After they landed, they revealed their figures. One person was wearing a black cloak that covered their entire body, making it impossible to see who it was, but this person was emitting a disgusting smell.A voice filled with hate came from the black cloaked individual. He said, \u201cZhang Kuang, Wang Lin\u2019s parents live here?\u201dAt his side was a very handsome youth. He had a very sharp look and very masculine features, but his eyes weren\u2019t bright. They were filled with a bit of greed. He whispered, \u201cSenior brother, that Wang Zhuo is really despicable. I thought that with how much he taunted Wang Lin, he would tell me where his parents were, but he wouldn\u2019t say a word. Thankfully, I was smart and checked the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s disciple registration and found that he was from this village, but I don\u2019t know which house.\u201dAfter he said that, he thought, \u201cWang Lin, we were from the same sect before, so I still had some concern about you, but now, I\u2019m a disciple of the Xuan Dao Sect. No matter what, I must steal the treasure you possess.\u201dThe person wrapped in the black cloak was the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s head disciple, Zhou Peng. His hatred for Wang Lin had reached its limit. He wished that he could eat Wang Lin\u2019s flesh and drink Wang Lin\u2019s blood because his entire reputation was ruined by Wang Lin. Now, his body was covered in a black dust that couldn\u2019t be washed off, so he had to cover himself in a black cloak so people couldn\u2019t see him.This black dust was at least hideable by clothes, but the smell emitted by the black dust was still there. Not to mention others, even when he smelled it himself, he felt like puking.He coldly snorted and said, \u201cZhang Kuang, you said that Wang Lin went from being trash to an expert so quickly because of that liquid?\u201dZhang Kuang endured the smell. Because Zhou Peng was too close, his stomach churned and he felt like puking, but he didn\u2019t dare show it in front of Zhou Peng. He quickly answered, \u201cSenior brother, why would I dare fool you? I already showed you the liquid. That was the liquid Wang Lin traded with me for the chants for Qi Condensation stages. I swear that if I\u2019m to lying to you, I will never reach the Foundation Building stage.\u201dZhou Peng took off his hood, exposing his black face covered in dust. A vicious light flashed across his eyes and he said, \u201cGood. Zhang Kuang, if what you said is true, then, in the future, as long as I\u2019m around, no one will dare to mess with you in the Xuan Dao Sect.\u201dZhang Kuang\u2019s face revealed an excited expression, but as he lowered his head, he thought, \u201cHmph, I, Zhang Kuang, am not someone who needs to follow in another\u2019s shadow. Once I have my footing in the Xuan Dao Sect, I will be able to reach the Foundation Building stage in a few dozen years.\u201dZhou Peng revealed a mocking expression when Zhang Kuang lowered his head. Zhou Peng then asked, \u201cHave you told anyone else about this liquid?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u2013 (Untitled)Zhang Kuang shook his head and said, \u201cSenior brother, in the entire Xuan Dao Sect, only the two of us know about this. I didn\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201dZhou Peng\u2019s eyes narrowed. He grabbed Zhang Kuang by the neck and shouted, \u201cZhang Kuang, you are lying!\u201dZhang Kuang didn\u2019t dare strike back. His face turn red as he saw killing intent in Zhou Peng\u2019s eyes. He clenched his teeth and said, \u201cSenior brother, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can use the soul search technique. What I say is 100% true. I didn\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201dZhou Peng\u2019s eyes lit up. He snorted and said, \u201cI\u2019ll believe you for now. Go catch Wang Lin\u2019s parents and kill them. I\u2019ll refine their souls into spirit flags. We can use those to find Wang Lin. Then, using his parents\u2019 souls to attack him, unless he\u2019s reached the Foundation Building stage, his soul will break.\u201dZhang Kuang\u2019s body shivered. He had never heard of such a vicious technique before, so he hesitated for a bit.Zhou Peng\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cGo!\u201d he shouted.Zhang Kuang clenched his teeth and ran toward the village.Killing intent filled Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. This was the first time he wanted to kill someone.Situ Na immediately shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Kill, kill, kill, kill them all! You are too weak now, but if you were strong enough, you should kill your way to the Xuan Dao Sect and kill them all. Back then, I loved doing these things.This was the first time Wang Lin didn\u2019t oppose Situ Nan\u2019s idea. He moved his body and chased after Zhang Kuang.Zhang Kuang\u2019s step slowed down until he almost stopped, but in the end, he took a deep breath and became more determined, then moved faster toward the village.Just at that moment, his expression suddenly changed. He turned his head and saw Wang Lin following behind him like a ghost in the air.Zhang Kuang took a few steps back and forced a smile. \u201cSenior brother, you\u2026you\u2026\u201dWang Lin remained silent. He displayed a cold smile.\u201d\u201cSenor brother, I\u2026\u201d When Zhang Kuang saw Wang Lin\u2019s expression, his heart skipped a beat and he took a few steps back while placing his hand on his bag of holding.\u201cZhang Kuang, aren\u2019t you looking for my home? It\u2019s over there.\u201d Wang Lin pointed toward his home.Zhang Kuang\u2019s heart pounded like crazy. He fell to the ground, kneeling, with a face filled with shame, and shouted, \u201cSenior brother, I was wrong. It\u2019s Zhou Peng\u2019s fault! He forced me to come. I\u2026\u201d At that moment, he took out a piece of jade and threw it into the air with a serious expression.The piece of jade suddenly turned into a flying sword and flew toward Wang Lin. Zhang Kuang quickly started to chant as he took out pieces of black wood. The pieces of black wood fused together into a whip.The moment the whip appeared, it released a dangerous aura. Zhang Kuang threw the whip at Wang Lin. He didn\u2019t even wait to see the result, he just ran away.Wang Lin revealed a mocking expression. He activated his attraction technique, which surrounded his body, and moved to the side. He sent out two invisible hands with his attraction technique. One of them pinched the sword and the other went toward Zhang Kuang. Zhang Kuang suddenly felt pain around his neck, as if a hand had a firm hold on it. His face turned purple. He let go of the technique he had formed with his hand and reached toward his neck.Killing intent filled Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. With a cracking sound, Zhang Kuang\u2019s neck bent as his eyes were filled with despair. Blood came out of his mouth, and, after Wang Lin released the attraction technique, he fell to the ground. His body twitched a bit before finally going limp forever.The moment Zhang Kuang died, the flying sword shook and turned back into a piece of jade. Wang Lin grabbed the jade out of the air.As for his long black whip, it also lost its support and turned back into pieces of black wood, which were also put away by Wang Lin. After Wang Lin took Zhang Kuang\u2019s bag of holding, he used the fireball technique to burn the body, then rushed toward where Zhou Peng was.Zhou Peng waited for half a day. He secretly cursed Zhang Kuang for being so slow. He was about to head over to see what was going on when his expression suddenly changed. He felt a fluctuation of spiritual energy from the village. Just as he was about to go check it out, he felt a powerful killing intent moving quickly toward him.Zhou Peng was shocked. He shouted, \u201cWho killed Zhang Kuang? His presence has completely disappeared, meaning he has died.\u201d Before he could think about it further, Wang Lin appeared in his view.Zhou Peng\u2019s expression changed greatly. Without a word, he turned around and ran away. He cursed in his heart, \u201cZhang Kuang, oh, Zhang Kuang. You\u2019re going to get me killed! How come Wang Lin suddenly came back?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes remained cold. He was determined to kill Zhou Peng. He wrapped himself in the attraction technique and chased after Zhou PengZhou Peng didn\u2019t even try to turn his head. He took out a flying sword and charged toward the Heng Yue Peak.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to run away!\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s voice entered Zhou Peng\u2019s ear like a ghost\u2019s whisper, causing his hair to stand. He shivered and found in horror that Wang Lin was getting closer. He shouted in desperation, \u201cWang Lin, there is no feud between us. What are you going to do?!\u201dWang Lin smiled coldly and said, \u201cNo feud between us? You know it well yourself. Zhou Peng, you will die today!\u201dZhou Peng groaned in his heart. He clenched his teeth and forced the flying sword to its limit. He thought, \u201cAs long as I reach the sect, no matter how strong he is, he won\u2019t be able to kill me.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He activated his attraction technique and grabbed toward Zhou Peng. Zhou Peng had been on guard against the dragon capture hand this entire time. When the dragon capture hand came, he flew closer to the ground. He almost dodged the technique. His body was safe, but his sword was hit, causing him to spin for a bit before he steadied himself.Zhou Peng\u2019s face darkened. His flying sword didn\u2019t stop as he continued his escape.Wang Lin started to get nervous. His attraction technique only had a certain range and once he passed that range, the power of the technique decreased a lot. He was starting to get worried. He might not be able to catch Zhou Peng before Zhou Peng returned to the sect. He knew that he must not let Zhou Peng get away because not only would it put himself in danger, but also put his parents in danger.He immediately said to Situ Nan, \u201cSenior Situ, is there any way for me to catch him immediately?\u201dSitu Nan calmly said, \u201cThere is\u2026but\u2026\u201dWang Lin frowned and immediately said, \u201cIf Zhou Peng gets away, then I\u2019ll just take my parents and move away. As for cultivation, I\u2019ll just give it up and live as a mortal.\u201dSitu Nan immediately said, \u201cWhat are you in a rush for? I\u2019m only talking a bit slowly. If it was the me from before, I would kill you with one slap for being such a disrespectful disciple.\u201d\u201cWhat disciple, you fart? Hurry up!\u201d Wang Lin became even more anxious. He even lost his respectful tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u2013 (Untitled)Situ Nan muttered a few words. He knew that Wang Lin was very worried, so he didn\u2019t waste anymore time. \u201cThere is still a bit of my soul essence left. I can help you teleport once, but only once, because if too much of my soul essence is used up, then I\u2019ll disappear before you reach Spirit Transformation,\u201d he said.With that, Situ Nan didn\u2019t say anymore. Wang Lin suddenly felt a cold air enter his body. This cold air was overwhelming. It was many times stronger than the time he was teleported by the white light.The cold air cycled through his body. Every part of his body that the air would pass through started to freeze. Wang Lin became like an ice sculpture and started to lose control of his attraction technique.Zhou Peng noticed Wang Lin\u2019s change, particularly when Wang Lin stopped chasing him, but he didn\u2019t even dare to turn around. He began to move even faster.When Wang Lin\u2019s body turned into an ice sculpture, Situ Nan shouted, \u201cKeep your mind calm. I\u2019m about to teleport!\u201dSuddenly, dark swirls cycled through Wang Lin\u2019s body and, in the blink of an eye, his body disappeared.Zhou Peng\u2019s divine sense had been locked onto Wang Lin this whole time. When Wang Lin suddenly disappeared, he was stunned. Before he could even understand what had just happened, a black dot appeared 5 meters in front of him. The black dots split up into smaller black dots and each one them turned into a black swirl.At the same time, Wang Lin\u2019s body suddenly appeared. The ice on his body quickly melted and he said, in a cold voice, \u201cYou can\u2019t run away!\u201dZhou Peng was shocked. His face became pale. He clenched his teeth and spat out a mouthful of green light. This green light grew until it became a giant python. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out some blood. That blood turned into a bell. He rang the bell and the python grew even larger. Then, it swiped its tail at Wang Lin.Situ Na said, with a lazy voice, \u201cBrat, there is still a bit of my power in your body. It would be a waste not to use it. I\u2019m going to borrow your body and show you one of my famous techniques.\u201dWith that, blue lights appeared from Wang Lin\u2019s body, forming a blue ball of light before him.The moment the ball appeared, the sky darkened and a destructive force appeared. With a boom, the ball broke and sent out waves of destructive force.When the wave touched the python\u2019s tail, the ice traveled all the way to its head. The python fell to the ground, frozen solid.Zhou Peng coughed out a mouthful of blood because of his connection with the python, but just as he coughed out the blood, the blood froze into red droplets. Then, Zhou Peng\u2019s body also slowly froze, until he became an ice sculpture.Situ Nan proudly said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that there are no more people. This technique of mine works best when there is a lot of people. Hey kid, this is the power of the Underworld Ascension Method. Can you see how strong the cold energy of this technique is?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s body moved. He caught Zhou Peng\u2019s frozen body. Without stopping, he rushed away from the Heng Yue Mountain.After finding an isolated place, he placed Zhou Peng\u2019s frozen body to the side and asked Situ Nan, \u201cIs Zhou Peng already dead?\u201dSitu Na slowly said, \u201cThis little baby is not dead yet, but he is close. If you want him to die faster, you can just break the ice, then he will die for sure.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. After pondering for a while, he said, \u201cBefore, you said you would teach me a puppet technique. Teach me that technique now.\u201dSitu Nan let out a laugh. He was very happy with how things were turning out. He hadn\u2019t told Wang Lin what the puppet technique was like or where it was from. Actually, this puppet technique was a demonic technique. He thought that Wang Lin was lacking killing intent. With his lack of killing intent, even if Wang Lin had ten lives, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to survive in the cultivation world. Situ Nan had been trying very hard \u00a0to change Wang Lin\u2019s nature and it seemed he was finally having some success.Situ Nan was very happy. \u201cThis puppet technique must be performed by you. I\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s done once you find a secluded cave,\u201d he happily said.Wang Lin grabbed Zhou Peng. He searched around until he found a cave and went inside.Situ Nan slowly said, \u201cI\u2019ll release the ice now. Zhou Peng is in a near death state. You must open up his body, take out his inner organs, and start refining them.\u201dWang Lin was stunned. He hesitated for a bit, then said, \u201cTake out his inner organs and refine them? This\u2026\u201dSitu Na secretly laughed and said, \u201cThis is a necessary step for making puppets. If you can\u2019t do it, then I can\u2019t help you.\u201d He secretly thought, \u201cBrat, you have never seen blood, so how will you ever be bloodthirsty? This puppet technique is actually not this complicated, but this is a good opportunity to open your eyes a bit. Kid, you will definitely be my demon sect\u2019s member. You can\u2019t escape it!\u201dWhile thinking that, Situ Nan quickly shouted, \u201cI\u2019m going to remove the ice. You have half an hour, so don\u2019t waste any time. Think about what he was planning to do to your parents.\u201dWith that, the ice surrounding Zhou Peng quickly melted and turned into blue light. The blue light returned to the heaven defying bead.Wang Lin hesitated for a while. He thought that if he didn\u2019t solve this problem now, there will definitely be more problems in the future. He clenched his teeth and waved his hand over Zhou Peng\u2019s body to cut it open. The strange thing was that there was no blood dripping out.While suppressing his sense of nausea, Wang Lin followed the directions Situ Nan gave him. He was forming different seals with his hands as his divine sense focused on the task. This half an hour felt like a whole year. When Situ Nan proudly said it was over, Wang Lin couldn\u2019t help but rush out of the cave and puke.Situ Na laughed. \u201cGood. This first step is over. Now, this second step is the most important step. You must surround his body with your divine sense and refine it for 3 days and 3 nights. Once you do that, the puppet can be considered complete. You will need to perform some techniques during those 3 days. I\u2019ll explain them one by one, so listen carefully.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s face was pale as he bitterly nodded. He took a deep breath and returned to the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 \u2013 Returning HomeThree days later, Wang Lin left the cave covered in sweat. Zhou Peng walked out behind him with misty eyes.\u201cZhou Peng, you return to the Xuan Dao Sect. Follow my directions and kill all of the people that want to harm me. Also, protect my parents afterwards.\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s voice was very cold and filled with bloodlust.Zhou Peng respectfully nodded and moved toward the Xuan Dao Sect.Wang Lin looked at Zhou Peng. After a long time, Wang Lin asked, \u201cSenior Situ, this puppet technique didn\u2019t really require the first step, right?\u201dSitu was stunned. He quickly said, \u201cSays who?! The first step was a must. Without the first step, you couldn\u2019t do the second step.\u201dAfter Wang Lin had personally made a puppet himself, he felt that there was something off. He wanted to say more, but instead asked, \u201cWill Pun Nanzi see through Zhou Peng?\u201dSitu Nan hesitated for a bit, then answered, \u201cTruth to be told, when you were making the puppet, I placed some of my essence inside it, so, if a nascent soul cultivator doesn\u2019t look very carefully, they shouldn\u2019t be able to find anything wrong. Also, that Pun Nanzi should be in closed door training most of the time, so the chances of him finding out are low\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while. He moved his body and shot out like a rainbow toward the village. He didn\u2019t stop at all and flew toward his home.Before he even entered the gate, he heard a familiar voice coming from inside\u201cLittle brat, how can anyone be as bad a carpenter as you? Just look at it\u2026 this isn\u2019t even half as good as what my son can do.\u201d\u201cMaster, Tie Zhu is an immortal now. How could I ever compare to him? If I can be even half as great as he is, I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201dWhen Wang Lin heard this, he was stunned. He immediately sent out his divine sense. Then, he let out a smile. He remembered this person. It was a playmate of his that often bugged Wang Lin\u2019s dad to teach him carpentry.He gently pushed the door open and said to the old figure in the yard, \u201cDad, Tie Zhu is back.\u201dThe old figure quivered. He immediately dropped the tool in his hand, turned his head, and saw a 20 or so year old youth that looked exactly like his son.\u201cTie Zhu?\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s dad rubbed his eyes hard as tears flowed out.Wang Lin stepped forward and embraced his dad. He wiped away the tears on his dad\u2019s face as he carefully studied that familiar face. He took a few steps back, knelt on the ground, and said, \u201cDad, Tie Zhu hasn\u2019t been a good son, not visiting at all in the last 5 years.\u201d\u201cIt really is Tie Zhu! Wife, come out! Our son is back!\u201d Tie Zhu\u2019s dad pulled Wang Lin up. He looked Wang Lin over with a smile on his face.Tie Zhu\u2019s dad excitedly said, \u201cTie Zhu, you grew taller. You\u2019ve almost caught up to your dad. You also have became sturdier. Good, that\u2019s my son!\u201dAt that moment, an old woman walked out of the house. She stared at Wang Lin as tears fell from her eyes.Wang Lin went up and knelt before the old woman with a yearning expression. He said, \u201cMother, Tie Zhu came back to see you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026how could you be so heartless? You haven\u2019t come back to see us at all in the last 5 years. Do we still exist in your heart? In these 5 years, your father and I have been constantly thinking about you\u2026\u201d As she kept speaking, she ended up hugging Tie Zhu and started to cry.Tie Zhu\u2019s dad looked at Tie Zhu\u2019s mom, then said, \u201cOur child is an immortal, so he must focus on more important matters. Just look at how you\u2019re acting. It will become the joke of the town. Little Six, you can go home. Don\u2019t bother coming back for a few days. I\u2019ll call you when Tie Zhu leaves.\u201dLittle Six smiled. He quickly responded and left after giving Wang Lin a look of admiration.That night, Wang Lin\u2019s mom made a plethora of good food. All of the dishes were Wang Lin\u2019s favorites. They ate and talked about the changes that had happened in these past 5 years.Wang Lin didn\u2019t need to eat in these past few years, but his mother\u2019s cooking smelled too delicious for him to resist.During the conversation, Wang Lin\u2019s parents asked about the giant mountain appearing on top of the Heng Yue Sect. Wang Lin hesitated for a bit and lied that the Heng Yue Sect moved, so he won\u2019t be able to come back as often. His parents didn\u2019t ask dig any deeper about this matter. They just told him to take care of his body.In these past 5 years, a lot had changed. Relatives often visited and, with fourth uncle\u2019s help, Wang Lin\u2019s dad was able to get back his part of the family inheritance.His dad didn\u2019t do much carving himself anymore, but he accepted a few apprentices and passed on his trade.Little Six was the smartest of the apprentices. He managed to learn 50 or 60 percent of the skills already.When Wang Lin heard this, he smiled and said, \u201cDad, I saw the wood carving Little Six made. They were pretty good, not nearly as bad as you were saying.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s dad snorted and said, \u201cThey are still far too poor! When I taught you how to carve, you were only 8 years old, and you were already doing better than him!\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mom looked at her son with eyes filled with love and said, \u201cYes, our Tie Zhu has always been smarter than them. I have to say, Tie Zhu, you aren\u2019t young anymore. In these past 5 years, many families have come to ask about marriage. Mom heard that immortals can also have families. Since you are back, stay for a while and go see them with mom. If there are any good ones, we can decide on the matter.\u201dWang Lin was stunned and wrily smiled. \u201cMother, how old do I look? Please don\u2019t worry about this.\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mom immediately became unhappy and stared at Wang Lin. \u201cLittle brat, all of the people your age in the village already have kids running around.\u201dWang Lin rubbed his nose and said, \u201cMom, creating a family is a big deal. Wait a few years and I\u2019ll bring one back. How\u2019s that?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s dad saw that his wife was about to say more. He coughed and said, \u201cWife, why are you worried about these pointless things? Our son is an immortal. Do you understand immortals? How could they marry a mortal? Tie Zhu is saying that he will bring back an immortal wife. Do you understand?\u201dTie Zhu\u2019s mom paused and muttered, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about immortals? Immortals can leave home and not come back for 5 years. If I have a immortal daugher in law, then my son probably won\u2019t even bring her back after 10 years.\u201dWang Lin wrily smiled. Right as he was about to speak, his mom glared at him and said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll listen to your dad. I guess you have your sights set on something high and the girls in the villages won\u2019t catch your eye. Mom will wait and see what kind of girl you bring back.\u201dWhen Wang Lin saw that his mom was angry, he immediately said, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. Your son will definitely bring you back a good daugher in law.\u201dAfter dinner, Wang Lin\u2019s parents asked him endless questions until late into the night before they finally went to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u2013 Four YearsWith Wang Lin\u2019s current cultivation, he didn\u2019t need to sleep at all. After lying in his bed for a while, he sat up and looked at the moon outside his window. He waved his right hand and took out a gourd, then drank a big gulp from it.Wang Lin muttered to himself, \u201cThe amount of spiritual energy needed to break through from Qi Condensation to Foundation Building is simply too great. It is time to start gathering dew.\u201dSitu Nan asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hey brat, when do you plan on going to find wood element to help complete the heaven defying bead?\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while, then said, \u201cFirst, I\u2019ll find a place nearby to prepare to break through to Foundation Building. Then, I\u2019ll have to see how things are going with Zhou Peng. If nothing unusual happens, I\u2019ll leave this place.\u201dThe night passed in silence. For the next few days, Wang Lin spent time with his parents. After half a month, Wang Lin left. After the reluctant farewell of his parents, he left in a rainbow colored light.Wang Lin felt very gloomy when he left. He didn\u2019t know when his next chance to come back home will be. It might be in a few years, or he might not come back ever again.Originally, the place he planned to use for closed door training was the cave with the hole in the wall, but he decided against it. Unlike other cultivators, he needed water in the cave, otherwise, no matter how rich the spiritual energy was, it would not be a good enough spot. Also, it was very close to the Heng Yue Mountain, so it was too dangerous.After searching the surrounding area, Wang Lin found a cave near the top of an empty mountain. There was a pool of underground water and lot of animal droppings in the cave. It seemed wild animals visited this area a lot. After carefully checking the cave and making sure that there was no other exit, Wang Lin quickly used the attraction technique and sealed the cave entrance with rocks.As a result, the cave became completely sealed and Wang Lin began his second closed door training.After he started his closed door training, time flew by. 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years. Without him realizing it, 4 years had passed by.As for the remaining people of the Heng Yue Sect, they gradually forgot about Wang Lin, thinking that he had died. Liu Wenju and the old woman regretted letting him out.The one who was most happy about this matter had to be Lu Song, because he managed to become the senior disciple of that small group.As for Huang Long and the others of his generation, they never had much contact with Wang Lin to begin with. They only noticed Wang Lin due to recent events, so, after 4 years, they had completely forgotten about him.During the first year of Wang Lin\u2019s closed door training, he kept in contact with Zhou Peng and found that all of the Foundation Building and above elders were in closed door training in the back mountains, so no one found out about what happened to Zhou Peng. In addition to this, he had his status as the senior disciple of the Xuan Dao Sect, so none of the disciples dared to mess with him. This allowed him to gather information and secretly take care of some disciples that had ill intentions toward Wang Lin. With Zhou Peng secretly taking care of these people, Wang Lin gradually faded from everyone\u2019s memories.The entrance of the cave that Wang Lin was cultivating in was now covered with plants, making the cave impossible to detect.In these 4 years, the entrance to the cave became a gathering place for various animals. Some even sat outside the entrance and cultivated.On a certain day, two rainbow colored lights flew toward the cave. Two male and one female appeared from the light as they stopped near the cave. The person in front was a middle aged man wearing black. His body stopped in mid air with a green flying sword under him. The sword released a cold aura that would cause fear in others.Next to the middle aged man stood a young girl. The girl was very attractive and her voice was very clear. \u201cThird senior brother, you have to help me find a crystal spirit beast. The competition to enter the back mountain is soon and I need a good wood crystal spirit beast to refine into a sword spirit. With that sword spirit, I\u2019ll win for sure.\u201dIf Wang Lin saw this girl, he would find her to be very familiar. This was the female named Xu who was secretly in love with Wang Zhuo. She had now grown from a pretty teenager to a beautiful woman.The middle aged man was in a trance. He suddenly regained his senses and said, \u201cJunior sister, work hard and strive to get into the back mountain. After I help you capture a crystal spirit beast, I\u2019ll have to go into closed door training.\u201dThere was another teenager who stood next to the girl. He was every young and was clinging to the girl. He said, \u201cSenior brother and sister, you two are flying too fast. I can\u2019t even keep my eyes open. Since we are here already, let\u2019s go down.\u201dThe girl named Xu said, \u201cJunior brother, didn\u2019t you say that you had follow? I already told you that your cultivation isn\u2019t high enough. Just this speed and you can\u2019t stand it.\u201dThe middle aged man turned, looked at the two, and said, \u201cJunior brother, your talent is good, but if you can\u2019t even stand this little bit of hardship, how will you cultivate in the future?\u201dThe youth was clearly very afraid of the middle aged man and said, \u201cThird brother, I know I was wrong.\u201dThe girl named Xu tapped the youth\u2019s head and said, \u201cJunior brother, just wait a bit. Once we capture the crystal beast, we can return to the sect.\u201dThe youth quickly nodded and whispered, \u201cSenior sister, you are one of the Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s geniuses. You managed to go from the 4th layer to the 7th layer in only 4 years. This time, after you capture the crystal beast and refine it into a sword spirit, you will become one of the experts in the Xuan Dao Sect. You\u2019ll have to help me when Li Shan bullies me in the future.\u201dThe girl shook her head and wrily smiled. \u201cSpeaking of geniuses, elder brother Liu Feng is definitely one. He has almost caught up to senior brother\u2019s cultivation and is going to break through into the 13th layer soon. There is also elder sister Liu Mei, who has already reached the 12th layer. They were all originally Xuan Dao Sect disciples, so they naturally have access to the back mountain. I am originally from the Heng Yue Sect, so I have to fight for one of the remaining spots in the back mountain. I hope I can win this time.\u201dThe middle aged man let out a snort and disgruntledly said, \u201cThat bat Liu Feng only grew so fast because he was able to enter the back mountain. It was only because the ancestor had his eyes on the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s back mountain that he made is this far. If it wasn\u2019t for the ancestor, how could Liu Feng grow so fast? Even if he has great talent, without a great amount of spiritual energy, it would take years to break through.\u201dThe girl named Xu smiled and changed the topic \u201cThird brother, look at this place. I remember it being very different from before. Why are there so many wild animals cultivating around here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u2013 Seizing FoundationThe middle aged man looked around for a bit, then muttered, \u201cThis place is indeed strange. Two years ago, there was a sudden burst of spiritual energy which attracted these beasts. Since then, waves of spiritual energy have been sent out from around here. That is what attracts the beasts.\u201dThe youth\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. He said, \u201cElder martial brother, could there be a treasure here?\u201dThe middle chuckled and said, \u201cThere were some elders that also thought so, but after searching for a while, they determined that the release of spiritual energy was a natural occurrence.\u201dThe youth sighed in disappointment and said, \u201cThat is unfortunate. If only there really was a treasure here.\u201dThe middle aged man let out a laugh and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. I\u2019ll catch a strong crystal spirit beast, then we can go back.\u201d With that, the middle aged man spread out his divine sense and found 7 to 8 crystal spirit beasts and began to observe them.Just at that moment, all of the beasts that were cultivating suddenly started to move, as if something startled them. Some even began to growl.Gradually, the number of growls began to increase, until all of the beasts were roaring. Their roars were directed at a vegetation-filled cliff.The middle aged man was stunned. Before he was able to call his fellow disciples to quickly leave the area, a huge divine sense swept past them. The middle aged man\u2019s face changed greatly. Even with his 12th layer cultivation level, he felt completely powerless under this divine sense.The girl named Xu\u2019s, who was next to the middle aged man, face turned pale. The flying sword under her feet flashed and fell to the ground. The girl and the youth hugging her also fell to the ground.The flying sword under the middle aged man also faltered and he had to use all of his power to maintain flight. He took a step and grabbed the two falling people before landing on the ground. Just this simple action caused him to be drenched in sweat.After he landed, he quickly clasped his hands and said, \u201cJunior is Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciple, Li Hai. I didn\u2019t know senior was cultivating here. Please forgive us.\u201dThe girl named Xu also noticed that divine sense. It caused her to lose control of her flying sword. She respectfully said, \u201cJunior is Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s disciple Xu Fei.\u201dThe youth was so scared that there wasn\u2019t any trace of blood on his face. He stood there, clenching the girl\u2019s clothes, not daring to speak.All of the beasts also felt chills when the divine sense spread across them. All of them revealed looks of shock and fear. They lied on the ground, not daring to move.\u201cXuan Dao Sect\u2026\u201d A very old voice echoed from the surroundings. It was hard to tell whether the voice was happy or angry.The middle aged man groaned. If he was by himself, he could have just escaped when he found that something was off, but now, with a junior sister and a little junior brother here, if he were to run away, then their masters would definitely hold him accountable. He could only hope that, because the Xuan Dao Sect was so close and that they hadn\u2019t done anything to offend this senior yet, the senior will not do anything.After the senior said that phrase, he began to think. The middle aged man clenched his teeth and decided that his life was more important. If the senior started to act with killing intent, then he was going to save himself first.Xu Fei\u2019s forehead was covered in beads of sweat. She was got very nervous when she saw her 3rd elder brother, who was alway calm, scared pale. She hesitated for a while, then said, \u201cSenior, junior hasn\u2019t done anything to offend you. You\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish speaking, the old voice let out a surprised sound and said, \u201cYou said your name is Xu?\u201dThe girl was stunned. She respectfully answered, \u201cDisciple is named Xu.\u201dThe voice became silent again. After a long time, the voice let out a sigh and said, \u201cYou can leave.\u201d With that, there was a sudden change in the sky, as if there was an invisible hand that waved in the air. The three were pushed far away by an unstoppable wind.The middle aged man felt even more horrified. Just at that moment, he felt like his entire body was imprisoned. If this senior wanted to kill him, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to react.Out of fear, he immediately grabbed his junior brother and sister and rushed away as fast as possible without a word when the restricting force around them was gone. He was afraid that the senior would changed their mind, so he used all of his strength to get away.After the three left, the cliff covered with vegetation started to shake until all of the vegetation fell off, revealing a dark cave.A young male with hair all the way to his waist slowly walked out. His face was white and his eyes sparkled. The moment he walked out of the cave, all of the wild beasts started to whine. Their eyes begged for mercy.The long haired youth was about 20 years old. His gaze was cold as he looked at all of the beasts. He remained silent as he looked toward the Heng Yue Mountain with regret in his heart.He was Wang Lin, who had been in closed door cultivation for 4 years.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He muttered to himself, \u201cI have reached the peak of Qi Condensation a long time ago, but reaching Foundation Building is simply too hard. I have already tried it many times, but am still unable to break through. Situ, will the method you mentioned really help me reach Foundation Building faster?\u201d\u201cYes. Have you decided to use my method?\u201d Situ Nan let out a proud smile. \u201cI told you before: while reaching the Foundation Building stage is hard, if you use my method, it will succeed for sure.\u201dA cold light flashed through Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cBut I can\u2019t even beat someone at the Foundation Building stage.. How could I catch one alive?\u201dSitu Nan let out a laugh and said, \u201cYou can rest assured, because you have me here. This time, in order to help you reach Foundation Building, I\u2019ll take another risk and use my technique again. As long as you can find me an opening, I can help you restrain the person. You better find someone who has just reached Foundation Building so I won\u2019t have to waste too much essence.\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while, then let out a sigh. He wrily smiled. \u201cSitu, this foundation stealing is very vicious. Whoever I steal from will surely die, so let\u2019s wait and see first.\u201dSitu Nan said, with discontent, \u201cYou! I have told you countless times that, in the world of cultivation, the strong prey on the weak. Killing others for your own benefit is completely normal. With your current merciful nature, how long will it take you reach Spirit Transformation? Hmph, if you don\u2019t want to use my method, you can also go look for wood element. If you can fill the heaven defying bead with wood element, the upgrade should give you enough spiritual energy to reach Foundation Building. If you won\u2019t do either of those, and don\u2019t have a Nascent Soul cultivator to help you, don\u2019t even think about reaching foundation Building.\u201dWang Lin pondered for a while, then said, \u201cI wonder how other people Reach Foundation building.\u201dSitu Nan grunted and said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. If they have a sect, then a Nascent Soul cultivator uses their own cultivation to help the disciple reach Foundation Building. If I still had my body, I could do the same and help you. In my home country, the status of a Nascent Soul cultivator is like that of a Core Formation cultivator here. Although there aren\u2019t too many, there are enough to help the disciples to reach Foundation Building.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u2013 Tian Shui CityWang Lin took a deep breath. In these 4 years, he had reached the peak of Qi Condensation in 2 years. He spent the remaining years trying to reach foundation building, but didn\u2019t have any success.But because he kept trying to break into Foundation Building, the gap between his real body and his cultivation level became a lot smaller. Instead of looking like he was at the 3rd layer, he now looked like he was at the 8th layer.Wang Lin muttered, \u201cFoundation Building\u2026\u201d His eyes flashed as he made a decision. He slapped his bag of holding and a very extravagant looking flying sword came out. It circled around him once before stopping in front of him.Wang Lin stepped onto the flying sword. His body moved and disappeared in a beam of light.All of the beasts lying on the ground finally relaxed a bit and quickly scattered.Wang Lin went around the Heng Yue Mountain and quickly flew away. The mountains, plains, forests, and villages looked very small under Wang Lin as he flew past them.In the blink of an eye, the village he was born in entered his view. Wang Lin pondered for a moment, then flew past the village without even turning his head.The Heng Yue Mountain was located in the northern border of the country of Zhao. It was a very remote location, with most people living in small villages. Wang Lin\u2019s destination was the city 10,000 kilometers from there. The city was called Tian Shui city and it was the largest city in the northern part of Zhao.Wang Lin had only heard about Tian Shui city. His teacher told him that there was an army of 100,000 stationed there. Wang Lin had always wanted to go there ever since he was a kid.Before he entered the the world of cultivation, his biggest dream was to make a name for himself in the state exam, then become a high ranked official in the capital, and move his parents there as well.Wang Lin\u2019s mind echoed the wishes of his youth. He let out a smile as he flew toward the city.10 days later, Wang Lin became confused as he floated in the air with Situ Nan\u2019s mocking laugh littering the air.\u201cI saw you flying for so many days straight. I thought you knew the road, but it turns out you don\u2019t!\u201dWang Lin snorted and said, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you asking me to go into these forests, I would have found the city for sure by now.\u201dSitu Nan laughed. \u201cThere are many forests on the way there, so there is a chance that there are some wood elements that could be absorbed by the bead. I\u2019m doing this for your benefit.\u201dWang Lin was about to speak, but suddenly stopped himself. He spotted a train of wagons on the road below.Liu San, the head of the Mighty Escort service in Tian Shui city. Although his body wasn\u2019t big, he was very powerful. He had mastered the mountain splitting palm to a high degree and could be considered one of the experts in Tian Shui city. He normally wouldn\u2019t come out for jobs.But this time, the shipment was too important, and it attracted too much attention. That was why North family asked him to come.Liu San was an easy going person who loved to make friends. Everyone in the escort team gave him a lot of face. He was currently proudly riding on his horse. This shipment was already delivered and although there were many thieves on the way, they were all scared and posed no danger. The most dangerous crisis was when they were attacked by the Greenwood bandits, but when they saw that Liu San was there, they gave him face and didn\u2019t attack, making him very proud.He closed his eyes and relaxed a bit. Tian Shui city was just up ahead, so this assignment by the North family could be considered complete.On a horse to the right of Liu San sat a very strong young man. He laughed and asked, \u201cLeader, once we finish this big delivery, how much of the profit do you think the North family will give us?\u201dA dark faced man also said, \u201cLeader, this shipment is so important that we should be able to get a decent part of the profit, right?.\u201dLiu San\u2019s stared at them and said, \u201cWhen has the North family ever cheated us? Just wait and see. No need to worry.\u201dThe young man wasn\u2019t afraid. He patted his horse and said, \u201cOkay, with leader\u2019s words, I\u2019m relieved.\u201dThe dark faced man let out a laugh. Right before he was about to speak, his face sunk. He asked. \u201cLeader, do you see a person standing there?\u201dLiu San focused his gaze and saw a figure standing at the cross road. His face also sunk. He said, \u201cYang Sen, ask him what\u2019s going on. If he needs help, give him some money. After all, everyone has hard times.\u201dYang Sen\u2019s head raised. He steered his horse and charged toward the person. When he got closer, instead of slowing down, he started to charge even faster.When Liu San saw this, he frowned. Although Yang Sen did his job well, whenever he did something, he had to force others into a lower position.The dark faced man let out a laugh and said, \u201cThat Yang Sen isn\u2019t afraid of charging in, but that kid really does have good horse riding skills.\u201dThe person who was standing at the cross was Wang Lin. He saw someone charge out from the train of carriages. That person quickly arrived before him.Yang Sen was close enough to see what the stranger looked like. Although the person was very young, he was also very calm. He admired the youth for not being scared by his speed at all. He turned his horse and grazed by Wang Lin\u2019s side.After he charged past Wang Lin, took a few steps back, clasped his hands, and said, \u201cI\u2019m Tian Shui city\u2019s Mighty Escort\u2019s Yang Sen. Does friend need any help?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s gaze scanned Yang Sen. He clasped his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for directions to Tian Shui city. I\u2019m sorry if I bothered you.\u201dYang Sen was stunned. He looked at Wang Lin a few times, especially at Wang Lin\u2019s hands and head. He smiled and said, \u201cNo problem. Tian Shui city isn\u2019t far. What is brother going to Tian Shui city for?\u201dYang Sen looked at Wang Lin a bit more. By now, the carriages had caught up and a voice shouted, \u201cYang Sen, what is going on?\u201dYang Sen turned the horse and shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a kid that doesn\u2019t know any martial arts looking for directions to Tian Shui city.\u201dLiu Sen held the reins and quickly approached. His eyes lit up as he looked at Wang Lin and said, \u201cFriend, what is your name?\u201dWang Lin clasped his hands and said, \u201cHello, escort leader. My name is Wang Lin. This is my first time leaving home, so I hope escort leader can tell me directions to Tian Shui city.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u2013 Bloody DisasterLiu San, after carefully examining Wang Lin, suddenly asked, \u201cAre you a student rushing here to take the exam?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm. He shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not here for the exam. I have some skill in a craft and would like to make a living in the city.\u201dLiu San relaxed a bit. His question had a deep meaning. It was almost time for the state exam, so a lot of local villages sent students to the city to take the exam. However, all of those students would carry a box holding writing materials, but Wang Lin was carrying nothing. If he admitted that he was a student here for the exam, he would have to be wary of this person.But Liu San didn\u2019t take this too seriously. He laughed and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. We are also heading toward Tian Shui city. Friend, how about you travel with us?\u201dA grateful look washed over Wang Lin\u2019s face. He said, \u201cThank you, escort leader!\u201dThe dark faced man looked at Wang Lin and laughed. \u201cKid, can you ride a horse?\u201dWang Lin wrily smiled and shook his head.Liu San pointed at the carriage behind him and said, \u201cWhat is there to thank me for? Everyone has a hard time when they are out traveling. Young man, there are only four days left until we reach the city.\u201dWang Lin clasped his hands. Without a word, he got on the carriage. He looked behind him and saw dozens of similar carriages. He scanned them with his divine sense and found them to all be empty. He didn\u2019t bother with it anymore and sat down cross legged.Yang Sen reined his horse and walked next to Wang Lin. He asked, \u201cFriend, how come you don\u2019t have any luggage for your travels?\u201dWang Lin sighed and shook his head. He said, \u201cI met robbers on the way.\u201dYang Sen was stunned. He looked at Wang Lin for a while, then said, \u201cKeeping your life is more important. This area hasn\u2019t been safe recently.\u201dAs they were talking, Wang Lin\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He raised his head and looked toward the forest in front of him. He expanded his divine sense and found two people hiding there, staring at the caravan.Even after the caravan passed, those two they still didn\u2019t do anything, so Wang Lin didn\u2019t say anything and ignored them.After a day of travel, the sun was starting to set and night was about to come. Liu San shouted from the front, \u201cBoys, we will reach the Tian Shui city area tomorrow and the North family will send someone to greet us. Today, we won\u2019t be able to find any lodging, so we will camp out here to rest for a bit, then set out early tomorrow morning. Once we reach the city, I\u2019ll take you boys to the Red Ice Palace to find you some pretty girls to play with.\u201dAll of the guys let out laughs, then got off their horses. They formed a circle with the wagons and tied the horses to the wagons. After that, they pitched their tents. Some went to sleep while others started drinking. The atmosphere became very lively.There were also 3 to 5 people taking turns patrolling the area.After Wang Lin got off the carriage, Yang Sen pulled him aside to a camp fire. During their day of conversing, Yang Sen found that he really liked Wang Lin and bragged a lot about his deeds to him.The more interested Wang Lin seemed in his story, the more excited he got while talking about them. That was why he dragged Wang Lin to talk the moment the group stopped to rest.There were three people sitting next to the fire. Besides the escort head Liu San and the dark faced man, there was also a middle aged scholar-looking man. He wore a blue robe, his skin was pale, and he had a broad forehead, but his eyes revealed an intelligent light.Seeing Wang Lin arriving, Liu San laughed. \u201cSir, this is the little brother I was telling you about, the one going to Tian Shui city to make a living.\u201d With that, he said to Wang Lin, \u201cLittle brother, this is our Mighty Escort\u2019s Mr. Wang. You are also named Wang, so you guys must have some relation. You guys should talk. Mr. Wang is a very knowledgable person who has seen a lot of things.\u201dThe middle aged scholar laughed softly and said, \u201cLao Liu, you don\u2019t need to brag for me. What I know isn\u2019t considered much.\u201dLiu San rolled his eyes and said, \u201cSays who? If you are a small person, then I am nothing. Little brother, this Mr. Wang is a living immortal. He knows everything up and down. His ability to tell fortunes is beyond amazing.\u201dWang Lin carefully looked at the middle aged man. He smiled and said, \u201cSir, you are full of energy and your eyes shine brightly. You are obviously a very intelligent person.\u201dThe middle aged scholar gave Wang Lin a surprised look and said, \u201cIt seems little brother is the same as me? I see that little brother looks like a scholar, but hides a dragon inside. Your future will not be average.\u201dWang Lin smiled and said, \u201cMy village\u2019s teachers also talked about fortune telling. After listening for a while, I also learned a bit.\u201dThe middle aged scholar let out a laugh. The dark faced man quickly said, \u201cMr. Wang, check mine as well. I\u2019m already getting old. Will I have any luck with marriage?\u201dLiu San laughed. \u201cHow many times have you asked on this trip already? Every time Mr. Wang checks for someone, it takes a lot of energy, so just forget about it.\u201dThe dark face man ignored Liu San\u2019s words and stared at the middle aged scholar.The middle aged scholar pondered a little, then answered, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll check for you. Yang Sen, weren\u2019t you asking me as well? I\u2019ll check for both of you.\u201dHaving said that, he closed his eyes. When he reopened them, they were shining a golden light. Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained the same, but his heart faltered. He spread out his divine sense and found that there was a sliver of spiritual energy moving inside the middle aged man. The spiritual energy moved in a strange path and arrived at the middle aged man\u2019s eyes.The middle aged man stared at the dark faced man. He was muttering some words, as if he was calculating something, and his hand formed a seal. His face turned red as he said, while frowning, \u201cLiu Laowu, there is a bloody disaster in your future. If you can get past it, you will get married three months after the event.\u201dThe black faced man was stunned. \u201cA disaster? No problem. Us escorts live in danger, so having to deal with a bloody battle is normal,\u201d he responded.The middle aged man turned his gaze to Yang Sen. His expression changed. He said \u201cStrange. Why do you also have a bloody ray representing disaster?\u201d With that, he quickly looked at Liu San and his face became dark and said, \u201cSomething is wrong. This technique passed down by my family has never been wrong. Lao Liu, you also have the sign of a bloody disaster.\u201dWith that, he stood up with a serious expression and looked at the surrounding people. His face became even more serious. \u201cLao Liu, I think something is wrong. I see that everyone here has the ray of a bloody disaster. This can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d said the middle aged scholar.Liu San\u2019s eyes narrowed. He looked around, then asked, \u201cSir, do you mean to say that we will soon have to face a bloody disaster?\u201dThe middle aged scholar nodded. After his eyes swept past Wang Lin, he was stunned. He carefully looked at Wang Lin and his expression suddenly changed. His face turned red and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face revealed a look of fear. He pointed and Wang Lin and burst out, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u2013 Encountering the Enemy AgainLiu San and the group was stunned. They had never seen the middle aged man act like this. He secretly moved a few steps away from Wang Lin and asked, \u201cSir, what about this little brother? Is he going to encounter that bloody disaster because of us?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression was calm. He looked at the middle aged man, but didn\u2019t say a word as Situ Nan\u2019s lazy voice floated into his ears.\u201cThis little baby is kind of interesting. His fortune telling technique is pretty good. When it comes to normal people, he is able to see signs of their future, but when he wants to look into the future of us cultivators, it\u2019s like struggling in the water. I sent him some memories of me wiping out a sect and he can\u2019t handle it anymore.\u201dIn just one breath of time, the middle aged scholar was covered in sweat. His gaze toward Wang Lin was no longer neutral, but filled with fear. He heard Liu San\u2019s words and quickly said, \u201cNothing to do with little\u2026 little brother. My skill isn\u2019t good enough. I can\u2019t see through it, can\u2019t see through it.\u201d With that, he repeatedly bowed with a bitter look on his face.The scene he saw before had already completely stunned him. That was not a normal world, but a hell filled with blood. Those people in the scene were obviously not mortals. They were able to fly in the sky and destroy mountains. The middle aged man grew up learning the fortune telling technique, so he knew that immortals existed. He also knew that he mustn\u2019t get involved, or he will die.Liu San frowned and was about to speak when he suddenly heard scream. A head flew through the area and landed on the ground. It rolled until it stopped next to the fire.Liu San\u2019s expression changed greatly. He quickly stood up as he realized that this head belonged to someone who was patrolling the area.Yang San grabbed the head. He clenched his fist and said, \u201cEr Gou, brother will get revenge for you!\u201dAll of the guards took out their weapons and their killing intent spread to the surroundings.The dark faced man stood next to Liu San and asked, \u201cWho are you? Seems like you guys don\u2019t understand the rules at all.\u201dA dark laugh came from the distance. Following a rustling sound, dozens of black clothed men appeared from the ground. They padded the dirt off their clothes as they stared at everyone.\u201cMountain splitting palm Liu San, give us the thing and we will leave immediately. Otherwise, no one will leave here alive.\u201d A skinny and old man walked out of the group of black clothed men.Liu San\u2019s face was as calm as water. He said, \u201cI was wondering who it was. It seems it\u2019s the Vulture Escort.\u201dThe old man let out a laugh. \u201cMan named Liu, there is no need to say pointless things. Your Mighty Escort officially went to carry out a shipment, but secretly brought back a 500 year old ginseng. If you surrender it, you will all be safe. Don\u2019t let such a thing endanger your life.\u201dLiu San frowned. He looked at the people around him and thought, \u201cHow does the Vulture Escort know that I was hiding the ginseng? It seems there are people in the same business with greedy hearts.\u201d With that, his gaze fell on Wang Lin and he sneered.He glanced at the dark faced man. He clenched his hand and said, with a deep voice, \u201cWhether or not I have the ginseng, are you going to steal it from me with your inferior martial arts skills?\u201dThe dark faced man got the message and secretly got behind Wang Lin.Wang Lin frowned. The middle aged man quickly stopped the dark faced man and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? This little brother isn\u2019t the enemy.\u201dThe dark faced man was stunned and was unable to respond.Just at that moment, the old man let out a laugh. \u201cMan named Liu, I can\u2019t beat you, but our boss is going to act personally. You are a dead man.\u201d With that, he took a few steps back and said, \u201cThe boss has arrived.\u201d He immediately bowed on the ground.All of the black clothed men became very excited. They all did the same as the old man and shouted, \u201cThe boss has arrived!\u201dA cold voice suddenly came from all sides. \u201cBring out the ginseng, or you will die!\u201d The moment the voice arrived, a fist sized fireball flew into the circle of carriages. The extremely hot fireball hit one of the escort members. Before he could even scream, he was burned to death.At that moment, everyone in the escort was stunned. Some of them even lost their grips on their weapons and dropped them on the ground.Yang Sen\u2019s eyes revealed a look of fear. \u201cWhat\u2026what weapon is that?\u201d he shouted.Heat surged around the fire, making the escort guards understand just how hot the fire was.Liu San\u2019s face was filled with shock. He took a few steps back and stared at the burned body, unable to say a word.The dark faced man\u2019s eyes revealed extreme fear. He said, while trembling, \u201cImmortal\u2026immortal technique?\u201d The dark faced man took the test to enter a sect when he was a kid. After he failed, he entered the martial arts world. The test was deeply ingrained in his mind, so when he saw the fireball, he immediately made the connection.The old man revealed a proud expression and said, \u201cOf course our boss is an immortal. Why don\u2019t you quickly hand the ginseng over to us.\u201dAll of the members of the escort looked at Liu San. Their eyes revealed a cry for help. If it was normal people, they would have the courage to fight, but this was an immortal. All of the escort guards lost their will to fight.Liu San revealed a bitter look. He was about to speak when three more fireballs appeared in the air, motionless.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he became very interested. From the looks of the fireballs, the person who was casting them couldn\u2019t have been higher than the 3rd layer. He touched his chin and sent out his divine sense. He quickly found the person on a large tree not far away.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Wang Lin muttered. He was stunned. The person was about 20 years old and was at the peak of the 2nd layer. He could almost break into the 3rd layer. The young man\u2019s face was gloomy and was covered in scars. At first glance, he looked very ferocious, but the more Wang Lin looked, the more familiar he looked.The middle aged scholar sighed. \u201cLao Liu, give it to them. Even if the North family finds out, they wouldn\u2019t blame us. The enemy is an immortal. How could us mortals defend against him?\u201dLiu San hesitated for a bit, then helplessly took out a small case and placed it on the ground.The moment the case landed on the ground, it rose into the air. However, it didn\u2019t fly to the Vulture Escort people, but into Wang Lin\u2019s hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 \u2013 The Strange Flying SwordLiu San jerked his head back. He gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cYou really were an spy!\u201dYang Sen\u2019s eyes were filled with rage as he looked at Wang Lin. The dark faced man\u2019s pupils shrank. He knew that the method Wang Lin used to get the box wasn\u2019t something a mortal could do.The middle aged scholar was also stunned. He looked at Wang Lin with a complex expression and sighed.Song Xing shouted, \u201cYou dare?!\u201d Then, he quickly jumped forward and grabbed toward Wang Lin\u2019s head.Song Xing\u2019s move caused Liu San\u2019s group to be confused, but Liu San didn\u2019t stop Song Xing. Everyone else also moved out of the way, opening a path to Wang Lin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even raise his head. Instead, he opened the box and saw a very shriveled up ginseng. This ginseng\u2019s body was very small, but it had countless roots. There was a yellow talisman on the ginseng, covering up the spiritual energy inside it.Song Xing had already gotten close. He smiled as he was ready to break Wang Lin\u2019s head. Then, his body suddenly quivered as an invisible force stopped him. Song Xing was tossed to the side and didn\u2019t get back up.The bizarre scene before them caused everyone to be stunned. Wang Lin didn\u2019t tear the talisman off the ginseng, but looked at it for a while. Then, he sighed and said,\u201cYou see an old friend and you won\u2019t even come out to say hi?\u201dWith a series of rustling sounds, that cold looking youth walked out of the forest. There was an invisible force around his body. All of the black clothed men were pushed to the side as he walked by. In addition, the three fireballs floating in the air returned to the youth and circled around him.The moment the black clothed men saw the youth, they respectfully said, \u201cWe greet the boss!\u201dThe youth didn\u2019t even look at Song Xing, who was coughing up blood, but looked at Wang Lin and said, \u201cThe person I know couldn\u2019t have not changed at all in 10 years! Who exactly are you?\u201dWang Lin looked at the youth, but didn\u2019t say a word. Instead, he took out a yellow paper from his bag of holding.The moment the cold looking youth saw the paper, he was stunned. He looked at Wang Lin a bit more, \u00a0then frowned. He said, \u201cFriend, what exactly is this? Friend, please give me that ginseng. It is very important to me.\u201dWang Lin was stunned and looked at the youth in front of him for a while. A doubt appeared in his heart. He spread out his divine sense and found something abnormal in the sky. He coldly smiled in his heart, then threw the ginseng over and said, \u201cForget it. I got the wrong person.\u201dA myriad of complex feelings crossed the youth\u2019s eyes. He caught the ginseng and said, \u201cThank you! Farewell.\u201d With that, he turned to leave when a dark cloud suddenly appeared. The moment the dark cloud appeared, a gust of wind caused everyone in the Mighty Escort to take several steps back.The dark cloud quickly moved and descended. As the cloud got lower, a strange gust of wind appeared and became stronger and stronger. A middle aged man dressed in white stepped onto the gust of wind and descended.The moment he appeared, an escort guard exploded into a mist of blood. Then, several other guards also exploded and turned into mist made of blood.The blood mist moved strangely in the air. They quickly gathered together and formed a shiny drop of blood.The middle aged man opened his mouth and sucked in. The drop of blood entered his mouth and his face turned red. He said, \u201cZhang Hu, you met someone you know. Why are you afraid of admitting it?\u201dZhang Hu\u2019s face quickly turned cold and respectfully said, \u201cTeacher, disciple doesn\u2019t know this person.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm. He sent out his divine sense and was stunned. This middle aged man had already reached the peak of the 15th layer.The middle aged man smiled and said to Wang Lin, \u201cFellow cultivator, do you know my disciple?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all. He said, \u201cSo what if I know or if I don\u2019t know him?\u201dThe middle aged man was stunned. He looked at Wang Lin for a bit, then suddenly smiled. \u201cMakes no difference. Although you\u2019re only at the 8th layer, if I drink your blood, it will still increase my cultivation a bit.\u201dZhang Hu\u2019s face suddenly changed. He quickly got in front of the middle aged man and said, \u201cTeacher, this person is my childhood friend. Please\u2026please spare him.\u201dA cold light flashed across the middle aged man\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cLeave. Go and gather the blood essence of all of the mortals here. You have no business with this matter.\u201dZhang Hu was about to speak when the middle aged man sneered as he said some words. Zhang Hu\u2019s face suddenly became pale and he started to bleed out of his orifices as large quantities of sweat dripped from his forehead.Wang Lin raised his brow. He activated his attraction technique and grabbed toward the middle aged man. The middle aged man\u2019s expression changed slightly. He let out a cold snort as he spat out a green light. The green light turned into a flying sword and slashed at the hand.Wang Lin\u2019s attraction technique had already reached an unimaginable level. The hand split into two hands. One grabbed Zhang Hu and the other grabbed the flying sword.The small green sword started to vibrate. The light the sword emitted flickered on and off. The middle aged man\u2019s expression suddenly changed and he threw out a black sword scabbard from his bag of holding. Without a word, he shot out several red lights from his hand.The moment the scabbard appeared, the green sword that was grabbed by the attraction technique suddenly disappeared. When it reappeared, it was next to the scabbard and fused with it.Wang Lin\u2019s face looked calm, but his heart was shocked. This was the first time the attraction technique had failed. A cold light flashed across his eyes. He slapped his bag of holding and several pieces of black wood appeared. The pieces of black wood fused into a whip and quickly flew out.Situ Nan\u2019s voice appeared in Wang Lin\u2019s ears. \u201cWang Lin, there is something strange about that sword!\u201dThe moment the flying sword entered the scabbard, it started to emit a buzzing sound as if it was facing a lot of resistance. After sinking in \u2155 of the way, it was no longer able to go any deeper. The green sword suddenly turned to blue and yanked itself out of the scabbard and slashed at the whip.This whip was something he got from Zhang Kuang. When he was in closed door training, he refined it to belong to him with advice from Situ Nan.Wang Lin controlled the whip to go around the flying sword and charge directly at the middle aged man.The middle aged man sneered. He ignored the whip and pointed at the flying sword. He muttered a few words, then the flying sword shook and suddenly disappeared. It reappeared in front of the middle aged man and slashed downwards.The middle aged man grinned and spat out a drop of golden blood. The drop of golden blood immediately turned into thin threads and entered the flying sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 \u2013 Old Man JimoWang Lin frowned. Just as he was about to retrieve the whip, a small red sword flew out of the ghostly sword. The red sword slashed down at a speed several times faster than its main body.The whip quickly split into two. It transformed back into pieces of wood and fell from the sky.The middle aged man revealed a murderous look. He waved his right hand and the sword flew toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin frowned. He grabbed Zhang Hu and threw him back. Then, he quickly backed up.The flying sword was speeding toward Wang Lin. An illusion appeared at the tip of the sword. Like lightning, the sword suddenly appeared in front of Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression changed. He waved his hand and a piece of jade appeared in it. The jade glowed and a blue light screen appeared, blocking the sword. The sword slashed down and the light screen started to crack. It couldn\u2019t hold on much longer.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He spat out a mouthful of spiritual energy into the light screen. The light blue color started to turn green and its faint color started to become more solid.The cracks started to seal back up, blocking the attack of the sword, but a faint crack appeared on the jade.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d The middle aged man\u2019s eyes narrowed. He looked at Wang Lin and said, \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re not only at the 8th layer. However, even if you\u2019re at the Foundation Establishment stage, you won\u2019t be able to get away alive from my flying sword.\u201dWith that, the middle aged man pointed with his finger while his eyes revealed a serious expression. He waved his hand and the flying sword flew back and entered the scabbard again. This time, it went halfway in and turned from blue to black and flew out of the scabbard again.A cold light flashed across Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. This was the first time Wang Lin had fought someone who was at the same cultivation level as him. Although their cultivation level was the same, his opponent obviously had better magical treasures. Wang Lin could feel that the sword had gotten a lot more powerful and Zhou Peng\u2019s jade wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it.He didn\u2019t hesitate. He slapped his bag of holding and took out an ancient jade. The moment the ancient jade appeared, it released a majestic aura.This ancient jade was the life saving treasure Liu Wenju gave to Wang Lin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye. He spat out a mouthful of spiritual energy and pointed at the ancient jade. Instantly, numerous golden symbols floated out of the ancient jade.Wang Lin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all. He coldly stared at the middle aged man. Killing intent appeared in his eyes.The middle aged man\u2019s pupils shrank. He hesitated a bit, then clenched his teeth and took out two golden orbs. The two golden orbs flew into the flying sword.The flying sword was currently black and covered in shining, golden spots. The sword circled around once, then flew toward Wang Lin. Several black swirls appeared near the sword.The coldness in Wang Lin\u2019s eyes intensified. He didn\u2019t even bother with the sword, he just pointed at the ancient jade before him. The golden symbols on the ancient jade suddenly glowed and came out of the jade. The symbols lined up. There was a total of 9 symbols.The flying sword was flying toward Wang Lin. He formed a seal with his hand and three of the symbols began to glow. The three symbols quickly appeared around the sword. Lightning connected the three symbols, forming a prison and trapping the flying sword.The flying sword was like a trapped beast, releasing a strong buzzing sound. It charged around in the cage and, every time it collided with the cage, the symbols would shine.The middle aged man\u2019s expression finally changed and he said, \u201cThis\u2026 this is a core treasure?\u201dWang Lin had learned from Situ Nan what a core treasure was. It was simply a treasure made by a Core Formation cultivator. If a Nascent Soul cultivator made a treasure, it was called Nascent Treasure.The middle aged man quickly revealed a look of fear. He waved his hand and grabbed toward the scabbard.Wang Lin let out a cold smile. The seal on his hand changed. The remaining six symbols instantly started to shine and charged toward the middle aged man.The fear in the middle aged man increased greatly. He quickly took out several pieces of jade, hoping that they would increase his chances of escaping.Before the pieces of jade could even activate, they exploded under the effect of the golden symbols. They didn\u2019t manage to stop the golden symbols one bit.The middle aged man revealed a look of despair and shouted, \u201cFellow cultivator, I am old man, Jimo\u2019s disciple\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, the golden symbols appeared before him. The first symbol pressed into his chest. His chest quickly caved in, causing him to cough out a mouthful of blood.The second symbol followed quickly after. The middle aged man bled out from his orifices and his chest had been pierced through.The third symbol quickly followed as well and the middle aged man\u2019s body completely disintegrated along with his bag of holding. Only the sword scabbard was completely unharmed and fell to the ground.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He pointed toward the ancient jade. Suddenly, the three remaining golden symbols paused and entered the ancient jade again.Also, after the middle aged man died, the frequency of the collisions from the flying sword slowed down until it eventually stopped moving.Wang Lin waved his hand. The three symbols trembled. Two of the symbols collapsed and only one of them followed Wang Lin\u2019s call and returned to the jade.Wang Lin carefully put the piece of jade back into his bag of holding. This piece of jade originally only had one attack, but, with Situ Nan\u2019s help, he managed to split it into 9 attacks. Although each attack was much weaker, it allowed him to use it more often.After doing all of that, he took a deep breath. His forehead was covered in sweat. This was the most vicious fight he\u2019s had since he started cultivating. He activated the attraction technique and retrieved the flying sword and scabbard to exam them.\u201cWang Lin, I didn\u2019t act before not because I didn\u2019t want to, but because my Nascent Soul essence has a limit, so it can\u2019t be carelessly wasted. Plus, you have to experience these life and death battles to help you grow in the future.\u201d This time, Situ Nan\u2019s voice was serious for once.Wang Lin nodded. He didn\u2019t say a word as he curiously checked out the treasure in his hand.Situ Nan explained. \u201cThis flying sword is really strange. That little baby could even display its full power. However, the real treasure here is that sword scabbard.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 \u2013 Teng Family CityWang Lin was checking out the treasures when he suddenly heard a whisper from behind. He shot a golden light into the flying sword and turned around. Zhang Hu opened his eyes. After he saw Wang Lin, he was startled. He looked around and saw the flying sword and sword scabbard in Wang Lin\u2019s hands. Zhang Hu revealed a joyous look and asked, \u201cHe\u2026died?\u201dWang Lin chuckled and nodded. \u201cYes. Zhang Hu, did you say you didn\u2019t know me before because of him?\u201dZhang Hu quickly touched his chest. After pondering for a while, he said, \u201cHe really is dead . Wang Lin, this is not a good place to talk. Once I finish all these people, we can catch up.\u201dWith that, he raised his right hand and 3 fireballs appeared.All of the people in the surroundings were completely stunned. What they just saw was something they had never thought they would see in their lives. When they saw the fireballs in Zhang Hu\u2019s hand, their faces revealed looks of fear.As for the people dressed in black, they also carefully looked at Zhang Hu with fear in their eyes.Wang Lin frowned. Just as he was about to speak, Zhang Hu took a step and threw the fireballs. However, the target was not Liu San\u2019s group, but the group of men dressed in black.In terms of their worth, the lives of these mortals were like ants. Without any ability to fight back, the men in black, including Song Hang, were caught by the fireballs. The strange thing was that their whole bodies weren\u2019t burned to ashes. Several strange golden drops of blood formed and were swallowed by Zhang Hu.Liu San\u2019s group were roasted by the heat of the fire until their hair curled and skin cracked, but none of them dared to move one bit.Seeing that Zhang Hu formed 3 more fireballs, Wang Lin said, in a heavy tone, \u201cZhang Hu, don\u2019t kill anymore.\u201dZhang Hu turned his head and looked at Wang Lin, then said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t kill these people, then they will go back and report everything. The person you killed is my teacher and also old man Jimo\u2019s 6th disciple. If he finds out about this, it will be hard for us to escape death.\u201dThe middle aged scholar was one of the few who was still calm. He quickly said, \u201cTwo immortals, we promise that we won\u2019t talk. I\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, Zhang Hu frowned and sneered, \u201cPromise not to talk? That\u2019s not up to you. When they take out your soul and refine it, you will tell them everything.\u201d Although he was talking to the middle aged scholar, his eyes were on Wang Lin.Wang Lin pondered for a while. He waved his hand and the remaining 6 or 7 people forcibly moved until they landed in front of Wang Lin.Zhang Hu withdrew the fireballs and stood at the side, silent.Wang Lin took out a piece of jade from his bag of holding. This was the jade he got from Zhang Kuang when he went to the exchange with Wang Hao.He vaguely remembered that there was technique inside that would wipe people\u2019s memories.After carefully searching the jade, he found the technique. Wang Lin checked it once and put the jade away. Wang Lin\u2019s eyes looked at the group and glowed blue. The blue light entered their eyes and their eyes also glowed blue before they fainted and fell onto the ground.Zhang Hu secretly sighed. He opened his mouth to say something, but didn\u2019t speak in the end.After Wang Lin finished the technique, he looked at Zhang Hu and flew off into the distance. Zhang Hu sighed. He spat out a golden ball, got on it, and flew after Wang Lin.The two flew in the air for a long time. Zhang Hu started to run out of breath and landed on a mountain top while Wang Lin slowly floated down.Zhang Hu calmed his breathing, then found a place to sit down. He took out two pieces of sweet potato and passed one to Wang Lin. \u201cI baked this. Check how it tastes,\u201d he said.Wang Lin took the sweet potato. He felt like he had returned to 10 years ago when the two had just meet.\u201cWhen I left the Heng Yue Sect back then, I didn\u2019t go home, but wandered around, looking to join another cultivation sect. I got lucky and consumed some herbs and somehow managed to reach the 1st layer of Qi Condensation. I have to thank the weasel\u2019s booklet for that. After meeting Bai Zhan, he decided not to kill me after he saw that I was at the 1st layer. Instead, he made me his disciple to help him gather the blood of mortals. He left a poison in me so he could control my life and death.\u201d\u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t want to say I knew you because he was nearby, but, thankfully, you killed him. That destroyed the poison in my body and I\u2019m finally free.\u201d Zhang Hu took a bite of sweet potato as he quickly explained what had happened in the past 10 years.Wang Lin felt very regrettable. Although Zhang Hu\u2019s story was very simple and short, he could see from Zhang Hu\u2019s expression that these 10 years had been very difficult for him.Zhang Hu revealed a look of envy and said, \u201cWang Lin, we haven\u2019t seen each other in 10 years. Seeing that you could kill my teacher, you must have reached Foundation Establishment. My teacher\u2019s flying sword is very powerful. He said he could only use \u2156 of its power, but even then, no one below Foundation Establishment could compete with him.\u201dWang Lin shook his head and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t reached Foundation Establishment yet. Do you know where this flying sword came from?\u201dZhang Hu looked at Wang Lin with a surprised look, but he didn\u2019t ask further. He carefully thought about it and said, \u201cI think he talked about it once. I think he said he found it in a cave and only got it because of the great opportunities at that moment. He always viewed it as a great treasure. Also, that sword scabbard is also a treasure. Teacher treasured that scabbard several times more than the flying word. I once heard from my teacher that besides him, unless someone is at the Core Formation stage, they can\u2019t refine it for themselves.\u201dWang Lin found a rock to sit down on. He pondered for a while, then asked, \u201cTell me about old man Jimo so we can at least be on guard against a few things.\u201dZhang Hu swallowed the sweet potato in his mouth and said, \u201cOld man Jimo is an independent cultivator. It\u2019s said that he has already reached Core Formation. He cares about his reputation a lot, so he will definitely be out searching for us when he finds out about Bai Zhan\u2019s death. You better return to the Heng Yue Sect. As for me, I can go hide in the Teng Family city. Even old man Jimo won\u2019t dare to be arrogant there. As long as I stay in the city, I should be safe.\u201dWang Lin wrily smiled and said, \u201cThe Heng Yue Sect only exists in name now.\u201dZhang Hu was startled and said, \u201cI heard about this before. 4 years ago, the Xuan Dao Sect stole the Heng Yue mountain, but I heard that the Heng Yue Sect disciples migrated. Did you not migrate with them?\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t want to discuss this matter and asked, \u201cWhat kind of place is the Teng Family city?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 \u2013 Refining The Flying SwordZhang Hu stuffed the remaining sweet potato in his mouth. After he finished eating, he said, \u201cThe Teng Family city belongs to a large cultivation family in the northern part of Zhao. It is said that they have Nascent Soul experts in the family. If a cultivator wants to enter the city, they have to pay 1 low quality spirit stone. If they wish to live there, they must pay 1 mid quality spirit stone per month. With all of the spirit stones I have gathered, I can live there for 6 months.\u201dWang Lin rubbed his chin and asked, \u201cZhang Hu, does this Teng Family City have an exchange fair?\u201dZhang Hu nodded and said, \u201cThere do. Every month, there is a large exchange fair where all of the surrounding cultivators come. Are you going to go exchange some things?\u201dWang Lin nodded and smiled, \u201cWhat? Do you not welcome me following you? I don\u2019t have many spirit stones, so I\u2019m relying on you.\u201dThe Teng Family was a very famous cultivation family in the northern part of the country of Zhao. The family head, Teng Xingsen, reached the Nascent Soul stage in the last 500 years, so he didn\u2019t go to the wars in the rank 4 countries.He was also Wu Feng Valley\u2019s minister, so his position was very high.Because the Teng Family had an ancestor like him, no one dared to mess with them, even though they weren\u2019t a big sect.The Teng Family\u2019s exchange fair provided a platform for the cultivators to trade in. At the beginning of each month, Teng Family City was very busy.Where there are lot of people, there will naturally be a lot of conflicts. Sometimes, people would fight the moment they met. Because of that, \u00a0the Teng family ancestor, Teng Xingsen, set a no fighting rule in the city.Everyone in the city was prohibited from fighting.The moment the order came out, everyone in the city obeyed, especially after Teng Xingsen personally came out and killed a few Core Formation cultivators.On this day, two rainbows flew across the sky toward the Teng Family city. One of them said, \u201cWang Lin, flying is prohibited in the city, so we need to walk from here.\u201dThese two were Wang Lin and Zhang Hu.Wang Lin\u2019s gaze swept the Teng Family City before him. This city wasn\u2019t big. To be honest, it was more like a large town than a city.Outside the city stood two Teng Family disciples greeting travelers with smiles and handing out tokens.Wang Lin expanded his divine sense and immediately found out that both of them were at the 3rd layer, like Zhang Hu.Looking at the long line going into the city, Wang Lin wasn\u2019t in any rush. He checked everyone in the line and found that everyone was a cultivator, but the strongest was only at the 13th layer.After a long time, just as Wang Lin and Zhang Hu were about to arrive at the gate, a figure suddenly appeared in the distance. The figure released a very strong aura. Wang Lin sent out his divine sense and was stunned. This person wasn\u2019t old at all, only about 30 years old, but had already reached Foundation Establishment.This person quickly arrived at the front of the gate. He waved his hand and created a wind that blew everyone away. The people with lower cultivation were sent rolling on the ground.Zhang Hu would have also been sent rolling if Wang Lin hadn\u2019t caught him right away.Wang Lin was also sent back a few steps. His expression was normal as he coldly looked at that person.The person let out a cold snort and walked to the gate. He threw out a token and the two guards became very respectful. One of them even followed the person into the city.Zhang Hu revealed a look of envy and asked, \u201cWhat cultivation level is that person at to have that much power with just a wave of his sleeve?\u201dWang Lin lightly said, \u201cFoundation Establishment.\u201dWhen it was their turn to enter the city, Zhang Hu quickly handed over two low quality spirit stones and the two entered the city.Zhang Hu had been here many times before. He lead Wang Lin through the city before paying two mid quality spirit stones to get rooms for themselves.Zhang Hu smiled at Wang Lin. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much money left. I hope this 500 year old ginseng sells well. We will split the profit evenly between us.\u201dThe two talked for a bit before returning to their own rooms.Wang Lin returned to his room and sat down cross legged. He took out Zhang Hu\u2019s master\u2019s flying sword and sword scabbard. After watching them for a long time, his eyes lit up and he threw the flying sword into the air. His hand formed a seal and pointed at the flying sword. A golden light flew out from the flying sword. Then, the flying sword suddenly moved like it returned to life and tried to fly away.Just as it charged halfway across the room, it seemed to have hit an invisible wall. It changed directions and charged again, but was stopped once again. After charging in a few directions, the flying sword stopped, released a humming sound, and charged toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression was normal as he took out the life saving treasure and sent out the golden symbol. The flying sword seemed to be afraid of the symbol, so it backed away.Wang Lin waved his right hand and the golden symbol started to circle around Wang Lin\u2019s body. The sword didn\u2019t seem to dare to attack Wang Lin again and started to wildly charge around the room faster and faster.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye. He spat out a mouthful of spiritual power to surround the sword. The flying sword suddenly disappeared and reappeared in front of the door and was about to charge out.At that moment, the flying sword turned from black to blue and its humming became a lot weaker.Without a word, Wang Lin pointed with his right hand and the golden symbol charged toward the flying sword.The sword\u2019s humming revealed a hint of fear as it backed away when the golden symbol got closer. Then, the sword suddenly disappeared again and reappeared near the window.The color of the sword suddenly changed from blue to green. The sword now looked exactly like it did before it entered the sword scabbard.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes darted across the room. He noticed that the sword\u2019s teleportation ability had something to do with its color. Without a master, it seemed its teleportation cost a lot of spiritual power.Situ Nan\u2019s slowly said, \u201cThe more consciousness a treasure has, the harder it is to refine. Even after killing its master, it will still take a lot of effort to make it your own treasure.\u201dWang Lin narrowed his eyes. He knew that this flying sword had consciousness and even had a teleportation skill. The more difficult it was to refine, the more he wanted to make it his own.Seeing that the flying sword was about to escape, Wang Lin waved his hand and two golden symbols flew out. The golden symbols blocked the flying sword\u2019s path and were positioned so that even if the sword teleported again, it wouldn\u2019t be able to get away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 \u2013 Blood Refining TechniqueAfter teleporting three times, the flying sword\u2019s color changed to light green. Both the light and sound that were emitting from the sword clearly showed that it was much weaker.Shortly after, the flying sword that hadn\u2019t teleported in a while was pushed into a corner by the two golden symbols. Wang Lin spat out another mouthful of spiritual energy. The flying sword was too slow and was surrounded by the spiritual energy. The two golden symbols circled the flying sword like two golden dragons. Every time the flying sword tried to escape, they\u2019d force it back, so the flying sword couldn\u2019t get out.As time passed, the flying sword\u2019s struggle didn\u2019t decrease, but it got more violent. When the spiritual energy surrounding the flying sword was fading, Wang Lin clenched his teeth and spat out another mouthful of spiritual energy to keep refining it.The night slipped by and the sword\u2019s struggle finally seemed to have decreased a bit. Wang Lin\u2019s face was pale. He had already spat out dozens of mouthfuls of spiritual energy.Even with his 15th layer cultivation level, and with the help of the spirit liquid, he could barely hang in there.The morning light shone into the room as Wang Lin continued his refining of the sword. The flying sword was no longer struggling. It floated in the air as slivers of Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy entered it.The moment Wang Lin\u2019s expression changed, he heard a knock, followed by Zhang Hu\u2019s voice.\u201cWang Lin, do you want to go with me to the weapon store?\u201dWang Lin took a deep breath and said, \u201cZhang Hu, I\u2019m at the critical point of my refining, so I can\u2019t go.\u201dZhang Hu was stunned. He pondered for a while, then, without a word, sat down cross legged in front of Wang Lin\u2019s door.Wang Lin no longer bothered with Zhang Hu and continued to refine. Time slowly passed until it was night. Wang Lin had already drank three gourds of spirit water, but the refining was still not over.In desperation, Wang Lin had to ask Situ Nan for advice.Situ Nan slowly said, \u201cKid, finally figured out that you should come to me? Hmph, I\u2019ve been waiting. If you go into closed door training for 10 years and use up a lot of spiritual power, you might have a chance to successfully refine it. I\u2019m talking about the real world, not the space in the heaven defying bead.\u201dWang Lin frowned and asked, \u201cThat long?\u201dSitu Nan slowly said, \u201cOf course. This is a Core Formation treasure and a super high-grade Core Formation treasure at that. A crazy Core Formation cultivator must have made it while they were tackling Nascent Soul cultivators and, by risking their chance to successfully reach Nascent Soul, they used the moment of breakthrough to refine this treasure. This person was really a madman. I have also wanted to do this, but after considering it for a long time, I gave up. Although failing to reach Nascent Soul isn\u2019t too bad, breaking through to Nascent Soul is the a very dangerous moment. One misstep and your soul will completely disappear.\u201d\u201cThat Bai Zhan must have also received help from the creator to make it his personal weapon. If I still had my body, it would be easy to refine, but now, even I can\u2019t do much \u2026 however\u2026\u201dWang Lin already knew about this old guy\u2019s temper and that he liked to tempt people, so Wang Lin wasn\u2019t worried and waited.After a while, Situ Nan sighed and muttered, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll tell you this: if you use the normal method of refining, it will take too much time. I\u2019ll teach you a method called the blood refining technique. The advantage is that you can instantly make this flying sword your own, however, the disadvantage is that if the flying sword takes damage, you will also take damage. But with the time required to refine it, the damage you\u2019d take would be several times worse than other methods.\u201dWang Lin pondered a bit and said, \u201cTell me how to use this blood refining technique.\u201dSitu Nan just wanted to leave Wang Lin in suspense for a bit, but realized that this kid would probably just ignore him, so he decided to speak, but he raised one condition.\u201cI haven\u2019t touched a woman in so many years. No matter what, you must let me be satisfied, even if I\u2019m just watching.\u201dWang Lin vaguely answered Situ Nan. Then, his hand formed strange seals according to Situ Nan\u2019s directions. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood filled with spiritual power. Then, he moved his hands and a strange symbol appeared in the air.The moment the symbol appeared, the blood started to enter the symbol. Soon, all of the blood was absorbed and all that remained was a blood colored symbol. Wang Lin waved his hand and the symbol landed on the sword.The flying sword trembled and immediately started to release strands of white gas.Wang Lin immediately spat out another mouthful of blood. He looked weaker, but his eyes looked more determined. He formed another strange symbol that absorbed the blood and was shot toward the flying sword.This process lasted several hours. It wasn\u2019t until the morning that a sharp sword hum came out of Wang Lin\u2019s room. Zhang Hu, who had been sitting outside Wang Lin\u2019s room the whole time, immediately stood up.The door silently opened. Wang Lin\u2019s face was carrying a bright smile. His mood was very good right now. He said, \u201cThank you, Zhang Hu.\u201dZhang Hu looked at Wang Lin with a strange expression and asked, \u201cWhat were you doing? Why did I just hear that sword hum just now?\u201dWang Lin opened his mouth and a small, green flying sword immediately flew out. The moment the sword appeared, a smell of blood surrounded the area.Zhang Hu was stunned and asked, \u201cThis\u2026this is my teacher\u2019s flying sword? You managed to refine it? Eh? Why is there such a strong scent of blood?\u201dWang Lin nodded. He waved his right hand and the flying sword returned to his side and entered his mouth again. Wang Lin was also very irritated over this strong scent of blood. Situ Nan only told him near the end that all treasures refined using the blood refining technique would have a bloody scent and, as it kills people in the future, the scent will only get stronger.Zhang Hu gawked at the flying sword. After a long time, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cWang Lin, I\u2019m impressed. With this flying sword, people of the same level will no longer be a threat to you. This sword\u2019s special ability is teleportation. The distance varies depending on the spiritual power of the user, but, when used unexpectedly, it is a very good ace.\u201dThe two exchanged a few words. When Zhang Hu was about to leave, he reminded Wang Lin that the monthly exchange fair was in 3 days and that Wang Lin should prepare for it.After Zhang Hu left, Wang Lin took out the sword scabbard. Even Situ Nan kept praising this sword scabbard and didn\u2019t know what rank of treasure this was.Wang Lin originally thought that this flying sword and sword scabbard were part of a set, but, after refining the flying sword, he noticed the difference between the two.Upon closer inspection, the sword scabbard released a very strong killing intent. The closer Wang Lin looked, the stronger the killing intent became, until his mind would go blank and he could only see the faint illusion of a sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 \u2013 Stealing Foundation (1)It was an extremely ancient sword. An evil aura was being released by the sword. That made it so that one couldn\u2019t help but stare at it. After a long time, Wang Lin slowly awakened. His eyes lit up as he gained some understanding.Three days later, the entire Teng Family City was covered in flowers as thousands of cultivators walked through the streets. Zhang Hu and Wang Lin had left early in the morning and were wandering around in the city.Because Zhang Hu needed to sell the ginseng, he left after talking to Wang Lin for a bit.Wang Lin slowly walked through the city while checking out all of the stalls. Some of the stuff really interested him, but the prices were simply too high, so Wang Lin left.While he was walking, he suddenly stopped. Before him was the stall of a cultivator who had various flying swords, pieces of jade, and a thread bound book.There were a few small words on the book. \u201cBasic formation research\u201d\u201cFormation? \u201c Wang Lin rubbed his chin and picked up the book. The little book was pretty thick. There were about 50 or 60 pages in the book.The stall owner was a 30 something year old man. He raised his head and slowly said, \u201c10 mid quality spirit stones for the book. If you\u2019re not going to buy it, don\u2019t carelessly touch it.\u201d10 mid quality spirit stones was all that Wang Lin had at the moment. After flipping through the book for a bit longer, he saw that the stall owner was getting impatient, so he put down 10 mid quality spirit stones and left.He checked out a few more stalls and found some wood element materials, but they were all very expensive. There was even an piece of iron wood, but its price was unfathomably high.A day had passed before Wang Lin even realized it. He returned to the inn and, just as he was about to step inside, he raised his brow and stopped.Normally, at this time of day, the inn was really lively, but it was completely silent at the moment.Wang Lin spread out his divine sense and his face suddenly changed. There was a mysterious force surrounding the inn that was preventing Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense from going in.Without a word, Wang Lin\u2019s body immediately moved backwards. He surrounded his body with the attraction technique and his body shot back dozens of meters like a sword.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Your reaction was pretty fast.\u201d A slightly surprised voice suddenly came out as a person walked out of the inn. This person was 25 or 26 years old and wore a white robe with black vines embroidered on the cuffs.He looked at Wang Lin, who was quickly backing away. He sneered and said, \u201cTeng Jia, Teng Yi, the two of you wait here for that kid, Zhang Hu. Destroy his cultivation, then throw him into jail while I catch this nimble brat.\u201dThe moment he said those words, two shadows shot out and appeared next to him. The two shadows were two wrinkly faced old men. One of them said, \u201cMy lord, these two people are in Teng Family City. This is against the rules. If the head asks\u2026\u201dThe white robed man frowned and stared Wang Lin. He said, \u201cIf my grandpa asks, just tell the truth. Zhang Hu got help from an outsider to kill his own teacher. How could I let such people get away?\u201dWith that, he waved his sleeves and his body flew into the air as he quickly chased after Wang Lin.The two old men looked at the young man before leaving, then disappeared without a trace.Wang Lin released all of his power and and pushed himself to the limit to run away. Right as he saw the walls of the city, a few shadows suddenly appeared and shouted, \u201cFeng Family City has a restriction on flying. Fellow cultivator, please stop!\u201dWithout a word, Wang Lin took out a gourd. He didn\u2019t have time to worry about the secret of the spirit water getting out as he took a big gulp. Spiritual energy filled his body as his speed exploded and he shot forwardThe expression of the Teng Family disciples, who were blocking Wang Lin\u2019s path, suddenly changed. Wang Lin charged through as he used his attraction technique to throw the disciples to the side.Like an unstoppable force, Wang Lin broke through. Because of his actions, more than 100 Teng Family disciples riding on different treasures chased after him.Wang Lin felt very bitter in his heart. He still didn\u2019t really know what exactly was going on. He didn\u2019t know what had happened back at the inn to cause those people to be waiting for him there. If he was just slightly slower, he would have already been caught.As for Zhang Hu, Wang Lin could only wish for the best as he was in danger himself.After leaving Teng Family City, Wang Lin kept racing south as the Teng Family disciples chased behind him. Suddenly, a rainbow color light shot out from Teng Family City. The light passed by all of the Teng Family disciples and shot at Wang Lin.An almost unreal, large flying sword appeared and slashed down at Wang Lin. At that moment, lightning gathered into countless balls and fell down with the sword.Wang Lin\u2019s scalp felt numb as Situ Nan shouted, \u201cThis is a Nascent level treasure! Wang Lin, retract all of your divine sense. I\u2019m going to teleport you!\u201dBlue crystal quickly spread from the crystal in Wang Lin\u2019s hand and covered his body. The moment that happened, the giant sword fell down. Sounds of the ground shattering echoed and the balls of lightning fell, creating waves of lightning.Wang Lin\u2019s body disappeared the moment the giant sword fell down. His body reappeared 300 meters away and he immediately flew away.Situ Nan\u2019s voice sounded weak as he scolded Wang Lin. \u201cThat little bastard is already at the Foundation Establishment stage at that young age. If you were at the Foundation Establishment stage, I could borrow your body and use some techniques. But right now, with only your Qi Condensation cultivation level, no matter how much I help, I can only get rid of a mid stage Foundation Establishment.\u201dTeng Li frowned, but immediately smiled. \u201cYou are the first person below Core Formation who has escaped from an attack from me. If it wasn\u2019t for brother Jimo asking me to do this, I really wouldn\u2019t want to kill you.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t even turn his head as he quickly escaped. His consumption of spiritual power was too great. Without any hesitation, he took out a gourd and drank a gulp as his speed rose.Teng Li\u2019s eyes became cold and said, \u201cI want to see how many times you can teleport!\u201d With that, he pointed his finger at Wang Lin. The sky darkened and the giant sword appeared gain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 \u2013 Stealing Foundation (2)All of the lightning balls roared as the giant sword swung down.Situ Nan didn\u2019t wait for Wang Lin to give him permission, he instantly teleported them again after cursing a few times.Teng Li frowned. He snorted and waved his right hand. The flying sword followed his hand and chased after Wang Lin.Two rays of rainbow followed one after the other as they flew across the sky. The Teng family\u2019s disciples chased for a while before giving up because they couldn\u2019t keep up.The more Teng Li chased, the more shocked he became. With his late stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, every time he caught up to the brat, the brat would teleport away.The more Wang Lin acted like this, the more interested Teng Li became. Teleport was a Nascent Soul technique. Wang Lin wasn\u2019t even at the Foundation Establishment stage, but could use teleportation. In Teng Li\u2019s eyes, Wang Lin must own a treasure that did this.Thinking about that, he licked his lips. The urge to kill Wang Lin for that treasure became even stronger.He was very good friends with old man Jimo\u2019s eldest disciple, Chen Zhong. A few days ago, he received a voice transmission jade from Chen Zhong to kill two people. One of them was Zhang Hu, who was the disciple of the 5th disciple of old man Jimo.Zhang Hu got outside help to kill his teacher and at the moment of the 5th disciple\u2019s death, old man Jimo detected it. That Zhang Hu didn\u2019t know that besides the poison, there was also a secret technique that old man Jimo used to control his disciples inside of him. By using this technique, he saw everything that occurred. In a fit of rage, old man Jimo used the technique to predict where Zhang Hu would be and sent out his eldest disciple, Chen Zhong, to find the two.Chen Zhong was very far away, so he sent a message to Teng Li to help him with this matter.Teng Li did a search and found that Zhang Hu was indeed inside Teng Family City and the person with Zhang Hu must\u2019ve been his accomplice. Those were the events that lead up to now.Originally, he just planned on helping as a favor, but now, he was determined to kill Wang Lin for the treasure that allowed him to teleport.Thinking about that, his speed increased as he chased after Wang Lin.Wang Lin drank a large gulp of spirit liquid. He then opened his mouth and spat out a ray of green light. The moment the green light appeared, the smell of blood filled the air.Soon, the green light flashed as it shot backward while Wang Lin continued to charge forward.Teng Li could clearly see what was going on. He didn\u2019t mind the green light at all and let out a sneer. He pointed at the green light and a lightning ball appeared that shot toward the green light.The moment the lightning ball touched the green light, it exploded.Teng Li looked at it with a look of contempt before withdrawing his gaze. Just at that moment, a ray of green light flashed 10 meters before him. The light shot toward Teng Lin and hit his body. His clothes were instantly destroyed, revealing glittering armor.After the green light was stopped by the armor, it immediately flashed and disappeared without a trace.Wang Lin secretly sighed and felt very regrettable. The green sword appeared in his hand as he continued to run away.Sweat appeared on Teng Li\u2019s forehead. What just happened was simply too dangerous. Even with his late stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, if he was hit, he would have been seriously injured. Also, the light that that sword released showed that it wasn\u2019t a simple treasure. He guessed that if he was hit by it, he would have died on the spot.Teng Li touched the armor his grandfather gave him and felt like he was very lucky, but his urge to kill Wang Lin had increased even more. A cold light flashed across his eyes as he muttered to himself, \u201cBesides the treasure that can teleport, he also has that sword. Little guy, all of your treasures will belong to me.\u201dIn a desert, three days later. Wang Lin drank a gulp of spirit liquid and muttered to himself, \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough spirit liquid left. I must find a way to quickly replenish it.\u201dSitu Nan weakly said, \u201cKid, I can\u2019t hold out much longer. I have used teleport too much in these past 3 days and don\u2019t have much essence left.\u201dWang Lin turned his head and his eyes were filled with killing intent as he coldly said, \u201cHe caught up again.\u201d He touched his bag of holding and a green sword appeared in his hand.The sword\u2019s color was dull and there were a few scratches on it. In these three days, Wang Lin had used the sword many times, but since Teng Li was already on guard, it was hard to launch a sneak attack. Also, Wang Lin\u2019s sword couldn\u2019t penetrate even an inch because of Teng Li\u2019s armor.After sending out the flying sword, Wang Lin spread out his divine sense and found a forest to the west. The forest was covered in a layer of fog.After pondering a little, without a word, Wang Lin flew to the west. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the forest and descended to the ground.Wang Lin knew that he was running out of spirit liquid and Situ Nan couldn\u2019t teleport anymore, so if he stayed in the air, he would be caught for sure.It would be better to give up on flying and travel on foot in the forest. Although he didn\u2019t know why this forest was covered by fog, he found that when he spread out his divine sense, his senses became muddy and he could only feel a dozen meters around him.Shortly after Wang Lin entered the forest, a rainbow arrived at the edge of forest. After circling the air around the forest, Teng Li stopped at the entrance. He had used up too much spiritual energy chasing Wang Lin in the past 3 days. If he didn\u2019t have recovery pills with him, he would have already given up on the chase.But the treasures that Wang Lin possessed had always kept him hooked. He wished he could immediately kill Wang Lin and take the treasures. Also, he didn\u2019t expect Wang Lin to last for so long. Even though Wang Lin could use a teleportation treasure, he didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard. He thought that because Wang Lin still hadn\u2019t even reached the Foundation Establishment stage, he would be able to outlast Wang Lin.So he wasn\u2019t in a rush during the entire chase and was waiting until Wang Lin ran out of spiritual energy to kill him in one blow.But he gave up this idea after the second day of chasing. Instead of slowing down, Wang Lin\u2019s speed increased as the chase went on. After observing for 3 days, Teng Li was completely shocked.He saw that Wang Lin would constantly take out a gourd and that every time he drank from it, his speed would increase. He had seen this countless times during the 3 day chase.The urge to kill Wang Lin became even stronger.Teng Li stood outside the forest. His eyes became cold, but he was a bit nervous about the forest. He thought, \u201cThis wild jungle is very mysterious. It is constantly surrounded by a fog and even grandfather said to stay away from this place. Now, should I keep chasing or not?\u201dAfter pondering a little, Teng Li made a decision. The treasures Wang Lin possessed made Teng Li determined to make them his own.There were many ancient trees that reached the sky and were filled with leaves. The ground was covered with half a meter thick layer of dead leaves. Countless poisonous insects crawled on the ground and snakes quickly moved through the leaves. Thousand year old trees could be seen everywhere. Countless types of flowers filled the ground, and many different type of beasts inhabited the area. The smell formed by the rotting leaves and animals created a stench strong enough to kill.This place was covered by fog year round. Strange trees grew tall enough to reach the sky and beast as powerful as Nascent Soul cultivators lived here. If one was not careful, then it would be easy to lose one\u2019s life here.Wang Lin spread out his divine sense as he quickly moved through the forest. Situ Nan quickly shouted, \u201cStop! Quickly stop!\u201dWang Lin\u2019s body stopped in an instant.Situ Nan sucked in a breath and slowly said, \u201cWhat kind of place is this, to still have Blue Line Vines? These blue vines are causes of disaster. A rank 2 country was wiped out by Blue Line Vines before.\u201d\u201cBlue Line Vine?\u201d Wang Lin was startled.Situ Nan seriously said, \u201cBefore you is a vine, and on the vine there is a blue line\u2026What is this? Wait, this isn\u2019t Blue Line Vine. Strange\u2026 Wang Lin, this should be a baby blue line vine. You better avoid it, because adult blue line vine is a nightmare for cultivators below Core Formation. This stuff is very sensitive to blood and every time it devours someone, it evolves. If it manages to reach the intermediate stage, then not even Spirit Forming cultivators can resist it. Also, this stuff is very sensitive to fluctuations of spiritual energy, so don\u2019t use techniques to attack it.\u201dWang Lin looked around with a serious look in his eyes and his gaze fell on a vine in the distance.This vine looked very normal, besides the thin blue line on it. Otherwise, it looked exactly like any other vine.Wang Lin pondered a little. He didn\u2019t listen to Situ Nan\u2019s warning, but walked forward without emitting any spiritual energy. He carefully pinched the vine and slowly pulled it out. After pulling it out for 3 meters, he let go and backed up. He cut his finger and flicked a drop of blood onto the vine.The moment the vine was hit by the blood, it immediately began to flail as a few more Blue Line Vines came out of the root and gathered together. After stirring for a while, they calmed down.Sweat appeared on Wang Lin\u2019s forehead. He faintly grinned and quickly left.Soon after he left, Teng Li arrived as well. Teng Li had been using techniques non stop to catch up to Wang Lin and Teng Li didn\u2019t even bother to pay any attention to the few vines on the ground.Although his divine sense was restricted, he could clearly feel that Wang Lin was very close. He let out a sneer as he moved faster, but just as he passed some ordinary looking vines, a change occurred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 \u2013 Stealing Foundation (3)Two days later, Wang Lin was next to a creek, filling his gourd with water while carefully checking his surroundings. His expression suddenly changed as he cursed, \u201cThis is never going to end!\u201dHe sent out his flying sword, put away his gourd as he jumped across the river, and ran deeper into the forest.A moment later, Teng Li carefully chased after Wang Lin, not daring to use any spiritual power. He looked very pathetic. His clothes were torn and his armor had lost its luster. His right arm was limp as he chased after Wang Lin.His hair was disheveled, his face was pale, and his eyes were filled with rage. His hatred for Wang Lin had reached an unimaginable degree. He had always been treated like a genius ever since he was little and never before had he been put into such a pathetic situation.All of this was caused by Wang Lin.The vines 2 days ago almost killed him. He never thought that such small vines could be so deadly. When the liquid the vine shot out hit his armor, it started to dissolve the plate.If it was only that, then it would be fine. He would have killed it with his flying sword. However, this vine was undying. Every time he cut the vine, it would divide into more.Even the lightning ball created by the flying sword couldn\u2019t stop the vines.Then, there were sneak attacks by Wang Lin\u2019s strange flying sword. His right arm was injured by the flying sword.Finally, Teng Li had to take out his life saving treasure given to him by his grandfather. The treasure was very powerful, but it only had one use. He had never used it once ever since he received it, but he knew that if he didn\u2019t use it now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to save his own life.In the end, under the power of the treasure, a majority of the vines were destroyed and the rest retreated back underground. Teng Li used this opportunity to finally escape.Thinking about it now, his forehead got covered in cold sweat. As for Wang Lin, he now hated him to the bones.Especially the fact that Wang Lin never attacked him head on and always sneak attacked him. With that strange flying sword Wang Lin possessed, Teng Li had to keep his flying sword floating around him at all times.He carefully checked the river. After hesitating for a bit, he drank some water from it as he was very thirsty after chasing for 5 or 6 days.The water felt very refreshing and sweet. Teng Li felt rejuvenated and was about to drink more when his heart suddenly skipped a beat. A small green sword quietly appeared before him and stabbed toward his head.Teng Li quickly retreated without any hesitation as he called his own flying sword to protect him. The two flying swords collided with each other, but the green sword was clearly at a disadvantage. After a while, the green sword gained a few more scratches as it suddenly flashed and disappeared.Teng Li looked at the hair the small green sword had cut as he screamed at the top of his lungs, \u201cDamn it! I swear that when I catch you, I\u2019ll let you experience all of the torture in the world and then refine your soul!\u201dWang Lin was running through the jungle as his face suddenly turned red and he swallowed a mouthful of blood. The green sword appeared next to him. He felt pain in his heart when he saw the new scratches. A cold light flash across his eyes as he kept running.Late into the night, 5 days later, Wang Lin and Teng Li were still running through the jungle. They had already entered into the deep part of the jungle and on that night, Wang Lin suddenly stopped.Situ Nan quickly said, \u201cBrat, you noticed it too? There is a very powerful spiritual fluctuation northwest of here. Go check it out.\u201d In these past few days, he had been on his toes using all of his knowledge to help Wang Lin avoid one danger after another.Without a word, Wang Lin changed his direction to northwest. Shortly after, he arrived at the spot of the spiritual fluctuation.The scene before him caused his pupils to contract.Under the moonlight was a giant tree that had been completely uprooted, laying on the ground. The area was clear of everything besides a dead body lying on the ground.Above his head floated a green bead as spiritual energy gathered from all directions, forming many smaller swirls.Situ Nan was stunned and said, with a surprised tone, \u201cA green core? Didn\u2019t think there would be a green core from a rank 4 country here.\u201dWang Lin asked, \u201cWhat is a green core?\u201d\u201cThis is the rank 4 country\u2019s demon sect\u2019s special cultivation technique, the Green Core, or the Fake Core. Unlike normal cores, you can have as many green cores as you wish. I remember that there was a mad man from a rank 4 country who had tens of thousands of green cores. Not even Spirit Forming cultivators from rank 5 countries would dare to mess with him. It has to be said that besides the ability to increase your cultivation, what makes the green core deadly is when it explodes. It is really powerful when tens of thousands of those green cores explode at once.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he suddenly asked, \u201cHow many green cores does this person before us have? Can you tell?\u201d\u201cHim? Only one is pretty good for him, and this person is also not a living person. He is clearly a zombie that has intelligence. He was probably a demonic cultivator from a rank 4 country that used a technique before his death to turn into a zombie.\u201dThat zombie had clearly already seen Wang Lin. He didn\u2019t move, but raised his finger and flicked. A green light shot out straight toward Wang Lin\u2019s forehead.Wang Lin quickly retreated and dodged the green light.The green light didn\u2019t chase, but made a circle and stopped. The green light projected a blurry imagine that released an unclear voice.\u201cLeave\u2026 this place\u2026. you\u2026 die.\u201d With that, the image\u2019s body moved as it disappeared. Soon, the massive amount of spiritual energy fluctuation disappeared without a trace as if it was completely covered up.Wang Lin carefully backed away without even batting his eyes. After a bit, a cold light flashed across his eyes and he no longer ran away, but spread out his divine sense, waiting for Teng Li to catch him.Teng Li\u2019s flying sword circled around his body, getting rid of anything in his way. He suddenly noticed something as he smiled. He pointed his finger forward and his flying sword shot out.Wang Lin\u2019s shadow was within sight. Teng Li became excited as he checked his surroundings. Wang Lin\u2019s actions put him on guard. He sneered, \u201cHow come you\u2019re not running?\u201dWang Lin pointed with his right finger and the green flying sword appeared. He waved his hand and the green sword shot out. Then, he took out a piece of jade, then spat out a mouthful of spiritual energy onto the jade.Suddenly, 4 golden characters appeared from the jade.Teng Li grinned. He bit his finger and flung out a drop of his blood onto his flying sword. Suddenly, the flying sword shook as it released demonic light and grew into a great sword. Countless lightning balls appeared as well, but there were clearly a lot less than before.The moment the great sword appeared, it released a cold aura as Teng Li swung it down.Wang Lin\u2019s small sword teleported and arrived behind Teng Li. Right before the sword could strike, Teng Li touched his bag of holding and a bell suddenly appeared and attached to his body.The small green sword struck the bell and waves of ripples appeared on it.While the great sword was swinging down, Wang Lin pointed his finger and the 4 golden symbols shot toward it. Wang Lin backed up until he arrived at the place he saw the zombie.The 4 symbols all exploded after they collided with the flying sword, sending it back up. However, there were simply too few golden symbols, so after pausing in the air for a bit, the great sword continued to swing down.Crackling sounds came from the ground as the ground clearly couldn\u2019t handle the pressure. All of the giant trees in the surrounding area fell over. Just as the sword came down, Wang Lin\u2019s body was covered in a blue light and he teleported away.Just as the sword was about to come in contact with his body, he teleported 100 meters away with a stream of blood trickling down from his forehead.The great sword slammed down into the ground with a bang. Soon after, a ghostly scream appeared and a ghostly figure that smelled like a rotten corpse charged toward Teng Li.Teng Li\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He already had his suspicions, but he didn\u2019t expect such a creature to be living here. He pointed his finger forward as the lightning balls slammed into the zombie.The lightning balls were very powerful and lightning was also the weakness of all undead. They immediately exploded when they touched the zombie. The zombie let out a scream as part of its body was blown off, revealing black bones.Teng Li sneered as he waved his left hand. Suddenly, more than 10 lightning balls appeared around the flying sword. The lightning balls charged toward the zombie, with the great sword following closely behind.Wang Lin secretly thought, \u201cNot Good!\u201d He didn\u2019t think that the zombie would be this weak and was about to escape.The zombie also noticed that something was wrong and, in a life and death situation, it let out a scream and spat out a green core. The moment the green core appeared, it immediately exploded.A wave of energy expanded outward in a ring around the zombie. All of the surrounding plants turned to dust and Teng Li, who was simply too close, bit the tip of his tongue and spat blood onto the bell attached to his body.In a flash, the bell went from a half transparent state to a more solid form. There were many ancient patterns on the bell.The moment the wave hit Teng Li, the bell shook violently. It only lasted a few seconds before it cracked.Using the time the bell bought for him, Teng Li threw out one treasure after another. As the bell broke, defensive layers went up in front of him one by one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 \u2013 Stealing Foundation (4)The countless layers of colorful defensive barriers were quickly broken through by the explosion like a sharp blade going through paper.As for Wang Lin, because he was very far away and the zombie was mainly targeting Teng Li, the shock wave didn\u2019t effect him much. When the waves arrived, he calmly took out a piece of jade and threw it in front of him. The jade immediately cracked and released a yellow gas that surrounded Wang Lin.His eyes pierced through the yellow gas and locked on to Teng Li.The shockwaves created by the explosion had started to weaken, but almost all of Teng Li\u2019s defenses had been broken. When the last layer of defense broke down, Teng Li pointed his finger at the zombie, ordering his great sword to stop its attack. At the same time, Teng Li quickly backed up 50 meters.He had already developed a deep fear of this zombie. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had so many treasures, he would have already died.It has to be said that even though the zombie\u2019s green core\u2019s explosion wasn\u2019t as strong as a normal core\u2019s explosion, it still took Teng Li\u2019s late stage Foundation Establishment cultivation with a ton of treasures to barely resist it.He was completely terrified that the zombie would throw out another green core like that. He had already lost all his urge to kill Wang Lin and only wanted to escape.Wang Lin had always been staring at Teng Li. He let out a faint smile as a cold light flashed across his eyes. He raised his right hand before him, put two of his fingers together, then gently pushed forward.Suddenly, a green light flashed and Teng Li felt pain striking his back as he was backing up. He panicked and, without looking back, continued to retreat.Wang Lin frowned. Teng Li\u2019s almost broken armor managed to stop the sword from piercing through his flesh. Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out some blood. The small green sword appeared in the blood and let out a loud sword hum, then quickly flew toward Teng Li.While in the air, the green sword suddenly teleported and stabbed toward Teng Li\u2019s back. Teng Li suddenly turned his head. His eyes were bloodshot and revealed a vicious gaze. A few pieces of jade quickly flew out of his bag of holding, forming defensive barriers.At the same time, he raised his left hand and pointed at Wang Lin. His great sword suddenly paused and sliced toward Wang Lin while several lightning balls appeared and smashed toward the zombie.He was betting, betting on whether Wang Lin\u2019s flying sword stabbed himself first or if his great sword would cut Wang Lin in half. If Wang Lin used teleport to escape, then he would lose control of the flying sword and give Teng Li time to escape. He was already almost out of gas, so if he stayed around any longer, he would be digging his own grave.Situ Nan screamed, \u201cMad! You are mad!\u201d Without waiting for Wang Lin, Situ Nan decided to teleport them. Right as the blue light appeared, Wang Lin shouted, \u201cIt is not time to teleport yet! Stop!\u201dA vicious look appeared on his face. Without looking at the great sword, he controlled the small sword to dodge the defensive layers and appeared before Teng Li.Teng Li panicked. His great sword was already half a meter above Wang Lin\u2019s head. A stream of blood flowed from Wang Lin\u2019s forehead. Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye as he grinned and said, \u201cDie!\u201dThe green sword flashed. It pierced through the armor and Teng Li\u2019s body, followed by a trail of blood.At the same time, Situ Nan used teleport. A blue light flashed as Wang Lin\u2019s body disappeared under the great sword and appeared before the bloody Teng Li.The great sword smashed down and created a deep rift in the ground.Wang Lin ignored the blood on his forehead, knelt down, and put his hand on Teng Li\u2019s body. Situ Nan knew what Wang Lin was thinking. The heaven defying bead suddenly lit up and a stream of energy flowed from the bead into Teng Li. Teng Li\u2019s body quickly froze into an ice sculpture with a terrified expression on his face.All of this happened in a short period of time. It happened so fast that the zombie didn\u2019t even realize what had happened. When it realized that Teng Li had been frozen, he cautiously looked at Wang Lin.All of the lightning balls that were charging toward the zombie dissipated. Even the great sword shrunk down to a small silver sword and fell into the rift on the ground.Wan Lin grabbed the ice sculpture and slowly backed away as he pointed the green flying sword at the zombie.The zombie stared at Wang Lin and screamed. It was about to charge at Wang Lin when it looked at the rift on the ground. During that moment of hesitation, Wang Lin had already moved more than 300 meters away and disappeared with a teleport.The zombie let out a roar and shot a look of frustration at Wang Lin\u2019s direction. It jumped into the rift and retrieved Teng Li\u2019s sword with a look of excitement and swallowed it.Wang Lin held the ice sculpture. His face was pale as he quickly moved through the forest. After making sure no one was following him, he finally relaxed a bit. He took out a gourd of spirit water and chugged it all down before sitting down cross legged to cultivate.The forest was silent. After a long time, Wang Lin opened his eyes as Situ Nan\u2019s discontented voice came.\u201cBrat, are you crazy? If I was a bit slower, you would have lost your life.\u201dWang Lin deeply said, \u201cThat was the only opportunity to kill Teng Li. If his spiritual energy recovered, there would never have been a second chance. This person has also chased me for several days. If I let him live, he will be a nuisance in the future, so I decided to take the risk. Also, the speed of the great sword depended on how much spiritual energy he had left in his body. Back then, he was almost out of power, so he couldn\u2019t have been faster than my sword.\u201dSitu Nan was silent. He found himself feeling as if he had just got to know the real Wang Lin. After a long time, he said, \u201cYou are qualified now. With that state of mind, you can establish your own sect in this cultivation world.\u201d Situ Nan\u2019s voice was no longer filled with arrogance, but with a bit of respect. If it was himself in that situation, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to risk it.Wang Lin didn\u2019t speak, but stared at Teng Li, who was trapped in ice. His eyes lit up and he said, \u201cIs it fine to steal his foundation?\u201dAfter hearing Wang Lin\u2019s question, Situ Nan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s completely possible. He is at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, so if you use him to break into Foundation Establishment, your cultivation level will rise faster than normal. Also, you will receive a bit of his talent, so your own talent will increase. This kid is already so strong at this early age, so his talent must be amazing. Haha, this time, you got something good from your gamble.\u201dWith that, Situ Nan explained the chant and the process of stealing foundation again. It wasn\u2019t until the sun went down that Situ Nan finished. Wang Lin spat out the green sword and stabbed it into a giant tree nearby.After carving a hole in the tree, Wang Lin jumped inside with Teng Li.He didn\u2019t put away the green sword, but had it float around him.The hole wasn\u2019t large and was very moist, but Want Lin couldn\u2019t be bothered by that now. He washed his wounds on his forehead with spirit liquid before he started to cultivate.In the morning of the next day, Wang Lin opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of spiritual power that turned into mist. Wang Lin didn\u2019t stop as his hand formed seals and shot out a blue light.The moment the blue light entered the spiritual energy mist, it started to move like boiling water as it shrunk and expanded.Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained calm as he kept moving his hand and shot blue light into the spiritual energy mist. As more blue lights got shot into it, it started to shrink and expand even faster.Immediately after, he moved his right hand and grabbed Teng Li\u2019s body. Situ Nan melted the ice without Wang Lin even asking.In a flash, the ice crystal surrounding Teng Li disappeared.Wan Lin\u2019s eyes lit up as he pointed his hand at the spiritual energy mist. The mist entered Teng Li\u2019s body. His body suddenly shook as his face revealed a painful expression, but his eyes remained closed. Soon, all of the mist entered Teng Li\u2019s body.Wang Lin took a deep breath as he revealed a serious expression. He bit the tip of his tongue, then drew a strange blood symbol with his hand.Wang Lin waved his right hand and the symbol landed on Teng Li\u2019s chest.Teng Li\u2019s body violently quivered as his arms and legs convulsed and blood flowed out of his orifices. However, the blood didn\u2019t drip down, but converged together.Soon after, a crisp snapping sound came from Teng Li\u2019s body as his face turned red and a strange shade of red appeared on his skin.Drops of blood seeped out of his skin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression became even more serious. Without even blinking once, he drew another blood symbol that landed on Teng Li\u2019s chest.Teng Li suddenly opened his mouth and let out a few miserable groans as all of the blood vessels in his body broke. Blood flowed out of his body and gathered in the air.In the blink of an eye, a giant ball of blood floated above Teng Li. His red colored body quickly turned pale.Wang Lin\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. He watched the ball of blood as he quickly formed seals and sent out techniques toward it. Soon, the ball of blood slowly shrunk until it was the size of a fist, emitting a blood-red light.Wang Lin took a deep breath. His entire body was soaked in sweat. Without stopping, he spat out more spiritual energy and shot blue light into it. Then, Wang Lin motioned with his hand and the mist went into Teng Li\u2019s body again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 \u2013 Stealing Foundation (5)Teng Li suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes had no light and were bloodshot. His lips quivered and his jaw was clenched.Wang Lin drew a complex symbol in the air with his right hand. Then, he bit his finger and flicked a drop of blood onto Teng Li\u2019s head.Teng Li let out a groan as his body started to violently twitch. Things started to move under his skin and made their way to his chest.Not long after, Teng Li\u2019s body visibly shrunk as all the muscles and veins in his body formed a big ball of meat on his chest.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. His right hand waved and sent out another technique. With a bang, the ball of meat separated from Teng Li\u2019s body. His body was now just a bag of bones.Wang Lin took a deep breath and spat out another mouthful of spiritual energy. The energy entered the ball of meat and, after a while, it shrunk down to the same size as the ball of blood.Wang Lin revealed an exhausted expression. He took out a gourd and drank a gulp before he started to cultivate. After a short while, he opened his eyes and pointed at Teng Li\u2019s body.Suddenly, loud cracking sounds filled the air. All of the bones in Teng Li\u2019s body crumbled into bone powder and formed a ball of bone dust.Blood, meat, and bone balls lined up, releasing a demonic aura.Wang Lin sighed and muttered to himself, \u201cIn order to steal one\u2019s foundation, you need their blood, meat, bones, soul, and spirit root. Also, the person can\u2019t die when you extract their blood, meat, and bone. This technique is just too cruel.\u201dSitu Nan slowly said, \u201cThis is nothing. In the country I came from, there are demonic sects that steal cores. That stuff is really cruel. Not only does the person who has their core taken suffer, even the person stealing it has to suffer, all for less than a 1% success rate.\u201dWang Lin pondered a little and regained his focus. He pointed his hand at Teng Li and started to chant. As Wang Lin chanted faster and faster, white gas was coming out of the pile of meat that was once Teng Li\u2019s body and gathered in the air.After an unknown amount of time, the white gas got very dense and formed a human shape. If one looked closely, the figure looked exactly like Teng Li.The little person\u2019s eyes revealed a confused look and his body shook. Slowly, the confused look disappeared as he looked viciously at Wang Lin and let out some silent screams.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye. He waved his hand and a red light appeared. The little person seemed to be afraid of the red light and tried to escape, but the area 3 meters around Teng Li\u2019s body was like a prison. No matter how hard the little person tried to escape, it couldn\u2019t get out.Finally, the little person saw that he couldn\u2019t escape. He let out a vicious look and charged toward the red light.Wang Lin revealed a deadpan expression as he waved his hand. The red light circled around the little person a few times and pulled it toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin knew that the soul extraction step was very important. He must safely extract the soul out of that 3 meter range without breaking it. Although a broken soul won\u2019t affect him stealing the foundation, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use Teng Li\u2019s spirit root to improve his own if the soul were to break.That little person\u2019s face revealed a painful expression as the red light slowly pulled it out. In the blink of an eye, half of its body had been dragged past the 3 meter mark.At that moment, a yellow light shone from the little person\u2019s body and the yellow light broke the red light. The little person quickly retreated back into the 3 meter space and with the glow of the yellow light, the little person became more solid.Wang Lin\u2019s face darkened as he stared at the little person. His hand moved to cast the technique again. The little person\u2019s face revealed a look of horror as he spoke.\u201cIf you kill, me my grandfather won\u2019t let you go! He is a Nascent Soul cultivator, so If you kill me, you will die for sure.\u201dA cold light flashed across Wan Lin\u2019s eyes. He spat out a lot of spiritual energy. Then, he constantly casted one technique after another on the spiritual energy until it became a thin line.The little person\u2019s fear became even worse as he said, \u201cMy grandfather already knows that I am in danger and he should be here any second. You\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Wang Lin waved his hand. The line wrapped around the little person and pulled him out.The little person struggled and screamed, \u201cGrandfather, save me!\u201d The yellow light glowed stronger as it resisted Wang Lin.Without a word, Wang Lin slapped his bag of holding and took out a gourd of spirit water. He poured the spirit water on the line and the line suddenly became as thick as a thumb as he pulled again.This time, no matter how hard the yellow light shone on the little person, it would no longer resist Wang Lin. The little person was pulled out of the 3 meter range. The moment the little person left the 3 meter range, the yellow light transformed into a yellow gas cloud, forming a shadowy figure inside. The figure wasn\u2019t clear, but a voice rang out, \u201cFellow cultivator, please stop! We can talk about this.\u201dWang Lin was started, but Situ Nan quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is an illusion avatar of a Nascent Soul cultivator. This is different from a physical avatar because it can\u2019t attack, see you, or even know your location. It only allows you to hear what he has to say. Also, looking at this illusion avatar, this person is very far away, that\u2019s why it is so blurry. As for why it is there, it seems he really loves Teng Li, so he always leaves that piece of divine sense with him.\u201dWithout a word, Wang Lin pointed at the little person. The little person immediately stopped, struggled, and shrunk until it was a ball that released purple light.The illusion avatar seemed to have have noticed that Teng Li\u2019s soul was being refined. He shouted, \u201cYou killed a Teng Family member, so you must pay! I will find you one day and I will kill you.\u201dAt a mountaintop tens of thousands of miles away, an old man in black robes stood up with a dark expression. His eyes lit up. He clenched his fist and muttered to himself, \u201cLi Er, your grandfather promises that I will avenge you.\u201d With that, he hit his chest with his right hand and coughed up black blood. His right hand rapidly drew in the black blood, forming countless strange symbols that floated in the air.Then, purple colored small people appeared and sat in the air.The little person shouted, \u201cCurse, go!\u201d The little person\u2019s hand formed a seal as his divine sense split up and fused into all the symbols.\u201cCurse, complete!\u201d The old man\u2019s soul visibly shrunk. It seemed he wasn\u2019t afraid to waste his energy at all. Those symbols with divine sense infused into them glowed a demonic light as they floated into the sky. They covered up half the sky, forming a formation, causing thunder to rumble.\u201cCurse, turn!\u201d The formation started to slowly turn. Blood colored lightning appeared in the sky, forming a strange diamond shape.\u201cCurse, close!\u201d The little person let out a shout as the earth shook. He spat out more soul energy as the formation spun faster and faster and the strange blood colored lightning became more and more solid. Soon, the formation shrunk until all the blood colored lightning was engraved onto the diamond shape.The pattern slowly fell down from the sky and imprinted onto the forehead of the little person.The little person let out a dark smile and said, \u201cIf you kill people of the Teng Family, you will be cursed by me!\u201dInside the hole in the tree were 4 balls floating before Wang Lin. He pointed his finger at Teng Li\u2019s remains and countless specks of gold light floated out of the remains.These specks of light were countless and \u2153 of them dissipated into the surroundings.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He knew that these specks of light were the so called spirit root. He spat out a mouthful of spiritual energy to devour the spirit root. The devoured spirit root immediately began to reject Wang Lin and the other \u2153 disappeared. Wang Lin was only able to devour \u2153 of Teng Li\u2019s spirit root.Just as at that moment, Wang Lin\u2019s forehead started to shine and a purple diamond appeared on it.Wang Lin immediately noticed it. He raised his hand to touch his forehead and his expression suddenly changed.Situ Nan quickly exclaimed, \u201cThis person really is high handed. Wang Lin, you have been cursed by a Nascent Soul cultivator. With this curse, once you enter a certain range of him, he will be able to instantly teleport next to you. I didn\u2019t expect him to give up his own life span to use this complicated formation curse on you.\u201dWang Lin suddenly stood up. His face was dark as he asked, \u201cIs there any way to break it?\u201dSitu Nan pondered a little and proudly laughed, \u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to be too worried. This type of curse doesn\u2019t have any offensive capabilities. It only allows him to locate you to teleport to you. Although this person\u2019s curse is good, I have spent a lot of time studying curses like this, ones that use formations and the fluctuations of spiritual energy in the world to apply the curse. I can\u2019t cast any because I have lost my body, but I can still help you break them.\u201cWith my help, cover your aura. As long as you aren\u2019t too close to him, he won\u2019t be able to find you, so relax. Hehe, Wang Lin, this is also another resource. I know of this ancient technique that can be used to make the curse to affect the caster. It requires you to be at the Core Formation stage, then, with some help of pills, you will be able to steal half of his cultivation. Ah, your luck is pretty good, kid.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 \u2013 Forest RuinsWang Lin pondered a little. He pointed at Teng Li\u2019s spirit and began to absorb it. Teng Li\u2019s spirit started to swell up and churn.Then, the blood ball quickly shot up and melted into the spirit. Gradually, the spirit began to shrink and the ball of meat and bone also melted into the spirit fog.The spirit had changed greatly. It was now a narrow ring that was floating in the air, emitting a gentle light.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He knew that he was already at the last step. He became even more focused as he placed the soul into the ring.After a long time, the ring suddenly emitted a bright light. Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he quickly bit the tip of his tongue and spat out blood. The moment the blood touched the ring, there was a sizzling sound and all of the blood instantly disappeared.After the ring fused with the blood, it started to tremble. The ring started to emit a powerful pressure and all of the living creatures within a kilometer of Wang Lin felt the change.Several powerful auras appeared and quickly charged toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye. He waved his hand and the ring quickly fused into his chest. A powerful surge of spiritual power suddenly flowed through his body, causing his face to become red.Wang Lin took a deep breath. His body moved and like an arrow as he quickly disappeared into the forest.Not long after he left, a giant python suddenly reared its head. After smelling the area, it revealed a confused expression. After shaking it\u2019s head, it turned around and left.After that, a ten foot tall ape arrived as fast as lightning. It charged into the hole in the tree and searched for a while, then left feeling frustrated.A few more powerful beasts came to check, but they all left in confusion.Wang Lin ran through the jungle with his body filled to the brim with spiritual energy. In addition, as he ran, a foul smelling black liquid came out of every pore in his body.Wang Lin felt like his body was being torn apart, so he frowned and stopped. After walking in a circle, his eyes flashed and he activated the attraction technique with the large amount of spiritual energy in his body.The dirt on the ground moved to the side as if there were two giant hands pushing it. Soon, a bottomless pit appeared in the ground.Without a word, Wang Lin jumped into the hole. Then, the dirt was moved back into the hole and everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.Sitting cross legged underground, Wang Lin focused his attention to organize the spiritual energy in his body. His body was constantly changing to Foundation EstablishmentWith the silence of being underground and no one bothering him, Wang Lin started his 3rd closed door training.Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, two years had passed.The ground above where Wang Lin was doing his closed door training was now covered in layers of decomposing leaves with poisonous insects crawling within them.On this day, the ground suddenly shook and countless poisonous insects scrambled out of the leaves. The dead leaves were pushed apart, followed by a layer of dirt from the ground as a dark figure emerged from the hole.The moment the figure appeared, all of the insects let out fearful screams as they quickly backed away.\u201cThis foundation stealing technique sure is mysterious. I\u2019ve finally reached Foundation Establishment.\u201d This dark figure was Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s gaze was like electricity and his whole body was filled with powerful spiritual energy. He opened his mouth and spat out a green light that turned into the green flying sword.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He raised his hand and the sword sheath flew out as he muttered, \u201cAfter two years of refining the sword sheath, it\u2019s almost completely mine. When used with the flying sword, its effect must be very powerful.\u201dAfter putting away the sword and sheath, he pondered for a while. Then, he touched the bead on his chest and thought, \u201cSitu Nan used up too much Nascent Soul Essence two years ago when he helped me escape from Teng Li. He also casted a spell that prevented Teng Huayuan from finding me. He has already been sleeping for more than a year and I\u2019m not sure when he will wake up. Good thing I have already memorized the Underworld Ascension Method. Now I just have to find a place with a lot of Yin energy to practice it.\u201dAfter making up his mind, Wang Lin took a deep breath and spread out his divine sense. He suddenly moved north until he arrived at a river and washed away all of the black dirt on his body. After finally washing all the dirt off, he felt very refreshed.Sitting on a rock near the river, he recalled his previous near death experience and felt a lot of regret. He didn\u2019t know whether Zhang Hu was still alive or not. He prayed that Zhang Hu managed to survive.Letting out a sigh, Wang Lin put away those thoughts as he began to ponder. After a long time, Wang Lin formed a seal with his right hand and shot out a ray white of light. The moment the white light appeared, its color started to change. It changed from white to grey and its color gradually darkened as it quickly flew towards the west.Wang Lin was stunned. This technique was something Situ Nan had taught him. It was used to find a place with very strong Yin energy. The darker the color of the light, the closer he was to a place with extreme Yin energy. When the light was black, it meant he had found the place.Without a word, Wang Lin quickly chased after the light that had already turned grey. The light turned darker and darker. When the it turned black, it suddenly collapsed and disappeared.Suddenly, Wang Lin stopped. He stared dumbfounded at the distance. He was so shocked that he was unable to say a word.Before him him was an endless ruin. There were collapsed buildings and trees as far as the eye could see.The ruins were covered with overgrown vegetation with small animals running through them, occasionally letting out screeches.There were cracks in the ground that looked like they were devouring the life on the surface.The large amounts of metal wreckage mixed with the growing green vegetation gave off a sense of ruin. The depressing atmosphere would make anyone\u2019s heart shudder.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He was completely stunned as he stared at the ruins.Just at that moment, from within one of the towers in the ruins, a pillar of white light shot out.Wang Lin was startled. His expression changed as he turned his head toward the nearby jungle. He saw a small beast covered in blood crawling towards where the pillar of white light landed. There was a wound deep enough to see the bone on its right leg. As it walked, it left behind a trail of blood.After a long time it finally arrived under the pillar of white light and let out scream of joy. In only a few seconds, the wound on his leg was mended and the small beast was fully healed.It happily shook its body before leaving the pillar and disappearing into the distance.Currently, the light pillar was still going. Wang Lin stared at it with a dumbfounded expression.Just at that moment, the pillar dissolved into countless silver specks. Wang Lin stared at that location and kept observing. Half an hour later, the light pillar appeared againThis cycle continued several times. After watching it for a whole day, Wang Lin was finally able to gain some insight.According to Wang Lin\u2019s judgement, this light pillar had something to do with sunlight. It seemed that although this place was in ruins, there were still some functioning treasures. After absorbing enough light, it will active its ability.And it seemed that a lot of wild beasts knew of the healing effect of the light pillar. Within that day, Wang Lin saw no less than 20 wounded wild beasts making their way to the pillar.Seeing that it was getting dark, Wang Lin calculated that the last pillar was about to appear. Without any hesitation, he charged forward and stuck his hand into the light pillar. He felt a very warm air flowing through the light. This was not the feeling of spiritual power, but something Wang Lin had never felt before.While slowly feeling the air current, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He cut his arm and put it inside the light pillar. In the blink of an eye, the wound was healed.Wang Lin pondered for a while. Without a word, he moved within the ruin and arrived before a large tower.This was the ruin of a giant cylindrical tower. Looking from the outside, it was clear that part of the tower had fallen over. However, even with just the ruin, it was clear how glorious it once was. Two giant statues holding swords stood and on top of them was a tower about 30 meters high.Wang Lin stared at the ruin. His mind couldn\u2019t help but imagine the moment that this once glorious tower snapped in half and part of it fell down on the two statues.The light pillar came from a stone bead that was about 2 meters in diameter at the top of the tower.While standing next to the stone bead, Wang Lin began to hesitate. The stone bead was too large and couldn\u2019t easily be moved. He also wasn\u2019t sure how the stone bead healed. He was afraid that if he removed it, it would stop it from working.After thinking about it again, he didn\u2019t carelessly act, but started to observe the area instead. Gradually, Wang Lin\u2019s expression became strange. After checking the area, he found that something was off.In some of the well preserved ruins, there were porcelain wares that were still in tact. Some of them even had a black substance in them.The sky was getting even darker now. Wang Lin quickly left the ruin. When the sky was completely dark, Wang Lin arrived back at the jungle. He stared back at the ruins with shining eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 \u2013 The Abyssal Cold CoreWang Lin suddenly had a wild guess. One day, while a family was having dinner, disaster struck. Without the people having any time to respond, the entire city was laid to waste.At this point, slivers of cold energy came from the ruins. This energy became denser and denser, until it felt like it had taken a solid form.\u201cLooking at the size of these ruins, I\u2019m afraid the population of this city was at least 10 million. The graveyard of 10 million people should be one of the best places to cultivate the Underworld Ascension Method.\u201dSitu Nan explained in great detail about the places with extreme Yin during Wang Lin\u2019s closed door training. There were four types of extreme Yin places. They were heavenly Yin, earth Yin, mystery Yin, and underworld Yin.Underworld Yin was the simplest to find. The more death there was in a place, the more death Yin there was.Mystery Yin was a bit hard. It only appeared in extremely cold places.Earth Yin was even harder and completely relied on luck to find. After all, earth Yin was the Yin emitted from the abyss within the earth.As for heaven Yin, it was basically impossible to find. In order to find heaven Yin, a place needs to have underworld Yin, mystery Yin, and earth Yin at the same time. If those three come together, they will change into heaven Yin.The higher quality the Yin, the more benefits it brings to the cultivator.Wang Lin immediately formed a seal with his right hand and he began to chant. Suddenly, specks of red light gathered before him until they formed a red ball of light.This was a technique especially made to test the quality of the Yin. Based on the color of the light, one could determine what type of Yin there was. The ball could become purple, black, silver, or red, matching with heaven, earth, mystery, and underworld Yin respectively.Situ Nan had also explained that even among the same type of extreme Yin, there were four different qualities which were ordinary, good, dense, and extreme Yin.Each level was divided into 10 ranks as well.In general, achieving ordinary rank 3 was enough to cultivate the Underworld Ascension Method. Having ordinary rank 8 was enough to speed up the cultivation.After the red ball of light appeared, it became brighter and brighter. Finally, it shone 5 times.Wang Lin touched his chin. Shining 5 times meant that this place had ordinary rank 5 underworld Yin.After pondering for while, he walked toward the center of the ruins without a word. The surrounding Yin energy became even denser as he walked closer to the center. The Yin energy was so dense, it made him feel like he was walking under water. Just a few hundred steps and he already felt like he couldn\u2019t breath.The ball of light became brighter and bright as it followed Wang Lin. This area was ordinary rank 8.Wang Lin didn\u2019t stop and continued for a few hundred more meters, until he arrived before the ruin of the giant stone bead. He could no longer continue forward. Slivers of Yin energy entered his body. His blood vessels began to feel painful and he was starting to lose control of his spiritual energy.At this point, the red ball split into two with a bang. Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He knew that this meant that this place had reached good quality rank 1.According to the information Wang Lin had gathered while scouting the ruins during the day, he knew that he was probably not even one 10,000th of the way in.And the deeper he went, the stronger the Yin energy became.\u201cThis is absolutely the best place to cultivate!\u201d Wang Lin slowly backed up until he was at the ordinary rank 5 location.This was the location Wang Lin had decided was the most suitable place for his current body. The density of the Yin energy for the Underworld Ascension Method must be increased gradually. This was a point Situ Nan kept stressing before he went to sleep.Wang Lin pondered a little. He sat down cross legged, closed his eyes, and began to cultivate. In his mind, Situ Nan\u2019s instructions for the Underworld Ascension Method echoed.This Underworld Ascension Method can be divided into 9 layers. Every three layers, one can form a cold core. Once all 9 levels are complete and the three cores fuse, there is a certain chance to instantly break into the Core Formation stage.This was the biggest reason Wang Lin became determined to practice the Underworld Ascension Method. Situ Nan also picked this because it was most suitable for Wang Lin and would increase his cultivation level quickest.Of course there are faster methods, like core stealing, but with Wang Lin\u2019s current cultivation level, to try and capture a Core Formation cultivator was no different than committing suicide.The cold core from the Underworld Ascension Method relies on meridian awakening. Meridian awakening is a process that anyone who practices the Underworld Ascension Method has to go through. There are three key meridian awakenings in the Underworld Ascension Method. They are the dantian, Qi Sea, and ancestral meridian.The moment one of those three meridians awaken, a cold core is formed. The moment a cold core is formed, the spiritual energy in one\u2019s body will become cold.As for the success rate of the meridian awakening, it is heavily related to the quality of the Yin.Time quickly passed. When he opened his eyes again, light was appearing and the Yin energy was quickly dispersing. The moment the sun appeared, all of the Yin energy disappeared.Wang Lin stood up. Since he decided to cultivate here, he should find a place to stay. He looked around and locked his sights on a collapsed house nearby.With the wave of his right hand, all of the debris and rubble flew to the side, clearing out a small area.After finishing everything, Wang Lin sat down in the middle of the cleared area. He took out a book and started to carefully read it.This was the book about formations he got at Teng Family City for a mid quality spirit stone two years ago.Before, he only flipped through the book and found that there was very detailed information about setting up and controlling formations inside.After memorizing all of the information in the book, Wang Lin began to ponder. His hand constantly moved as he unconsciously drew something in the air.The day quickly passed and it was now dusk. Wang Lin sighed and opened his eyes. He muttered, \u201cFormations are really deep and complex. Even though the formations in this book are only some simple ones, it still took me an entire day to get some understanding. The illusion formations in the book are especially complex. It relies a lot on predication, and the farther you predict, the harder it gets.\u201dFeeling helpless, he gave up on trying to figure out how they worked and just tried them out. He activated the attraction technique and moved rocks to a place outside the room.Following the instructions carefully, Wang Lin managed to make a simple formation called the Minor Confusion Formation.This formation was too rough and simple. It didn\u2019t even have the minimum amount of formation flags. Wang Lin bitterly smiled as he looked at the rocks, then at the book. He made some adjustments and the formation finally looked like the one in the book.Wang Lin took a deep breath. His hand formed the instructed seals. Then, a mist suddenly appeared and covered the surrounding area.Wang Lin stared at the mist and let out a bitter smile. This formation might trick some mortals, but it won\u2019t do anything against cultivators, so it won\u2019t protect him while he cultivates.After pondering for a while, Wang Lin muttered, \u201cIf one isn\u2019t enough, then I\u2019ll lay down two. If anything, I can just lay down all of the formations in the book. It should more or less have some effect.\u201dWith that, Wang Lin used his attraction technique and moved the rocks in the area. After playing with a few more formations, night came again.Wang Lin sat cross legged on the ground. The moment the Yin energy appeared, he took a deep breath, put his hands on his knees, and began cultivating. His breathing method was one long, five short. One long means he takes a very long breath in and five short means that when he breaths out, the time is only \u2155 of the time he used to breath in. This is the fastest way to absorb Yin energy.Strictly speaking, this was the first time he had absorbed outside energy to cultivate. In the last two years, he had always been using spiritual liquid inside the heaven defying bead, so it had all been internal absorption.This Yin energy was basically the same as spiritual energy. Wang Lin had cultivated for many years, so he was very used to this, but he immediately noticed a difference. When he absorbed spiritual energy, there was always a layer blocking that spiritual energy from entering his body. Even when it did enter, a large amount would disappear before he could absorb it.However, this was not the same. That thin layer was no longer there and the Yin energy entered his body at an overwhelming rate. Also, his body felt different from before. Large portions of the Yin energy that entered his body was absorbed, unlike before.Wang Lin pondered about this for a while and he came up with three possible answers. One was that the Yin energy was different from spiritual energy and was more suited for him to cultivate. Two: Foundation Establishment cultivators absorbed spiritual energy faster than Qi Condensation cultivators. Three: after absorbing part of Teng Li\u2019s spirit root, his own talent had increased a lot.As for which answer was correct, Wang Lin didn\u2019t pursue it any longer and instead focused his mind on cultivation.At the start, Wang Lin felt very uncomfortable due to the cold nature of the Yin energy. When he absorbed the Yin energy, it would immediately enter his body and go into his organs. The cold being emitted from inside his body made him shiver. This was the complete opposite of what it felt like to absorb spiritual energy. One gave you a very warm and comfortable feeling while the other made you feel like you were being frozen.As Wang Lin absorbed more and more Yin energy, his hands and feet became cold. Then, his blood started to become thicker and even his heartbeat slowed down.Frost started to appear on his eyebrows, hair, and all of the pores in his body. A surge of cold came from inside his body and perfectly fused with the surroundings.Time flew by. When the sun rose and the Yin energy dispersed, Wang Lin\u2019s eyelids trembled as he opened his eyes. He exhaled a breath of white gas. After a night of cultivation, a small mass of Yin energy appeared in his dantian. This small mass slowly rotated, releasing Yin energy.The spiritual energy in his body didn\u2019t reject this mass of Yin energy. They ignored each other and didn\u2019t interact.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 \u2013 The Strange Blue Skinned PersonTouching his stomach, Wang Lin muttered, \u201cI finally understand why this is called the Underworld Ascension Method.\u201dThe Underworld Ascension Method makes one enter a near death state when cultivating. One uses this state of being close to entering the underworld to make it easier for the body to absorb Yin energy. However, if a mistake is made, one might really enter the underworld.In truth, even in a rank 6 country, not many people have the courage to cultivate the Underworld Ascension method. Situ Nan was one of the few that had successfully cultivated this method. Even among all the demon cultivators in the rank 6 countries, this was still considered an strange method.The reason it\u2019s considered a strange technique is because the change is too great. For some, the change is great for the cultivator, while for others, the change means death.Wang Lin started living in the ruins. Every night, he would cultivate and absorb the Yin energy. A month had passed.During this month, besides cultivating the Underworld Ascension Method, Wang Lin also noticed that the heaven defying bead could produce spirit liquid here. However, the power contained in the spirit liquid wasn\u2019t spiritual power, but Yin power.As a result, Wang Lin gained a bit more understanding of the bead.Wang Lin started to collect Yin spirit liquid. Midnight was when the most Yin spirit liquid appeared.After taking the Yin spirit liquid, he noticed that although it contained a lot of Yin energy, compared to the spiritual energy in normal spirit liquid, it was not on the same level.If comparing the effectiveness of the Yin spirit liquid to normal spirit liquid, then it was only on the level of soaking the bead in snow water. It was far from the pure spirit liquid.Wang Lin knew that plainly speaking, the Underworld Ascension Method was all about how much Yin energy one could absorb. The more one absorbed, the more powerful they\u2019d become. As a result, Wang Lin entered the heaven defying bead\u2019s space to cultivate with the Yin spirit liquid during the day.With the passage of time, Wang Lin began to absorb more and more Yin energy. Every time he cultivated, he would slowly blend into the surrounding Yin energy. Each time, his heartbeat would slow down until it became so faint, it looked as if his heart stopped.There were even a couple of times when his heart beat almost stopped, but he manage to hold out.One morning, Wang Lin woke from his trance. He took a deep breath and said, \u201cI have absorbed a lot of Yin energy. I should be able to make the first breakthrough now.\u201dSuddenly, he stared at the surrounding fog formation and revealed a confused look. He waved his sleeves and a path opened within the fog.Wang Lin walked out of the formation and saw several deep marks that went deep into the ruins. He remembered that there were some injured wild beasts that couldn\u2019t hold out while waiting for the light pillar.But now, the wild beasts\u2019 corpses were gone. They seemed to have been dragged into the depths of the ruins.\u201cCould there still be people inside the ruins?\u201d A cold thought entered Wang Lin\u2019s mind. When this person came to drag the corpses away, how come he didn\u2019t notice them?Wang Lin\u2019s eyes became more serious. He quickly checked around his room and found that there were no signs of attack on his formations.He stroked his chin. Then, his body shot out like lightning into the jungle and returned with two beast carcasses. After tossing them to the side, he returned to his formation and shot out a white light. The fog of the formation became even thicker and a rumbling sound could be heard in the fog.Having done all of this, Wang Lin still felt uneasily, as if there was a giant shadow looming over him. After a long time, he calmed down and spread out his divine sense. He drank some Yin spirit liquid and started to cultivate while vigilantly watching his surroundings.Night came. On this night, Wang Lin didn\u2019t absorb didn\u2019t absorb any Yin energy, but focused his attention on his surroundings. He spread his divine sense to its maximum range. He could feel even a blade of grass moving hundreds of meters away.He paid extra attention to the two carcasses. He wanted to see what kind of creature lived in the ruins and would come here at night.Time slowly passed. Midnight was approaching and the Yin energy was becoming extremely dense. Wang Lin didn\u2019t cultivate, but carefully watched his surroundings.In the area of his divine sense, it was completely silent. The two carcasses started to accumulate frost thanks to the Yin energy that entered them. Even the jungle outside the ruins was silent to a frightening degree.This was not the first time Wang Lin spread out his divine sense at night. Before, even this late at night, there would be a few cries from beasts. This was the first time it was this silent.Suddenly, Wang Lin\u2019s expression changed as the Yin energy in the ruin started to stir.His eyes focused on the Yin energy as he sneered and watched with cold eyes.He saw that following the disturbance of Yin energy in the ruin, a figure quickly appeared. The figure\u2019s speed was too quick. Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense only saw a shadow before the two carcasses disappeared.Wang Lin was startled. When the figure first appeared, he saw what it looked like. It was a humanoid creature with blue skin.The person\u2019s skin was covered in strange symbols. In addition, there were nine half-inch yellow papers placed on various parts of the person\u2019s body. This strange person made Wang Lin very surprised.The strange person appeared again. He stood outside Wang Lin\u2019s formation with a thinking expression.The strange person took a few steps back. He stared at the fog with doubt in his eyes. After hesitating for a bit, he circled the fog once.Wang Lin focused his attention on observing the strange person and didn\u2019t attack. He wanted to see what this strange person could do.After the strange person circled the fog formation once, he revealed a curious look. Then, it charged into the formation.The moment he entered the formation, killing intent filled Wang Lin\u2019s eyes. His right hand formed a seal and a white light shot into the formation. The fog quickly moved as if it was boiling.Shortly after, sounds of rocks breaking could be heard as the formations were broken one by one. The density of the fog also decreased.Wang Lin opened his mouth and spat out a green light. The moment the green light appeared, it shot out like lightning. With a boom, the green light hit the strange person, causing him to let out an angry roar. A powerful force spread out, blowing all of the stones into the air and turning them to dustAs the fog quickly dissipated, the strange person spotted Wang Lin. His eyes were bloodshot as he walked toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s expression remained the same. He moved his right hand in the air and the green sword appeared behind the strange person. The sword pierced through the strange person\u2019s heart and blue blood burst out of his chest.The moment the blood appeared, it turned into ice crystals and fell to the ground.The strange person let out a painful groan as it quickly took a few steps back, revealing a horrified expression.Wang Lin\u2019s heart sank. The strange person received an attack from the flying sword and was still able to move afterwards. A cold light flashed across his eyes as he slapped his bag of holding and an ancient sword scabbard appeared in his hand.The green flying sword quickly entered the sword scabbard about \u2155 of the way. The green sword quickly turned from green to blue, then blue to black. The sword left the scabbard and quickly slashed toward the strange person.The strange person saw the black sword and revealed a horrified expression. Just as he was about to back away, the black sword rushed forward and stabbed his chest. A series of explosions occurred inside the strange person\u2019s body, causing him to fly backwards like a kite with a broken string.After the flying sword was stained with the strange person\u2019s blood, it became stuck inside his body. No matter how hard Wang Lin willed it to move, it wouldn\u2019t budge. It even lost its ability to teleport.Shocked, Wang Lin\u2019s killing intent became even stronger. He saw earlier that just as the flying sword pierced into the strange person, the strange symbols on his body gleamed. He clearly used some sort of technique to block that blow.Without a word, he slapped his bag of holding and took out the yellow talisman he got from Zhang Hu. Suddenly, Wang Lin\u2019s pupils shrank. He saw that strange person\u2019s body turn in an unimaginable angle in mid air and landed on the ground. There was a large wound on his chest that splurted out large amounts of blue blood.The symbols on his body flickered in a chaotic manner. As the symbols gleamed, his wound was rapidly recovering.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye. He spat out a mouthful of spiritual power into the yellow talisman. The yellow talisman bursted into hot, black flames and hit the wounded area of the strange person.The strange person let out a painful scream as his body was pierced through again.\u201cStill not dead!\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s heart sank. Even after receiving this much damage, he was still alive. What gave Wang Lin a bit of peace of mind was after the talisman\u2019s attack landed, the sword was able to break free and return to his side.The strange person\u2019s eyes revealed a struggling expression. Suddenly, he ripped off one of the nine yellow papers. The moment that yellow paper was ripped, green gas spewed from all over his body and surrounded him completely.Wang Lin\u2019s face became gloomy. Without hesitation, he put the sword into the scabbard and pushed down \u2157 of the way. The sword quickly turned from black to red.\u2157 of the way was the limit of how far Wang Lin could push the sword into the scabbard. With his early stage Foundation Establishment cultivation and the sword after it had been \u2157 of the way into the sword scabbard, he could put up a fight against mid stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.Just at that moment, the green gas surrounding the strange person was quickly absorbed by his body. When he appeared again before Wang Lin, his body was perfectly fine, without a hint of the wound.He stared at Wang Lin with hate in his eyes. However, he obviously felt a lot of dread toward Wang Lin, mostly because of that flying sword.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Wang Lin didn\u2019t immediately attack. The other person had nine talismans. Using one of them allowed the person to recover completely from a near-death state. This battle would take a very long time for Wang Lin to win.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 \u2013 Bluffing Magic TreasureWang Lin\u2019s eyes flashed cold as he said, \u201cI\u2019m here to cultivate, so unless it\u2019s really needed, I don\u2019t want to act. If you back off and never disturb me again, I will let you go and forget about this matter.\u201dThe strange man let out a puzzled expression and said some strange words. It was clear that he didn\u2019t understand Wang Lin and Wang Lin couldn\u2019t understand him.Wang Lin slightly narrowed his eyes and slowly moved to a broken wall. The strange man quickly became alert when he saw Wang Lin move.Wang Lin waved his right hand quickly as he drew on the broken wall. The strange man was dumbfounded. As he stared at Wang Lin\u2019s finger, he revealed a look of understanding.Wang Lin\u2019s finger quickly drew a picture of the ruin and then, with a slash of his finger, he drew a line that split the ruin in half.Then, Wang Lin pointed at the strange man and pointed to the right half of the picture, then pointed at himself followed by the left side of the picture. After doing all that, Wang Lin\u2019s finger slowly moved left and right leaving a mark on the wall as he stared at the strange man. His eyes were filled with killing intent, his intention obvious.\u201cIf you come to my side again, I\u2019ll waste my spiritual power to kill you!\u201dThe strange man was surprised. He hesitated for a while as he rubbed his chest with a look of fear in his eyes. He looked at the flying sword with dread in his eyes and let out a shout of strange words.Wang Lin frowned. After the strange person saw that Wang Lin didn\u2019t understand him, he quickly became frantic and started waving his hand. He then suddenly hit his head and moved next to a wall and punched it. The moment he punched the wall, a symbol on his body lit up and the wall crumbledThe strange person picked up some pieces of the broken wall. He stared at them with reminiscence in his eyes. He placed the rocks on the ground, then stared at Wang Lin and shouted a few words.Wang Lin\u2019s face relaxed a bit. He grabbed in the air and suddenly, all of the stones next to the strange person moved to the side in a specific order. Then, his right hand formed a seal and shot out a light. Soon, the fog formed around the range of the stone.Wang Lin started at the strange person and calmly asked, \u201cIs this restriction that you\u2019re talking about?\u201dThe strange person quickly revealed an excited expression as he waved his hand and beat his chest. Suddenly, a symbol on his body lit up and he opened his arms. The ground suddenly shook and the piece of land the rock formation was on floated into the air, leaving behind a huge hole in the ground.The small confusion formation floated in the air like a small mountain above the the strange person\u2019s head. He nodded toward Wang Lin, then quickly left. After moving a bit away, he paused and turned to face Wang Lin. He shouted some words at Wang Lin and made a gesture before disappearing into the distance.Wang Lin stared at the strange person\u2019s figure. It was not that he didn\u2019t think about killing the strange man, but the yellow talisman on him was too powerful. Unless it was absolutely necessary, he didn\u2019t want to get into a life and death fight with the strange man.As he was thinking this, his expression suddenly changed. The flying sword flew to his side as his eyes became filled with killing intent. The strange person came back!Wang Lin stared at the figure before him and said, with a cold voice, \u201cYou\u2019re courting death\u201dThe strange man quickly stopped. He was holding a round object in his hand. He waved his hand and tried to explain. After seeing that Wang Lin\u2019s eyes were still cold, he threw the round object toward Wang Lin.Wang Lin slowly took a few steps. The strange man didn\u2019t use a lot of strength, so the round object rolled a bit and stopped before Wang Lin.After he threw the object, the strange man let out a smile toward Wang Lin and left.At this point, the day was still bright, so Wang Lin cautiously looked at the direction of the figure. After a long time, he withdrew his gaze. He walked up to the round object and looked down.This was a bead that was only 1/10th the size of a fist. It was covered in dust and even had some cracks on it. After looking at the bead for a while, he let out a surprised expression. He took a stone from the ground and lightly hit the bead. The bead rolled backward for a bit.Slivers of weak spiritual power leaked from the bead.\u201cThis is a treasure?\u201d He was stunned. He grabbed the air with his right hand and the bead floated into the air. After observing it for a while, he grabbed it with his right hand without any hesitation. He scanned it with his divine sense and fed it some spiritual power.Suddenly, white smoke came out of the bead. The smoke floated above and formed the shape of an old man. The old man had the hair of a crane, the skin of a chicken, the beak of an eagle, and the head of a harrier. The old man emitted a dangerous aura. He casually looked at Wang Lin and revealed a sarcastic smile. He said, \u201cDo you dare to fight with this old man?\u201dWang Lin was stunned and took a few steps back. After carefully looking, he noticed that the person was only at the 15th layer of Qi Condensation. He rubbed his nose. His eyes lit up and he quickly sent more spiritual power into the stone bead.With the input of spiritual energy, the old man\u2019s spiritual power quickly rose until it reached mid stage Foundation Establishment. The old man\u2019s hair moved without wind and his body released a huge fighting aura. The old man floated into the air and said, \u201cDo you dare to fight with this old man?\u201dWang Lin was completely astonished. He had no idea what use this bead had and decided to pour more spiritual power into it.The old man\u2019s eyes shined brightly and his aura quickly increased. His hand moved, causing thunderous roars as his cultivation raised to the point where Wang Lin couldn\u2019t even tell what cultivation level the old man was at. The old man\u2019s cultivation had already reached a degree that would cause fear with just a glance. The old man let out a breath and released the aura of a peerless expert. He held his hand behind his back and said, \u201cThose below the Core Formation stage don\u2019t have the right to fight me. Scram!\u201dWang Lin withdrew his spiritual power and the old man quickly disappeared and turned back into the white smoke. The smoke returned to the bead and with a crackling sound, another crack appeared on the bead.Wang Lin stared at the stone bead and was unable to utter a word. He was completely convinced of the effect of the stone bead. The stone bead was an illusionary magical treasure and the illusion it created was almost no different from reality. The old man, regardless of the way he spoke, the aura of a master that he emitted was perfect, just like that last line, \u201cThose below Core Formation stage don\u2019t have the right to fight me. Scram!\u201dThe aura and expression had reached its peak. Wang Lin believed that even if it was himself, he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that it was a fake. After all from, the view of most people, the old man had the aura of an old master.And with the increase in his own cultivation, he could put more spiritual power into the bead and the power of the old man would increase. This was really the best method to scare people.Wang Lin put away the treasure and muttered to himself, \u201cThis strange blue person is really interesting. He must have felt bad after breaking the little confusion formation, so he gave me this treasure.\u201dFrom this little exchange, he immediately realized that the strange person couldn\u2019t use magic treasures and that within the ruin, there must be more magic treasures.Now this ruined city became a treasure trove in Wang Lin\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis place has a mysterious light that heals wounds, an illusionary magic treasure, and a strange blue person. What other secrets does this place have?\u201d Wang Lin rubbed his chin. Currently, the day was still bright, so he put down the formations again. He sat down in the middle and drank some Yin spirit liquid, then started to cultivate.Two month flew by.On this day, Wang Lin sat cross legged in the room. In the two months of cultivating the extreme Yin energy, he had gathered enough energy to attempt the first breakthrough.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He had already finished studying the Underworld Ascension method and knew very well how the three big breakthroughs will be.The three key points of breaking through were the dantain in his stomach, the Qi sea in his chest, and the progenitor meridian.These three locations needed to be broken through three times each to form the cold cores. In simpler terms, for the first level, the dantain must be opened and when it\u2019s time to reach level 2, the opening at the dantain must be crushed and opened again.The principle of the Underworld Method was to break first, then recover to gain more strength.Wang Lin pondered for a moment, then moved the Yin energy in his dantain in order to start his first breakthrough.Under his control, the Yin energy spun faster and faster, causing a sharp pain in his stomach. Wang Lin was very familiar with the technique, so he knew that the stronger the pain, the closer the moment of the breakthrough.This type of pain was not something a normal person could withstand. The feeling was as if someone pierced his stomach with a sword and churned it around. In just a few breaths, Wang Lin was covered in cold sweat.The Yin energy quickly turned into a swirl under the spin as it grew wider. Looking from the outside, Wang Lin\u2019s stomach turned green and frost started to gather all over his body.Wang Lin gritted his teeth as the pain got even worse. Suddenly, the cold energy swept through his body.At this point, with the spin of the Yin energy, a black hole appeared. The moment it appeared, all of the Yin energy sank into it like rocks in water.Shortly after, all of the Spiritual energy also started being devoured as it left his body and entered the black hole.A strange change happened inside the black hole. The spiritual power that always ignored the Yin energy while in Wang Lin\u2019s body started to fight with the Yin energy. The two energies fiercely clashed against each other for control.Gradually, the Yin energy and spiritual power started to devour and mix with each other and formed a new type of spiritual power that slowly spun inside the black hole.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 \u2013 The First IndicationThe first layer of the Underworld Ascension Method was complete.The meridian in his dantian was ready to be opened.Wang Lin calmed himself and transferred \u2153 of the Yin energy outside of his dantian toward his dantian.The Yin energy didn\u2019t enter his dantian, but surrounded it and started to charge into the black hole.Although with every charge there was some lost, the Yin energy became more and more fierce as it kept charging in his dantian as if it was waging war.After a long time, the black hole started to crack, and at that moment, Wang Lin quickly transferred another \u2153 of the Yin energy from his body. In one move, he opened the meridian in his dantian.For an instant, Wang Lin felt extreme pain. The moment the black hole broke, the mysterious power started to fill his body. Wang Lin didn\u2019t even blink. He started to charge the next meridian.This time, it took a lot longer than before, and after seeing that there might not be enough Yin energy, Wang Lin added the remaining \u2153 of the Yin energy into the Yin energy stream. The Yin energy steam formed a swirl that was several times larger than the previous one.The swirl spun faster and faster, meaning the time for the breakthrough was close. Night slowly came.Wang Lin was still in the late stage of the breakthrough. The swirl was still spinning, and because it was spinning so fast, it looked like a nebula. Although it looked very slow from the outside, in reality, it was spinning too fast for the eye to see.All the way until midnight, when the Yin energy was most dense, Wang Lin\u2019s body was still like a black hole. There was a swirl of Yin energy 20 feet wide spinning around him, quickly being absorbed.Within 10 feet of Wang Lin, it was like a meat grinder for Yin energy. All of the Yin energy was being devoured at an insane speed.The massive amount of Yin energy was absorbed by Wang Lin and instantly added to the swirl in his body. The swirl became larger and larger, until it was almost out of Wang Lin\u2019s control and still growing unrestrained. He was immediately stunned and wanted to stop, but found that he could no longer control the swirl as he watched it grow larger and larger. Wang Lin started to become nervous as there was no record of this in the records of the Underworld Ascension Method.Wang Lin didn\u2019t know that the reason the Underworld Ascension Method was called a demonic technique was because the variations were too great. Some were very beneficial while others would kill the user.And Situ Nan was still asleep, so Wang Lin had to resolve this himself.As the swirl grew, the suction force grew as well, and the 10 foot radius quickly increased. This was a very vicious cycle. The wider the range, the more Yin energy it will absorb. The more Yin energy meant the faster the swirl will grow, meaning more Yin energy will be absorbed.20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet, 70 feet, 100 feet\u2026All of the Yin energy within a 100 foot radius started to move violently as it rushed toward Wang Lin. This large movement of Yin energy affected all of the Yin energy within 1000 feet, causing it to move as if there was a giant hand guiding it.Wang Lin had already completely lost control of the swirl and after an unknown amount of time, his dantian broke through with a bang.This was the second time his dantian broke through, and just like the first time, it formed a black hole in his dantian. The change in his body immediately caused the Yin energy absorbed to move as well.If Wang Lin was endlessly absorbing Yin energy from the surroundings before, that suction was now devouring it.In a moment, all of the Yin energy within 100 feet was instantly devoured by the black hole, causing an even more widespread disturbance of Yin energy. Soon, the swirl increased from 100 feet to 150 feet, 200 feet, 300 feet, 500 feet, 700 feet, and eventually more than 1000 feet.If one looked from the sky, they would witness a very shocking scene. All of the Yin energy was violently surging around one center point.In the depths of the ruins, the strange blue person was holding the body of a beast in his hand. He bit off a chunk of meat and started to chew it when he suddenly turned to Wang Lin\u2019s direction and revealed a shocked expression. He quickly threw away his food and ran toward Wang Lin like a frightened rabbit.After walking a few steps, he paused and noticed that all of the Yin energy was rushing toward the same direction. He hesitated a bit, but continued, however, he stopped 3000 feet away from Wang Lin\u2019s location and his expression became even more shocked.As for Wang Lin, the moment he made his breakthrough, all of the changed spiritual energy quickly gathered in the black hole in his dantian and fused together.The moment all of the spiritual energy fused back together, he gained some control of the swirl in his body. However, the amount of control was very small and not nearly enough to stop the swirl of Yin energy inside him.Wang Lin clenched his teeth. He decided to quit trying to stop the absorption of Yin energy and to break through a 3rd time.Under Wang Lin\u2019s control, the large amount of Yin energy smashed into his dantian. His dantian shattered into many blue specks and within the blue specks was a dark-blue crystal. Large amounts of Yin energy surrounded and entered the dark-blue crystal. The crystal\u2019s color got darker and darker until it became green.The three breakthroughs were easily completed and a cold core appeared in Wang Lin\u2019s dantian. Many small hands extended from the cold core and reached every part of Wang Lin\u2019s body.The spiritual energy in his body quickly underwent change after the appearance of the cold core.Wang Lin was still surrounded by Yin energy and he had a feeling that if he kept absorbing the Yin energy, he would explode. This feeling was confirmed when he started to feel a sense of swelling.Wang Lin clenched his teeth again and decided that it was all or nothing. He moved the Yin energy and decided to attempt the 4th breakthrough.Situ Nan had pointed out that the 1st, 4th, and 7th layers were extremely hard because those were the first times one attempted to make a breakthrough in the dantian, Qi Sea, and ancestral meridian.One was supposed to stop after making the 3rd breakthrough in order to nurture the cold core before attempting the 4th breakthrough.But the spiritual energy in Wang Lin\u2019s body had already mixed with the vast Yin energy, and because he needed to expend it, he could only attempt the 4th breakthrough.The Qi Sea in his chest opened.The Yin swirl slowly raised upward until it reached the Qi Sea and started to spin faster again.The swirl endlessly devoured Yin energy. Wang Lin tried to break through time and time again, but he failed each time. The sky was slowly starting to light up.The Yin energy within 1000 feet slowly dissipated, until all of it disappeared.The Qi Sea in his chest still remained unopened. Wang Lin finally understood why the Underworld Ascension Method was so difficult. He had already tried to open his Qi Sea over 100 times, but he failed every time, and every time it failed, he lost some Yin energy.The large amount of Yin energy was gradually used up by all of the attempts to break through. Along with the fact that day arrived and all of the Yin energy dissipated, the remaining Yin energy was slowly absorbed by Wang Lin\u2019s cold core.Wang Lin absorbed too much Yin energy this night. All of the spiritual energy in his body underwent a change and changed to Yin spiritual energy.In terms of quantity, Wang Lin could clearly feel that his Yin spiritual energy amounted to twice as much as his spiritual energy from before, meaning that he was now at the peak of early stage Foundation Establishment.He opened his eyes and recalled what had happened last night. Although he was alarmed, he was mostly weighing the pros and cons of this type of cultivation.The unexpected occurrence during his nighttime cultivation opened up a new way of thinking for him.The advantage of this type of cultivation was self explanatory and the con was that it was too dangerous. One wrong move and he would have exploded, but thanks to this experience, he will have full control next time and that will lower the danger.Wang Lin muttered, \u201cIt seems I have to find a new shelter. Although the amount of Yin energy is great, the quality is too low to satisfy my needs to make a breakthrough.\u201d Right now, Wang Lin\u2019s chance of a breaking through was too low, but according to the records, the higher the quality of the Yin energy, the better the chance for a breakthrough.Wing Lin remembered the test he did a few months ago and remembered that the pillar around the stone bead was high quality rank one, so he made his decision.At the same time, the sky outside the forest suddenly darkened as an old man releasing a huge pressure silently appeared. He looked at the forest below him with powerful killing intent in his eyes.\u201cLi Er, grandpa Tai is here to get revenge for you!\u201dThe person who came was the Teng family ancestor, Teng Huayuan. He cursed during the entire trip here, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t find the exact location of his grandson\u2019s killer. It was as if there was some fog blocking him. He was unable to determine the exact location, but knew that the killer was in the jungle below him.As for this jungle, it was a place he didn\u2019t want to venture into unless he had no choice. With just a scan, he could tell how dangerous it was and that it contained a being that even he didn\u2019t dare to mess with.But because of Teng Li\u2019s death, he couldn\u2019t be bothered by much. He believed that as long as he was very quiet and only searched for his enemy, the powerful being wouldn\u2019t mind.After pondering for a while, he clenched his teeth and charged into the forest.Within the depths of the jungle ruins, the lid of a coffin opened without a sound. A withered hand glowing black and purple light slowly appeared from within the coffin. The hand gripped hard and suddenly, a purple ball of lightning appeared in the hand, releasing a dangerous aura.\u201cThe 100 year time is up! My master, you gave up your body to run away before, but this time, you won\u2019t be able to get away!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 \u2013 Extreme Yin Spiritual EnergyTeng Huayuan carefully walked through the jungle with his divine sense spread out. His face suddenly lit up with joy as he found Wang Lin. Just as he was about to teleport, a gust of eerie wind blew, followed by a somber voice.\u201cGet the hell out of here!\u201dTeng Huayuan\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He quickly backed up a few steps without a thought and looked around.He only saw a dark fog flying in from the distance. The dark fog was surrounded by eerie winds. A withered hand extended from the dark fog and reached toward Teng Huayuan.Teng Huayuan scanned the fog with his divine sense and became frightened. This person\u2019s cultivation level was mid stage Nascent Soul, causing him to back up again.The withered hand lightly waved. A giant hand appeared and tried to grab Teng Huayuan.Teng Huayuan wrily smiled. He turned around and ran without any hesitation, because a mid stage Nascent Soul cultivator was not something he could mess with. He knew that there was a powerful cultivator here, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be a mid stage Nascent Soul one.Teng Huayuan disappeared in the blink of an eye. The hand let out a cold snort and disappeared as well.Teng Huayuan appeared in the sky outside the forest. His expression suddenly changed as a giant hand silently appeared behind him and mercilessly grabbed toward him.Teng Huayuan secretly complained. He quickly took out a beast skin. He pointed with his hand and the beast skin wrapped around him and moved him away, barely escaping the giant hand.Despite all of this, he was still hit by the fingers of the giant hand. He coughed out blood and his face became pale, but he quickly escaped without even looking back.A black fog appeared in the air. The fog slowly shrunk until it revealed a person. The person was completely dried up and looked like a bag of bones. He looked at the direction Teng Huayuan escaped toward. However, he didn\u2019t chase, but returned to the forest.He calmly flew around back and forth in the jungle as if he was looking for something. Shortly after, he stopped above an open area. He stared at the ground without any emotion. He slammed the ground with his hand and with a bang, a large crack appeared in the ground.The moment the crack appeared, a scream came from the ground as a dark figure flew out, trying to escape. The withered man let out a cold snort and a cage surrounded the area. The dark figure hit the cage and bounced back. It no longer tried to run away, but kneeled down and started kowtowing.The withered man slowly said, \u201cAfter not seeing it for 100 years, I didn\u2019t expect master\u2019s body to turn into a zombie and even form its own soul. You are still considered someone of my generation, so I can let you live, but you must use your connection to the master to help me find him.\u201dThe zombie quickly nodded as he stared with fear in his eyes at the withered man.The withered man waved his hand and the cage disappeared. He stared at the zombie and darkly said, \u201cCome, take me to master. If you can help me find master\u2019s Nascent Soul, then once I devour it and free myself, I\u2019ll help you evolve into a demon.\u201dThe zombie was startled and revealed a joyous expression. It quickly nodded and ran off into the jungle.The man emotionlessly followed.At that moment, somewhere in the ruins where the sunshine didn\u2019t reach, the blue skinned man looked toward Wang Lin\u2019s direction with a lingering expression.As for Wang Lin, although he had absorbed a large amount of Yin energy, it was all only rank 6 or 7 good quality. With this quality, no matter much was absorbed, the change to his spiritual energy wasn\u2019t much and it was no longer good enough for him to make more breakthroughs. He turned his gaze to deeper in the ruin. His target was over there!He decided to explore a bit and find where the highest quality Yin energy was.After all, the higher the quality, the higher the success rate of a breakthrough.At midnight of this day, Wang Lin\u2019s hand formed the seal for the Yin energy detection technique as he walked through the ruins.After walking for a distance, the red light flashed rapidly and, with a pop, it split into two.The moment the red light turned into two, Wang Lin revealed a happy expression. He knew that this meant that the Yin energy had surpassed ordinary quality and had reached good quality.As he kept walking forward, the two red lights kept glowing as the rank increased.Good quality rank 2, rank 3 \u2026 until rank 5. Wang Lin stopped. Before him was a wide road with a ruined building on each side. It was clear that a long time ago, this was a very populated area.Wang Lin calculated the distance for a bit and realize that he hadn\u2019t even traveled 1/1000th of the radius of the city, so he started to move faster.The red light released by the technique was very eye catching in the night. Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense was spread out, constantly checking his surroundings.The quality of the Yin energy kept increasing. Good quality rank 6, 7, 8\u2026The sun rose and fell. On the fourth day, Wang Lin had already entered the depths of the ruins. He guessed that his current position was the center of the city. If it was not the center, it wasn\u2019t far from it.On the way here, he saw dozens of deep pits, meters wide, filled with rain water. There were also mysterious snakes that would jump out at Wang Lin with their poisonous fangs.In addition to this, the destruction in the ruins became even worse. On the path to his current location, there were no structures taller than 10 meters.Besides the overgrown grass area, there was a swamp. There were also some mysterious creatures living in the swamp. Once, Wang Lin was almost eaten by one of those creatures, making him even more alert of his surroundings.Despite going so deep into the ruins, the quality of the Yin energy still never reached Dense quality.On the night of the 5th day, he walked out of the swamp and before him was a large group of buildings. Although all of the buildings had collapsed, you could still see how populated this place must have been.The most eye catching spot was the thousand meter wide and hundred meter deep hole in the ground.This giant hole was very strange. Normally speaking, this hole should be filled with rain water, but there was no liquid inside it at all.Wang Lin took a closer look. Although it was night and there was dense Yin energy in the way, Wang Lin could still clearly see the beehive-like caves at the bottom of the giant hole.The moment Wang Lin reached the edge of the hole to inspect them, the red light in his hand suddenly reacted. The red light fused into one, then split into three, indicating that the Yin energy here had reached \u201cGood\u201d quality.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He didn\u2019t rush in, but carefully walked around the hole. When he was on the opposite side, the three lights fused back into one and became two again.He understood that the reason the Yin energy reached Good quality was this giant hole.Wang Lin rubbed his chin. After pondering for a while, he didn\u2019t immediately jump in, but sat down and decided to wait for morning.Before long, it turned into day. The moment the Yin energy dissipated, Wang Lin jumped into the giant hole. The moment he landed, the small green flying sword came out, releasing a cold aura.Wang Lin raised his head and looked into the sky. With how deep this hole was, it should\u2019ve been filled with rainwater after all these years.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes squinted and he focused his gaze on the countless beehive-like holes at the bottom of the giant hole.Although he didn\u2019t know how deep the holes were, all of the water must have drained through them. He touched the holes and found that they were damp, reaffirming his previous thoughts.After carefully checking the surroundings and finding no danger, he sat down cross legged and waited for night to come.The sun set and night came. As the Yin energy flooded in, all of the beasts ran away, not willing to spend the night here.The light before Wang Lin became brighter and brighter as it turned from one to two, then from two to three.Normal quality rank four, six, eight, ten. Good quality rank three, six, ten and broke through to Dense quality.It was still not midnight yet and the quality of the Yin energy had already reached rank 1 Dense quality.Wang Lin exposed a happy expression. He spread out his divine sense and found that the reason the Yin energy quality was higher here had something to do with the holes in the ground.He could see slivers of Yin energy coming out of the holes and mix with the surrounding Yin energy.As time passed, the red light shone even brighter and reached rank 2 Dense quality. When midnight arrived, the Yin energy had reached rank 5 Dense quality.Wang Lin no longer hesitated and quickly started to cultivate.With more and more Yin energy gathered at his chest, he found one difference. The purity of the Yin energy was more than ten times higher than before.A change in quality could cause a change in quantity. This meant that one minute of gathering Yin energy now was like more than 10 minutes of gathering Yin energy before.Soon, the Yin energy at his chest started to form a swirl and spin. As the swirl spun faster and faster, the unexpected change that occurred last time happened again.The Yin energy within 100 feet of Wang Lin fluctuated and rushed toward him.As the swirl in his chest absorbed more Yin energy, it became larger. Soon, it reached last time\u2019s size of 1000 feet in radius.The range kept increasing. 1200 feet, 1400 feet, 1500 feet\u2026Within a 10 kilometer radius, the Yin energy moved as if it were being manipulated as it rushed toward Wang Lin and was devoured.As the Yin energy that swirled in his chest grew larger and larger, he started to feel like he was losing control. Knowing his limits, he controlled the Yin energy to start attempting the first breakthrough of his Qi Sea.The Yin energy swirl was like a spinning blade repeatedly stabbing at the Qi Sea to open it. Slowly, the Qi Sea showed signs of opening.The sign grew stronger and stronger. If you compared this breakthrough to trying to destroy a stone wall, then this wall was now filled with cracks and was ready to collapse.After one hour, the Qi Sea was no longer able to withstand it and collapsed with a bang.Large amounts of human potential exploded from the Qi Sea like a volcano. It quickly mixed with the Yin energy, forming a very powerful Yin force.Currently, the spiritual energy in his dantian became restless. It quickly moved toward the newly formed Yin force and started to devour it.Whenever a sliver of Yin force was formed, Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy would devour it to strengthen itself. Gradually, as Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy devoured all of the Yin force, his spiritual energy became even stronger.A nebula-like scene appeared in Wang Lin\u2019s Qi Sea. Waves of blue spiritual energy spread out from the nebula.Wang Lin felt the very strange spiritual energy in his body. His eyes lit up as he lightly touched a strone next to him.In an instant, there was a flash of blue light and the stone was completely frozen, releasing Yin energy.Wang Lin took a deep breath and quickly kicked the frozen stone. With a series of crackling sounds, the stone broke into many pieces.Wang Lin carefully checked and quickly sucked in a breath of cold air. Upon closer inspection, he found that the internal structure of the stone was constantly changing. This was no longer rock, but more of an ice crystal structure.In other words, with one touch of his spiritual power, he didn\u2019t just freeze the stone, but completely changed its structure to ice.Wang Lin didn\u2019t know that after a session of devouring the Yin energy, his spiritual energy had undergone a great change. Even if Situ Nan was awake right now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to figure this out.In ancient cultivation times, besides the different ranks in cultivation level, there were also three ranks for spiritual energy, which were Ji, Dao, and Shi.The three realms weren\u2019t ranked in any order, but advance in parallel. Once a realm had been entered, one couldn\u2019t switch to another realm.The difficulty to enter the three realms wasn\u2019t high, but it wasn\u2019t easy either. It all depended on luck in the end.In ancient cultivation times, any knowledgeable cultivators would know not to choose the Ji Realm. While the offensive power of the Ji Realm was high, there were too many drawbacks. One of the most deadly drawbacks was that once one walked the path of Ji, one could only use Ji spiritual energy, which presented a huge issue in breaking through to the Spirit Severing stage from the Nascent Soul stage.Spirit Severing required one to integrate with the world and not walk an extreme path.However, even with those downsides, the Ji Realm also had a lot of benefits. It could be said that people of the same cultivation level couldn\u2019t defend against Ji Realm at all.Although one had no chance of reaching the Spirit Severing stage, after reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, one could become the number one of everyone below the Spirit Severing stage.More importantly, with the increase in cultivation, Ji Realm cultivators didn\u2019t even need magic treasures because their Ji Realm spiritual power was already the most powerful type of spiritual energy.As for the Dao Realm, it was the dream of all cultivators. Once your spiritual energy entered the Dao Realm, then entering the Spirit Severing stage was very easy.Because of this, the Dao Realm was the most sought after Realm in the ancient cultivation world.As for the Shi Realm, if Ji Realm was death, then Shi Realm was life. It was not a realm people below Spirit Severing could comprehend, and even for Spirit Severing cultivators, it was something they could only wish to have.The three spiritual energy Realms were very difficult to grasp and with the destruction of the ancient cultivation world, the information about the three realms gradually disappeared.The cultivators nowadays don\u2019t care about the type or quality of their spiritual energy. The only thing they pay any heed to is their cultivation level.Wang Lin didn\u2019t know that because of all the Yin energy he devoured, his spiritual energy changed to the Ji Realm.The reason for all this was because of the Underworld Ascension Method. It was one of the few methods that could create Ji Realm spiritual energy.However, the Underworld Ascension Method Situ Nan gave Wang Lin wasn\u2019t like the one from the ancient cultivation world. With the passage of time, parts of the methods were lost and it was their successors that reorganized the remaining information.As for Wang Lin\u2019s spiritual energy entering the door to Ji Realm, the most important factor was the heaven defying bead.Wang Lin stared at his fingertips and his eyes lit up. Just at that moment, he raised his head and jumped out of the hole. He looked and saw the blue skinned man quickly closing in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 \u2013 Corpse Yin Sect (1)Wang Lin chuckled. He no longer felt much hostility toward this strange blue person. He felt like stretching his body, so he quickly dashed forward like a rabbit.The distance between the two quickly shortened. When the strange blue person saw Wang Lin charging toward him, his eyes locked onto Wang Lin, ready for battle. However, he let out a laugh when he noticed that Wang Lin wasn\u2019t using the green sword. He stopped, completely forgetting the reason he came here in the first place, and prepared for battle. Without any hesitation, he ripped off a talisman that released a blue gas. He sucked the blue gas into his body and his aura suddenly became a lot stronger.His eyes revealed a serious expression as he spat out a few words in his strange language, as if he was trying to tell Wang Lin something.Wang Lin knew that the talismans on the blue man were very strange. Even after receiving a heavy injury from Wang Lin, with just one talisman, the blue man was able to completely recover. After that, Wang Lin became very curious about the talismans.Now, the strange man ripped off another yellow talisman and his strength suddenly doubled.Without a word, Wang Lin waved his hand. His spiritual energy cycled through his body and his aura suddenly changed as well.Slivers of blue energy hovered around him. A cold aura surrounded his body and an extremely cold expression appeared on his face.The strange man\u2019s eyes lit up. He opened his mouth and spat out a word that Wang Lin could understand: \u201cStrength!\u201d With that, he formed a fist. His arm glowed and grew larger as he threw a punch at Wang Lin.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes flashed. The Yin spiritual energy inside his body came out and formed a fist that collided with the strange man\u2019s fist in the air. In the moment of impact, the strange man entered a strange posture. He had one foot was on the ground while leaning toward the left and he started breathing in a strange pattern. Suddenly, a gust of wind swirled around with him as the center, blowing away all of the nearby rocks, creating a clean, open area around them.Wang Lin\u2019s face turned red and he involuntarily backed up three steps as he stared at the strange man.The strange man\u2019s heart was in even more of a shock than Wang Lin. He could clearly feel the strange Yin spiritual energy entering his body from Wang Lin\u2019s fist. The cold energy spread out throughout his body with waves of extreme coldness.If it wasn\u2019t for all of the strange symbols on his body, which helped him contain this cold energy, his whole body would have already been frozen solid.Looking at his right hand, which was completely frozen, he was horrified to find that all of the muscles and bones in his right arm had become ice. He looked at Wang Lin with his face pale and said another word Wang Lin could understand: \u201cJi?\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t say anything. Because he didn\u2019t know what Ji meant, he shook his head.The strange man was stunned. He ripped off another talisman, causing white and green colored gas to appear. After the gas disappeared, his right arm returned to normal, but Wang Lin could see that his arm was trembling.He looked at Wang Lin and let out a snort. He blabbed for a while before finally leaving. Wang Lin looked at the strange man until he was gone, then sat down to recall the battle.The energy in the strange man\u2019s punch was very strange. It didn\u2019t seem to be spiritual energy, but some other type of energy.\u201cStrength?\u201d He remembered the word the strange man shouted before throwing out that punch.Ignoring the strange punch the strange man threw, Wang Lin was very happy with the power of his Yin spiritual energy. He named this type of spiritual energy that could change the structure of things \u201cJi Yan spiritual energy.\u201d\u201cJi?\u201d This was what the strange man said after seeing his power.Wang Lin muttered to himself, \u201cIt is about time to leave. Once I reach the 5th layer of the Underworld Ascension Method, it will be time to leave.\u201d\u201cI must find more extreme Earth Yin locations, I must!\u201d Wang Lin knew that he must find extreme Yin because in order to break through to higher layers of the Underworld Ascension Method, he would need higher quality Yin energy.Although the ruins had dense Yan energy, Wang Lin knew that the Yin energy here was only around rank 10 dense quality. It may be able to reach rank 1 extreme quality at most.It has to be said that among heaven, earth, mystery, and underworld Yin energies, the difference between mystery and underworld wasn\u2019t big, but the difference between them and earth and heaven was enormous. Rank 1 good quality earth Yin energy was the same as rank 1 extreme quality mystery or underworld Yin energy.As for the heaven Yin energy that one could only wish for just rank 1 of, ordinary rank was as good as rank 1 extreme quality mystery and underworld energy.While he was pondering, he lifted his head and saw that the strange man was returning. After the strange man came back, he gestured to Wang Lin for a while. The strange man pointed at the surroundings, sucked in a deep breath, then vigorously shook his head.Then, he pointed at Wang Lin, then at himself, and made a bunch of gestures. Wang Lin gradually began to understand what this strange person wanted. It seemed the strange man wanted Wang Lin to follow him. Curious, Wang Lin nodded.The strange man moved very fast. He was very familiar with the surroundings and avoided all of the dangerous pits in the swamp.The strange man even entered a fissure in the ground and went into the tunnels underground. After a while, Wan Lin was shocked that they had traveled past the vast swamp area so quickly.Two days later, the two of them arrived at a deserted corner of the ruins. During these two days, the two of them had only stopped to rest once.After they arrived, Wang Lin noticed an intact tower nearby. At the top of that tower was a stone bead almost 2 meters wide.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. This stone bead was almost exactly the same as the one in the ruins.The strange man didn\u2019t stop and climbed to the top of the tower. He formed a few seals and touched the stone bead. A ray of light shot out from the stone bead toward the center of the ruin.From a distance, the pillar of light seemed endless.After doing all of that, the strange man jumped down. He waved his hand toward Wang Lin and the two of them left the place.Time passed. Wang Lin followed the strange strange man going from one bead to the next. In most places, the towers had already collapsed, but the stone beads were all in perfect condition.One by one, the stone beads were started and the lights all shot toward the center of the city.When the last stone bead, which was the first one Wang Lin saw, started, the entire city seemed to have changed.Along the way, Wang Lin secretly calculated that there were eight of these stone beads.The strange man looked into the sky and revealed an anxious look. The two of them rushed toward the center of the city without any rest. At dusk on the 4th day, the two arrived outside the center of the city.The eight pillars of light were gathered here. The strange man stopped and bowed. His eyes were filled with devotion as he let out song-like words.As his voice became more and more acute, the earth shook as a one hundred meter tall statue rose from the ground. The statue rose half way up before stopping.The statue was that of a man with long hair. The man looked quaint, his eye intellegent, and his hand held a hundred meter long spear as he looked into the distance. Around his body was a coiled dragon with its mouth open, as if it was going to attack. The scales on the dragon were so detailed that they almost looked real.The eight rays of light gathered at the statue and the eyes of the statue became brighter and brighter. Wang Lin felt like the illusion of this man with long hair was alive.After the statue appeared, the devotion in the strange man\u2019s eyes became even deeper. He waved at Wang Lin and urgently pointed at the mouth of the dragon.Wang Lin pondered a little. Without a word, he jumped up several times and arrived near the dragon\u2019s head. The moment he got up there, he felt a powerful Yin energy coming from below his feet.Wang Lin immediately sat down and formed a seal, making a red light appear. The red light immediately split into 4 and flashed rapidly until all 4 exploded. Wang Lin was in shock. He knew that this meant that the energy in this place had reached the limit of underworld Yin energy. It reached Extreme quality.Surprised, he quickly started to cultivate and absorb the Yin energy. However, this time, the suction range wasn\u2019t large and was focused entirely in the few meters around him. From a distance, it looked like a red sphere had appeared and surrounded the dragon\u2019s head.Wang Lin sat there for 5 days.In these 5 days, the strange man waited and became more and more anxious each day. He looked into the sky as if something was going to be attracted by the statue. The nine talismans on his body moved without any wind. Cearly, he was ready to take them off at any time.The Qi Sea was finally opened on the 3rd day and reformed in the early morning of the 5th day. The 5th layer of the Underworld Ascension Method was complete!One more step, then he could form his second cold core. When that was complete, he wouldn\u2019t fear late stage Foundation Establishment cultivators anymore. Even now, he no longer feared mid stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.Next, he tried to raise the quality of his Yin spiritual energy by mixing in the extreme quality Yin energy.While he was controlling the fusion, he was also observing his own spiritual energy. He noticed that his spiritual energy turned darker and darker and went from blue to dark blue.He didn\u2019t know that his spiritual power was even closer to the Ji Realm.At that moment, the world suddenly changed. The sky darkened and the clouds moved as if someone was pushing them with a large hand. Dark fog gathered until it formed the shape of a coffin.An illusionary figure slowly appeared on top of the coffin, its body quickly becoming more solid.A hoarse voice came from the sky.\u201cYou mean to say that master\u2019s Nascent Soul is hiding inside the statue?\u201dThe strange man\u2019s expression changed greatly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 \u2013 Corpse Yin Sect (2)The strange man\u2019s face suddenly changed. He removed the nine talismans from his body, then jumped up to where Wang Lin was. He ripped apart the red sphere without any hesitation and grabbed Wang Lin.Wang Lin woke up the moment those two arrived. He noticed the panic in the strange man\u2019s face and allowed himself to be dragged down from the statue.The moment the two landed, the strange man made a seal and put his hand on the statue. A black portal appeared and the strange man dragged Wang Lin into it.At the same time, the eight pillars of light disappeared and the statue started to slowly sink back into the ground.At that moment, the young man\u2019s body solidified. His body looked like a mummy\u2019s and his expression was cold. The zombie emitting an awful stench was standing next to him.The young man stared at the slowly sinking statue. He spread out his divine sense over the whole area, then his gaze returned to the statue.As for Wang Lin, the moment he was dragged into the statue by the strange person, he spread out his divine sense and revealed a surprised expression.The space inside the statue wasn\u2019t very large. There were white crystals floating around and there was a black, stone person sitting in the center.The stone person\u2019s appearance was exactly the same as the statue\u2019s outside. There were slivers of purple lines connection the stone person to the statue.Soon, a light curtain appeared in the space. The light fluctuated a bit and displayed the scene from outside.Through the light curtain, Wang Lin could see what was going on outside. He then looked at the strange person and and immediately noticed the great amount of hatred in his eyes.The young man stood outside the statue. He stared at the statue and slowly said, \u201cMaster, 100 years passed by so quickly. This time, you won\u2019t be able to run away!\u201dWang Lin sucked in a breath. He turned around and stared at the strange man. He asked, \u201cYou are his master?\u201dThe strange man blankly stared at Wang Lin. Just at that moment, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he spat out a green light. The green light flashed across the space and mercilessly lunged toward the stone person sitting in the air.A ray of purple light appeared to block the sword, but the sword teleported past the purple light and stabbed the stone peron.A violent roar echoed throughout the space as a ball of light escaped from the stone person. Wang Lin waved his hand and the sword turned around and shot toward the ball of light.The strange man finally reacted and his eyes were filled with anxiousness. He stared at Wang Lin with anger hidden in his eyes as he pointed at the sword and shouted a few times.Wang Lin was stunned. Just at that moment, a very hoarse voice came out from the ball of light.\u201cLittle friend, please don\u2019t be impulsive. I don\u2019t mean any harm. I am the master of the person outside\u2026\u201d At the same time, countless rays of light gathered from all directions at the ball of light. Slowly, the ball of light turned into a small person 1 foot tall.This little person looked very weak. His face was pale and he looked like a kid. The little person kept dodging the green sword while looking at Wang Lin with an ashen face.The strange person let out an angry roar and was about to block the flying sword.Wang Lin backed up a few steps the moment the little person spoke. He waved his hand and the flying sword returned to his side. The flying sword circled around Wang Lin with the tip pointing at the little person.The strange person walked up to the little man. He shouted angrily at Wang Lin a few times, his eyes filled with disappointment.The little person bitterly laughed. His body floated up and landed on the shoulder of the strange person. He said, \u201cAdai, don\u2019t be rude to our guest.\u201dThe strange person\u2019s expression suddenly eased, but he still cautiously looked at Wang Lin.The little person sighed. He looked at Wang Lin and warmly said, \u201cLittle friend, please don\u2019t be rash, I\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, the man outside said a strange word. The moment the strange word came out, the whole statue shook and stopped descending.The little person\u2019s expression slightly changed. His hand formed a seal as he spat out purple gas. The moment the purple gas appeared, it entered the statue.The statue\u2019s eyes shined a purple light and continued to descend.The young man let out a cold snort. He grabbed at the air and the statue shook again. It started to sink slower. At the same time, he sent out many seals, causing the statue to tremble, but the statue still stood.The small person inside the statue let out a relieved look, but he looked even more tired. He said to Wang Lin, \u201cThis statue can last half an hour under the attack of Amu, more than enough time for me to tell you the story behind all of this.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t say a word as he stared at the little person.The little person sighed and said, \u201cMy name is Wu Yu. Has little friend ever heard of the Corpse Sect?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression remained normal with the small sword next to him as he shook his head.Wu Yu bitterly smiled and said, \u201cLittle friend doesn\u2019t need to be alert. I am only a Nascent Soul without a body. Coupled with countless uses of Nascent Energy throughout the years, I am no threat to you. It is your sword that almost killed me.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. After pondering a little, he asked, \u201cWho is that person outside? Are you his master?\u201dWu Yu\u2019s eyes revealed a helpless expression. He answered, \u201cHe is my corpse puppet. Alas, I was one of ancestors of the corpse sect. The corpse sect had a rule stating that every disciple that joins must find a corpse to make their own corpse puppet.\u201d\u201cAs our own cultivation level increased, the corpse puppet would grow as well.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes narrowed as he asked, \u201cYour corpse puppet rebelled?\u201dWu Yu wrily smiled. He nodded and said, \u201cThat is right. Originally, with the technique used, the corpse puppet could never rebel. Unfortunately, I came to this place 300 years ago, hoping to use the Yin energy here to break past early stage Nascent Soul. Not only did I fail, but my corpse puppet took the opportunity to seriously injure me. During the shock of the injury, he was able to escape from my control.\u201dAt that moment, the statue started to tremble even harder. The little person revealed an anxious look and quickly continued, \u201cI had to retreat to heal my injuries, so I didn\u2019t chase after it. 100 years later, when my injuries got better, I found my corpse puppet. However, he had managed to gain his own consciousness and even had a lucky encounter, causing him to enter mid stage Nascent Soul before me.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t stand a chance, so I gave up my body and escaped with my Nascent Soul. My Nascent Soul took heavy injuries and has been hiding inside this statue ever since. I\u2019m too afraid to go out. That zombie was my body from back then. It seems to have gained its own consciousness in these 100 years in this place.\u201dWang Lin coldly smiled and said, \u201cWhat a bunch of nonsense. If that corpse puppet is really as you say, why didn\u2019t it leave instead of continuing to look for you?\u201dWu Yu wrily smiled. He hesitated for a bit and said, \u201cForget it. Little friend, you don\u2019t know, but this is related to the corpse sect\u2019s secrets. Although this corpse puppet is out of my control, I have still refined it for hundreds of years. It is connected to my soul, so if it goes more than 100 kilometers away from me, it will die.\u201cThe only way to fix this problem is to swallow my Nascent Soul and seal it within him. Only by doing that would he truly escape my control.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up and he said, \u201cHe never found you in these few hundred years?\u201dWu Yu touched the inner side of the statue and said, \u201cWhen I was running away, I accidently entered this statue. This statue can hide my presence. Only with the help of the statue did I survive.\u201d\u201cAlso, after the corpse puppet reached mid stage Nascent Soul, every time it came out, it would need to rest after a while. Every rest takes about 100 years. That is another reason why I haven\u2019t been eaten yet.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression was calm as he slowly asked, \u201cOh? Then why haven\u2019t you escaped during the 100 years he was sleeping?\u201d\u201cI have tried to escape countless times, but this jungle is surrounded by a vast fog. This fog is very harmful to the Nascent Soul. I can\u2019t withstand touching it even a little. The corpse puppet can\u2019t find me, but I didn\u2019t expect my body to gain its own consciousness. With the connection between me and my body, it was able to find me.\u201d\u201cAlso, Adai did things on his own and made the statue appear for you, which attracted them. Alas, this is my own fault. I can\u2019t blame anyone else.\u201d Wu Yu wrily smiled and continued:\u201cLittle friend, Adai has already told me about what happened between you and him. If it was 300 years ago, I would have tried to possess your body, but I have already wasted my chance on trying to posses Adai. Now, I won\u2019t have another chance until I reach mid stage Nascent Soul.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t believe a word of what this little person said, but his expression remained normal. He looked at the strange person and asked, \u201cHis name is Adai?\u201dWu Yu nodded and said, \u201cLittle friend, I found Adai in this statue. When I entered here, I found Adai sleeping and tried to take possession of this body. However, his body contains a very strange power. After using the majority of my Nascent Energy on his body, I was finally able to escape. Although I failed in possessing him, this allowed Adai to wake up and caused him to have the feeling that our lives are connected.\u201d\u201cFrom then on, I knew that there would probably be no chance for me to escape until Adai told me about you.\u201dWith that, a flash of excitement entered Wu Yu\u2019s eyes.Wang Lin didn\u2019t speak, but quietly stared at the little person, waiting for the rest.Wu Yu revealed a pleading expression and said, \u201cI beg little friend here to please help me\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 \u2013 Corpse Yin Sect (3)Wu Yu revealed a pleading expression and quickly said, \u201cI can\u2019t leave this place, but I would like to ask you to go to the corpse sect and ask my senior apprentice brother, Ye Zi, to come and save me.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cDo you have a way for me to leave without being noticed by the corpse puppet?\u201d he asked.Wu Yu quickly nodded and sincerely said, \u201cI can use the last of my Nascent Energy to open up a transfer array that will take you directly to the corpse sect.\u201dWang Lin stared at Wu Yu. He faintly smiled and said, \u201cIf you can open up the transfer array, why don\u2019t you go back through it?\u201dWu Yu sighed and said, \u201cThe corpse puppet can\u2019t go more than 100 kilometers away from me, and I can\u2019t go 100 kilometers away from him. If the corpse puppet leaves the 100 kilometer range, it would immediately die. If I still had my body, my soul would take a heavy injury, but now I am just a Nascent Soul. I really don\u2019t want to die with the corpse puppet.\u201dThe frequency at which the statue was trembling was increasing. Wu Yu saw that Wang Lin\u2019s expression still hadn\u2019t changed. He clenched his jaw and said, \u201cI, Wu Yu, swear on my Nascent Soul that I mean you no harm, so please help me, little friend. I can even gift Adai to you. The nine talismans were already on his body when I found him and they contain unimaginable power.\u201d\u201cIn addition, I can feel that your spiritual energy contains Yin properties. I also use the Yin method of cultivation. I assume you came here to use the Yin energy for cultivation. The Yin energy here is the Underworld type of Yin energy. If you go to the corpse sect, there is a cultivation spot that has Earth Type Yin energy.\u201dWang Lin narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cIf the corpse sect has a location with Earth type Yin energy, why did you come here to make your breakthrough?\u201dWu Yu gave Wang Lin a deep glance. This youth was very careful. No matter how much he tried to convince him, Wang Lin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all.After hearing Wang Lin\u2019s question, he wryly smiled and said, \u201cLittle friend, I have already sworn upon my Nascent Soul. This corpse puppet is not the same as a living being. Every time it is about to make a breakthrough, it must absorb Underworld type Yin energy, so I brought it here.\u201dJust at that moment, the statue shook violently and cracks appeared all over its body. A series of crackling sounds could be heard as the cracks became larger and the statue seemed to be about to collapse. Wu Yu\u2019s expression suddenly became very anxious and said, \u201cLittle friend, if you want to cultivate your Yin technique at the corpse sect, you can pretend to be my disciple. I\u2019ll teleport you directly to the corpse sect and they won\u2019t suspect a thing. Little friend, consider it yourself.\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, the statue suddenly shook violently. The cracks now covered the entire statue and some parts even started to fall off.Wang Lin\u2019s mind spun. He knew that if he didn\u2019t leave, his life would be in danger when that corpse puppet broke in. He instantly knew that the corpse puppet was a cold hearted killer.Thinking about that, he nodded toward Wu Yu without a word.Wu Yu took a deep breath. Both of his hands constantly formed seals as a pentagonal ring slowly appeared before him.This ring of light emitted a rainbow color and a small suction force could be felt.At that moment, the statue broke with a bang and a cold voice came in. \u201cMaster, I want to see where you will run to now.\u201dWu Yu reveal a horrified expression. Without waiting for the transfer array to completely open, he shouted, \u201cLittle friend, go quickly! Whether I survive or not is all in your hands!\u201d With that, he flew into the stone person floating in the air.At the same time, Wang Lin charged toward the transfer array. The transfer array was unstable and seemed like it might collapse.The strange person hesitated for a bit and followed Wang Lin into the transfer array.Just at that moment, the statue completely collapsed. The young man came in with a mocking smile. However, the moment he saw the transfer array, his expression drastically changed.As for Wang Lin, after he entered the transfer array, he found himself inside a tunnel. He could feel his body being stretched and there were countless specks of lights flashing by like the stars in the sky.Wang Lin looked back saw. He saw Adai behind him, looking left and right. After Adai noticed that Wang Lin was looking at him, he shouted a few strange words toward Wang Lin. His eyes were no longer cautious of Wang Lin, but were filled with confusion.After an unknown amount of time, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. The light became larger and larger until it covered most of the tunnel. Wang Lin and Adai felt a suction force from the light and were sucked in.The Corpse Sect was a demonic sect in Zhao. Although they were weaker than the number one Sky Demon Sect, the Corpse Sect was much more mysterious. It could be said that the Corpse Sect was the number 1 most mysterious sect in Zhao.How many disciples the sect had, where the sect was located, how many Nascent Soul cultivators the sect had, and such information were all unknown to the outside world.There were even rumors that the Corpse Sect had already been completely wiped out.In short, this was a very low profile sect, but this kind of low profile was something the world could never forget about.The only thing people knew about the Corpse Sect was their cultivation method.The disciples of the Corpse sect only had one chance to refine a corpse. Once they refine one, they will never refine another.This was a very miraculous technique.For the Corpse Sect\u2019s disciples, besides their own cultivation, the cultivation of their corpse puppet was also important. The reason this technique was so miraculous was that 500 years ago, a Foundation Establishment disciple had a Nascent Soul corpse puppet.Although this disciple ended up mysteriously disappearing, his appearance caused a stir in Zhao, especially among the lower level cultivators who now dreamed of joining the Corpse Sect.But no matter how many people tried to find it, the Corpse Sect was like a floating cloud that no one could find.In a location in the far west side of Zhao was an area surrounded by Yin energy all year round. Even cultivators didn\u2019t come here often.Because aside from the fact that this area was shrouded with Yin energy, there was also the Nine Earth energy that not even Nascent Soul cultivators were willing to touch. Anyone below the Nascent Soul stage would be injured from touching it.Supposedly, areas with this many restrictions should be hiding some sort of big treasure. This was the idea in many cultivators\u2019 heads. Finally, a few of the demonic sects got together with their experts and broke the restrictions to search the area.But what surprised everyone was that there was nothing there at all. Some of the people expanded their search to the underground and still found nothing.This treasure hunt turned into a joke. They were mocked by the orthodox sects.Gradually, due to the fact that this place had many restrictions and no treasure, it was forgotten by everyone.At the center of the plain was an area covered by fog.Inside the fog was a marsh that took up most of the area, and under the marsh was a giant cave. There were numerous tunnels connecting the giant cave to smaller caves and tunnels from those caves to others. The entire underground area was covered with big and small caves connected to each other.This was where the most mysterious demonic sect of Zhao, the Corpse Sect, was located.The largest cave in the center was the size of several of the Heng Yue Sect\u2019s main hall. Inside were eight pillars of purple wood, forming a formation. There were endless waves of purple energy emitting from the wood pillars.There were countless strange symbols and patterns carved into the eight wood pillars. There were also strings of light connecting them. If one looked at them from above, they could see that those lights formed a total of 49 rings of light.Sitting on the eight wood pillars were eight young men. A coffin floated behind each one of them.Five of the rings lit up and a youth wearing blue and a coffin appeared in the cave.One of the eight youths on the pillars opened his eyes and looked at the person who had just arrived. He spoke with no emotion in his voice at all, \u201cWhere did you came from?\u201dThe blue robed youth quickly bowed and said, \u201cRank 2 cultivation country Lu Corpse Sect branch. I, Lin Yi, am here to participate in the promotion exam.The youth coldly glanced at the person and said, \u201cThe 18th cave to the right, go.\u201dThe blue robed youth respectfully clasped his hands and exited the formation. Afterward, he calculated for a bit and entered a cave.The youth on the pillar slightly nodded. He no longer minded the blue robed youth and closed his eyes.Within the next several hours, more people came out of the transfer array. The strongest person to come caused 13 rings to light up. The moment the 13 rings lit up, two of the eight youths opened their eyes.Time slowly passed. The rings in the formation lit up again. This time, it was six rings.A youth on a wood pillar opened his eyes. Just at that moment, there was a sudden flash of light and seven more rings lit up.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d At that moment, another youth opened his eyes. The two looked at each other, then carefully looked at the formation.Shortly after, the formation flashed again and the amount of rings to light up increased from 13 to 28.\u201cIt seems there is a senior coming here.\u201d Two more youths opened their eyes. There was a hint of respect in the four youths\u2019 cold gazes as they stared at the formation.The moment that was said, there was a rumbling sound coming from the formation as the number of rings of light that were lit up increased from 28 one by one.The remaining four youths opened their eyes with shocked expressions. When 40 rings lit up, the eight of them stood up, kneeled down on one knee, and formed a strange sign as they said, \u201cWelcome senior\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 \u2013 Enter the SectThe moment the word \u201cSenior\u201d came out, three more rings lit up, making it a total of 43 rings. After 43 rings were lit, no more lit up, but they started to shine in sync.The attitude of each of the eight youths changed again. Their faces were filled with shock, then that changed to a near crazed level of respect. They went from one knee on the ground to two knees as they carefully stared at the transfer array. It has to be said that if 40 rings light up, that means the status of the person in the Corpse Sect is very high and if it\u2019s above 40, then it is a Nascent Soul ancestor.With that knowledge, it made sense for the eight of them to have this reaction.Slowly, the two figures that appeared in the formation became more and more solid. One of them was about 20 years old. He looked very handsome, had an air of coolness, and was wearing black clothes that made him look even more upright.Behind him followed a strange, blue skinned person with countless strange symbols all over his body. The most eye catching part was the nine yellow talismans stuck to various parts of his body.The moment the two appeared, slivers of cold air spread out.Suddenly, one of the eight youths let out a surprised sound. Soon, all of them were shocked.This person was Wang Lin. The moment he appeared, he opened his mouth and spat out a green light. The flying sword circled around him, releasing a cold aura with the sword tip pointing at the eight people on the wood pillars.With a scan of his divine sense, Wang Lin relaxed a bit. All eight of the youths around him were only at the 15th layer of Qi Condensation. If he wanted to, he could kill them all in an instant.The strange person, Adai, also for some reason stopped looking around like he was when they were inside the tunnel. He stood behind Wang Lin and stared at the strange symbols on the wood pillars, seemingly lost in thought.The eight people on the wood pillars stood up. One of them had a strange expression on his face as he asked, \u201cSenior, you are?\u201dWang Lin already planned out what he was going to say during the trip here. Currently, he was very calm as he coldly said, \u201cI am Wang Lin. Please inform uncle-master Ye Zizai that I have something important to tell him.\u201dThe youth was startled. He looked at the other youth, then said, \u201cSenior, I can\u2019t help you with that. Let me take you to see the elder.\u201dWang Lin nodded. He walked out of the formation and Adai followed behind.The youth jumped off the wood pillar and the coffin followed behind him.\u201cSenior, this way.\u201d With that, the youth flew toward one of the tunnels.Without a word, Wang Lin followed the youth.Along the way, the youth secretly inspected Wang Lin. The more he saw, the more respectful he became. After all, strength was everything in the cultivation world; and with Wang Lin\u2019s Foundation Establishment cultivation level, the youth naturally respected Wang Lin.Adai, who was behind Wang Lin, attracted most of the youth\u2019s attention.Similarly, Wang Lin was also inspecting the youth, especially the coffin behind him. Waves of cold energy were emitted from the coffin and there was a layer blocking out his divine sense. However, as Wang Lin was a mid stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, he saw through it with a little effort.There was a corpse inside the coffin. The body was like dry wood and sleeping. The moment Wang Lin saw the corpse, the corpse woke up. Although its eyes were cloudy, it was filled with killing intent.The youth seemed to notice and smacked the coffin. The corpse closed its eyes and the youth smiled. \u201cSenior, this corpse puppet was given to me by my master. Master got it from the outer world battleground. It is very sensitive to divine sense and is filled with killing intent. It took me a very long time to finally refine it.\u201dWang Lin nodded and said, \u201cYour corpse puppet has early stage Foundation Establishment cultivation. Not bad.\u201dThe moment the youth heard those words, he was secretly shocked and his respect for Wang Lin deepened. It has to be said that the coffin has the ability to block out divine sense, yet Wang Lin was able to see through it instantly. Clearly, Wang Lin was no ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator. Maybe even a late stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.Thinking of that, his attitude became even more respectful as he asked, \u201cSenior, is this your corpse puppet?\u201dWang Lin\u2019s expression was calm as he nodded.The youth\u2019s face was filled with curiosity as he looked at Adai before exclaiming, \u201cSenior, how did you get your corpse puppet to be so intelligent? The only other corpse puppet as intelligent is ancestor Ze\u2019s Flying Luo Sha.Wang Lin looked at the youth and didn\u2019t answer.The youth kept looking at Adai, making him very nervous, until Adai couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and started to yell at the youth.The youth was startled when he heard Adai speaking and asked, \u201cSenior, your corpse puppet has already evolved to the point of speaking?\u201dWang Lin slightly frowned. \u201cThis person really talks too much,\u201d he thought.The youth didn\u2019t seem to be aware of how annoying he was and kept talking even though Wang Lin didn\u2019t answer.After less than a quarter of an hour of walking, the youth went from talking about Wang Lin\u2019s corpse puppet to his fellow disciples, then his own master, the ancestor, and so on. Although Wang Lin was annoyed, he was able to learn a lot about the Corpse Sect.\u201cThe Zhao branch of the Corpse Sect is really amazing. People from the upper rank 4 and 5 countries to the lower rank 1 and 2 countries, they all pass through here as a transit point. For example, the Corpse Sect branches in rank 1 and 2 countries\u2019 qualification test is held here.The tunnel became wider and wider as the youth kept talking.Wang Lin really couldn\u2019t stand the youth\u2019s chatter, so when he saw the exit of the tunnel, he immediately sped up and flew toward it.Inside the cave were five large stone pillars and on top of each pillar was a large ball of blue flame.On the top of the pillar in the middle sat an old man. He had a very ruddy complexion. His face was red and his hair moved without any wind. While he was cultivating, slivers of gas from the balls of fire entered his body, exitted his body, then entered the pillar.The cycle continued. It was very strange.The moment Wang Lin flew into the cave, the old man opened his eyes. His eyes glowed as he carefully examined Wang Lin with a cold gaze.Wang Lin checked with his divine sense and found that the old man was at the mid stage of Foundation Establishment.At that moment, the youth also quickly entered the cave and said to the old man, \u201cElder, this senior just arrived through the formation. 43 rings lit up when he arrived and he wants to see ancestor Ye.\u201dAfter hearing this, the old man\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He looked at Wang Lin with a strange expression and asked, \u201cFellow cultivator, who in the corpse sect opened the tunnel for you?\u201dWang Lin calmly answered, \u201cWu Yu.\u201dHearing that name, the old man\u2019s expression changed. He stood up and said, \u201cAncestor Wu Yu, who disappeared for a few hundred years. What\u2026 what is your relationship with him?\u201dWang Lin looked at the old man and said, \u201cDisciple.\u201dThe old man sucked in a breath of cold air. Wu Yu\u2019s status was extremely high within the corpse sect. If what Wang Lin said was true, then he couldn\u2019t afford to offend this person. With that, he quickly smiled and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s uncle-master returning. Junior\u2019s name is Mu Rong. What is senior\u2019s name?\u201dWang Lin faintly smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Wang Lin. As for being called uncle-master, I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201dMu Rong let out a laugh. He turned his head and looked at the youth. His expression went cold as he said, \u201cYou can go now. I\u2019ll lead uncle-master Wang to ancestor Ye.\u201dThe youth quickly agreed. He turned around and muttered to himself before quickly leaving.After the youth left, Mu Rong invited Wang Lin onto the stone pillar and asked, \u201cBrother Wang, why didn\u2019t ancestor come back with you?\u201dWang Lin looked at the person and responded, \u201cMy master\u2019s corpse puppet had some problems, so he is taking care of it.Mu Rong nodded and said, \u201cAncestor Wu Yu\u2019s corpse puppet is almost as powerful as ancestor Ye\u2019s. The more powerful a corpse puppet is, the harder they are to deal with; however, with his strength, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u201d He looked at Wang Lin, trying to figure out some secrets.Unfortunately, Wang Lin\u2019s expression never changed the entire time. Mu Rong pondered a little and said, \u201cPlease wait here, brother Wang. I\u2019ll contact ancestor Ye right away.\u201d With that, he slapped his bag of holding and took out a piece of jade. He held the jade in his hand with a serious expression for a moment, then tossed it.The jade flashed a few times, then quickly flew into one of the tunnels.After doing that, Mu Rong looked at Adai behind Wang Lin. Just as he was about to speak, Wang Lin spoke as he looked at the blue flame on the pillars with a surprised expression. \u201cBrother Mu, these Yin flames contain Yan energy as well. They don\u2019t seem ordinary.\u201dMu Rong let out a laugh and said, \u201cBrother Wang, this Blue Firelord flame was created by melting the cores of several Core Formation cultivators from the orthodox sects hundreds of years ago. After they were further refined by ancestor Ye, they became treasures of the corpse sect. They benefit our cultivation a lot and are especially beneficial to our corpse puppets.\u201dWang Lin stared at the blue flame. He waved his hand. A sliver of the blue flame floated to him. He observed the flame, then sent some of his Yin energy into the flame. Sizzling sounds came from the flame and it turned into a small blue ball floating in his hand.Mu Rong\u2019s expression slightly changed to a smile. \u201cBrother Wang, turning this gas into solid form isn\u2019t easy without a lot of Yin energy. It seems ancestor Wu Yu really loves you.\u201dThe last sliver of doubt that Mu Rong had toward Wang Lin disappeared after Wang Lin displayed that move. He didn\u2019t know that although Wang Lin\u2019s Yin energy was similar to the Yin method the corpse sect practiced, they were very different.At that moment, the blue flame suddenly dimmed as more and more gas gathered from the blue flames. The gas formed into the figure of a person. The figure emitted a heavy pressure.Wang Lin\u2019s pupils contracted. Under the pressure of the figure, he felt a sense of terror. Then, he looked at Mu Rong, who was already kneeling on the ground.A grim voice came from the figure. \u201cYou are junior apprentice brother Wu Yu\u2019s disciple?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 \u2013 FurnaceThe moment that loud voice spoke out, the sound transformed into violent wind that caused the balls of fire in the surroundings to dim. Loud sounds echoed in the cave, giving off the feeling of divine punishment.Wang Lin took a deep breath. He clasped his hands and respectfully said, \u201cGreeting, senior Ye.\u201dThe figure slowly became solid and turned into a 40 or so year old man. This person was very handsome. His eyes sparkled like the stars and his skin was as smooth as jade. He looked at Wang Lin with no emotion on his face and said, \u201cMu Rong, you can leave.\u201dMu Rong, who was kneeling on the ground, quickly stood up, charged toward one of the caves, and disappeared without a trace.Ye Zi waved his left hand and a curtain of light suddenly appeared and surrounded them. He sighed and said, with a sense of melancholy, \u201c Wang Lin, you are not a disciple of the Corpse Sect. There is no need to lie. My junior apprentice brother Wu Yu must have met with some trouble. Wang Lin, there is no 3rd person here, so tell me.\u201dWang Lin straightened his back. He had already thought about it on the way here. There was no way he would be able to lie to a Nascent Soul cultivator like Ye Zi, so he decided to tell the truth.After pondering a little, Wang Lin recounted everything that happened in the ruins.Ye Zi silently listened and didn\u2019t say a word. He sighed after Wang Lin finished speaking, then closed eyes his and thought, \u201cWhat this Wang Lin said should be true. When brother Wu Yu left, he did say that his corpse puppet was about to advance and what Wang Lin said matches his personality. A corpse puppet rebelling. Alas, junior apprentice brother, how could the rebelling of a mid stage Nascent Soul corpse puppet be as easy to deal with as you stated? Even if I go, I can\u2019t help you at all.\u201d\u201cSince you made Wang Lin deliver the message, you must have other ideas\u2026\u201d With that, Ye Zi spread out his divine sense and was shocked. The method this Wang Lin cultivated was very close to the corpse sect\u2019s. He was filled with Yin energy. After pondering for a while, Ye Zi understood Wu Yu\u2019s intention.This was Wu Yu\u2019s way of sending a distress call while sending the corpse sect a disciple. After scanning Wang Lin, he looked at Adai. After he pondered for a bit, he completely understood Wu Yu\u2019s intentions. Adai\u2019s body was built for cultivating the corpse sect\u2019s cultivation method.After Ye Zi withdrew his gaze, he slowly asked Wang Lin, \u201cHe is Adai, who accompanied my junior apprentice brother for all these years?\u201dWang Lin nodded.Ye Zi took a deep breath and decisively said, \u201cWang Lin, I checked out your spiritual energy and it contains a lot of Yin property. If you were to cultivate here, you would have a much easier time. Wang Lin, are you willing to become a disciple of the corpse sect?\u201dWang Lin already guessed everything that could happen on the way here. Ye Zi\u2019s recruitment was within his expectations, so he respectfully said, \u201cDisciple is willing.\u201dYe Zi nodded again and said, \u201cFine. Since you had the luck of meeting my junior brother Wu Yu, then you might as well become his real disciple. From now on, you are the corpse sect\u2019s second generation disciple.\u201dWith that, he pointed at Adai and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking Adai with me.\u201d He saw Wang Lin\u2019s uncertainty and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He has such a deep relationship with my junior brother, I won\u2019t dare to hurt him. I\u2019m going to take him as my personal disciple.\u201dWith that, he waved his right hand and threw out a dark blue jade. Then, he grabbed Adai with his hand. Adai let out a scream as they disappeared into the caves.Wang Lin caught the jade. He scanned it with his divine sense and his expression became strange.There were only some simple techniques and not a trace of the corpse sect\u2019s cultivation method. This must be because Ye Zi was worried, so Wang Lin didn\u2019t mind.As he was checking out the jade, Mu Rong peaked out from one of the caves and walked out. After he found that Ye Zi had left, he flew to Wang Lin and was about to speak when he noticed the jade in his hand. He was shocked and quickly took a few steps back as he said, \u201cDisciple Mu Rong greets ancestor.\u201dWang Lin was shooked and stared at the jade as he said, \u201cBrother Mu, there is no need to be like this. Does the color of the jade mean anything?\u201dMu Rong looked a the jade in Wang Lin\u2019s hand with envy as he bitterly smiled and took out a light blue jade and said, \u201cAncestor, you didn\u2019t have a jade before, so we could talk to each other as if we were peers, but now that you have your jade, the corpse sect has strict rules regarding ranks, so how would I dare to call you brother Wang again\u2026\u201d\u201cLook at the color of my jade. The jade is the only form of identification in the corpse sect. The first ancestor\u2019s jade is green, ancestors\u2019 jades are dark blue, elders\u2019 jades are light blue, and all disciples\u2019 jades are white.\u201dWang Lin put away his jade and was just about to speak when the balls of fires on the pillar suddenly flashed a few times, releasing green smoke.Mu Rong\u2019s expression changed a bit. His hand formed a seal and he said, \u201cGather!\u201dThe green smoke quickly came toward Mu Rong and entered his forehead.Mu Rong closed his eyes. Shortly after, he reopened them and said, \u201cAncestor, first ancestor Ye Zi has arranged a room for you. I\u2019ll take you there shortly.\u201dWang Lin was very surprised about the techniques of the corpse sect. Just like the technique that just now used smoke to transmit a message. He rubbed his chin and nodded.Mu Rong flew toward one of the caves. Wang Lin jumped and followed behind.The two moved quickly through the caves as Mu Rong talked to Wang Lin about the corpse sect. Along with the youth\u2019s explanation, Wang Lin now had a certain understanding of the corpse sect.The corpse sect was one of the four demonic sects of Zhao. They had over one thousand disciples and they all lived underground. Each had their own cultivation room. Everyone other than the few disciples that would go out to purchase things while everyone else was cultivating in their rooms.Although, calling them a demonic sect wasn\u2019t really fitting compared to the Tian Dao Sect\u2019s demonic flame, He Huan Sect\u2019s evil Yin, and Wu Feng Valley\u2019s murderous aura. Though the corpse sect had corpse puppets, everyone there were really just cultivation maniacs.Every disciple cultivated like a madman and the reason for this was because of the cruel requirements the corpse sect had. If one doesn\u2019t reach reach the 10th layer of Qi Condensation in 10 years, doesn\u2019t reach Foundation Establishment in 30 years, or doesn\u2019t reach Core Formation in 100 years, they will be refined into a corpse puppet.This cruel system was like a whip that caused all of the corpse sect disciples to cultivate like crazy.Every year there were several people that were refined into corpse puppets, and every time, all of the disciples watched the process.Similarly, every year, there were disciples that were sent out to find fitting mortals to replenish those lost disciples.It\u2019s not that the disciples didn\u2019t want to rebel, but all of the disciples that were accepted would have part of their soul removed and sealed into a jade. The jades were split into 4 ranks. The first ancestor\u2019s green jade could control any disciple in the sect. The ancestor\u2019s dark blue jade also had a similar effect, and then the elder\u2019s light blue jade.Under layers of control, no one dared to rebel. Mu Rong also told Wang Lin that this corpse sect was only a branch of the real corpse sect. He once saw a messenger from a rank 5 country. Even that messenger\u2019s slave was at least at the Nascent Soul cultivation level.The more Wang Lin heard, the more shocked he was. He wondered why when Ye Zi gave him the jade, Ye Zi didn\u2019t seal part of his soul in it.The same question came from Ye Zi\u2019s body after he returned to his own cave.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you seal part of his soul into the jade?\u201d Asked a hoarse voice that sounded like two iron plates rubbing together.Ye Zi slapped his palm on Adai\u2019s forehead and sealed his senses. Then, he turned around and sat cross legged on the black bed. He pointed at his forehead and his body shook as an illusionary figure appeared next to him.This figure was very blurry. One couldn\u2019t clearly see what he looked like. He floated around Adai, observing him, then he reached out his hand toward Adai\u2019s head.Ye Zi frowned. He waved his right hand and coughed out a mouthful of blue Yin fire. After the Yin fire appeared, it formed a wall that blocked the figure\u2019s hand.Ye Zi coldly said, \u201cLuo Sha, this person is my junior apprentice brother\u2019s personal disciple. You can\u2019t hurt him.\u201dThe figure let out a laugh. He floated in the air with his arms hugging his own shoulders and said, with a high pitched voice, \u201cYe Zizai, you and your junior apprentice brother are only furnaces for us. Your brother left early, before Lord Zi could awaken, and now he is calling you for help. He is really throwing himself into the net. Ye Zizai, since you already know his location, why aren\u2019t you going to help Lord Zi devour Wu Yu?\u201dYe Zizai\u2019s face was gloomy. He stared at the figure and sneered. \u201cBefore you completely devour me, don\u2019t think I will listen to any order from you. As for Lord Zi, I won\u2019t go to help him or my junior apprentice brother. Whether he could devour my junior apprentice brother, it\u2019s all up to himself.\u201dThe figure let out a creepy laugh. He didn\u2019t seem to mind and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go, I won\u2019t force you, but the next wave of bodies has been prepared by a rank 5 country. This time, there are 10 people. You must pick your furnace carefully. Remember, you are only an outer disciple of the corpse sect. Also, what are you going to do with this brat Adai?\u201dYe Zizai pondered for a while and secretly let out a sigh. 400 years ago, he entered the corpse sect and, thanks to his talent, he was able to reach the Nascent Soul stage in 400 years, but just at that moment, his corpse puppet gained a sense of self and started to devour his consciousness. This process was very slow and this allowed him to learn of some of the corpse sect\u2019s secrets.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 \u2013 Great ChangeThe Corpse Sect is a very large sect. Based on Ye Zizai\u2019s knowledge, the main Corpse Sect is based in a rank 5 country, and the rest of the branches are scattered across the planet.All of these branches have very rigid systems to force the disciples to train like crazy. After Ye Zi found out the truth, he felt like they were being raised like animals.After the \u201canimals\u201d reach the Core Formation stage, there is a ceremony. That is when souls from rank 5 countries that have lost their bodies will be placed into corpse puppets.To say it plainly, the Corpse Sect is the largest provider of bodies for sects from rank 5 countries. It has to be said that rank 4 or higher countries wage a number of wars every year. In the battle in the foreign battleground, injuries and death are inevitable. All cultivators above the Nascent Stage have a chance of escaping with their Nascent Souls if they are careful.That\u2019s when the Corpse Sect come\u2019s in. Whether it\u2019s someone who lost their body or is getting ready to possess a body, all transactions dealing with bodies are done at the Corpse Sect.The bodies the Corpse Sect provides all have excellent talent and have been training in the cultivation method provided by the Corpse Sect since they were young. Every branch of the Corpse Sect provides different cultivation methods to their disciples.The Corpse Sect deals with a lot of sects from rank 4 or 5 countries, and some of them sign exclusive deals with the Corpse Sect in order to get bodies faster. One part of the deal is that the sect provides their basic cultivation method, effectively making a branch their sect\u2019s personal body farm.Zhao\u2019s Corpse Sect comes from a demonic sect in a rank 5 country. The cultivation method is called the Underworld Method.Ye Zi let out a sigh. It was not that he didn\u2019t think about rebelling, but the more he knew, the more he understood how small he really was in comparison. He wasn\u2019t qualified to rebel, and once the possession starts, it can\u2019t be stopped unless his cultivation level greatly surpasses the cultivation level of the soul in the corpse puppet.There is another rule in the Corpse Sect: if a disciple reaches the Nascent Soul stage, even if their body is possessed by another, they are given the chance to possess someone else.Ye Zizai, for example, once he is completely devoured, his soul will be placed in the corpse puppet of someone he chooses. He will then possess that person through their corpse puppet, just like he is being possessed right now.But he only has one chance. If he can\u2019t break through the Nascent Soul stage and get to the Spirit Severing stage, then the only road left for him is to be sent to the foreign battleground to be used as cannon fodder.Once one reaches the Spirit Severing stage, they are promoted to elder in a branch in a rank 4 country. They then have 1000 years to reach the Soul Transformation stage. The consequences for failure are the same.Ye Zizai coldly replied to Luo Sha\u2019s question. \u201cAdai is not even at the Core Formation stage yet, so what does he have to do with you? He is also my junior apprentice brother\u2019s disciple, so as long as I\u2019m still around, I\u2019ll guarantee his safety.\u201d As he was speaking, he felt pressure from the figure in the air, He then said, word for word, \u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone to harm him! Anyone!\u201dLuo Sha let out a laugh. His eyes lit up as he said, \u201cYe Zizai, Adai\u2019s body is very good. He would be a good candidate for you to posses.\u201dYe Zizai let out a cold snort. He indeed did have this idea in mind. When he first saw Adai, he decided that he was going to prepare Adai\u2019s body for himself.The figure faintly smiled and said, \u201cThat brat Wang Lin has a weird cultivation method. He has a hint of the true Underworld cultivation method about him. No matter how he cultivated, he would make an excellent furnace. Ye Zizai, you still haven\u2019t answered my question; why you didn\u2019t seal part of his soul earlier?\u201dYe Zizai closed his eyes and said, \u201cAdai is not my only choice. Including Wang Lin, I have several possible candidates. Also, I haven\u2019t decided on who will be the host and who will be the corpse puppet yet. I won\u2019t seal part of their soul before they reach the Core Formation stage because once I seal a part of their soul, they will be recorded within the Corpse Sect. If they get taken by someone else, then I would have done all this work for nothing.\u201d Ye Zizai didn\u2019t care if Luo Sha knew. He was doing all of this to create a path for himself. In a way, it was him admitting defeat to Luo Sha and allowing Luo Sha to possess his body.With that, he opened his eyes and added, \u201cThe clean up of the foreign battleground is about to start. I believe the tokens will be passed out in a few days.\u201dThe figure licked his lips and laughed with a hoarse voice. \u201cThis time, after the messenger from the cultivation union opens up the portal to the foreign battleground, I only need to absorb three breaths of spiritual energy to finish the possession. Ye Zizai, according to my agreement with the Corpse Sect, once I possess you, I\u2019ll keep your consciousness intact. Once you have decided on a candidate, I\u2019ll help you once in exchange for your body and raise that person\u2019s cultivation to the Core Formation stage to make it easier for you to possess them.\u201dAfter Ye Zizai found out the secret of the Corpse Sect, he knew that this day would come. The clean up of the foreign battleground every 100 years is the time where a majority of people complete their possession. Ye Zizai secretly sighed. He closed his eyes and no longer spoke.As for Wang Lin, he quickly moved with Mu Rong through the caves. Wang Lin could clearly feel that they were going deeper underground. The father they went, the more clearly he could feel the Yin energy coming from underground.After a long time, Mu Rong stopped before a cave. He looked enviously at Wang Lin and said, \u201cAncestor, this is the cave prepared for you by the first Ancestor. This is one of the best cultivation spots in the Corpse Sect.\u201dAfter a few exchanges with Wang Lin, he entered the room. The cave was only 1/5th the size of the cave Mu Rong was in. There was a thick layer of ice on the ground that was emitting a blue light, making the room look very strange.There were countless tiny holes on the walls. Slivers of Yin energy came out of them.Aside from that, the cave was empty. Wang Lin squatted down and touched the ground. Suddenly, Yin energy entered his body, but the instant it entered, it turned into white gas and disappeared within his body.Wang Lin\u2019s expression changed. The Yin energy in his body had far surpassed the Yin energy from the ground.Wang Lin sat on the ground. His hands formed seals according to the technique recorded inside the jade. He sent out the technique while spreading out his divine sense. The walls in the cave started to move strangely until all of the holes were closed.The entire cave was now a sealed area.Wang Lin looked around and began to ponder. He was forced to join the Corpse Sect because back in the ruin, if he hadn\u2019t entered the transfer array, he would have gotten mixed in with the battle between the corpse puppet and Wu Yu.From the looks of things now, it seemed that Wu Yu wasn\u2019t lying. This place was very fitting for cultivating the Underworld Ascension Method. But just from being here, Wang Lin felt a sense of danger, especially from Ye Zi. Although his expression was kind, Wang Lin felt like he was being watched by a poisonous snake.This feeling immediately moved from Wang Lin to Adai the moment Ye Zi saw Adai.Nevertheless, not only did Wang Lin\u2019s caution not decrease, but he became even more cautious. \u201cThis Ye Zizai must have some bad intentions in mind,\u201d he thought.Wang Lin slightly frowned and muttered to himself, \u201cUnfortunately, Situ is still asleep. With his experience, he would be able to see through Ye Zizai instantly. I must find a chance to escape. But since I\u2019m already here, I must take this opportunity to cultivate.\u201dThinking about that, his eyes lit up. His hand formed seals and shot out multiple techniques. Immediately, rumbling sounds came from the small holes in the wall and white gas filled the room.Wang Lin opened his mouth and sucked all of the white gas into his body, but soon, even more white gas appeared from the holes on the wall.The moment the white gas entered his body, it was absorbed by his spiritual energy.Wang Lin revealed an odd expression. Both of his hands formed a seal as he shot out a pillar of light. The pillar quickly condensed into a ball of light.Wang Lin didn\u2019t even bat an eye as he watched the ball of light glow light blue and flash once. His eyes lit up as he muttered to himself, \u201cEarth Yin, ordinary quality rank 1.\u201dBefore he could finish, his expression suddenly changed as he felt a powerful pressure coming in from all sides. He felt like he was losing control of the spiritual energy in his body.Wang Lin\u2019s expression became very serious as he quickly closed his eyes and began to cultivate. Large droplets of sweat fell from his forehead and his body was soon soaked in sweat.At that moment, an enormous rainbow colored cloud appeared in the sky above Zhao. It can be said that it covered the entire sky.The moment the cloud appeared, it was as if divine retribution had descended. The expression of every cultivator below the Nascent Soul stage, no matter where they were, what sect they were from, or what they were doing, changed.Under the huge pressure, all of the Qi Condensation disciples were terrified as they lost control of the spiritual energy in their bodies.All of the Foundation Establishment and Core Formation cultivators quickly sat down to cultivate in order to regulate the spiritual energy in their bodies. Only Nascent Soul cultivators were able to resist, but their expressions changed greatly.In a secret area in the back mountain of the Xian Dao Sect, Punnan Zi suddenly opened his eyes. His expression changed multiple times before revealing a look of ecstasy. Without a word, he disappeared from the secret area and reappeared 100 kilometers away.Inside the area of Zhao, several streaks of light appeared in the sky, all charging toward Heaven\u2019s Tower in the center of Zhao.With how the cultivators reacted, the mortals reacted even more strongly. All of them were kneeling on the ground toward Heaven\u2019s tower. Legend has it that the rainbow colored divine retribution will arrive once every 100 years. It has finally appeared again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 \u2013 Introduction to the Foreign BattlegroundAll of the powerful Nascent Soul cultivators flew toward Heaven\u2019s Tower.Deep in the caves of the Corpse Sect, Ye Zizai\u2019s eyes lit up as he disappeared from the room and quickly teleported away. Before he left, he used his green jade to send out a command to every Corpse Sect disciple.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a few days. Open up the defense formation and kill anyone that dares to leave!\u201dThe Teng family ancestor, Teng Huayuan, was cultivating inside the Teng family ancestral home when the rainbow colored cloud appeared. His eyes lit up and hesitation appeared in his eyes. After a while, he left a voice transmission jade and left.The same scene happened across various major sects throughout Zhao.From the area of Zhao, all of the trails of light gathered at Heaven\u2019s Tower.Heaven\u2019s Tower was the symbol of a country that was part of the Cultivation Union. When a country joins, the Union sends someone to build the tower. A messenger lives inside Heaven\u2019s Tower. This messenger doesn\u2019t interfere with the affairs of the country they\u2019re in and only comes out to settle big problems.Punnan Zi was the first Nascent Soul cultivator to reach Heaven\u2019s Tower. After all, he was the last remaining Nascent Soul cultivator from 500 years ago. His cultivation level was already mid stage Nascent Soul and he was only one step away from late stage Nascent Soul.Along with the experience he got from the foreign battleground, he had a solid hold on the position of most powerful cultivator in Zhao.He was wearing a gray robe as he appeared at the base of Heaven\u2019s Tower. Looking at Heaven\u2019s Tower, the octagon shaped tower reached all the way up to the sky. There were bursts of light coming from the tower, making it look very mysterious.Punnan Zi looked up at Heaven\u2019s Tower with fear still lingering in his eyes. This was the second time he had been here. The first time was 500 years ago, when all 23 Nascent Soul cultivators of Zhao were forced by a rank 4 country to enter the foreign battleground.500 years later, he was the only person who returned.Punnan Zi didn\u2019t even know how he survived these 500 years. There were several large battles every day and life and death was decided in an instant.Over these 500, years he saw many powerful cultivators. These powerful cultivators would only need to move their fingers to kill him.One of the Nascent Soul cultivators from Zhao, the ancestor of the Heng Yue Sect, Punnan Zi personally saw him being swallowed whole by a very ordinary looking cultivator.The more Punnan Zi saw, the more scared he became, and the more scared he became, the more he wanted to break past the Nascent Soul stage. In those 500 years in the foreign battleground, he learned that beyond the Spirit Severing stage, there was the Soul Transformation stage.With mixed feelings, he bowed toward Heaven\u2019s Tower and said, \u201cMessenger, Xuan Dao Sect\u2019s Punnan Zi is here.\u201d\u201cPunnan Zi, you and I can be considered old acquaintances. You don\u2019t need to be so formal.\u201d A hearty voice came from the tower, followed by an old man. This old man was slightly round, kind of ugly, and was wearing a green robe that highlighted his round belly, making him look kind of funny.But Punnan Zi didn\u2019t dare to show any disrespect. He waved his hand and took out a bag of holding. He handed it to the old man and said, \u201cLord messenger, these are some materials I have gathered since I returned. Some of these are materials you asked for.\u201dThe fat old man narrowed his eyes and let out a laugh. He accepted the bag without even looking at it and put it away as he said, \u201cPunnan Zi, you are the first Nascent Soul cultivator from Zhao that managed to return from the foreign battleground since I became the messenger of Zhao. I have already sent all of your information to my sect. They have sent word that if you manage to break into the late stage of Nascent Soul within 100 years, then they will break the rules and accept you as an honorary disciplePunnan Zi revealed a look of ecstasy and nodded.As the two were talking, two streaks of light arrived, landing in an open area. A man and woman were in them. The man looked about 30 years old. He was very handsome in an evil kind of way. When he saw the fat old man, he quickly and respectfully said, \u201cHe Huan Sect\u2019s Chen Huan greets lord messenger.\u201dThe female was very beautiful. She looked at the fat old man and respectfully said, \u201cHe Huan Sect\u2019s Chen Yan greets lord messenger.\u201dThe fat messenger nodded and no longer paid them any attention as he began to chat with Punnan Zi. From his view, only Punnan Zi barely had the right to talk with him.Shortly after, more than 10 people arrived, including Teng Huayuan. The last one to arrive was Ye Zizai. The moment he entered the tower, the fat messenger exhaled softly. He looked at Ye Zizai and let out a faint smile.When all of the Nascent Soul cultivators arrived, the rainbow colored cloud became even denser in the sky. The fat messenger\u2019s expression became serious as he formed a few seals and shot them into the sky.Shortly after, the cloud began to stir and a ray of red light landed from the sky onto Heaven\u2019s Tower. Soon, the other six colors of the rainbow landed on Heaven\u2019s Tower as well.After Heaven\u2019s Tower absorbed the seven rays of light, it shook and a ring of light dozens of meters in diameter appeared from the top of the tower. The ring of light shot into the sky, forming a black hole. Rings of white lightning surrounded the black hole.Looking up, one could see waves of energy spreading out with the pillars of light as the center. The clouds melted like hot water being poured on snow.Gusts of wind appeared from the pillars of light. The gust hit everyone\u2019s clothes, making popping sounds. Most of the people present were early stage Nascent Soul cultivators. All of them backed up a few steps under the wind. Only four people withstood the wind and didn\u2019t back up.These four people were Punnan Zi, Ye Zizai, a white haired cultivator from the Piao Miao Sect, and a skinny old man from the Tian Dao Sect.The fat messenger\u2019s expression became very serious. He flew into the air and respectfully shouted, \u201cRank 3 country moderator Shi Linyi welcomes the arrival of the cultivation union messenger.\u201dA huge head appeared from the black hole and coldly looked at everyone.Including the four that didn\u2019t back up, all of the Nascent Soul cultivators here felt as if their Nascent Souls were about to collapse under that gaze. They didn\u2019t doubt at all that if the person in the black hole stared at them any longer, their Nascent Souls wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the pressure and explode.Punnan Zi was the first to recover. His face was pale. He recognized this figure very clearly. It was an expert of the Giant Demon Family from the foreign battleground. This family of cultivators cultivated by devouring other cultivators. The ancestor of the Heng Yue Sect was swallowed by a member of the Giant Demon Family before they even revealed their true form.The giant\u2019s gaze landed on Linyi and his expression became a bit softer, but he impatiently said, \u201cThis desolate area barely has any spiritual energy at all. If it wasn\u2019t for the damn treaty, I could suck all of the spiritual energy from here in one breath. All of you, listen well. The foreign battleground will open up in five months. You guys of Zhao are responsible for the 100,000 square kilometer area 58 degrees north of the entrance. There are seven tokens there. Same rules as normal; four of them must be broken. Only at most three sects are allowed to enter. If more than three tokens remain after five months, the country of Zhao will lose its right to participate.With that, the giant opened his mouth and seven rays of light flew out of it, landing on the ground and revealing seven tokens. With that done, the giant\u2019s head went back into the black hole, but his head suddenly poked back out and he shouted, \u201cIf you find a bead like this in the foreign battleground, you must immediately turn it in. Anyone who turns it in will be rewarded a Soul Transformation level magic treasure, their sect will be rewarded 10 Spirit Severing stage zombies, and their country will be raised by one rank!\u201d\u201cBut if anyone dares to keep it to themselves, their entire country will be wiped out. Linyi, this is a message sent out by the higher ups from Suzaku. You will get the message in a few days.\u201d With that, his eyes lit up and the clouds in the sky moved to form an image. The image was that of a bead with a few clouds carved onto it.If Wang Lin was here, he would immediately recognize that it was the bead that he had been storing near his chest.With that, the giant muttered a few times and then a giant hand came out from the black hole and grabbed the light pillar at the top of Heaven\u2019s Tower. He shook it a few times and said, \u201cLinyi, I\u2019m taking this seven color magical treasure. I can\u2019t just come here for nothing.\u201dAfter a large rumble, the pillar of light was pulled into the black hole and disappeared along with it. The rainbow colored cloud in the sky scattered and the huge pressure covering Zhao disappeared.The fat messenger\u2019s face became ugly. He let out a cold snort as he waved his sleeves and entered the tower. From the tower came his gloomy voice.\u201cThe same old rule; Core Formation and Nascent Soul cultivators aren\u2019t allowed to join. Bring your Foundation Establishment cultivators. They are your main fighting force. Everyone, go back. The battle will start in 3 days.\u201dThe seven orthodox and demonic sects picked up their tokens. They looked at each other and left without a word. The only interesting part was that the Nascent Soul cultivators of the three orthodox sects all went in the same direction.Tian Dao Sect\u2019s skinny old man viciously looked at the three people that left and said, \u201cFellow cultivators, how about you all come over to my place for a bit?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u2013 The Stone Bead ChangesAs for Wang Lin, after the pressure disappeared, his expression darkened. Ye Zizai had left the moment the pressure appeared. \u201cThere must be something going on here,\u201d he thought.Although Ye Zizai had left, the Corpse Sect was even more on alert right now. After thinking about it, Wang Lin thought that this might not be a good opportunity, so he spread out his divine sense. But just as his divine sense touched the walls, it was blocked. Only the holes in the wall didn\u2019t block him.But the holes were filled with Yin energy and were very deep. Even after Wang Lin went more than 100 meters into the hole, he still hadn\u2019t found anything strange. However, the Yin energy became even more powerful, to the point where his divine sense couldn\u2019t withstand it anymore and was showing signs of collapsing. He pondered for a while. He didn\u2019t act rashly and firstly withdrew his divine sense. He calmed his heart, then formed a few seals as all of the spiritual energy in his body began to work. Then, a layer of deep blue light appeared on his body. After the light appeared, it form a whirlpool that sucked in all of the white gas.All of the disciples that were cultivating inside the Corpse Sect had just recovered their senses from the pressure. They were all in shock as they could clearly feel the Yin energy decreasing while Wang Lin cultivated. Because the Yin energy came from a mysterious place deep underground, they were all very surprised.When Wang Lin saw the endless stream of Yin energy coming, he quickly stopped absorbing it and started to digest the Yin energy in his body.While he was cultivating, he suddenly felt the area where he held the bead turn cold. He quickly took out the bead and found that countless drops of liquid had gathered on it.Wang Lin was immediately surprised. It has to be said that the one weakness of the Heaven Defying bead was that there was no spiritual energy inside it, so he had to drink spirit liquid to keep cultivating inside. But the effect of the spirit water decreased with usage. Only spirit water from dew maintained its effectivenessBut collecting dew was too slow. That\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t been training inside the bead much after he started cultivating the Underworld Ascension Method. However, he had still been collecting dew to use every now and then.Now, for some odd reason, the Heaven Defying bead suddenly produced this much liquid. He could clearly feel that the spirit liquid contained Yin energy and the amount of spiritual power wasn\u2019t any less than that of spirit liquid made with dew.Wang Lin took a deep breath. Without a word, he started to gather the liquid.After he finished collecting all of the liquid, his eyes lit up as he began to cultivate Yin energy again. Immediately, white gas appeared. This time, he kept his divine sense on the stone bead and noticed that some of the white gas entered the stone bead, causing several drops of liquid to appear on it.Wang Lin revealed a joyous expression. Just like that, he collected a gourd of spirit liquid.The gourd had completely changed color. It was now a dark blue that emitted a ghostly light. Even when Wang Lin touched it, he felt a bit cold.If someone else were to touch it, just an instant of contact would allow the Yin energy to invade their body and freeze their blood, muscles, and bones.He carefully put away the gourd inside his bag of holding. As he took out another gourd, his gaze suddenly locked onto the stone bead.There was originally only one leaf on the stone bead, but now there was a second leave that was symmetrical to the first leaf.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. According to Situ Nan, the bead needed to absorb the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Only after that would the bead be truly unlocked and acknowledge an owner.The water element was already full, which was why the clouds on the bead had disappeared. The leaf indicated that it needed wood element.But wood element materials were hard to find. When Wang Lin checked the market in Teng Family City, he found a few, but their prices were all extremely high. And he didn\u2019t know how to make the bead absorb them or even if those materials were enough to complete the bead, so he gave up on them.But looking at it now, there was an extra leaf on the bead. This caused Wang Lin to go into deep thought. After carefully looking at the bead for a long time, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up. He was no longer in a rush to leave, at least not until the bead finished evolving or until he figures out the secrets of the bead.But there were still things that needed to be done. Wang Lin put away the stone bead and his hand formed a seal that shot out a beam of blue light toward the wall. When the blue light hit the wall, the wall seemed to melt. A hole opened up in the cave. Wang Lin went through the hole and went the originally planned route.The tunnel wasn\u2019t long, so it didn\u2019t take much time for him to reach the other cave. Just as he came out of the tunnel, he suddenly stopped as he saw Mu Rong sitting there, cross legged. Mu Rong stared at Wang Lin and said:\u201cAncestor, please go back. The first ancestor left an order stating that no one may leave their personal cave. Ancestor, please don\u2019t make it hard on me.\u201dWang Lin\u2019s gaze swept the room as he nodded and took a few steps back. He turned around and headed back toward his own cave as he thought to himself that the situation had changed.Wang Lin understood that the corpse sect had strict rules, but no matter how strict they were, there was no need to place a mid stage Foundation Establishment expert outside his room.Before, when he arrived, he clearly remembered that the person in that room was a 13th layer Qi Condensation disciple.Thinking about this, Wang Lin went toward another exit inside his own cave. After a while, he came out of the tunnel into a smaller cave.But just as he took a few steps out, he immediately stopped. On the floor of the cave sat a youth dressed in black. He coldly looked at Wang Lin without a word and behind him was a green coffin.\u201cAnother mid stage Foundation Establishment cultivator\u2026\u201d Wang Lin\u2019s pupils shrank as he backed up and left. It wasn\u2019t until he went really far that the youth\u2019s divine sense finally stopped locking onto him.And so, Wang Lin checked all 11 tunnels connected to his cave. Aside from the 5 that were sealed, the other six all had Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding the cave, and one of them even had a late stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.Wang Lin returned to his cave with a heavy heart,. He sat down and began to ponder. All of this was definitely not a coincidence. It was not hard to guess that this was arranged by Ye Zizai to prevent Wang Lin from leaving.Wang Lin frowned. Of the six people, besides the one late stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, Wang Lin was confident that he could defeat them even if they had a corpse puppet. But this was only the first layer of caves. On the way here here, there were over 30 caves.As a result, he is unable to leave in a short period of time, so before he would even be able to make it to the last cave, he would be stopped by the late stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, or even a Core Formation cultivator from the Corpse Sect.Wang Lin couldn\u2019t help but let out a smile. He wished that Situ Nan was awake right now. If Situ Nan was awake, it would be much easier to leave by utilizing Situ Nan\u2019s experience.Wang Lin called Situ Nan a few times inside the bead, but gave up after not getting any response.But Wang Lin knew that if he wanted to leave this place, it was not something he could do in a short period of time. His actions earlier were only to check out the situation.Both of his hands formed a seal and closed the cave. He began to cultivate Yin energy once more. Not only did he have the bead, but his divine sense also entered the holes in the wall.Wang Lin didn\u2019t split up his Divine Sense, but moved all of it as one into one of the small holes. As a result, the range of his divine sense increased greatly.Originally, with his divine sense, his range was 1 kilometer, but the interference from the cave wall was extremely strong, so it was trapped inside the cave.As Wang Lin cultivated, the white gas quickly gathered toward him. His divine sense was like a thin thread traveling through the tunnels in the walls. Although the tunnels were very long, their complexity was even more amazing.Soon, he arrived at the farthest he had ever probed, which was about 100 meters away from Wang Lin\u2019s cave. After his divine sense reached there, it became difficult for it to go any farther as waves of Yin energy rushed forward. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Wang Lin was cultivating the Underworld Ascension Method, which made him very resistant to Yin energy, his divine sense would have collapsed under one wave of this Yin energy.Nevertheless, the speed at which he was probing had slowed down by a lot. After an unknown amount of time, his divine sense had reached 300 meters into the tunnel. The white gas that was rushing toward him came in waves until it almost formed a wall that blocked his path.Wang Lin clenched his teeth and smashed through this wall with his divine sense.The scene before him caused the Wang Lin who had been sitting there cultivating with closed eyes to open up his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 \u2013 Refining the Sword SheathThis was a very large cave with countless small holes on its walls. Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense came out of one of those small holes.In the center of the room was a huge coffin. This coffin looked very normal. In fact, there weren\u2019t even any decorations on it at all, but waves of powerful Yin energy were being released from the coffin. The Yin energy turned into white gas that was sucked into the countless holes.Wang Lin hesitated and observed the coffin for a while. Then, he attempted to check it out with his divine sense and, to his surprise, he entered without any resistance.The coffin was completely empty except for a large hole. The Yin energy was coming out of this hole.The Yin energy was very dense. The waves of Yin energy prevented Wang Lin\u2019s divine sense from seeing through it.In his own cave, Wang Lin\u2019s eyes revealed a determined light. In order to find out where this Yin energy was coming from and why the bead could absorb this Yin energy, he took out the gourd from his bag of holding and took a gulp without any hesitation.Even with Wang Lin\u2019s current physical condition, he couldn\u2019t help but shiver. He was quickly losing consciousness and his body became numb. Wang Lin didn\u2019t waste any time and quickly circulated the spiritual energy in his body to absorb the Yin energy. As he absorbed the Yin energy, his divine sense became more powerful. With the constant flow of energy, his divine sense charged into the hole in the coffin.His divine sense struggled inside the hole and many times the Yin energy almost scattered his divine sense. When he went down 400 meters or so, the Yin energy formed a wall.Wang Lin clenched his teeth and took a large gulp of Yin spirit liquid. He charged through the wall and was shocked by what he saw.An extremely large body was floating in the air. If Wang Lin were to compare his body to this giant\u2019s, he would only be the size of the giant\u2019s finger. On the body were these strange, greenish-purple plants. The plants would move in a strange manner and the body would visibly shrink, but quickly grow back to normal. As the cycle continued, the purple plants rapidly released Yin energy.Wang Lin was stunned. He spread out his divine sense, observed it for a while, and was stunned. This body was purposely left here by someone. Its purpose was to be nutrients for the greenish-purple plants.It was clear that the reason the Corpse Sect had this Yin energy was due to these plants.Even the reason why the Heaven Defying bead evolved must be these planets. Wang Lin felt that this place was very weird because the moment he entered, he had this feeling of danger.Just as he was about to leave, a difficult to understand voice could be heard.Wang Lin didn\u2019t say a word and attempted to withdraw his divine sense, but he was shocked to find out that the Yin energy in the room was blocking him from leaving. Soon, the voice grew closer and closer, until he was almost able to hear what it was saying.\u201cSave me\u2026\u201dWang Lin decisively took the gourd and drank all of the remaining Yin spirit liquid. His divine sense shook as he charged into the surrounding Yin energy. Large amounts of Yin energy entered his divine sense and mixed with the unabsorbed Yin energy in his body, causing Wang Lin to cough out a mouthful of blood. By the time the blood was coughed out, it was already frozen solid.Even so, his divine sense broke through the obstacle and quickly returned to his body. He coughed out more frozen blood as he revealed a terrified expression.He didn\u2019t dare to check again and quickly began to cultivate to regulate his body. After a while, he opened his eyes and began to ponder as he stared at the holes in the wall.Time slowly passed and in the blink of an eye, Wang Lin had already been at the Corpse Sect for four days. In these four days, aside from three days ago, when he explored underground with his divine sense, he didn\u2019t go out at all. He spent all this time collecting Yin spirit liquid from the bead. During this time, the bead went from two leaves to three leaves.According to Wang Lin\u2019s calculations, the total number of leaves should be the same as the clouds from before, a total of ten. Wang Lin also knew from previous experience that each leaf would take longer than the last. If he just continued like this, then it would take years before he could complete the wood element.But the Corpse Sect was not a place he could stay in for long. He decided to check that place out once again to find a way for his body to enter. If he could get some of that plant, he was sure he could make the bead evolve much faster.But the danger of doing this was simply too great. Even Wang Lin was unsure.After pondering for a long time, he gave up on going down there in person. He understood that with his current cultivation level, no matter how careful he was, the chances of him being able to get some of that greenish purple plant were low and that he was more likely to lose his life. After thinking about the situation, he knew he that it was not safe.After he made up his mind, he slapped his bag of holding and an ancient looking sword sheath floated before him.After Wang Lin obtained this sword sheath, he had only refined it once after he stole Teng Li\u2019s foundation. Although he didn\u2019t successfully refine it, he gained some control over it, but the effect wasn\u2019t great. He had only been able to make the flying sword sink 3/5th of the way in.Wang Lin had studied this sword sheath many times. Even Situ Nan said that this sword Sheath was very strange and was more valuable than the small flying sword that went through blood refining.Wang Lin\u2019s eyes lit up as he muttered, \u201cSun Hao said before that he found this sword and sword sheath inside an ancient cave and that besides his master, only people who had reached the Core Formation stage could refine it. There are truths and lies in this. It is not that you can\u2019t refine it if you are below the Core Formation stage, it is just the amount of time and spiritual energy it takes is too great. Once you have reached the Core Formation stage, the fire in one\u2019s core shortens the process greatly. Unfortunately, the blood refining technique can only be used on one item. If it could be used on both at the same time, then things would be much easier.\u201dWang Lin didn\u2019t even blink as he stared at the sword sheath. In order to increase the power of his flying sword, he must try to refine this sword sheath again. Although he didn\u2019t have a core, he did have a cold core from cultivating the Underworld Ascension Method.All of the spiritual energy in his body was managed by the cold core in his body. Wang Lin had studied it for a while, but Situ Nan once told him that a cold core was far from a real core and that unless it was a last resort, his cold core shouldn\u2019t leave his body. After the cold core leaves the body for a period of time, it dissipates, meaning that he would have to form another one.The first time he refined the sword sheath was when he first entered the Foundation Establishment stage. Now that he has cultivated the Underworld Ascension Method, not to mention the change in quality of his spiritual energy, his spiritual energy itself had also increased greatly. He was now at the peak of early stage Foundation Establishment and was only one step away from mid stage Foundation Establishment, so it would be much easier this time.Thinking about that, Wang Lin opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of Yin spiritual energy. The moment the Yin spiritual energy touched the sword sheath, a layer of frost covered the sword sheath.Wang Lin pointed with his finger and the sword sheath slowly turned in the air while radiating a blue light. It looked very beautiful.Wang Lin\u2019s hand didn\u2019t stop as he shot out multiple beams of blue light. Every time the blue light touched the sword sheath, the sword sheath would tremble. Gradually, Wang Lin\u2019s hand moved faster and faster, until it looked like there was a stream of light connecting Wang Lin\u2019s hand with the sword sheath and the frequency of the sword sheath\u2019s trembling escalated.Large drops of sweat appeared on Wang Lin\u2019s forehead, but they were instantly frozen and fell to the ground. Wang Lin didn\u2019t have time to bother with that at all as he quickly shot out a few more rays of blue light. Then, he quickly slapped his bag of holding and drank some Yin spirit liquid before he continued to refine the sword sheath.Time slowly passed. After the sword sheath had trembled for such a long time, the blue light surrounding it went on and off. Slowly, a pentagon shape appeared on the sword sheath.After he saw the pattern, Wang Lin relaxed a bit. He no longer shot out blue rays of light and instead regulated the spiritual energy in his body as he thought, \u201cMy cultivation is about five times stronger than before. Situ Nan told me of a method that can force the formation on the sword sheath to appear by using my spiritual energy. Last time, I shot out 5000 rays of spiritual energy before the formation appeared, but I was too tired to continue. This time, it appeared after only 1000 rays. Although my cultivation level has increased a lot, it is still too far away from the Core Formation stage. Situ Nan said before that at the Core Formation stage, only a few rays of spiritual energy would force the formation to appear.\u201dHe took a deep breath. His right hand formed a seal and pointed at his abdomen. His stomach shrank back in as he reveal a painful expression. His right hand slowly rose from his abdomen and he opened his mouth as a blue orb the size of a baby\u2019s first floated out of his mouth.Wang Lin\u2019s face was pale. After breathing slowly for a bit, he quickly pointed at the cold core. Suddenly, the cold core melted into a puddle of blue liquid. Wang Lin\u2019s face became even more pale. There wasn\u2019t even a trace of blood, but Wang Lin\u2019s expression became even more serious as he carefully guided the melted cold core toward the sword sheath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
