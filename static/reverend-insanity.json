    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Perishing The Demon\u2019s Heart Yet Never RegrettedTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cFang Yuan, you should obediently hand over the Spring and Autumn Cicada, and I will let you die comfortably!\u201d\u201cDevil bastard Fang, don\u2019t attempt to resist. Today, all the great righteous sects have joined hands to destroy your demon lair. Inescapable nets have soon been arranged here. You definitely will be beheaded this time!\u201d\u201cFang Yuan, you damn demon, you\u2019ve killed countless of lives just to cultivate the Spring and Autumn Cicada. You have committed appalling sins, the unforgivable and innumerable sins!\u201d\u201cDemon, three hundred years ago you had insulted me, snatched away my pure body, savaged my entire family, and killed nine generations of mine. From there onwards, I regretted not eating your flesh and drinking your blood! Today, I will let you face something even worse than death!\u201d. . . . . .Fang Yuan who was wearing a dilapidated, large dark green robe, was looking around with his messy hair and blood-soaked body.The blood-stained robe was drifting with the mountain wind, like a battle flag which was loudly moving.Bright red blood was pouring out from hundreds of opened wounds on his body. Just standing there for a while and the blood under Fang Yang\u2019s feet soon accumulated into a big pool.Surrounded by enemies, he had soon lost his ways to escape.The result was set. He definitely had to die today.Fang Yuan had soon been aware of such consequences. However, even though death was coming, he was still expressionless. His face was carried a calm countenance.His dark eyes were like a deep old well, which was too deep that one couldn\u2019t see the bottom, as always.The outstanding heroes from those righteous sects who were surrounding him were not the respectable sect\u2019s leaders, but their famous young heroes. Encircling him right now, there were people who were yelling, or coldly smiling, or squinting their eyes which were beaming with alerted light, or frighteningly looking at him while holding down tightly on their wounds.They didn\u2019t make even the slightest move. Everyone was afraid that Fang Yuan who was on the verge of dying would counter-attack.Such an intense confrontation had lasted for about six hours until sunset. The sun was shining its light on the side of the mountain. In that moment, the entire surroundings were lighted up like a forest fire.Fang Yuan who was staying quiet like a statue, gradually turned away.The outstanding heroes suddenly became alerted. They consistently strode back one step.Concurrently, the gray-white mountain rocks under Fang Yuan\u2019s feet had soon turned into a scarlet red color, due to the blood. Because of the loss of blood, his pale face was added with captivating, brilliant light when being shone upon by the sunset.Looking at the green mountain and sunset, Fang Yuan softly said with a faint smile, \u201cSunset on the green mountain, autumn moon, and spring breeze. It is indeed black hair at dawn turns to snow at nightfall, right or wrong, in victory or in defeat, looking back, were superfluous.\u201d [1]When he was saying this, sceneries from his previous life on Earth, came rushing back into his mind.He used to be a Chinese scholar on Earth, coming to this world by fate. He had been struggling for three hundred years then overrunning the entire world for two hundred years. Five hundred years had slowly passed, but it was his glorious days.Numerous of memories from which he had buried deep down inside his heart suddenly lively reappeared in front of his eyes at this moment.\u201cIn the end, I still fail.\u201d Fang Yuan silently exclaimed. He was quite lamented but didn\u2019t have any regrets.Such results, he had soon foreseen. When he made his choice, he had already prepared his mentality.What was called the demon ways, was not cultivating the righteous, but killing and destroying. It was what heaven and earth couldn\u2019t tolerate. One had to see the entire world as their enemy, and also freely act untiltheir hearts\u2019 contentS.\u201cIf I have successfully cultivated the Spring and Autumn Cicada, should I be a demon in my next life?\u201d Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud thinking about that.\u201cYou demon, what are you laughing at?\u201d\u201cEveryone, be careful! The demon is going to counter attack at his last moments!\u201dQuickly hand over the Spring and Autumn Cicada!\u201dAs those outstanding heroes were forcingly approaching him, Fang Yuan outrageously self-exploded with a loud \u2018BOOM\u2019.. . . . . .The continuous spring rain was silently falling, comforting the Green Thatch Mountain.The night was here, with softly cold winds that carried the swaying drizzle.However, the Green Thatch Mountain wasn\u2019t pitch-black. From the waist to the bottom of the mountain, numerous faint rays were illuminating, as if it was wearing a dazzling light band.This light was from one of the huts that was hanging on the mountain. Although they couldn\u2019t be compared with the light from ten thousand houses, it was still a couple thousand.The Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold which was located at the Green Thatch Mountain had added a strong humans\u2019 breath to the secluded giant mountain ranges.In the middle of the Ancient Moon Mountain was a glorious, majestic chamber. Right now, they were holding a ritual Sacrificial Ceremony. Hence, the light was illuminating brightly. (Sacrificial here meant to honor the Gods)\u201cThe ancestors please look upon us. We hope many young men who possess excellent intelligence will appear in this Sacrificial Ceremony, bringing new blood and hopes for our family!\u201d The head of the Ancient Moon Clan was a middle-aged man with gray temples on both sides. Wearing a pure white ceremonial robe, he was kneeling on the light brown ground with his back straight-up. With two hands held together, he closed his eyes, sincerely praying.He was facing a black table. There were three levels on the table to put the memorial tablets for worshiping ancestors. Red copper censers were put on two sides of the memorial tablets. Smoke was lightly fluctuating about.Behind him, there were more than ten people who were also kneeling. They were wearing baggy white ceremonial robes. They were the elders, and spokespersons in the clan, holding different authority powers.After praying, the head of Ancient Moon clan was the first one to stoop. His two hands were put on a straight line, palms laid flat on the ground, bowing. The sounds of foreheads hitting the brown floor slightly resonated.The elderly group behind him also followed with solemn countenances.In that moment, the whole ancestral hall was filled with the sound of foreheads touching the floor.After the ceremony, everyone slowly stood up, silently and stately exited the ancestral hall.In the hallway, the elders were silently exhaling in relief. The atmosphere was relaxing.Discussion sounds started to resound.\u201cTime is indeed flying. In a blink, a year has passed.\u201d\u201cThe previous opening ceremony was as if it had just happened yesterday. Every detail still clearly appears in front of my eyes.\u201d\u201c Tomorrow will be the yearly Sacrificial Ceremony. I am wondering what kinds of new blood can appear at this year\u2019s ceremony.\u201d\u201cHaizz, I hope an A-grade young man could appear. It has been three years since such a genius had appeared in our Ancient Moon clan.\u201d\u201cTrue, Bai Village and the Xiong Village both hadtalented young men appearing these last few years. Especially Bai NingBing of the Bai family. His capacity is really intimidating.\u201dWhen the name Bai NingBing was mentioned, the elders couldn\u2019t help but show a layer of worried expressions on their faces.This person had an extremely excellent capacity. Within the short period of two years, he had cultivated to a level three Gu Master. In his generation, he could be considered the only leading one. Even the previous generation was feeling pressures due to the appearance of this genius.Concurrently, he, of course, was the backbone of the Bai family. At least, he still assumed a personal responsibility of the supreme masters. No one doubted this.\u201cNevertheless, among the young man who participated in this year\u2019s ceremony, it can\u2019t be said there are no hopes.\u201d\u201cExactly. A young genius has appeared on Fang Zhi\u2019s line. At three-months-old, he could talk. Then walk at four-months-old. At five, he could already read and make poems. He is exceptionally intelligent, and brimming with talent. It\u2019s a pity that his parent had passed away so early. Right now, he is being taken care of by his aunt and uncle.\u201cYeah, he is an early boomer. Besides, he also has great ambitions. Recently, he\u2019s written \u300aBring in the Wine\u300b, \u300aOde to the Plum Blossom\u300b, and I have heard the \u300aMelody of a River Town\u300b. He is indeed a genius!\u201dThe head of the Ancient Moon Clan was the last one to exit the ancestral hall. As he gradually closed the doors, he immediately heard the discussions of the elders in the hallway.He instantly understood. The young man the elderly group was talking about was called Gu Yue Fang Yuan (Gu Yue = Ancient Moon).Being the head of a clan, he would have naturally focused on such an excellent disciple. And Gu Yue Fang Yuan was the most brilliant one among the junior disciples.Experiences had shown that one that could remember things with just a glance when they were young, or mature people with innate exceptional talents, were the people that would have the most outstanding cultivation qualities.\u201cIf he could be ranked in a grade A aptitude, he could be compared to Bai NingBing. Even if he was a grade C, he could still take charge of a line later on, becoming the pillar of the Ancient Moon clan. However, such an early boomer that he is, the possibility of a B is not much. He might be a grade A.\u201d Thinking of this, the head of the Ancient Moon clan couldn\u2019t help but slightly smirked, beaming a faint smile.Quickly afterwards, he lightly coughed, then turned to the elderly group and said, \u201cEverybody, it\u2019s not early anymore. Because of the opening ceremony tomorrow, please rest well tonight, taking good care of your mentalities.\u201dThe elderly group was dumbstruck upon hearing such words. Everyone was looking at each other with a gleam of alert hiding within their eyes.The head of the clan\u2019s implication in these words, they had all understood.Every year, this group of elders constantly fought over the younger, geniuses generation with each other until they were bumped and bruised, then flushed with anger.They should take a good rest and waited for the fight tomorrow.Especially Gu Yue Fang Yuan, who had a great possibility of reaching grade A. Moreover, his parents had passed away. He was one of the two orphans on Fang Zhi\u2019s line. If they could have taken him to their line, after carefully nourished, they could protect their bloodline for a hundred years without possibly declining!\u201cHowever, I should say the obscenity first. Fighting still has to be fair. You can\u2019t use any conspiracy methods, harming the clan\u2019s unity. You elders, please remember this!\u201d The clan\u2019s head said with a solemn and concerned voice.\u201cDon\u2019t dare to. Don\u2019t dare to.\u201d\u201cDefinitely remember by heart.\u201d\u201cI will take my leave. Clan head, please, you don\u2019t have to see me out.\u201dThe elders, who were filled with thoughts,slowly left.Not long after, the long hallway instantly turned cold. Spring rain and slating wind were piercing through the window. The head of the clan then slowly walked towards the window.For a moment, his mouth was filled with the moisture from the mountain air, seeping into one\u2019s heart.This was the third floor. When the clan\u2019s head looked out, he could see more than half of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, without lacking anything.In such a night, the majority of people inside the stronghold had already had light, which was much different than normal.Tomorrow was the opening ceremony. It had significant effects on everyone\u2019s benefits. A type of excitement and anxiousness had covered the hearts of everyone in the clan. Naturally, some of them couldn\u2019t be able to have a deep sleep.\u201cThis is the future hopes of the clan.\u201d With eyes that were reflecting spot by spot of light, the head of the clan deeply exhaled.However, at this moment, there was another person who was similarly looking at these sparkling light spots in the night with a pair of clear eyes, carrying complicated feelings inside of them.\u201cThe Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, this is five hundred years ago? ! The Spring and Autumn Cicada is indeed effective. . . . . .\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes were distant. He stood beside the window, letting wind and rain hitting his body without any cares.The effect of the Spring and Autumn Cicada was in turning back time. In the ten oddest Gu rankings, it stood at number seven. Naturally, it was not a joke.In another word, it was a rebirth.\u201cTaking advantage of the Spring and Autumn Cicada to be reborn, going back five hundred years ago!\u201d Fang Yuan raised his hands; eyes silently observed the relatively pale hands of the younger him. Then, he tightly grasped, using his powers to clearly feel this reality.The sound of rain hitting the windows resonated in his ears. He slowly closed his eyes only to open it after a long while, then deeply sighed, \u201cFive hundred years passing by, really is like a dream.\u201dNevertheless, he clearly understood, this was not a dream.----[1] These are the lines from a several Chinese poems. In which \" black hair at dawn turns to snow at nightfall\" meant time is passing by too quickly, one night and black hair have already turned gray.Fact: All the names of the poems he \"wrote\" are the name of several Chinese poems. I think he learned these when he was still a scholar on Earth, then used them now in a world where nobody knew about them. The lines from above are also from a poem which was written by someone else.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: The Enlightenment of Going Back Five Hundred YearsTranslator: - - Editor: - -Legend said, in this world, there was something called the River of time. It supported the entire flow of this world. And the Spring and Autumn Cicada could go against the current, turning back time.Towards such rumor, people had diverse opinions. Lots of people would have found it unbelievable, while others had half-believed or half-doubted.It seemed that no one would truly believe in it.Because every time that a person had used the Spring and Autumn Cicada, that one had to pay with his life, and sacrificed his entire cultivation base to propel the power.The price was costly. However, the thing that made people couldn\u2019t bear was that -- in using one\u2019s life to trade, while the results were still uncertain.Even if someone had possessed the Spring and Autumn Cicada, that person, still, would not dare to have recklessly used it.What if the whole rumor was a scheme?If Fang Yuan was not in a dead-end situation, he would also not have used it so quickly.However, concurrently, Fang Yuan was totally convinced.Because the reality that was displayedin front of him had made him unable to retort. He really was being reincarnated again!\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that such good Gu had called for such tremendous strengths to kill more than a hundred thousand people, becoming the wrath of God and resentment of all men, then suffering countless hardships to be able to refine it. . . . . .\u201d Fang Yuan silently exclaimed. Although he had been reborn, the Spring and Autumn Cicada didn\u2019t come along with him.Human is the spirit of all living things; Gu is the true essence of the world.Gu was extremely odd and innumerable. There was Gu which would dissipate after using it one to two times. However, some Gu could be reused again and again as long as the limits of usage hadn\u2019t been surpassed.Maybe the Spring and Autumn Cicada was the kind of Gu that could only be used once.\u201cEven though it has been gone, I can still refine it again. If I could have made it in my previous life, why can\u2019t I make it in this life?\u201d However, after a while later, Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t but feel a wave of magnificent goals filling his heart.He could totally accept the fact that the Spring and Autumn Cicada had been damaged while trying to bring him back to life.Moreover, he still carried a treasure with him, but not utterly lacking.This treasure was the memories and experiences he had gained in the past five hundred years.His memory contained lots of hidden treasures that no one was able to have opened up before. Being through countless of great events had easily helped him take control of the flow of history. He recalled numerous of people in his mind. Some were secret senior cultivators; some were eminent geniuses, some hadn\u2019t even been born yet. Living through the past five hundred years, he had experienced severe hardships when cultivating as well as gaining various fighting experiences.With these experiences, undoubtedly, he would be able to hold the general situation and decisive opportunities of the world in his hands. If he could perform this well, overrunning the world and recalling the demon\u2019s ruthless svelte would be no problem. Moreover, he could even take one step forward, breaking through newer and higher realms!\u201cThen how should I do it. . . . . .\u201d Fang Yuan was incredibly rational. He quickly retrieved his ambition, facing the night rain outside the window and emerging in thoughts.Imagining like this, a plethora of things to tackle, instantly appeared.After thinking for a while, his brows were frowning even more.Five hundred years were quite long. Those untold things had become vague. He couldn\u2019t recall his memories. Those well-hidden treasures and immortal opportunities were numerous, but the majority of those were at hundred thousand li\u2019s[1] away. Also, it could only be opened at a certain time.\u201cThe critical key is still the cultivation base. The me right now haven\u2019t even opened my Primeval Sea, haven\u2019t even stepped on the cultivation path of a Gu Master. I\u2019m basically a mortal! I need to cultivate quickly, increase my cultivation base then chase after the history in front of me, trying to take advantage of those immortal opportunities, and find a good place.\u201dMoreover, with such many hidden treasures but without enough cultivation, even though if he was to possess it, he still couldn\u2019t comprehend it. On the contrary, it would be as if he was being burned while holding the hot potato, seeking for death.The very first problem that arose in front of Fang Yuan was the cultivation base.He needed to enhance his cultivation base quickly. If he kept on being slow like he had been in his previous life, it would be too late.\u201cIf I need to increase my cultivation quickly, I definitely must borrow resources from the clan. With my current situation, I basically, cannot be able to penetrate the mountain ranges which are full of dangers safely. A regular boar could easily kill me. If I could reach a level three cultivation base of a Gu Master, I would then be able to protect myself, traveling around this world.\u201dUsing the eyes that had been toughened with the Demonic Path for five hundred years to observe, this Green Thatch Mountain was too small. The Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold looked even more like a prison.However, the prison that had captivated freedom was also a place that represented absolute safety.\u201cHum, in these short whiles, let\u2019s train in this prison. I just need to cultivate to the third level of a Gu Master; then I can leave this abandoned mountain. Lucky for me, tomorrow is the Sacrificial Ceremony. From there onwards I can officially open the cultivation path of a Gu Master for myself.\u201dThinking about the Sacrificial Ceremony, Fang Yuan\u2019s heart which had long been covered with dust, suddenly recalled a scene.\u201cAptitude?. . . . . .\u201d Looking outside of the window, he couldn\u2019t help but coldly laugh.Right at that time, the door was slightly opened. A young man stepped inside.\u201cGege[2], why are you standing beside the window when it\u2019s raining?\u201dThis young man had a skinny figure. He was much shorter than Fang Yuan, but their faces were almost identical.Fang Yuan turned around to look at the young man, a gleam of complications instantly beamed on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s you, my twin brother.\u201d He slightly raised his brows. His countenance recovered its normal coldness.Fang Zheng lowered his head, looking at his feet. This was his signature gesture, \u201cI see that gege\u2019s doors aren\u2019t closed yet, so I thought thatI should close it quietly. Tomorrow is the Sacrificial Ceremony. It\u2019s too late, and gege haven\u2019t rested yet, if aunt and uncle knew, they would be worried.\u201dHe didn\u2019t feel weird about Fang Yuan\u2019s cold reaction. From their childhood until now, his older brother had always been like this.He sometimes thought that maybe geniuses were really different from ordinary people. Although having an identical appearance with gege, he himself was nothing better than a mole cricket or an ant. (Meant having no powers)Being born from the same mother at the same time, how could Heaven be so unfair. Heaven gave gege the talents like diamonds, and he was as normal as a rock.Everyone around them, when mentioning him, all said, \u201cThis is Fang Yuan\u2019s didi[3].\u201dAunt and uncle had also told him to learn from his older brother.Even he himself had grown self hatred in seeing his own face in the mirror!These thoughts had been formed for the past several years and gradually accumulated in his innermost feelings. Like his heart was being suppressed by a stone which was getting heavier and heavier as time went on, his head had been gradually bowing lower and lower throughout the years. He had also talked less and become more silent.\u201cWorry. . . . . .\u201d Thinking about his aunt and uncle, Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but mockingly laugh inside.He clearly remembered that his parents had passed away at the same time while they were on a mission for the clan. At three, he and his didi had become orphans together.His aunt and uncle then used the name of being their guardians to snatch away the heritage properties of his parents publicly. Moreover, they had treated he and his didi very harshly.Usually, one who had been reborn usually chose to hide their talents and nurture it in the dark. However, with such difficult life, Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t have any other choice but to display his \u201cTalents\u201d which had surpassed ordinary people.What was called genius was only a person with a mature spirit and soul, using thousands of years of famous Chinese Earth\u2019s poems.Surprisingly, everyone was frightened by these small experiments of his. He then quickly became the center of attention. Under the pressure from the outside, the young Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but maintain his icy expression to pretend and protect himself, avoiding being exposed.With time, his cold countenance had become a habit.Just like that, his uncle and aunt didn\u2019t continue treating him and his didi harshly again. The more people that valued his prospects, the more that such treatments were increased.Nonetheless, this was not affection; this was a kind of investment.The funny thing was that his didi couldn't see the truth. Not only was he getting deceived by uncle and aunt, he even grew his resentment towards him. Don\u2019t be deceived by his obedient and honest self right now. In Fang Yuan\u2019s memory, after being measured to be a grade A aptitude, with constant vigorous training in the clan, his resentment, and jealousy had all been shown. He had also gone against and oppressed his own older blood brother several times.Not to mention his aptitude. . . . . .Haha, the highest one was only a C grade.Destiny always loved to play around.A pair of twins; gege\u2019s aptitude was grade C but then had independently enjoyed the name of a genius for dozens of years. Didi who didn\u2019t have any fame, on the contrary, possessed a grade A aptitude.The results had really opened the eyes of the people in this clan. Moreover, it had also completely overturned the treatments that the two brothers had been experiencing until now.Didi was like a sleeping dragon that suddenly soared through the sky, and gege was like a little phoenix which had just fallen down from heaven.After that, there came the difficulties that was deliberately brought over by his didi, the cold treatment from his uncle and aunt, and the contempt of the fellow clan members.Hatred?In his previous life, Fang Yuan used to hate his lacking aptitude, hated the cold-blooded clan, hated the prejudicial fate.However, right now, as he used what he had been through the last five hundred years to examine this path, the waves in his heart were fearless, without a gleam of hatred.What was good in hatred?Changing his point of views and thoughts for a while, he could also understand his didi, his uncle and aunt, also the fierce enemies of the righteous sects that were now surrounding him, five hundred years later.The weak were the preys; the strong were the survivors. This was the nature of this world.Besides, everyone had their own ambitions. But when they were fighting over the same sacred opportunity, how could one not understand the snatching and slaughtering in between?After five hundred years, he had soon understood. Inside one\u2019s heart, only Immortality could be the main path.If someone was to stop him in the middle of achieving this path, then no matter who it was, it could only be \u2018you die, I live\u2019.With the greedy ambition in his heart, on this path, everyone was destined to be your enemies, you were destined to be coming and going alone and also destined to be facing layer upon layer of killing.This was the enlightenment concised from five hundred years of living.\u201cRevenge is not my goal; demon path is never just compromising.\u201d Thinking until here, Fang Yuan could not help but laugh. Turning to face his didi, he casually glanced at him, and said, \u201cYou should go back.\u201dFang Zheng couldn\u2019t help but get frightened. He felt his gege\u2019s eyes were as sharp as a pointy ice blade, as though it could penetrate his deepest innermost thoughts.Under his eyes, he seemed to be naked in the pile of snow, without any worthy secrets.\u201cThen I will meet you tomorrow, gege.\u201d He immediately didn\u2019t dare to waste any more words. Fang Zheng closed the doors, then greeted before leaving.---[1] Chinese's unit of measure. 1 li = 500 meters[2] Gege = older brother[3] Didi = younger brotherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Please Take a HikeTranslator: - - Editor: - -Bang, bang bang, bang, bang bang.The patrolling night watchman knocked on the clapper with such hysterical rhythm.The sounds were transmitted through the insides of the high pillar houses. Fang Yuan opened his dry eyes, and silently thought, \u201cIt\u2019s the fifth watch of the night.\u201d [1]Last night, he was emerged in his thoughts while lying on his bed. After organizing a pile of plans, he ended up sleeping for only more than two hours.This body had not even started cultivating yet; so his energy was not yet exuberant. Therefore, waves after waves of tiredness had been shrouding his entire body and mind.However, five hundred years of suffering had soon refined Fang Yuan\u2019s determinative will of steel. The thought of being addicted to sleep was basically nothing.Currently, he was pushing the thin silk blanket which was covering his body, neatly standing up.The spring rain had stopped when he opened the window.A mixture of fragrance coming from the ground, the trees and wildflowers suddenly rushed into his nostrils. Fang Yuan\u2019s mind was clear, the sleepiness inside him was totally washed away.Concurrently, the sun still had not risen up yet. The blue sky was dull, a little bit gloomy yet still bright.Spreading his vision, the pillar huts, which were made from green bamboo and trees, along with the mountain ranges had slowly appeared, showing off a layer of secluded green color.A pillar house had at least two stories. These were the special house structures for people dwelling on mountains. Because of the unbalanced and rugged mountain, the first floor was a giant wooden pillar, while the second floor was the living quarters.Fang Yuan and his didi Fang Zheng stayed on the second floor.\u201cFang Yuan young master, you\u2019ve waken up. I have come up here to serve you to wash up.\u201d Right then, from the floor below, resounded the voice of a girl.Fang Yuan lowered his head only to see his personal maid, Shen Cui.Her appearance could only be considered as above average, but she was dressed up nicely. She was wearing a green outfit, with long sleeves shirt and pants. Below her foot was a pair of embroidered shoes; a pearl hairpin laid upon her black hair. A scent of youthful vitality was emanating from her entire body.He happily glanced at Fang Yuan. Holding a basin that was filled with water, she gradually went upstairs.The water was lukewarm, used to wash the face. A willow branch which was moistened with snow salt to rinse one\u2019s mouth. This could clean and whiten the tooth.Shen Cui gently served him, smiles were flashing on her face. Her countenance was lively as spring. After that, she helped Fang Yuan to wear his clothes, and buttoned up his shirt. While she was doing it, she sometimes deliberately rubbed her plump breasts against his arm or behind his back.Fang Yuan remained in his expressionless countenances, his heart was as calm as water.This maid was nothing but being the eyes of his uncle and aunt to watch over him. Moreover, she only admired vanity, and was a heartless girl. He had been deceived by her in his previous life. After the Sacrificial Ceremony, when he had suffered a great fall, she immediately turned away, giving him a scornful look several times.Fang Zheng came in when Shen Cui was smoothing the creases on the clothes on Fang Yuan\u2019s chest. A gleam of admiration and jealousy could not then be hidden from his eyes.Living together with gege all these years, being looked after by Fang Yuan, he also had his own servant. However, it was not a young maid like Shen Cui, but a fat old woman.\u201cIf someday, Shen Cui could serve me like that, how would that feel like?\u201d Fang Zheng silently thought, yet still didn\u2019t dare to think about such lewd acts.The fact that uncle and aunt had specially favored Fang Yuan was something that everyone in this mansion had soon known about.Initially, he did not even have a servant. This was something that Fang Yuan had demanded for Fang Zheng.Even though there was a huge difference in status between a master and his servant, normally, Fang Zheng didn\u2019t dare to disdain this girl, Shen Cui. The reason was because Shen Cui\u2019s mother was Shen Mama who currently stayed besides his aunt. She was also the housekeeper of the entire mansion, and was totally trusted by his aunt. She held quite a lot of authoritative power in her hands.\u201cIt\u2019s good, you don\u2019t need to keep on fixing it.\u201d Fang Yuan impatiently brushed away Shen Cui\u2019s soft and small hands. His clothes had soon been smooth, Shen Cui was just seducing him.As for her, Fang Yuan\u2019s prospects were radiating. There was a huge possibility that he would have a grade A in his aptitude. If she could become Fang Yuan\u2019s concubine, she could turn from being a servant to that of being a master. It could be viewed as one step closer towards heaven.Fang Yuan who had been deceived in his previous life, had even liked this maid. But after being reborn, his heart was as cold as frost.\u201cYou can leave.\u201d Fang Yuan had not even spared Shen Cui a glance as he tidied up his own cuff.Shen Cui slightly pouted. She felt weird and upset that Fang Yuan could not read her mood today. She was about to say something fanciful, but was scared by Fang Yuan\u2019s intangible temper, wanted to open her mouth for several times, but could only have said, \u201cYes\u201d, then obediently left.\u201cYou\u2019re good to go?\u201d Fang Yuan looked at Fang Zheng.His didi was dumbstruck. Standing at the door, he lowered his head looking at his feet, then gently answered with a yes.In fact, he woke up at the fourth watch of the night; he was too anxious that he could not possibly sleep. After secretly waking up early, he went to get himself prepared, although his eye sockets were all dark.Fang Yuan nodded. He could not understand his didi\u2019s thoughts in his previous life, but how could he not know of it in this life?However, exposing him was meaningless right now. He casually said, \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201dThe two brothers left their house. Along the way, they bumped into several same-aged youths. In groups of two to three, they were all obviously heading towards the same destination.\u201cLook, they are the two brothers of the Fang family.\u201d Whisperings could be heard from all around them.\u201cThe one that is coming is Fang Yuan, the writing poem Fang Yuan.\u201d Someone emphasized.\u201cSo it\u2019s him. Expressionless face with an ignorant attitude, I guess the rumors really are true then.\u201d Someone said with a sour tone, full of jealousy, and pitiful admiration.\u201cHuh, if you were like him you can also act like that!\u201d One coldly snorted and answered, hiding his discontentedness inside.Fang Zheng listened to these whispers without changing his expressions he had soon been familiar with such discussions.He lowered his head and silently followed behind his gege.Right now, the sun had already risen with the sunlight shining, casting Fang Yuan\u2019s shadow on his head.The sun was rising slowly, but Fang Zheng suddenly felt that he was only heading towards the darkness.The darkness came from his gege\u2019s shadow which might be something that he could never have gotten out of, for his entire life.Waves and waves of pressure were hitting on his chest, even interrupting his breathing. This damn feeling made him thought of the word \u2018suffocated\u2019!\u201cHuh, such discussions, really if even woods are gathering like a forest, the wind will still destroy them.\u201d [2] Hearing the whisperings from around, Fang Yuan could not help but coldly laugh inside.After he had been found out to be a grade C in aptitude, no wonder his enemies were all surrounding him? For a long while, all the things he was suffering from were harshness, disdain, and cold-shoulders.Feng Zheng who was following behind him had deeply exhaled, he had picked up every single word.In his previous life, he could not see it, but he was now well aware of everything.This was the sensitivity he had gained after having lived for five hundred years.He suddenly thought of his aunt and uncle. They had all planned it well. Letting Shen Cui to be by his side for a closer observation, then sending an old woman for his didi. In fact, there were still lots of differences in treatments which the two of them had received.This was deliberate. They wanted to stir up the grievances inside of his didi\u2019s heart, inciting the disharmony with his own blood brother.Calamity in this world was rather unequally distributed rather than being scarce.He was too inexperienced in his previous life, and his didi was too naive. Thus, they were successfully deceived by their aunt and uncle.From when he was reborn until now, although seeing the situation with the Sacrificial Ceremony was like a bad old practices that died hard, it did not mean that it was totally impossible to change with Fang Yue\u2019s comprehension of the Demon Way\u2019s schemes and wisdom.He could totally have oppressed this didi. Shen Cui was only a young girl; she could be taken care of later. Ha? Even his aunt and uncle, the elders and the clan\u2019s head, he had several methods to strike against them.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to do it. . . . . .\u201d Fang Yuan casually sighed inside.Even if it was his didi, so what? Their affections were nothing significant. Outsiders were just outsiders, if he could let them go, he would.So what if Shen Cui was beautiful, without love and loyalty, she was only flesh and bones. Taking care of later on. Ha? She was simply not worthy.Even if they were his aunt and uncle, clan\u2019s head and elders, they were just passerbys. Why should he be wasting his efforts and energy to deal with passerbys?Ha haSo long as they don\u2019t hinder my path, then take a hike and scram. I wouldn\u2019t even bother to stomp on you.---[1] In old China, the night was divided into five 2-hour periods, with the middle of the third watch being at midnight. Fifth watch = 3.00 to 5.00 AM.

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Gu Yue Fang Yuan!Translator: - - Editor: - -The sunlight was radiating as the sun had risen.Sharp-bladed sunlight easily pierced through the faint mountain fog.More than a hundred young men at the age of fifteen were gathering in front of the clan head\u2019s pavilion.The clan head\u2019s pavilion was located in the central of the mountain stronghold. It was a five-stories upswept eaves building that was being strictly guarded. In front of the pavilion was a large square. The memorial tablets of the ancestors of Gu Yue\u2019s clan was being worshiped inside the pavilion. Each clan\u2019s head had also started their daily lives in here. Every time there was a ceremony or unexpected major event, they would gather up the elder's group to talk and discuss. This was the center of authority of the entire mountain\u2019s stronghold.\u201cGood, everyone is on time. The Sacrificial Ceremony today will be a major turning point in your life. Without any further ado, everyone follow me.\u201d The one in charge of this was the Elder of the Schoolhouse. Although his hair and beard were all white, the healthy Elder still led the group of youth entering the Clan Head\u2019s Pavilion.However, they had not gone upstairs, but rather through a lobby door, going downwards.Following the well-made stone stairs, they were gradually entering an underground karst cave.The group of young men constantly exclaimed in awe at the cave. The underground cave was magnificent with stalactites emitting red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, the seven rainbow colors. When those light shone upon the youths\u2019 face, the neon colors were like illuminating their faces.Fang Yuan was in the center of the crowd. He was silently observing, then inaudibly thought, \u201cHundreds of years ago, the Gu Yue Clan has traveled from the central to the southern borderline. Here, they decided to station at the Green Thatch Mountain. It\u2019s because they were satisfied with a spiritual spring inside of this spacious underground cave. This spiritual spring could produce a large amount of Primeval Stone, and also be considered as the foundations of the Ancient Moon Clan.\u201dGoing forward for about a hundred steps, the surrounding was getting even more secluded. only the sound of water could vaguely be heard.Turning at one point, an over three zhang\u2019s[1] a big spring appeared in front of everyone.The light reflecting from those stalactites had totally faded away here.Nevertheless, in the darkness, the water within the spring was emitting faint lagoon light, and looked like the Milky Way during the night.The water was flowing here from a dark place deep inside the cave. The water was transparent as though one could clearly see the fishes swimming, the water plants as well as sand and stones at the bottom.On the other side of the spring, was a sea of flowers.This was the Moon Orchid that the Ancient Moon Clan had deliberately grown. With fetal like crescent moon, the flower displayed a lucid and elegant baby blue color. Stems that were like jade and sparkling buds, it was as though the pearls were refracting gentle halos when being shone upon by the light.With a glance, the riverside sea of flowers was like an enormous layer of bluish green carpet in a pitch black surrounding. It was decorated with countless pearls.\u201cThe Moon Orchid is the most common food for many Gu insects. This field of flowers can be said as the biggest nutrient medium of the clan.\u201d Fang Yuan was well aware of this point.\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d\u201cTruly stunning.\u201dThe group of youths widened their eyes which were beaming with light, excitedly yet nervously.\u201cAlright, listen as I call out your name. Whoever is called, pass this river to the other bank. If you can head forward, then head forward, the further you go the better that it is. You all heard me?\u201d The Elder finished his instructions.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d One after another young man replied. In fact, before coming here, they had all heard this from their family members or their seniors. They clearly understood that the further that they went, the better the aptitude score they would get. The achievements they might gain in the future would be even more significant.\u201cGu Yue Chen Bo.\u201d The Elder held the list then called the first man.The river was wide yet shallow. The water level could only reach the young man\u2019s knees. Chen Bo\u2019s countenance was solemn; he stepped onto the sea of flower on the other side of the riverbank.He immediately felt an invisible pressure, as though there was an invisible wall in front, stopping him from moving forward.As he was struggling with making his footsteps, a cluster of light spots suddenly appeared on the sea of flowers below his feet. The luminous spots were diluted, displaying a pure white color.The light spots gathered around Chen Bu, then intruded his body.Chen Bo felt that the pressure had significantly decreased in a blink. The invisible wall suddenly became much softer.He gritted his teeth trying to go forward, firmly barging ahead. After three steps, the pressure was constantly increasing. Just like the initially invisible wall, he could not advance for the slightest bit.Looking at this, the Elder could only sigh. He was noting down on one side. On the other side, he said, \u201cGu Yue Chen Bo, three steps, zero aptitudes for Gu Master. Next, Gu Yue Zao Xia.\u201dChen Bo face turned pale all of a sudden. He clenched his teeth, penetrated the river and returned to his spot. Without any aptitude, he could only live as a mortal. His status within the family would also be the lowest.His body was shaking. Such tremendous strike was no different from throttling the hopes of his entire life.Several people looked at him with commiserative in their eyes. But most of them were focusing on the second one who now had stepped on the opposite riverbank.It was a pity that this young man could only go four steps forward. He was the same, no aptitude.Not everyone could be qualified for cultivating. In general, among ten people, it would be good enough if only five of them could cultivate. In the Ancient Moon Clan, this ratio was slightly higher; there would have been around six people.This was because of the ancestors of the Ancient Moon Clan. Also he was the clan\u2019s first head. He was a legendary supreme master; his blood vessel had sustained hidden genetical powers due to his cultivation process. The common aptitude of those that belonged to the Ancient Moon clan was slightly better thanks to the blood vessel that they carried from him.Two zero aptitude disciples in a row had made the elders\u2019 countenance who were focusing in the dark all twisted. Even the experienced and knowledgeable clan\u2019s head could not help but slightly furrow his brows.Right then, the schoolhouse\u2019s elder called out the third name, \u201cGu Yue Mo Bei.\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d The yelling resounded from among the crowd from a young hatchet-faced youth who was wearing sackcloth clothing.His figure was sturdy. Compared to those at the same age, he was much more muscular, displaying a beam of fierce aura.Quickly getting through the river, he stepped onto the shore.Ten steps, twenty steps, thirty steps, faint light was still entering his body bit by bit.Straight to thirty-six steps, he finally stopped.The group of youths on the other riverbank could only widen their eyes and mouths seeing such scenery. The Elder happily yelled, \u201cGood, Gu Yue Mo Bei, grade B aptitude. Come, let\u2019s me see your Primeval Sea.\u201dGu Yue Mo Bei returned to the schoolhouse Elder\u2019s side. The Elder raised his hand, holding the young man\u2019s shoulder, and closed his eyes, attentively measuring. After that, he retrieved his hand, nodded then noting down, \u201cGu Yue Mo Bei, your Primeval Sea is six by six, and can be vigorously nourished.\u201dThe aptitude was ranked into A, B, C, and D grade.A grade D aptitude could become an experienced Gu Master after three years of training, becoming the pillar of the clan.C graded aptitude could become the center of the clan, achieving to level two Gu Master after being nourished for two years.A young man with a B graded aptitude would be much cherished. Usually, they would be trained to become the Elders of the clan. With six to seven years of skill, a level three Gu Master was achievable.About grade A aptitude, only one would have already brought much luck to the entire clan. They would have been carefully taken care of. With tremendous resources, they could become a level four Gu Master in just around ten years. By then, they could be qualified to compete for the position of the clan\u2019s head!In other words, this Gu Yue Mo Bei only needed to grow up. He would definitely become an elder of the Ancient Moon clan later on. No wonder why the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder, could not be able to have held his laughter. Moreover, the group of elders who were focusing in the dark all sighed in relief. After, they sent a look of admiration to one specific Elder.This Elder also had a hatchet face. This was Gu Yue Mo Bei\u2019s grandfather, Gu Yue Mo Chen. His face had soon been beaming with happiness. He provokingly glanced at the elder who was his opponent, \u201cHow is it, my grandson is not that bad right, Gu Yue Chi Lian?\u201dThe Gu Yue Chi Lian elder\u2019s hair was covered with a scarlet red color. He snorted but had not answered. His countenance was twisted.An hour later, half of the group of the young men had stepped on the sea of flowers. There were several grades of C\u2019s and D\u2019s. But, of course, more than half had zero aptitude.\u201cHaizz, the blood vessel is getting diluted more and more. Also, there has not been any level four supreme masters appearing in our clan these past few years to enhance our blood vessel. The fourth generation clan\u2019s head is the only supreme master that had reached level five. But he has perished together with Hua Jiu the monk and did not leave behind any successors. The aptitudes of the juniors in our Ancient Moon Clan are getting weaker and weaker.\u201d The clan\u2019s head deeply sighed.Right at that time, the schoolhouse\u2019s elder yelled, \u201cGu Yue Chi Cheng.\u201dHearing the name, the elderly group immediately glanced over at Gu Yue Chi Lian; this was his grandson.Gu Yue Chi Lian had a small figure. His face was full of pockmarks. He tightened his fist while sweat was pouring all over his face. He seemed particularly nervous.He stepped onto the opposite riverbank. The luminous spots instantly gathered around him; he stopped after thirty-six steps.\u201cAnother grade B!\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s elder loudly shouted.The group of youths abruptly stood up, one after another looking at Gu Yue Chi Cheng with admiration in their eyes.\u201cHahaha, thirty-six steps, thirty-six steps!\u201d Gu Yue Chi Lian yelled, glared at Gu Yue Mo Chen so as to demonstrate his strength.This time Gu Yue Mo Chen\u2019s face was paled.\u201cGu Yue Chi Cheng. . . . . .\u201d Standing in the crowd, Feng Yuan stroked his chin while deeply emerged in his thoughts.In his memory, Gu Yue Chi Cheng was caught cheating during the Scacrificial Ceremony. Thus, he had been strictly punished afterwards.In fact, his aptitude was only at grade C. But his grandfather Gu Yue Chi Lian had faked his results for him. That was why his grade B aptitude had been a fraud.This was really bad. Fang Yuan could think have thought of ten other methods that could be even more perfect than that of Gu Yue Chi Cheng\u2019s. If one's aptitude was a B grade or A grade, that one would be vigorously trained by the clan.But currently, it had only been a short period since Fang Yuan was reborn. With his situation right now, it would be hard to use any scheme recklessly.Secondly, even if he succeeded in cheating, he would not be able to hide it later on when they had started to cultivate. He would have exposed himself.Gu Yue Chi Cheng was different from him. His grandfather was Gu Yue Chi Lian, one of the two who held the most authoritative power in the clan. He could hide it for his grandson.\u201cGu Yue Chi Lian had also opposed with Gu Yue Mo Chen. These two elders were the two biggest forces that could have the most influence towards the clan. To oppress his opponent, he needed his grandson to have possessed an outstanding aptitude. It is because of his grandfather\u2019s backup that Gu Yue Chi Cheng could temporarily hide his scheme. In my memory, if it was not for that unexpected event, no one could have figured it out.\u201dStarlight was beaming in Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes. He was thinking about how to gain the most benefits out of his plan.Exposing him right now would have resulted in a simple compliment from the clan. But at the same time, he would have offended the high authority of Gu Yue Chi Lian. This definitely shouldn\u2019t have happened.During such a short period, he also could not blackmail him. With his low capacity, he would then overturn the situation, unintentionally inviting trouble in.While still emerged in his thoughts, he suddenly heard his name coming from the schoolhouse\u2019s elder, \u201cGu Yue Fang Yuan!\u201d-----[1] Zhang is a Chinese unit of measurement. 1 zhang = 3.33mPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Human Ancestor and Three Gu, Enlightened HopeTranslator: - - Editor: - -The surrounding stayed silent for a while before all the people turned their eyes on him.\u201cThis is getting even more interesting.\u201d Fang Yuan silently smiled inside. In front of everyone, he had passed the river and stepped onto the opposite riverbank.In an instant, he felt a layer of pressure.This pressure originated from deep inside of the spiritual spring. The overflowing primeval qi emitted by the spiritual spring was the cause of the pressure.Quickly, the flower bush underneath Fang Yuan\u2019s feet started to release numerous light spots.Those luminous spots were floating around and then covered Fang Yuan\u2019s entire body, intruding him.\u201cThis is the Gu of Hope.\u201d Fang Yuan whispered inside. Although the one in charge did not say much, he had understood it clearly.Each luminous spot was a thread Gu.The Gu\u2019s name was Hope.There was an ancient folklore about this Gu of Hope.Legend said, at the moment when this world had just formed, it was an uncivilized world with wild animals going on rampages ubiquitously. When the first human kind appeared, he was the Ancestor of Human\u2019s - Ren Zu. He ate raw meat and fowl. Hence, he led a tough life.Particularly with the existence of a group of wild animals called Predicaments. They loved Ren Zu\u2019s meat and always wanted to have a taste of him.Ren Zu didn\u2019t have a sturdy body like a stone mountain or beastly sharp claws. How could he have fought with this Predicament beast? His sources of food were getting unstable. He hid the entire day. Being the lowest one on the food chain, it seemed as if his life was getting endangered.However, at that time, there were three Gu\u2019s deliberately coming to him, they said, \u201cIf you use your life to support ours, we will help you surpass this obstacle.\u201dRen Zu was at his dead-end, he could only accept the demands of the three Gu\u2019s.First, he used his own juvenile youthfulness to nourish the biggest one out of the three Gu\u2019s. That Gu then gave him power.With power, Ren Yu\u2019s life had turned for the better. He started to have a stable source of food and was able to protect himself. He loved vigorous battles and had savaged many Predicaments. However, his pains came quickly. He then realized that the power was not omnipotent. Rather than using it recklessly, it had also needed recovering and training time.Moreover, with the whole flock of Predicaments, he was just a small entity.After learning a painful experience, he decided to use his middle-aged vigorousness and youthfulness to nourish the prettiest Gu of the three.Immediately, the second Gu had given him Wisdom.Ren Zu had received the Wisdom and then started to accumulate experiences after learning about thinking and introspection. He realized that it was sometimes better to use his mind than using strength. Thanks to his wisdom and power, he achieved many things that he could not before, savaging many more Predicaments. He ate their flesh, drank their blood, and used this tenaciousness to continue living.But pleasant hours flew fast; Ren Zu was old now. He was getting older and older.This was because he had devoted his juvenile and middle-aged life for the Gu of Power and the Gu of Hope.His body was withering as he got older. He could not feel happy anymore.\u201cYou human, what can you give us now? You don\u2019t have anything left to offer us anymore.\u201d The Gu of Power and the Gu of Hope coldly left after realizing that point.Ren Zu had lost his power and wisdom. He quickly got detected and was surrounded by the Predicaments again. He was old; he did not have enough strength to run. His teeth were also gone; he could not even chew on wild fruits.He paralyzingly fell to the ground while numerous Predicaments were encircling him. In his heart, there was only depression.Right at that time, the third Gu told him. \u201cHuman, consecrate to me, I can help you escape the Predicaments.\u201dTears were falling from Ren Zu\u2019s eyes; and he said, \u201cGu ah, what do I have left? Look, Gu of Power and Gu of Wisdom have all left me. And I only have old-age. Compared to my juvenile and middle-age, it might be unworthy. But if I offer you my old-age, then my life would instantly end. Even if I am surrounded by these Predicaments, I will still live even just for half a second more. I still want to live for a longer while; even a second is good enough. Thus, you should go. I can\u2019t consecrate to you anymore.\u201dThat Gu said, \u201cAmong the three, my requirement is the smallest. Human, you only need to give me your heart. That is enough.\u201d\u201cEven if I give you my heart, Gu ah, what could you give me?\u201d Ren Zu said, \u201cThis is an impasse. Even if the Gu of Power and Wisdom had both returned to me, they still could not change a single thing.\u201dCompared with the Gu of Power, this Gu was the weakest. It was just a luminous spot. It was also the dimmest in contrast with the Gu of Wisdom. This Gu could only emit faint white light and did not have any bit of gorgeousness or magnificence.However, after the human had offered his heart to the Gu, this thread of Gu suddenly burst out stunning light, illuminating the entire surroundings. The flock of Predicaments scarily yelled, \u201cThis is the Gu of Hope, quickly retreat. We Predicaments are most afraid of hope.\u201dThe group of Predicaments then terrifyingly ran away.Ren Zu widened his eyes. From this moment onwards, he knew -- confronting those Predicaments, he just needed to give his heart to the Gu of Hope.Concurrently, the Gu of Hope had gathered and turned into a group of light beams, intruding Fang Yuan\u2019s body.Due to external pressure, they had quickly come together to Fang Yuan\u2019s stomach, stayed at three cun\u2019s[1] below his navel, spontaneously forming a cluster.Fang Yuan instantly felt that the pressure was decreasing.He started walking, keep heading forward.With every step, one by one, the Gu of Hope continuously plunged up from the sea of flowers, gathered around his body and joined the group of light.The cluster of light was getting bigger as well as brighter.However, the person in charge on the opposite riverbank was frowning.\u201cThe numbers of the Gu of Hope seems to be quite little.\u201d The elderly group who was focusing on Fang Yuan in the dark could not help but feel solemn when seeing this scenery.The head of the clan had also furrowed his brows. This should not have been the situation that happened to the grade A aptitude.Under the pressure, Fang Yuan continued walking forward.\u201cUnder ten steps is not having any aptitude for cultivating. Ten to twenty steps is a grade D aptitude. Grade C aptitude ranges from twenty to thirty steps. Thirty to forty steps will be ranked at B grade while forty to fifty is a grade A aptitude. Until now, I have walked twenty-three steps.\u201d\u201cTwenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six. . . . . . twenty-seven.\u201d Fang Yuan silently counted inside. When he was at the twenty-seventh step, it was as if a loud BANG had resounded, the group of light inside his abdomen had reached its limit, abruptly fiercely exploded.This explosion only happened inside of Fang Yuan\u2019s body. The outsiders could not recognize it. But Fang Yuan had felt an earth-shaking mystery at that time.In a short while, the hair on his entire body had stood up; pores tightened up, his mentality was like a bow which was vigorously stretched, abruptly tautened.Quickly after, his head was like a void while his body was getting feeble. It was as if he had fallen on a mountain peak that was surrounded by white clouds. The heartstrings inside of him started to loosen; his hair was getting down as the pores on his entire body were opened up.Immediately, sweat began to pour out on his body.This process was neither fast nor short. It came quickly, but also left abruptly.Fang Yuan was dumbstruck but he seemed to have regained his consciousness just after a blink.In the dark, he calmed his mind then went on sensing inside of his own body. He instantly discovered an aperture that had appeared out of nothing, laid between his two kidneys underneath his abdomen.He had success in opening up his aperture!This was his hope for an immortal life!!----[1] A Chinese's unit of measure. 1 cun = 3.33cmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: The Future Path Will Be BrilliantTranslator: - - Editor: - -The vain aperture was mysterious and abnormal. Although it was entrusted inside Fang Yuan\u2019s body, it was in another area discorded with where his organs were. You could say that it was massive, but could also say that it was incredibly small.Some had called it the Violet Estate; others called it the Prosperous Lake. However, the majority of people called it the Primeval Sea Vain Aperture.The vain aperture was round-shaped. A layer of flowing white light was covering it on the outside. This light layer resulted from the explosion of those Gu\u2019s of Hope.It was because of this light layer that the vain aperture was supported and had not collapsed collapse.Inside the vain aperture was his Primeval Sea.The sea water was as smooth as the reflection on a mirror. The cyan color was getting thicker, along with a copper color blazing light.This was the condensed Bronze Primeval Qi that only a level one Gu Master could possess. People called it the Bronze Sea.The sea level only reached to almost half of the vain aperture, only measured to be four by four. This was also the limits of a grade C aptitude.Each drop of seawater was his Primeval Qi, representing Fang Yuan\u2019s congealed essence, qi, and spirit. This symbolized the vita potential that he had accumulated these past fifteen years.Gu Master used this Primeval Qi to incite Gu\u2019s worm. In other words, from here onwards, Fang Yuan had officially joined the forces of the level one Gu Master.After his vain aperture had been opened up, the Gu of Hope had also stopped intruding his body.Fang Yuan had retrieved his mentality before he felt an extreme pressure in front which was as thick as a wall, stopping him from continue moving forward.\u201cJust like my last life.\u201d Facing such result, he could only coldly smile.\u201cYou can\u2019t continue?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s elder who was holding a string of hope left, yelling from the other riverbank.Fang Yuan turned around and used his action as an answer.This made the other youngsters not able to have reacted in time.It started with a WOO; then the whole crowd instantly busted out.\u201cWhat? Fang Yuan has just walked twenty-seven steps?\u201d\u201cSo he is only a grade C aptitude?!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable, he is a genius, how can it only be a C?\u201dThe group of people was like a tempest.\u201cGege....\u201d In the crowd, Gu Yue Fang Zheng raised his head, scarily looked at Fang Yuan who was returning from the opposite riverbank. He couldn\u2019t believe the scene that had happened in front of him. His gege was only a grade C aptitude?He had always thought gege would be a grade A.No, not only him, his aunt and uncle, and many people in their clan also had the same thoughts.But it was hard to believe that such a result would happen!\u201cDamn it, only a grade C!\u201d The head of the Ancient Moon clan clenched his fists. He deeply sighed, disappointment could easily be heard in his words.The Elders who were silently focusing had also frowned. Some of them lowered their heads and whispered, while the others could only face the sky and heavily sigh.\u201cCan there be a mistake in the experiment?\u201d\u201cHow could it be? This method is extremely accurate. Moreover, everyone is staring at him. It is very hard to cheat.\u201d\u201cBut, how can you explain his excellent performances from before then?\u201d\u201cThe higher a young man\u2019s Primeval Sea aptitude is, the more likely he will display excellent abnormal characteristics, indeed. Like intelligence, perception, memory, power, quick-wit, etc. But reserved in this order, showing those characteristics doesn\u2019t represent a high aptitude. This can only be measured by experiments.\u201d\u201cHaizz, too many hopes, too many disappointments. The Ancient Moon Clan is getting weaker generation by generation.\u201d......The icy cold river water had soaked his socks. The coldness was intruding his bones.Fang Yuan was still expressionlessly approaching. As the distance was shortened, he could clearly see the expression on the schoolhouse elder\u2019s countenance as well as the look on hundreds of the young men in front of him.Some of them had a gleam of astonishment in their eyes, others were shocked. People, who were happy seeing his misfortune, were or at a loss for words, or simply just indifferent.The similar scenery made Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but think about his previous life.At that time, he felt as if the sky was falling down on him. When he was crossing the river, he stripped of all his soaked clothes. He seemed to have lost his soul and dropped his spirit. But, no one had picked him up.The disappointment and cold expressions were like a sharp blade, cutting his heart into pieces. His thoughts were incredibly chaotic, but his heart was throbbing even more.It was like falling down on the ground from upon the clouds. The higher that he stood, the more painful the fall would be.However, in this life\u2026Entering the same scenery again, but this time, Fang Yuan\u2019s heart was absolutely calm.He thought about that legend. When the Predicaments came, you must give your heart to Hope.The hope right now was right inside his body. Although his hope was petty, it had far surpassed people who had zero aptitude to be qualified for cultivating.If other people were disappointed by it, then be it. What could he do about it?The disappointments of the other people had nothing to do with him. What was important was the hope inside his soul!Living for five hundred years had let him realized a principle: Being able to chase after your dream iss a brilliant thing when you are alive. You don\u2019t need to be too strict about whether outsiders are disappointed or pleased by it.Walk your own road. Let's those outsiders be feeling whatever it is that they wish, whether being disappointed or pleased!\u201cHaizz...\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s elder deeply exhaled, he yelled again, \u201cThe next one, Gu Yue Fang Zheng.\u201dThere was no reply.\u201cGu Yue Fang Zheng!\u201d The Elder loudly shouted. His voice was resonating inside the vast cave.\u201cA? I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here!\u201d Fang Zheng struggled from his fear. He hastily ran out then unexpectedly tripped then fell down. With a swoosh sound, he coincidently stumbled into the river.Instantly, laughter started to resonate.\u201cThe Fang family\u2019s brothers aren\u2019t anything more than this.\u201d The Ancient Moon clan\u2019s head coldly snorted. He felt tired just looking at Gu Yue Fang Zheng.\u201cYou can throw your face away now!\u201d Fang Zheng tried splashing in the water. However, the slimy bottom made it impossible for him to stand up straight. The results of his effort only brought him more shame. He felt even more anxious as his ears picked up waves after waves of laughter.Nevertheless, he suddenly felt a force pulling him up until his head was out of the water. He could finally regain his balance.As he harshly wiped his face to look up again; he saw his gege Fang Yuan was helping him stand up by holding his collar.\u201cGe...\u201d He opened his mouth, attempted to say some. But it ended up to be a constant choking, leading to violent coughing.\u201cHaha, the Fang family has such a well-matched pair of brothers!\u201d A mocking sound resounded from the riverbank.The laughter was getting even louder. The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder didn\u2019t step out. He furrowed his brows; disappointment was filled in his eyes.Fang Zheng heard a voice coming from his gege as he was stumbling, \u201cLet\u2019s go, the future path will be brilliant.\u201dFang Zheng couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth in awe. The others couldn\u2019t clearly see Fang Yuan since his back was facing them right now. However, Fang Zheng could have distinctly felt the calmness that were in Fang Yuan\u2019s words. As he was speaking, the corner of his mouth was slightly pulled up, displaying a grim smile.\u201cHe is a grade C aptitude, how could he be so calm?\u201d Fang Zheng couldn\u2019t help but doubt.Fang Yuan didn\u2019t waste any other words. He patted Fang Zheng\u2019 shoulders then turned away and left.Fang Zheng was dumbstruck as he headed towards the sea of flowers.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how can gege stay so calm, if it were me, I am afraid....\u201d He lowered his head, unconsciously walking forward. He didn\u2019t even know that he was displaying a miracle performance.Until he woke up, he had already been standing deep inside of the sea of flowers, at such distance, that no one had able to reach before.Forty-three steps!\u201cMy god, a grade A aptitude!!!\u201d The Elder of the schoolhouse shouted.\u201cGrade A, is it really grade A?!\u201d\u201cThree years, and a grade A aptitude genius has finally made an appearance in our Ancient Moon clan!\u201dThe Elders who were silently watching on the side had also yelled simultaneously.\u201cWell, the Fang\u2019s line was originally divided from our Chi\u2019s line. This Gu Yue Fang Zheng should be left in our Chi line\u2019s care.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Lian then announced.\u201cHow can it be? What qualities do you damn old Chi Lian\u2019s have? Remember when you had misled and harmed those youngsters? This kid should be given to me, Gu Yue Mo Chen, to nourish.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen immediately growled as if he had been shocked by a surge of electricity.\u201cStop arguing. No matter who raises this kid, they could never do a better job than the head of the clan. Whoever is discontented, then that one is opposing me, Gu Yue Bo!\u201d The dispirited and disappointment inside the reddened eyes of the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s head seemed to have all been washed away. He was totally going insane now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Nine levels of Gu Master, The Hidden Legacy Hua Jiu Left BehindTranslator: - - Editor: - -A week flew by in a flash.\u201cHuman is the spirit of all living things; Gu is the true essence of the world. There are thousands types of Gu existing in this world. They are innumerable. They live in our surroundings; inside the ore underground, in the bush, or even inside the bodies of those beasts.\u201d\u201cIn the humans consistently reproduced lifecycle, the former sages have gradually discovered the miracle of Gu. People who have opened their vain aperture, and urged their primeval Qi to raise, cultivate and control those Gu, for a variety of purposes, are called Gu Masters.\u201d\u201cAnd you guys, at the Sacrificial Ceremony seven days ago, have successfully opened up your vain aperture, congealing the Primeval Sea. This represents a Gu Master at level one.\u201dInside the mountain stronghold\u2019 schoolhouse, the Elder slowly explained.In front of him, there were fifty-seven young men who were sitting straight, paying absolute attention to his lecture.The powerful and miraculous image of a Gu Master had soon been carved deep inside these youngsters\u2019 hearts. Thus, what the Elder said was all incredibly interesting to them.Right then, a young man raised his hand. When the Elder allowed, he stood up and asked, \u201cRespectable Elder, when I was young, I only knew a Gu Master would be divided into level one, level two, etc. Can you give us more details on that?\u201dThe Gu Yue mastered nodded, waved his hand signaling for the young man to sit down, \u201cThere is a total of nine grand stages for a Gu Master. From top to bottom, it is level one, level two, level three, then all the way to level nine. In each level, it will be divided into Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Peak, four small stages. You guys have just become a Gu Master, Beginner level one.\u201d\u201cIf you diligently cultivate, afterward, your cultivation base would naturally be enhanced. You could then even reach level two or three. Of course, the higher the aptitude is, the more opportunities it is that you have to advance to higher level.\u201d\u201cA level D aptitude\u2019s Primeval Sea takes up about two to three parts of your vain aperture. The maximum stages you could achieve are level one to two. Four to five parts are what the Primeval Sea of a grade C aptitude could reach. Normally, they will be at level two. Only a few could luckily break through The Beginner level three. With a person that gets a grade B in aptitude, their Primeval Sea would be about six to seven parts. They could cultivate to level three or even four. Ranked A in aptitude would have a Primeval Sea that took up eight to nine parts of their vain apertures. Such person will obviously be the most gifted. They are the people most suitable to cultivate. They could even achieve level five.\u201d\u201cAbout the level six of the Gu Masters, they are all legends. I also don\u2019t know the details. Our Ancient Moon Clan doesn\u2019t have anyone who has surpassed level six. But there is a master at level five, and also level four.\u201dThe youngsters all had their ears perking straight up, eyes beaming with dazzling light.Everyone unconsciously looked at the person who was sitting in the front row - Gu Yue Fang Zheng. He was a grade A aptitude. Their eyes were filled with admiration as well as jealousy.At the same time, there were also people who turned to look at the corner in the last row.At the corner beside the window, Gu Yue Fang Yuan was lying on the table sleeping.\u201cLook, he is sleeping.\u201d Someone softly said.\u201cHe has been sleeping for the whole week; does he not even think about waking up?\u201d Another person pouted.\u201cNot only that, I heard that he doesn\u2019t even return home at night, and only wanders around the village.\u201d\u201cThere are people who have seen him, not only once, holding his wine jug, dead drunk outside. Luckily, these few years, it seems the village has already been cleared up, andis quite safe.\u201d Small news started to spread as those classmates had gathered around them.\u201cHaizz, it is absolutely a hard strike. He himself has been a genius for so many years. It really is unimaginable that he ended up only to be a grade C, haha.\u201d\u201cNot only that. Turned out his own blood brother was measured out to be a grade A. Now, he is the center of attention, receiving the best treatment. Didi is in heaven while gege is staying on the ground, tsk tsk...\u201dHearing the discussion was getting louder and louder, the Elder\u2019s brows were already displaying his annoyances.In the whole classroom, every young man was sitting up straight, emanating light of vitality. Hence, Fang Yuan who was lying on the table sleeping became even more eye-catching.\u201cHe is still so dispirited even after a whole week. Tsk, I have certainly been mistaken before. How can someone like him be a genius?\u201d The Elder coldly snorted inside. With these circumstances, he had soon talked to Fang Yuan several times. However, it was useless. Fang Yuan still did what he wanted to do. He slept through every lecture, making the elderly teacher who was in charge extremely angry.\u201cFine, so what if it was a grade C? If he couldn\u2019t even bear such trauma and kept on being like this, it would be hard to believe in him. On the contrary, it will be a waste of the clan\u2019s resources.\u201d The Elder was incredibly disappointed with Fang Yuan.Compared to Fang Yuan who was just a grade C aptitude, his didi Fang Zhang was a grade A. He was the one that should be worthy for the clan to put their great efforts to nourish.As the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder thought about that, he continued talking, \u201cIn the history of our clan, there are many supreme masters. Among them, there are two supreme masters at level five. One was the first generation clan\u2019s head. He also is our ancestor, the founder of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold. The other is the fourth generation clan\u2019s head. His talents are excellent. He had cultivated until he broke through level five of a Gu Master. If he wasn't sneakily attacked by that despicable and shameless Hua Jiu monk, he might have been able to reach level six of a Gu Master. Haizz.....\u201dWhen talking till here, Gu Yue Master deeply exhaled.The youngsters sitting below the platform angrily stood up, yelling,\u201cIt was all because of that cunning devilish Hua Jiu monk!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that our fourth generation clan\u2019s head was too kind-hearted. He had died young.\u201d\u201cI regretted not being born hundreds of years earlier. If not, whenever I saw that demon, I would definitely expose his disgusting face.\u201dThere was not a single person in the Ancient Moon clan that didn\u2019t know of the allusion between the fourth generation clan\u2019s head and Hua Jiu the monk.Hua Jiu the monk was also a level five Gu Master. He was famous among the Demon Way for being a lifelong pervert. Several hundred years ago, he sneaked into the Green Thatch Mountain in an attempt to commit a crime inside the mountain stronghold. However, it had resulted in him being pierced through by the fourth generation clan\u2019s head. After an earth-shaking fierce battle, Hua Jiu the monk was beaten up until he was kneeling on the ground asking for mercy. The fourth generation clan\u2019s head with his kind-hearted nature had intended to spare his life. But then Hua Jiu the monk abruptly rebelled. He sneaked an attack and severely wounded the fourth generation clan\u2019s head.The clan\u2019s head had been enraged. He savaged Hua Jiu the monk on the spot. Nevertheless, he was so heavily wounded that he couldn\u2019t make it out alive. He then soon let go of this world.Therefore, to every member of the Ancient Moon clan, the fourth generation clan\u2019s head was a hero that had died for the mountain stronghold.\u201cHua Jiu the monk.....\u201d Being publicly condemned by the schoolhouse\u2019s elder, Fang Yuan who was sitting in the corner slowly opened his sleepy dazed eyes.He stretched his back, asking without any resentment, \u201cHow did this Hua Jiu monk die? I have wondered around the mountain stronghold for countless of time but why can I still not be able to find his legacy?\u201dFrom what he remembered, around two months afterwards, a Gu Master in the clan who was constantly drinking due to being heartbroken. He was dead drunk then, lying outside the mountain stronghold. Afterward, the fragrance of wine started to spread around, it then carelessly attracted a Wine Gu.The Gu Master rejoiced and wanted to capture it. The Wine Gu frantically ran away while the Gu Master constantly chased after it. Following the Wine Gu\u2019s trace, he discovered a mysterious cave connecting to the ground below.The Wine Gu was a precious Gu. This Gu Master who was still slightly drunk took the risk and entered the cave, following it to the secretive underground. After that, he discovered the corpse of Hua Jiu the monk, along with the legacy he left behind.The Gu Master returned to the mountain stronghold, immediately reported everything he had found. This had instantly shaken the entire clan.Moreover, that Gu Master had gained many benefits from this. His cultivation base had started to surged and lovers who had left him from before went back to him. He then temporarily became the most prominent hero at that time.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I only knew of the news, but not of its particular location At that time I obviously didn\u2019t think that one they I would have been reborn. Hua Jiu the monk, where could you possibly be dead at?\u201dThose few days, he had bought lots of wine, then went wandering outside of the mountain stronghold at nightfall. He wanted to borrow the fragrance of wine to attract that Wine Gu. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t find that Wine Gu. The result had really made the people incredibly disappointed.\u201cIf I can find that Wine Gu and then cultivate it into a Vitality Gu, it would be far better than the clan\u2019s Moonlight Gu. April has come in a blink. Time is obviously not waiting for me.\u201d Fang Yuan deeply sighed. His glance turned towards the scenery outside of the window.There was the blue sky with white clouds floating; the greenish mountain range endlessly spread out. There was a bamboo forest near him.This was the special spear bamboo that only existed at the Green Thatch Mountain. The tall standing bamboo was like a straight line, with sharp and pointy tips like spears.Some newly grown bamboo seemed to have grown further in the forest. The soft shoots that had grown out were covered with a yellow-green color. Pretty and colorful freckles sometimes fell on the branches.The coming spring wind covered the verdant hills, and green waters with a fresh aura sprinkled on the whole world.Without knowing, the lecture was almost coming to an end. The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder finally announced, \u201cNext week, I will teach you guys how to meditate as well as how to look into the vain aperture Primeval Sea yourselves. That means how to sit down and urge the Primeval Qi in your body. Now is the time for you guys to cultivate your Vitality Gu. After this lecture, you guys will have to go to the Gu Chamber, choosing your Gu. After choosing your Gu, you can return home to continue cultivating. When it is time to cultivate the Gu, come back to the schoolhouse. At the same time, this will also be your first examination. Whoever could take the first position would be rewarded with a generous sum of twenty Primeval Stones.\u201dWhat!After that, the entire schoolhouse was standing up and loudly cheering.\u201cWhat would be a good choice for me when cultivating the Gu?\u201d The starlight inside Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes abruptly flickered then disappeared in a flash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Things Are Still There, but The Person No Longer IsTranslator: - - Editor: - -Beside the schoolhouse, they had set up a Gu Chamber. The Chamber was not massive. It was only sixty square meters wide.When a Gu Master cultivated, their critical strength was the Gu.After the lecture had ended, the excited young men started to rush over to the Gu Chamber.\u201cLine up; one group enters at a time.\u201d A raging shout suddenly arose. Guards were standing outside of the chamber.One group of youngsters came in, and then exited.It was Fang Yuan\u2019s turn to enter the Gu Chamber.The Yin and Yang were equally distributed in the Chamber. Separate holes existed in all four walls, one by one, square holes had been engraved on them. The square holes varied in size. The biggest one was the size of a gravel, while the smallest one was about fist-sized.Tools with various shapes were displayed in those numerous square holes. It could be a gray stone basil or a bright green jade tray. Some were exquisite grass baskets or even warm pottery furnaces.Inside of those countless tools were numerous Gu.Some of the Gu were staying dead silent while others were constantly arguing. The rustling noise gathered and became a symphony of life.\u201cThe Gu is also divided into nine stages, corresponding to nine levels of a Gu Master. All of these Gu\u2019s are level one Gu\u2019s.\u201d Fang Yuan scanned around, and immediately realized inside.Typically speaking, a level one Gu Master could only use level one Gu. If they urged a higher level Gu, the Gu Masters would have to pay a great price.Moreover, the Gu needed to be raised. The higher the level of the Gu was, the higher the expense would be. Normally, it wouldn\u2019t be something that a low-level Gu Master could bear.To a beginner Gu Master, if it wasn\u2019t under exceptional circumstances, they all chose a Gu to start cultivating for the first time.And the first Gu to be cultivated would have a significant meaning. They were called Vitality Gu, and was connected to their lives as well. Once it was dead, the Gu Master would undergone severe injuries.\u201cHaizz, I was hoping to use the Wine Gu of Hua Jiu the monk to cultivate it into my Vitality Gu. Anyhow, right now, there are still no clues about where Hua Jiu monk\u2019s corpse was, whether when could I find it, or ithad been already found. To ensure my goal, let\u2019s just choose a Moonlight Gu then.\u201dFang Yuan exclaimed on one side. On the other side, he immediately walked towards the left wall.Leaning in front of the wall, there were countless silver white trays. There was a flock of Gu\u2019s on each of those trays.This Gu was transparently sparkling. Its curved body was like a crescent moon. On the gray tray, it emitted a thread of tranquil and beautiful aura.The name was Moonlight. It was composed of the Gu\u2019s of the Ancient Moon clan. The majority of the members of the clan all chose it to become Vitality Gu\u2019s. Rather than being a natural Gu, it had undergone the secret creating art of the Ancient Moon clan. Finding it at the other places was impossible. It could be considered the signature symbol of the Ancient Moon clan.The differences between level one Moonlight Gu were incredibly small. Fang Yuan casually chose one and put it onto his hand.The Moonlight Gu was extremely light and might be equal to the weight of a sheet of silver paper. The Gu only took up a small place on his palm. It looked like an ordinary jade earring. Looking at the Gu on his palm, Fang Yuan could penetrate through it to see his own hidden palm print.After scanning through it, Fang Yuan put it inside his pocket as he noticed no problems, and then slowly exited the chamber.There was still a long queue outside of the chamber. The young man that saw Fang Yuan getting out couldn\u2019t hold his excitement and rushed into the Gu Chamber.If it were an ordinary person, they would hurriedly return home to cultivate after receiving their Gu. But Fang Yuan wasn\u2019t in such a rush. He was still longing for his Wine Gu which was still nowhere to be found.The Wine Gu was precious. Even though the Moon Light Gu was the signature of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, its benefits towards a Gu Master couldn\u2019t be compared to that of the Wine Gu.Leaving the Gu Chamber, Fang Yuan straightly headed to the wine shop.\u201cOwner, two jugs of old wine.\u201d Fang Yuan scooped inside his pocket, using the remaining fragments of the Primeval stone and put it on the counter.For the past few days, he always came here to buy wine. Then afterward, he would go wandering around the mountain stronghold, in an attempt to attract that Wine Gu.The owner was a short fat middle-aged man with an oily face. He had almost remembered Fang Yuan after all those days.\u201cCustomer, you\u2019re here.\u201d As he was greeting, he raised his thick and fat hand, and skillfully took the fragments of Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Stone away.Moving his hand up and down, feeling that the weight was not too bad, the owner beamed an even friendlier smile.Primeval Stones were the currency of this world, used to measure the value of every good. At the same time, it could be utilized as it condensed the essence of the world, very efficient for the cultivation process of Gu Masters.Having the attribute of money as well as goods, it was remarkably similar to the Earth\u2019s god. (Don\u2019t forget he was a scholar on Earth before coming to this world) On Earth, there used to be a gold standard system. Whereby in this world, it would be the Primeval Stone standard system.Primeval Stones could be compared to gold. Hence, the demand for the Primeval Stones was astonishing.Anyhow, an exceeded amount of the Primeval Stone still couldn\u2019t bear Fang Yuan\u2019s consuming speed.\u201cTwo jugs a day, seven days in a row. The Primeval Stone I have collected from before is all gone now.\u201d Bringing two jugs of wine outside, Fang Yuan slightly furrowed his brows.Once became a Gu Master, one could directly extract the pure Primeval Qi inside the Primeval Stone to nourish the vain apertures in their Primeval Sea.Therefore, for a Gu Master, Primeval Stones were not just money, but also an assistance towards cultivating.With a generous sum of Primeval Stones, one\u2019s cultivation speed would be enhanced significantly. This could more or less make up for the lack in aptitude.\u201cThe Wine Gu still doesn\u2019t want to appear and I have run out of Primeval Stones for the wine. Do I really have to cultivate the Moonlight Gu into my Vitality Gu then?\u201d Fang Yuan was quite reluctant.Getting out of the wine shop, Fang Yuan was holding the two jugs on one hand. On the other hand, he thought, \u201cThe schoolhouse\u2019s elders have already said the first one that completes cultivating the Vitality Gu will be rewarded with twenty Primeval Stones. Everyone must be diligently cultivating at home to get to the first place. . Cultivate Gu firstly called for taking used of time. It\u2019s a pity that cultivating the Vitality Gu is extremely challenging in terms of aptitude. The better that the aptitude is, the bigger that the advantages would be. With my grade C aptitude, even if I am to use schemes and methods, there is still no hopes for winning.\u201dRight at that time, Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s voice resounded from behind, \u201cGege, you really did go to the wine shop to get drunk! Follow me, aunt and uncle want to meet you.\u201dFang Yuan stopped in his steps and turned back to look at him.He realized that his didi wasn\u2019t lowering his head when talking anymore.Their eyes met.A gush of wind whizzingly blew by, brushed away gege\u2019s black hair and didi\u2019s robe.Within the short period of a month, things were still there, but the person no longer was.The week before the Sacrificial Ceremony, the differences were significant whether for gege or didi.Fang Yuan gege fell down from the cloud high above; the genius aureole was heartlessly snatched away by the other. And didi started to burst out his halo, like a new star, gradually rising.Towards the didi Gu Yue Fang Zheng, such chances were like shaking the sky and earth.He could finally experience what his gege was feeling before. He was the hope of the others, was being looked at with either admiration or jealousy.He felt like he himself who was staying in a dark corner was suddenly brought out to a paradise full of sunlight.He woke up every day feeling as if he was being in a beautiful dream. Treatments different like night and day made it quite unbelievable for him, until now. At the same time, he also felt unwell.Couldn\u2019t adapt.He went straight from being nameless to becoming the center of attention, being focused on and pointed at by people.Sometimes, Fang Zheng would feel that his face was boiling, bewildered as he picked up the discussion from the passerbys on the street, complimenting him. He constantly averted his eyes, almost to the point of not knowing how to walk!Before, in ten days, Gu Yue Fang Zheng had unknowingly lost weight. Nonetheless, his mentality was getting even more fulfilled.In the deepest part of his innermost feelings, a feeling called \u2018confidence\u2019 gradually grew.\u201cThis is what gege was feeling before. It really is awesome yet bitter!\u201d He also couldn\u2019t help thinking about how his gege Gu Yue Fang Yuan had faced these discussions and attention from before.He unconsciously started to imitate Fang Yuan. He pretended to remain an expressionless countenance, but then quickly realized that he himself was not a lump of clay.Sometimes, a female shout in the schoolhouse would make his face reddened. On the road, whenever those aunties were trying to tease him, he would instantly run for his life.He was like a baby who was learning how to walk, slowly stumbling to adapt to his new life.In this process, he also couldn\u2019t avoid hearing rumors about his gege -- dispirited, a drinker, and didn\u2019t come home for several days but slept outside on the roads.In the beginning, he was terrified. His own gege, such a formidable genius existence, how could he have turned out like that?!But slowly, he started to understand. Gege was a normal person. Facing such setbacks and obstacles, being dispirited was a certain fact.Using such explanations, Fang Zheng vaguely felt an indescribable feeling of rejoice.This kind of happiness was something that he didn\u2019t admit as to having, but it existed.The gege who was being praised as a genius had used to be the shadow that suppressed him. But now, he had become so demoralized. Looking at such aspects, it had proved his maturity, hadn\u2019t it?I am excellent; this is the truth!Hence, looking at Fang Yuan who was holding the wine jugs with messy hair and clothes, Gu Yue Fang Zheng sighed out in relief inside. His breathing unknowingly became more comfortable.However, he said on the outside, \u201cGege, you can\u2019t continue drinking, you can\u2019t keep going down like this. You don\u2019t know how much the people who care for you are worried; you need to wake up and stand up!\u201dFang Yuan\u2019s countenance didn\u2019t change; he refused to open his mouth.They stared at each other.The light was beaming in his didi Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes, displaying a gleam of sharpness. On the other side, gege Fang Yuan\u2019s pupils were pitch black, like a secluded ancient swamp.Those pupils brought Fang Zheng an unfathomable pressure. After a short while of confrontation, he instinctively averted his eyes, looking to the side.However, when he was finally able to react, he felt a fierce rage boiling in his heart.He was enraged at himself.What\u2019s wrong with me? I don\u2019t even have the courage to face my gege?I want to change; I want a complete change!With that thought, he once again looked straight with his sharp pair of eyes.However, Fang Yuan had soon stopped looking at him. He held the jug with his hand and went by Fang Zheng. A calm-voice arose, \u201cWhat are you standing there for, let\u2019s go.\u201dFang Zheng\u2019s breathing was disorderly. The tone that was accumulated in his heart didn\u2019t have a place to burst out. This had made him feel unutterably gloomy.Looking at gege who had soon left, he reluctantly followed behind him.At this moment, he didn\u2019t lower his head but raised it up to face the sunlight.He then stared attentively at his foot, which was stamping on his gege Fang Yuan\u2019s shadow with every step that he made.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Getting FurtherTranslator: - - Editor: - -The red sun in the West still hadn\u2019t completely descended yet.The sky, without a single beam of light, was covering every single living entities with a layer of gray. Looking out from the window, the mountains from afar seemed to lean towards a dull, hazy black hue.Inside the dim living room, his aunt and under were sitting in the master position. Their countenances seemed to be shrouded by a layer of shadow; one could only vaguely read their expressions.Looking at Fang Yuan who was holding two jugs of wine while coming over, his uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu annoyingly twisted his brows then said, \u201cTime sure is flying. You guys are all fifteen now. Moreover, you both have an aptitude for being Gu Master. Especially Fang Zheng, uncle and aunt are very proud of you guys. I will give you guys six Primeval Stones each; you brothers should take it. Cultivating Gu wastes lots of Primeval Essence. These Primeval Stones will be what you need.\u201dAfter he had finished, a servant came over, giving Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng each a small pouch.Fang Yuan retrieved the pouch, and kept being silent.Fang Zheng immediately opened the pouch as soon as he saw it. Inside was six ash gray color Primeval Stones. A grateful expression immediately beamed on his countenance. He stood up from where he was standing, gesturing to his aunt and uncle,\u201cMany thanks, aunt and uncle, nephew really does need Primeval Stones to enhance my Primeval Essence. You guys have raised me till now, such foster favor that I will always remember, and won\u2019t dare to forget for my whole life!\u201dHis uncle smilingly nodded while his aunt hurriedly waved her hands, and gently said to him,\u201cSit down, sit down quickly. You two brothers might not be our blood sons, but we\u2019ve raised you guys up as if we were raising our own children. Seeing you guys having such bright future, we also feel proud. Haizz, we don\u2019t have any kids. Sometimes I thought it would be great if you guys can be my children.\u201dSuch deep implications, though Fang Zheng couldn\u2019t realize it, but Fang Yuan slightly furrowed his brows.Undoubtedly his uncle spoke up, \u201cI have spoken with your aunt. We want to adopt you guys to our house, officially becoming our family members. Fang Zheng, are you willing to?\u201dFang Zheng was dumbstruck for a while, but happiness was quickly displayed on his visage. He agreed, \u201cTruthfully speaking, since my parents died, nephew always longed for the day that our family can be reunited. Being able to become family members with aunt and uncle is incredibly splendid!\u201dAunty\u2019s expression was getting more tranquil, she laughed, \u201cYou are our good kids now, and still calls us aunt and uncle?\u201d\u201cFather, mother.\u201d Fang Zhen shook, hastily changed his words.His aunt and uncle both laughed out loud.\u201cGood child, it really isn\u2019t wasted that we have taken you in since you were five, then raised you for ten years straight.\u201d His aunt wiped her tears.His uncle looked at the silent Fang Yuan, and gently said, \u201cFang Yuan, how about you?\u201dFang Yuan shook his head, didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cGege\u201d Gu Yue Fang Zheng wanted to persuade him as his uncle stopped him.Using a consistent tone, his uncle said, \u201cIf it is like this, nephew Fang Yuan, we won\u2019t force you. You are already fifteen. You should be independent right now; it will also be better to inherit the Fang family\u2019s line later on. I have also prepared two hundred Primeval Stones, considered it as my aid.\u201d\u201cTwo hundred Primeval Stones!\u201d Fang Zheng instantly widened his eyes. He couldn\u2019t help but show his admiration as he had never seen such many Primeval Stones before.However, Fang Yuan shook his head again like before.Fang Zheng didn\u2019t understand a thing. His expression slightly changed. Aunty\u2019s countenance was also getting colder.\u201cUncle, aunt, if there is nothing more, then nephew will take his leave first.\u201d Fang Yuan didn\u2019t let them had a chance to talk; he held his wine jugs, and directly left the room as he finished those words.Fang Zheng stood up, \u201cFather, mother, gege couldn\u2019t think straight for a short while, maybe I should go persuade him?\u201dHis uncle waved his hands, deliberately sighed, \u201cHaizz, this is something you can\u2019t force. I\u2019m happy enough that you wanted to do that. Servant, come and help Fang Zheng young master to rest well.\u201d\u201cThen, I will take my leave.\u201d The living room instantly fell into silence as soon as Fang Zheng left.The sun had completely descended behind the mountain, making the living room even dimmer.After a while, a cold voice faintly resounded, \u201cThis rascal Fang Yuan seems to have realized our plan.\u2019One of the regulations of the Ancient Moon Clan had expressly stipulated, The oldest son, once having reached the age of sixteen, would be qualified for inheriting his family\u2019s property.Fang Yuan\u2019s parent had both passed away. The inheritance that was left behind had been \u201csafeguarded\u201d by his uncle and aunt.The value of this heritage was something two hundred Primeval Stones couldn\u2019t be compared to.If Fang Yuan was like Fang Zheng, agreed in being their adopted sons, then he wouldn\u2019t be qualified to accept the heritage. Staying independently at the age of fifteen also went against the regulations regarding the inheritance of the property.\u201cIt\u2019s lucky we\u2019ve lured Fang Zheng, Fang Yuan is just a grade C aptitude.\u201d His uncle exclaimed, feeling incredibly lucky.\u201cHusband, if Fang Yuan wanted to go independent at the age of sixteen, then what should we do?\u201d Aunt\u2019s tone was getting hysterical thinking about that inheritance.\u201cHm, if he is nursing his evil thoughts, then he couldn\u2019t blame us. We only need to catch him making a big problem before he can independently leave, then expel him from the family. This will also deprive him of his qualifications in receiving the inheritance.\u201d His uncle coldly snorted.\u201cBut this Fang Yuan really is a rascal. He is really cunning, how could he possibly allow himself to make such a big mistake?\u201d Aunt was confused.Uncle immediately glared, he lowered his tone, berating, \u201cStupid! If he doesn\u2019t make any mistakes, then couldn\u2019t we frame him? Let\u2019s let that maid Shen Cui seduce Fang Yuan then accuse him of molesting her afterwards. Either human or object evidence is all in our hands, we could blame him for being drunk then going insane. You are still afraid that we couldn\u2019t expel him?\u201d\u201cHusband really does have a method, such wise schemes!\u201d Aunt couldn\u2019t help but felt rejoiced.The night scene had fallen. The starry night was being shielded more than half by those floating black clouds. Light started to light up in the homes of the families on the mountain stronghold.Gu Yue Fang Zhen was led to a room.\u201cFang Zheng young master, this is the room that master has specially ordered to rearrange for you.\u201d Shen Mama carefully introduced. She bowed, expression was full of a flattering smile.Fang Zheng looked around; light was beaming in his eyes. This room was double the size of his old room. In the middle was laid a massive bed. Beside the window sill was a sandalwood table and on it were arranged exquisite papers and brushes. Refined ornaments were hung on all four walls. Moreover, the ground below his feet wasn\u2019t ordinary; it was covered with a layer of soft handwork carpet.From when he was young until now, Fang Zheng had never lived in such a room. He continuously nodded, \u201cThis is excellent, really is not bad. Much thanks, Shen Mama.\u201dThis Shen Mama was regarded highly by his aunt. She was the one managing every servant in the family, worthy of the name of the housekeeper.Shen Cui, the maid beside Fang Yuan, was her daughter.Shen Mama laughed out loud, \u201cTo what extent did I do it to deserve your thanks. It is what I should do!\u201d Young master, please take a good rest. If you want anything, just shake that bell beside your bed, and a servant will immediately be here to serve you immediately. Master has said, young master only needs to put his heart into cultivating, giving those errands for the servants to do.\u201dGratefulness once again busted out from Fang Zheng\u2019s heart. He didn\u2019t say a word, just silently determined inside, I need to get the first rank. I can\u2019t let aunt and uncle be disappointed!.........The darkness was becoming dull as black clouds in the sky were getting denser and denser. The starry night seemed to be completely covered by those clouds. Small stars emitting faint light were struggling in the sky.\u201cAunt and uncle must have gathered forces to think about how to expel me out from the family. In my past life, they silently ordered a servant to provoke then put the blame on me. Resulted in expelling me out of the family. Who knows what changes could there be in this life.\u201d Fang Yuan who was walking on the street coldly laughed inside.He had soon discovered aunt and uncle\u2019s real intention.Nonetheless, he could also understand.\u2018Human beings die in pursuit of wealth and birds die in pursuit of food\u2019. No matter whether it was on Earth or in this world, there would always be people who would stomp on family, friendship, and love for their own benefits.In fact, there was no family. When aunt and uncle adopted Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng, their basic purpose was to cover up the inheritance. It was just because Fang Yuan and Fang Zhen had kept on bringing them surprises.\u201cEverything\u2019s got off to a rough start, especially for me. Firstly, I don\u2019t have an excellent aptitude. Secondly, I have no teacher to keep an eye on me. This is equaled to starting from scratch. The inheritance from my parents could be viewed as a springboard for me. I have wasted two years to get to Peak stage of level one when aunt and uncle have had snatched away my inheritance in my previous life. This time, I cannot make the same mistake.\u201dFang Yuan kept on walking while thinking like that.He didn\u2019t stay in one place, but bringing along two jugs of wine, heading towards the outer perimeters of the village.The nightfall was getting quieter. Black clouds had hidden those starlights. the wind that was loudly breezing by had turned more and more fierce.A storm was coming.Still, he wanted to try. He needed to wait until next year when he reached the age of sixteen to retrieve the inheritance that was rightfully his. The legacy left behind by Hua Jiu the monk was the thing he was capable of having right now.There were only a few people who were walking on the street. The houses on both sides were emanating faint light. Fragments of rubbish, dust, and tree leaves were freely floating along with the wind.Fang Yuan\u2019s thin clothes couldn\u2019t block the mountain wind. He couldn\u2019t help but felt a wave of coldness rushing in.He simply opened one wine jug, taking a sip. Although it was just unfiltered rice wine, a gleam of warmness suddenly raised up in his body as he swallowed the wine.This was the first time he had ever drunk wine.As he was leaving the mountain stronghold, the houses on both sides of the street were getting more and more thinly scattered, as well as those rays of light.In front was a pitch black layer. The forest was suppressed by that strong wind; branches were swaying non-stop in the darkness. The swishing sound was as if a flock of beasts were shrieking vigorously.Fang Yuan didn\u2019t show the slightest hesitation in his footsteps. As he exited the grand gates of the mountain stronghold, he gradually approached the endless dark path.And behind him right now was the glorious bright light from thousand of houses.Under the light was a warm corner.Gu Yue Fang Zheng sat in front of this table, noting down what he had learned in the previous lecture. Inside a bright room filled with light, solid walls prevented those cold winds, beside his hand was a warm cup of ginseng tea, with steam faintly being hoisted.\u201cYoung master Fang Zheng, warm water for your bath is ready.\u201d Outside the door, Shen Cui\u2019s gentle tone resounded.Fang Zheng felt his heart shook, \u201cTake it in.\u201dShen Cui was swaying her waist, stepping inside the room with a flirty expression.\u201cServant greets young master Fang Zheng.\u201d Her beautiful pair of eyes glanced over at Fang Zheng. Fang Yuan was a grade C aptitude, but Fang Zheng was an A grade. Being able to climb above him, was true wealth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Fortune as Unpredictable as Weather, Cultivating Gu Different from Hardship.Translator: - - Editor: - -Pitter-patter...Heavy raindrops were intensively falling to the ground, hitting on the verdant bamboo houses resonating crisp sounds.Those raindrops were attacking the water surface of the pond in front of the house. Inside the water, fishes were happily swimming back and forth while the water ferns were slightly swaying.The sky was overcast. The whole vision was being covered by a thick layer of rain.Inside the dim room, with his windows opened, Fang Yuan silently looked at the heavy storm, deeply sighed inside, \u201cIt\u2019s been three nights and three days.\u201dThree days before tonight, he was still searching around the mountain stronghold while holding his two jugs of wine.However, the heavy rain suddenly came at midnight.Not to mention that he was completely soaked, but with these circumstances, there was no way he could continue his search.The rain could quickly wash away the fragrance of wine. At the same time, if he was still determined in continuing his search even under the heavy rain, it would make others people suspect his actions.Before, he had pretended to be a drunkard in order to hide his true intentions. Nevertheless, he absolutely should not have underestimated other people\u2019s intelligence. Normally, only stupid people would have thought that others were like them.At a dead-end, Fang Yuan could only stop his search.And this rain, once started, seemed like it was endless. It was either light or heavy, diluted or dense, but had never stopped.\u201cJust like this, I won\u2019t be able to find the Wine Gu for a short while. To ensure that I will be able to achieve my goal, right now I should first refine the Moonlight Gu. Along the process, it will be best if I could find the Wine Gu, but if not, then I could only accept it. Nonetheless, this is normal; fortune is as unpredictable as the weather anyway. In this world, how could there be someone who could sail with the wind perfectly without any flaws?\u201d Fang Yuan maintained a steady emotion. Five hundred years had soon erased the little impulsiveness in his characteristics.He closed the doors and windows, then sat cross-legged on his bed, slowly closed both of his eyes and calmed his breathing, he then immersed in his mind.In a second, the scenery of his vain aperture appeared in his head.Although his vain aperture was attached to his body, it was exceptionally profound. It could be extremely small yet incredibly big.Covering the vain aperture on the outside was a layer of light. The white light layer had brought others a very weak feeling, but it was what had supported the vain aperture.Inside the vain aperture was his Primeval Essence Sea.The water had a bronze color. Its surface was as calm as a mirror\u2019s. The water level was about half of the vain aperture. The total volume that the Primeval Sea had taken up was about forty-four percent of the vain apertures.This was the Bronze Primeval Essence of a level one Gu Master. Each of the water drops were all Primeval Essences. They were the Primeval power of Fang Yuan\u2019s vitality, as well as his condensed essence, qi, soul.Each of those Primeval drops were absolutely precious, as it was the foundations of a Gu Master and their Primeval power. A Gu Master\u2019s ability to cultivate and urge the Gu were depended on this Primeval Essence.As his mind left the Primeval Sea, Fang Yuan opened his eyes, taking the Moonlight Gu out of his bosom.The Moonlight Gu silently laid on Fang Yuan\u2019s palm, like a curved blue moon, stunning yet refined, emanating dazzling light.As Fang Yuan\u2019s mind gently shook, the Primeval Sea inside his vain aperture frantically twisted. A wave of Primeval Essence broke through the sea surface, left his body, and fiercely entered the Moonlight Gu.The Moonlight Gu suddenly busted out its dim blue radiance, slightly shaking on Fang Yuan\u2019s palm. It was trying to resist the vigorous Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Essence.Gu was the essence of Heaven and Earth, the code for the great path, the medium of principle. It was also a living entity, being born with freedom, and having self-willpower. Right now, Fang Yuan wanted to cultivate it, erasing its willpower. Of course, the Moonlight Gu would naturally resist after feeling such danger.The cultivating process was incredibly tough.The Moonlight Gu was like a curved crescent moon. As the bronze colored Primeval Essence was poured inside its body, it had first dyed the two pointy tips of the crescent moon with a green color.Following this bronze intent, it started to spread out to the middle part of the crescent moon.After less than three minutes, Fang Yuan\u2019s face was already paled. A great amount of Primeval Essence was constantly intruding the Moonlight Gu, bringing him a weak feeling as if his veins were being drawn out and his marrow was being sucked out, attacking his heart non-stop.One percent, two percent, three percent\u2026 eight percent, nine percent, ten percent.Ten minutes later, Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Sea had decreased by ten percent of Primeval Essence. However, the green bronze intent still stayed on the two pointy tips on the Moonlight Gu\u2019s crystal blue body, only expanding to the middle by a tiny bit on the surface area.The Moonlight Gu had surely resisted with all of its mind.Luckily, Fang Yuan had soon predicted this. It was not unexpected. He was then diligently trying to impart the Primeval Essence in that Moonlight Gu.Ten percent, twenty percent, thirty percentAfter twenty minutes, the Primeval Essence inside his Primeval Sea was only left with fourteen percent. The green bronze intent which was expanding on the Moonlight Gu, in total, could only take up about one-twelfth of the Moonlight Gu\u2019s body.The rest of its body still had a light blue color.\u201cCultivating Gu is too tough.\u201d Seeing this, Fang Yuan silently exclaimed. Cutting off the Primeval Essence, he did not continue cultivating this Moonlight Gu.Until now, he had cultivated the Gu for half an hour straight; his Primeval Sea had been wasted by half, with only fourteen percent remaining. But this Moonlight Gu had just been cultivated to one-twelfth of its capacity.Moreover, what had made it hard to accept was that the Moonlight Gu\u2019s body was still emitting a dim blue halo. Although Fang Yuan had stopped his cultivating process, it did not stop resisting, trying to expel Fang Yuan\u2019s bronze Primeval Essence like normal.Fang Yuan could clearly feel that the Primeval Essence that had entered the Moonlight Gu was gradually being repelled by it, dissipated outside of its body. On the Moonlight Gu\u2019s body, the green bronze intent in the two pointy tips had slowly shrunk.With this speed, after around six hours later, the Moonlight Gu could totally repel Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Essence out of its body. When that happened, continued cultivating this Gu was not much different from starting all over again.\u201cWhenever one was cultivating Gu, it is like a war between two parties, a positional warfare, a war of attrition. The Gu have only been cultivated to one-twelfth, but I have wasted thirty percent of my Primeval Essence. To ensure a successful result, when cultivating Gu, a Gu master needs to constantly replenish their Primeval Seas while continuously cultivating. A Gu Cultivating examination does not only require the skill of urging their Primeval Essence, but also their patience in this war of attrition.As Fang Yuan was thinking, he took out a Primeval Stone inside of his pouch.A Gu Master normally had two methods to replenish their wasted Primeval Essence.One was to recover naturally. After a period of time, the Primeval Sea would automatically recover its Primeval Essence. Like Fang Yuan who was a grade C aptitude, within one hour, he could recover four percent of his Primeval Essence. In six hours, it would be up to twenty-four percent of his total Primeval Essence.The second method was to directly absorb the Primeval power from the Primeval Stone.Primeval Stone was nature\u2019s treasure. The condensation of the natural Primeval Essence could then be absorbed by the Gu masters.Fang Yuan held the Primeval Stone in his hand as he constantly absorbed the surging natural Primeval Essence, urging it to enter the Primeval Sea inside his vain aperture.The delicate aureole on the outside of the Primeval Stone gradually ceased as the sea level inside of Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Sea was continuously increasing with a speed that could be seen with naked eyes.About half an hour later, the Primeval Sea had once again recovered to forty-four percent in volume. Reaching this level, the water surface\u2019s rising speed abruptly stopped. Although there was still an empty space inside of the vain aperture, it was impossible for Fang Yuan to store anymore Primeval Essences. This was the limit of a grade C aptitude.Hence, this could clearly prove the important part of a cultivating aptitude towards cultivation.The higher the aptitude was, the more the vain aperture could store Primeval Essence. Moreover, the Primeval Essence\u2019s recovering speed was also faster.For Fang Yuan, if he wanted to ensure his results, he needed to absorb the Primeval Stones while cultivating the Gu, because his recovering Primeval Essence speed was slower as compared to the speed of the Moonlight Gu in repelling his Primeval Essence.However, for a grade A aptitude like Fang Zheng, he could have replenished his Primeval Essence for about eight percent per hour. After six hours, he could then recover forty-eight percent of the total Primeval that he could store. And the Moonlight Gu could only repel about thirty percent of Primeval Essence within six hours.He would not even need the external help of the Primeval Stones. When consistently cultivating, with taking few rests in between, he could totally have success in cultivating this Moonlight Gu in just a few days.Therefore, Fang Yuan had known from the start that cultivating the Moonlight Gu for this Gu Cultivating Examination; that it would have been impossible for him to have gotten first place. This was not related to one\u2019s competency. The most critical element was one\u2019s aptitude.The second element was Primeval Stones.If having an exceeded amount of Primeval stones without being afraid of wasting it, even a grade B aptitude could have had the same excellent ability as a grade A aptitude, getting first place.\u201cI only have six Primeval Stones. In comparison with Gu Yue Mo Bei, and Gu Yue Chi Cheng who have seniors helping them behind their backs, I am obviously worse. I\u2019m only at grade C aptitude, also lower compared to Gu Yue Fang Zheng. Compared to an examination without a tiny bit opportunity of winning, it will be better to divert my attention, and go search for the Wine Gu. If I could cultivate it into my Vitality Gu, it would be better than the Moonlight Gu. Ah? The sound of the rain outside has gotten lighter, seems like it is stopping. The rain has already been here for three days, and three nights straight, it should stop now.\u201dFang Yuan retrieved his Moonlight Gu. As he was getting off the bed and about to open the window, a knocking sound started to resonate.Outside the door, Shen Cui\u2019s voice arose, \u201cYoung master Fang Yuan, it is me. It has been raining for three days straight. I have brought some wine and food; young master should eat, as it may ease his sadness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: It Was Merely SeductionTranslator: - - Editor: - -Fang Yuan slightly furrowed his brows. With his intuition and five hundred years of living experience, he could smell a conspiracy.A ray of ice-cold light flashed in his eyes, he slowly relaxed his brows, \u201cI\u2019m quite hungry. Good timing, come in.\u201dShen Cui who was holding a food hamper, a scornful grin beamed on the corner of her mouth after she heard what Fang Yuan had said.But as she opened the door, only a gentle expression was left on her visage.\u201cYoung master Fang Yuan, I can even smell the fragrance of the food and wine coming through the hamper.\u201d Her voice was sweet, exhibiting a gleam of passionate charm.Putting the hamper on the table, Shen Cui then took out food trays one by one, arranging it neatly.The table was beautifully displayed and also gave off a pleasant aroma.She then took out two wine cups, pouring the wine inside and serving it.\u201cYoung master, let\u2019s sit down. Servant dares to be bold. I\u2019ve always wanted to drink with young master at least once.\u201d Her smile was like flowers. Approaching Fang Yuan, she brashly held his hand tight, taking him to the chair beside the table, guiding him to sit down.Afterward, she directly sat on Fang Yuan\u2019s thigh. Her soft body was leaning completely on Fang Yuan\u2019s bosom, like a birdie that rested upon Fang Yuan, talking to his ear, \u201cYoung master Fang Yuan, I have liked you ever since. Regardless of aptitude, I still want to stay with you, lean on you, console you. Tonight, I only have this thought of giving myself to you.\u201dToday, she had dressed up nicely.Rouge dyed her lips with a cherry color. As she was leaning in towards his ear to talk, a gentle, youthful breath teasingly entered Fang Yuan\u2019s earlobe.Because she was sitting in his bosom, he could clearly feel her curvy figure.Her thighs were brimming with elasticity, her small waist with the soft breast.\u201cYoung master, let me serve you some more wine.\u201d Shen Cui held up the cup of wine, lifting her head than pouring the wine into her mouth. Subsequently, her eyes were like brimming with water; she silently looked at Fang Yuan. Using her small cherry lips, she slowly headed toward Fang Yuan\u2019s lips.Fang Yuan\u2019s countenance was cold as if the one sitting in his lap was not a girl, but a statue.Shen Cui looked at Fang Yuan\u2019s expression. At the beginning, she was still afraid, but as her lips were only a tiny bit away from his, she was certain. She was even feeling contemptuous inside, \u201cStill pretending.\u201dRight then, Fang Yuan coldly laughed, a gleam of disdain could be heard in his tone, \u201cSo it is merely just seduction.\u201dShen Cui\u2019s visage instantly frozen. She swallowed the wine in her mouth, insincerely acted angrily, \u201cYoung master Fang Yuan, what are you talking about?\u201dFang Yuan\u2019s deep pair of eyes were emitting cold light; he stared at Shen Cui\u2019s eyes as his hand was put on her pure white neck, gradually tightening.Shen Cui\u2019s pupils fiercely shrank, she said with a frightening tone, \u201cYoung master, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201dFang Yuan did not reply, but he only increased the strength of his hand.\u201cYoung Master Fang Yuan, I\u2019m scared!\u201d Shen Cui was almost suffocated. Her countenance showed a gleam of confusion. She raised her two hands to hold onto Fang Yuan\u2019s hands, attempting to pull them apart. However, Fang Yuan\u2019s hands were like iron clasps, how could she have pried them open?\u201cIt appears that aunt and uncle wanted you to seduce then frame me? If so, they must have prepared well all the men downstairs.\u201d Fang Yuan scornfully sneered, \u201cAnyhow, who do you think you are, seducing me with just this? Just by two of your mushy flocks of meat?\u201dAfter finishing, he put his hands on Shen Cui\u2019s chest, forcefully squeezed her soft breasts, instantly deforming it.Severe pain from her chest made Shen Cui\u2019s eyes widen. The pain was too brutal that it brought her to tears. She wanted to yell, but her throat was being tightly clutched by Fang Yuan. In the end, she could only sob. She started to resist vigorously if not, she would really be suffocated to death!However, right then, Fang Yuan slowly released the strength of his hands.Shen Cui instantly widened her mouth, hastily gasping. Rapid breathing had led to an acute chain of coughing.Fang Yuan slightly laughed. He raised his hand, gently caressed Shen Cui\u2019s cheeks, then casually said, \u201cShen Cui, do you think I can kill you?\u201dIf Fang Yuan was devilishly growling, Shen Cui might have resisted vigorously.But when Fang Yuan used such soft tone to ask her about whether he could kill her or not, a frightening feeling arose deep inside of her innermost feelings.She was scared!She terrifyingly looked at Fang Yuan, looking at the young man who was smiling at her.Just in a second, Shen Cui vowed that she would never forget Fang Yuan's two eyes. This pair of eyes did not have a single gleam of sentiment, but were pitch black, as deep as an ancient dampness which was hiding a terrifying giant beast.In his attentive eyes, Shen Cui felt as if she was being put in the middle of a place full of snow and ice while naked!This person in front of her would definitely dare to kill her and could kill her...My god! Why did I mess with such demon?!Chen Cui\u2019s heart was filled with regrets. At this moment, she was itching to turn away and run for her life.However, right now she was in Fang Yuan\u2019s chest. She did not even dare to make any movements, not even mentioning running away.Her entire body was tensed up. With a shaking soft body and face as pale as a sheet of paper, she was speechless.\u201cRemembering you have been my personal servant, serving me for years, I will not kill you this time. Did not you want to escape your servant life? Go find my didi; he is foolish and naive.\u201d Fang Yuan retrieved his smile, patting Shen Cui\u2019s cheeks while saying with a calm as water tone.After deeply exhaling, he finally said,\u201cGo.\u201dShen Cui who was dumbstruck obediently went outside. She had lost her soul and dropped her spirit; she did not even know how she had escaped from that demon Fang Yuan.As they saw Shen Cui got out, the men who were waiting in darkness doubtingly looked at each other.\u201cTo have gone that far to set up a trap of seduction, but still, they have a new idea, compared to my past life at least. Haha, aunt and uncle, I will deeply remember your affections this time!\u201dAfter Shen Cui had left for a while, Fang Yuan instantly stood up, going to the doors.No matter what, he could not stay here anymore.Even a nobleman would not stand beside a collapsing wall, not to mention a devil. Without enough power, only a fool would put himself in a dangerous position.\u201cOwner, are there any rooms available?\u201d Walking inside the only tavern in the mountain stronghold, Fang Yuan asked about the pricing.\u201cYes, yes, there are rooms upstairs, on the second and third floor. Not only convenient, but they are also extremely tidy. The first floor is the luncheonette; you can have your meal here, or ask the servant to deliver it to your room especially.\u201d The owner delicately treated Fang Yuan.This was the only tavern in the mountain stronghold. Business was not too good and even seemed quite lonely. This tavern was only crowded when the caravan came to the Green Thatch mountain for trading each year.Fang Yuan threw two whole Primeval Stones to the owner as he was quite hungry, \u201cFirst, get me a deluxe room, then bring me two jugs of wine, three to four appetizers, keep the change. If this is not enough, I will give you more.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The owner received the two Primeval Stones, and asked again, \u201cYou want to have your meal in your room, or the bustling hall?\u201dFang Yuan glanced at the sky. The rain had stopped. Moreover, it was almost night. He decided to eat in the hall, then directly got out of the village, went searching for Hua Jiu the monk\u2019s hidden legacy. He then turned to the owner, and said, \u201cThe hall then.\u201dIn the tavern\u2019s luncheonette, there laid more than ten square tables, each surrounded by four large benches. The middle table also had a thick pillar in the center, supporting the tavern. The floor was covered with marble tiles, which were quite wet due to the air moisture of the mountain.There were three tables that were occupied.The table which was leaning on the window only had an old man drinking wine. He was pouring his wine alone while looking at the sunset outside the window.There were about five to six hunters sitting at the middle table. They formed a circle, talking with each other about what had happened during the hunt. A pile of pheasants and hares being used as baits were scattered besides their feet.Two youngsters, who were sitting at the table in the corner, seemed to be secretly discussing about something. Their figure was covered by a shadow, which made it hard to distinguish whether they were male or female.Fang Yuan chose the table near the door. Just in a short while, wine and food had been served.\u201cWith my grade C aptitude, wanting to cultivate the Moonlight Gu, I have to use the aid from the Primeval Stones. If I am to be lucky that this Moonlight Gu does not have a stubborn willpower, I may only need five stones. But if it is obstinate, then trouble has come, I will need eight stones.\"Gu was also a living entity; they would naturally have a will to live.One that had a formidable willpower would resist the cultivation of a Gu Master. Those with a weak willpower would depressingly give up in the end. Once it had lost its will, the cultivating process would be an ease.\u201cI only have six Primeval Stones with me right now. After giving two to the owner, there are four left. This is not enough.\u201dIn this world, Primeval Stones were a strong currency. The demand for it was very high.The living expense of a typical family of three would be at most a whole Primeval Stone.However, to a Gu Master, they would need to use a lot. Like Fang Yuan, only for cultivating Gu, he had already needed an average of seven Primeval Stones.This was for the Moonlight Gu. If he really did find the Wine Gu, wanting to cultivate it with his aptitude, he would need another ten Primeval Stones on top of that!\u201cIn other words, my current situation is -- even if I had found the Wine Gu, I still won\u2019t have enough Primeval Stones to cultivate it. However, I need to continue searching. There is a high possibility that there would be a big amount of Primeval Stone in Hua Jiu the monk\u2019s legacy.That was not hard to guess.Hua Jiu the monk was a level five Gu Master. Being a famous supreme master on the demon path, how could he not have had any Primeval Stones, the most basic items for a Gu Master then?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Green Bamboo Wine\u2019s Fragrance, Gu Master Displaying His PowerTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cEvery problem is all decided by the result of the search for Hua Jiu the monk\u2019s hidden legacy. If I could find it, it could easily solve any matter that arises. And if I could not, these problems would simply prolong my cultivating speed. Thus, the starting point of my cultivation would be far from being equaled with those at my age. It\u2019s hard to understand. I have used several hours in a whole week to attract that Wine Gu, but why isn\u2019t there still any results?\u201dFang Yuan furrowed his brows and deeply thought. The food in his mouth did not taste like anything either.Right then, a noisy sound resonated, interrupting his line of thought.Fang Yuan turned to look at the direction of the sound. He discovered that at the middle table surrounded by those six hunters, the smell of wine was almost overwhelming. The atmosphere was heating up like fire; their faces were dyed with a red color.\u201cZhang di, come, another cup!\u201d\u201cFeng dage, we brothers admire your power. You alone can handle a black skin wild boar. Really is heroic! This cup of wine you have to take, if you do not, then you\u2019re not giving us brothers any face.\u201d\u201cMuch thanks to the offer from all of you fellow brother\u2019s, but I really can\u2019t drink.\u201d\u201cFeng dage refuses to drink, are you not satisfied with this wine? Servant, come here, and give me the best wine here!\u201dTheir voices were getting louder and louder. Obviously, they had drunk too much.The servant came running, \u201cDage, there is good wine, but it is quite precious.\u201d\u201cWhat, you\u2019re scared I won\u2019t pay?!\u201d Some people in that group of hunters all stood up and stared at that servant after hearing such words. They were either guys with sturdy bodies, attractive figures or dark, thin but robust, with sharp pressure. They carried with them the distinctive fierce aura of the people living in the mountains.The servant hurriedly bowed down; he protested, \u201cHow can I dare to look down upon you heroes. It is just that this wine is truly quite expensive, the price of one jug is about two Primeval Stones!\u201dThe hunters were astonished.Two Primeval Stones was not cheap. It was equaled to a two-month living expense of an ordinary family. Hunters hunted animals for a living. They made relatively more than a regular person. Sometimes, a black skinned wild boar could be about half a Primeval Stone price. However, hunting was adventurous. If doing it wrong, they could have turned themselves into bait.Wasting two Primeval Stones for a wine jug was unworthy to these hunters.\u2019\u2019Is it really that expensive for a jug of wine?\u201d\u201cYoung fellow, are you lying to us?\u201dThe group of hunters was constantly asking. Their voices were slightly weaker and seemed to be unable to step down from their own embarrassment.The servant did not even dare to talk.The hunter called Feng ge hurriedly smoothed it over when seeing things were going the wrong way, \u201cBrothers, please do not waste any more. I can\u2019t drink wine today, let\u2019s save it for another day.\u201d\u201cGege, what are you saying!\u201d\u201cHow can it be...\u201dThe rest of the group started to yell, but their voices were getting smaller, and smaller. The entire group had also sat down in their seats.The servant was also a skillful one. Looking at the situation, he had soon known, that the sale would not be made.However, such circumstances he had seen countless of times, it could not be blamed. As he wanted to go back, the sound from a young man arose from the table in the corner, \u201cHaha, how funny. One by one were growling loudly, but had obediently shut up at an unaffordable jug of wine, go shrink back!\u201dThe hunter was provoked as soon as he heard these words, he then shouted, \u201cWho said I could not afford it? Servant, bring that wine over. I will give you Primeval Stones, not just two!\u201d\u201cA, please wait a bit, I will immediately bring it over!\u201d The servant could not guess the overturn of this situation. He instantly replied, they turned around and held a wine jug over.This jug was only half the size of a normal wine jug. However, when the cover was opened, the scent of pure wine fragrance immediately emanated, filling up the entire luncheonette.The lone drinker old man sitting beside the window could not help but turn around and laid an eye on it because of the smell from this wine jug.It really was good wine.\u201cHonorable guests, I did not lie. This is the best Green Bamboo Wine, which is only sold in our tavern. Try smelling the fragrance of this wine!\u201d The servant said as he deeply inhaled, face brimming with satisfaction.Fang Yuan\u2019s heart shook. The servant hadn\u2019t lied about this.There were three wine shops in the entire Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold. What they sold was all rice wine, unfiltered rice wine, those basic ones. Fang Yuan had constantly been buying wine for seven days straight in an attempt to attract that Wine Gu. Of course, he knew the market price.The wine jug had incited the addictions in some of those hunters. The whole group twitching their noses; their Adam's apples were moving up and down non-stop.And that hunter who had talked too quickly was beaming with excitement and also with a gleam of regret.That this wine jug could cost two Primeval Stones!\u201cI bought this wine jug out of impulsiveness. This servant was also too much. He did not say anything but immediately brought the jug over. Now, the covered seal has already been opened; I can\u2019t return it now.\u201dThe hunter felt pain as he kept thinking about this. Wanting to take it back, but he was scared of losing his face.In the end, he could only tap the table, smilingly said, \u201cDamn, this is good wine! Gege, please have it, I will take care of the wine today!\u201dRight at that time, the young man sitting at the table in the corner mockingly said again, \u201cHow can this small jug be enough for the six of you? Buy some more then.\u201dBeing oppressed by such words, the hunter\u2019s green veins were already showing. He stood up, agitatedly stared at the direction of that youngster, \u201cYou rascal, you talk too much. Come, step out, let gege train my two hands with you!\u201d\u201cA? I will step out.\u201d As the young man heard that sentence, he really stood up, and devilishly smiled while walking out of the shadowed corner.He possessed a tall, thin figure with pale skin. Wearing a dark blue martial costume, he looked quite neat.He wore a sapphire blue headband on his head. The short top garment exposed his thin and weak shoulders. He dressed in a long pants and had a pair of straw sandals on his feet. There were even bands on his calf.The critical thing was the green belt on his waist. In the middle of the belt laid a sparkling copper plate. The word \u201cOne\u201d was carved on that copper plate.\u201cA level one Gu Master?!\u201d The hunter who was yelling obviously understood the meaning behind his clothing. He abruptly breathed out a gulp of cold air. The angry expression on his face had now been changed into one of being terrified.He did not expect he had messed with a Gu Master!\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to train with me? Come, attack.\u201d The Gu Master young man strolled over, wearing a mocking expression on his face.The hunter who was just provoking him was like a statue, standing still in one place without the slightest of movements.\u201cYou guys can all come. I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d The young man slowly approaching the hunter\u2019s table, casually said.The visages of all those hunters had changed. Their red faces from drinking had turned pale in a flash. Sweat started to pour on their foreheads. They were like cats on hot bricks, and did not even dare to exhale heavily.The young Gu Master stretched out his hand then held the wine jug up. As he was smelling the wine fragrance, he laughed, \u201cThe smell is indeed excellent...\u201d\u201cHonorable Gu Master, if you like it, please take it. I have offended you honorable; please take this as my apologies.\u201d The hunter who was provoking before, hastily clasped his hand together, smilingly talked to the young man.Unexpectedly, the young Gu Master abruptly changed his expression. With a loud BANG, he threw the wine jug on the ground.With an icy countenance and sharp as blade eyes, he lowered his voice and growled, \u201cYou are worthy of apologizing to me? You hunters really do have money. Using two Primeval Stones to buy a jug of wine, you guys are even wealthier than me then?! Do you know that I have never had to even worry about Primeval stones! You dare to boast about your wealth in front of me? You ordinary people think you are worthy?!\u201d\u201cI do not dare to, do not dare to!\u201d\u201cOffending you honorable, we deserve to die a thousand times!\u201d\u201cWe were impulsive when offending you; these are the Primeval Stones we have right now, honorable Gu Master, please take it.\u201dAll the hunters stood up as if they had been struck by lightning, instantly took out the Primeval Stones in their bosoms. But they were just normal people. Where could they have dug out their wealth from? The things they took out were just fragments of Primeval Stones. The biggest one was just one-fourth the size of a normal Primeval Stone.The young Gu Master did not receive those stones. He did not stop sneering, using his eagle-eyes to scan through the entire luncheonette.Those hunters which he glared his eyes at were all bowing their heads. The old man who was sitting beside the window enjoying the scene also turned away, avoiding the Gu Master\u2019s eyes.Only Fang Yuan was silently looking, without scrupling.The clothing on this young Gu Master was something only an official Gu Master was allowed to wear. Fang Yuan would not even qualify for it. Fang Yuan could only receive it from the clan after having graduated.The copper plate on this Gu Master\u2019s belt had the word \u201cOne\u201d, representing that he was a level one, Gu Master.However, he was already around twenty years old. With the Primeval Essence emitting from his body, he must have been an Advanced Level one.One would start to cultivate at the age of fifteen. This person had only reached the Advanced level one when he was already over twenty. It meant that this young man\u2019s aptitude must be a grade D, one grade lower than that of Fang Yuan\u2019s. There was a possibility that he was a logistics Gu Master, and did not even count as a Fighting Gu Master.But no matter what, to handle six hunters, these were more than enough.This was the difference in capacities between ordinary people with a Gu Master.\u201cOne with power can be set up on high. This is the nature of this world. No, no matter which worlds, the big fish eats the little fish, and the little fish eats the small shrimps. It is just that this world is displaying that in a more obvious way.\u201d Fang Yuan silently exclaimed.\u201cGood job Jiang Ya, teaching him a bit is enough. You do not need to make it too difficult for that ordinary man. If someone spreads this news, you might not be scared of losing face, but I am.\u201d Another youngster sitting on the table in the corner said.As they heard the voice, they noticed that this youngster was actually a female.The young man named Jiang Ya was feeling embarrassed hearing his friend\u2019s words. He stopped his bitter smile and did not even bother to glance at the fragments of Primeval Stones that those hunters were offering. In total, this could not even be worth two Primeval Stones, he, of course, had no interests.He waved his hand, heading back to his seat. Fierce words were still coming out from his mouth as he was walking, \u201cIf you guys want to continue drinking, then drink the Green Bamboo Wine. I want to see who would still be able to drink the wine that I have knocked down on the floor?\u201dThe hunters all bowed their heads, being reprimanded like six good grandsons.The heavy scent of wine filled the entire luncheonette. The hunter who bought the wine just to smell the scent was feeling painful until his face was all twisted.He had used two Primeval Stones to buy this wine jug, but did not even get to have a gulp!Fang Yuan stopped his chopsticks. He was already full. Smelling the fragrance from the wine, light started to flash in his eyes. He suddenly took out two Primeval Stones, put it on the table, then coldly said, \u201cServant, give me the Green Bamboo Wine.\u201dThe whole room was astonished.That young Gu Master named Jiang Ya instantly stopped in his steps. The corner of his mouth shrunk as he slightly exhaled. What he had mocked just now, with Fang Yuan\u2019s jug of wine, would not it be shaming him? Giving him a slap in the face?He turned about, squinted his eyes, using an icy-cold look to pierce at Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan casually faced him with an expressionless countenance, without any hesitation.Light flickered in Jiang Ya\u2019s eyes. The icy-cold aura had disappeared as he felt the Primeval Essence on Fang Yuan\u2019s body.He had known Fang Yuan\u2019s identity by now. He then flashed a warm smile which was like the spring breeze, \u201cso it is my junior.\u201dOther people suddenly woke up, as they immediately turned to look at Fang Yuan with a different feeling in their eyes.No wonder this young man was not afraid of the Gu Master, as he was also a Gu Master. Even though he was still in school, it was already much different.\u201cHonorable Gu Master, here is your wine!\u201d The servant frantically ran over, flatteringly smiled.Fang Yuan turned to the young Gu Master Jiang Ya and nodded. He then took his wine jug, and exited the tavern.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Bamboo Forest Under the Moonlight, A Speck of Snow PearlTranslator: - - Editor: - -Around three hundred years ago, a genius appeared in the Ancient Moon clan.His talents were extraordinary. Only at a young age, but he had already cultivated to a level five Gu Master, with a great possibility of reaching even higher. He was famous in the Green Thatch Mountain, shining with brilliant light, he became the person whom everyone in the clan entrusted their hopes to.He was the legendary fourth generation clan\u2019s head in the history of the Ancient Moon clan.Unfortunately, with the purpose of protecting the clan\u2019s members, the fourth generation clan\u2019s head had to confront the devilish level five Gu Master - Hua Jiu monk. After a fierce battle, he had beaten up Hua Jiu monk. Moreover, he made that demon bow down on the ground begging for mercy.However, in the end, right when the fourth clan\u2019s head was being careless, Hua Jiu the monk sneaked an attack on him.The fourth generation clan\u2019s head was enraged, he killed Hua Jiu monk. But due to his severe wounds, he had died young.This tragic folklore was still being passed down to present, as part of the way that the member of the Ancient Moon clan used to eulogize him.Nonetheless, Fang Yuan understood. Such a story could not be trusted completely. , because there was a big hole in the story itself.In his previous life, about a month after, the Gu Master decided to get drunk because he was heartbroken. He then got dead drunk, laying outside of the mountain stronghold. As the fragrance of wine was circulating in the air, it had unexpectedly lured over a Wine Gu.The Gu Master chased after the Wine Gu only to find out a secret cave with Hua Jiu monk\u2019s corpse. At the same time, he could also find Hua Jiu monk\u2019s hidden legacy.The Gu Master then returned to the clan to inform this, creating a huge sensation at the time.As the storm was ceasing, he had gained his benefits. Not only was he be able to obtain the Wine Gu, but he also got his cultivation base increased. His ex-girlfriend had also come back to him. These had made him become the man of the moment at the time.The folklore was being passed down one generation after another, making the later version more different than the last one. However, in Fang Yuan\u2019s memory, even though the way that Gu Master had found out the legacy was quite trustworthy, he still doubted that there was still a hidden truth behind it.\u201cAt first I did not figure it out. But that day when I was searching while analyzing, I realized something was not right.\u201d The night was getting thicker. Fang Yuan was wandering in the bamboo forest around the mountain stronghold as he was trying to organize every clue he had.\u201cIf I were him, when I find out the hidden legacy of Hua Jiu monk, why would not I keep everything for myself? Why do I need to inform the entire sect? Without talking about the honor of the clan, everyone has something called greed. In the end, what could be the thing that makes him be willing to ignore his own benefits and go to report to the higher authority in the clan?\u201dThe truth was buried under the foggy history. Fang Yuan silently thought, but could not come up with any answer.Anyhow, there weren\u2019t not enough clues. He only had two, but the two were also half true half fake, and could not be trusted completely.Fang Yuan could not help but think about himself, \u201cNo matter what, after buying this jug of Green Bamboo Wine, I only have two Primeval Stones left. If I could not find the legacy, then it\u2019s going to be problematic. This time I am betting all on this single throw!\u201dThough, if he were to cultivate the Gu, he would not have enough Primeval Stones. On the contrary, if he invested in this high-end wine, it would increase the success rate.If it was someone else, the majority of people would slowly collect Primeval Stones.But to Fang Yuan, the efficiency of this move was too low. He was willing to risk and bet for once.People that walked on the Demon Way always loved to take risks.At present.On the night that was getting deeper, the spring moon was like a bow.The cloud covering the moonlight was as giving it a layer of gauze.Because it had been raining for three days straight, the mountain atmosphere was all washed away, left with only pure fresh air.Such fresh air was like a sheet of white paper, even better for spreading the fragrance of the wine. This was one of the reasons why Fang Yuan believed that today was the day.\u201cThere is only this area left that I haven\u2019t searched,\u201d Walking towards a bamboo forest, he stopped his footsteps.The previous seven days of searching weren\u2019t useless. It at least proved that Hua Jiu monk had not died in those areas.This was the second reason.Inside the bamboo forest, grasses were lavish, with an abundance of white flowers and straight bamboo poles.As Fang Yuan opened the wine jug, the dense fragrance of the wine instantly rushed into his nostrils.Green Bamboo Wine could be considered the best wine in the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold. This was the third reason.\u201cWith three reasons like this, if I want to succeed, it has to be tonight!\u201d Fang Yuan silently encouraged himself on one side. On the other side, he titled the wine jug, and slowly poured some wine on a stone.If those previous hunters had seen this, they would have been pained till death. This wine freaking costed two Primeval Stones...But Fang Yuan could not care less.The scent of wine was spreading quickly. In the night, the slow spring breeze carrying the fagrance of the wine gradually permeated the entire bamboo forest.Fang Yuan stood at one place and smelled the scent of the wine. After a while, nothing had happened.He could only hear the sound of nightingales not far from there. The sound was as if it was coming from a string of silver bells.His eyes were calm as this was not unexpected. He turned around and started to walk to another area around hundreds of meters away.Right there, he did the same things, pouring the wine and waiting in one spot for a short period.Times after times, when he had tried out numerous areas, having poured the wine several times, the jug of Green Bamboo Wine was finally getting lighter.\u201cOne last time.\u201d Fang Yuan deeply sighed inside. He toppled the jug of wine, turning the jug upside down to let all the remaining wine fall downwards.As the wine was poured into the bush, the grasses were swaying non-stop. The wildflowers were all bowing their heads slightly over when being poured over by the wine.Fang Yuan stood still. With his last string of hope, he attentively looked around.Right now, it was already late at night.A thick layer of black clouds were shielding the moonlight.The darkness was like a layer of curtain cloth, covering this bamboo forest.The whole surroundings was silent. One by one, green bamboo was standing straight by themselves. They left only a line cutting straight down from above in Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes.He was inaudibly standingin one place. He could clearly feel his breathing, as well as sensing the last speck of hope inside his heart. Followed the time which was passing by, as nothing had happened.\u201cStill a failure?\u201d He whispered to himself, \u201cWith three advantages all gathered tonight, I still could not succeed in finding any traces of that Wine Gu. This means the successful rate will be even lower in the future. I only have two Primeval Stones left and I still have to cultivate the Moonlight Gu. I can\u2019t continue risking.\u201dThe result of risking usually wasn\u2019t like what people expected. But if the result was like what one wanted, then the ending result would be tremendous.Fang Yuan loved risking, but he wasn\u2019t addicted to it. He wasn\u2019t the stubborn one, who only wanted to overturn the situation.He understood clearly his limit, and that was his capital.The five hundred years of experiences told him that it was now time to stop.Sometimes, life was like this. Having a goal was something brilliant. It was always brimming with enticing charm. It seemed within their reach, but they still could not achieve it even after putting all their efforts in. This made people stubbornly toss around besides it, thinking about other methods.\u201cThis charm of this life also lies on the fact that it always lacks of better options.\u201d Fang Yuan bitterly smiled, shook his head and turned around.But right at that time.A wind flew by, like a gentle hand that gently passed by the cloudy dark sky.The clouds slowly opened up, revealing the hidden crescent moon.The curved crescent moon was hanging up in the sky, like a white jade cup, pouring down the moonlight as clear as water to the ground.The moonlight was shining on the bamboo forest, atop of the stone, the stream in the mountain, and on Fang Yuans\u2019s body.Fang Yuan was wearing chaste clothing. His young visage which was shone on by the moonlight was getting even paler.Darkness disappeared in a flash, leaving an area which was full of crystallized frost like snow.Seemed like they were being attracted to the moonlight, the nightingale started to chirp once again. This time, it was not one, but countless of birds that surrounded this bamboo forest had started to respond to each other.At the same time, the crickets which were living in this great mountains also joined in, chanting out loud the melody of vitality.They were only active at night. On their bodies, the particular red light of insects was illuminating. Right now, as they were gathering up, a flock of insects was radiating light like cornelians.Fang Yuan glanced at them. The group of crickets were like a flow of jumping red water. They stamped on the wild flowers and grasses and gathered under the moonlight inside this bamboo forest.Inside the bamboo forest which was like a transparent pond, the jasper color green spear bamboos were sparkling with jade-like halo.A glimpser of hope appeared in the darkest time. The nature at this moment had displayed its enchanting and alluring beauty in front of Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan unconsciously stopped his footsteps. He felt like he was put inside of a fairyland.Initially, he wanted to turn around and walk away, but now he could not help but followed his intuition to look back.That bush which was covered with Green Bamboo Wine slightly swayed in the wind, but still, nothing had appeared.Fang Yuan mockingly smiled, he retrieved his glance.However.He did not think as he was raising his eyes, he saw a speck of a white snow shadow.This snow shadow was lying on a green spear bamboo not far from him. Under the moonlight, it was like a round pearl.Fang Yuan fiercely widened his eyes. His body slightly shook as his heart was shaking vigorously, it was now beating frantically.It was the Wine Gu!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Hidden Profound in The Mountain CrackTranslator: - - Editor: - -The Gu had a body like a silkworm, emitting white light as pearls. Its chubby appearance made it look quite amiable.It used wine as food and could soar up to the sky. When it was flying, it would travel at an incredibly fast speed while curving its body into a ball.Although it was just a level one Gu, its value was even more precious than some of the level two Gu\u2019s.Using it as a Vital Gu was far better in comparison to the Moonlight Gu.Right now, that Wine Gu was lying on a tree not far from Fang Yuan. He only needed five to six steps to be able to reach that green spear bamboo.Fang Yuan held his breath. He did notdid not recklessly approach it, but was slowly stepping back.He knew that although the distance was close, wanting to directly catch a Wine Gu, with just him, who had just opened his vain aperture, would be something extremely tough. Or it was to say; he did notdid not have many possibilities to succeed.With his vision, he could not see the Wine Gu clearly. But in the dark, Fang Yuan could feel that it was staying alerted towards his existence.Fang Yuan slowly retreated, he did so gently in order not to incite the Wine Gu.He knew, if the Wine Gu wanted to fly away, it would be impossible for him to use his speed to stop it. He could only wait until it was dead drunk from drinking. After that, its flying speed would decrease. That was the only chance to catch it.Fang Yuan was retreating further and further away. The Wine Gu lying on the bamboo could not help but stand up.The thick, vigorous scent of wine in front had attracted and totally captivated it. Its saliva might have been accumulated into a pond right now.However, the Wine Gu\u2019s vigilance was fairly high. It curved up its body, then plunged up in the air only when Fang Yuan had stepped back around two hundred steps.When it was flying, its body would curve up into a fist, and looked like a chubby white wonton. (omg T^T sounds so cute ><)The wonton streaked by the air, leaving behind a smooth curving line, then fell down on the bush which Fang Yuan had poured the wine on.Seeing the delicious meal in front of it, the Wine Gu had put down more than half of its precaution. It hurriedly climbed over to the flower bud which was soaked with wine, greedily explored, and only left its tail protruding outside.It was starving now. Facing the delicious Green Bamboo Wine, he opened his mouth wide and freely sucked it in. It was soon emerged in enjoying the meal, and totally forgot about Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan stood behind it and started to approach it carefully.He looked at its tail outside the flower bud. Its tail was like a silkworm\u2019s tail, chubby, smooth, and was illuminating a halo that made people think about a pearl.Its tail was still hanging outside and it did notdid not have any of the slightest movements.After a while, the tail slightly raised up. Obviously, the Wine Gu was drinking with satisfaction.Finally, when Fang Yuan was only ten steps away from it, its tail suddenly stood straight up, swaying non-stop, carrying a happy tempo.He had obsessed in drinking already!Looking at such scenery, Fang Yuan almost laughed out loud.He did notdid not continue moving forward, but patiently stopped and waited. If he approached quickly, he was quite certain that he would be able to catch this Wine Gu. However, Fang Yuan wanted this Wine Gu to lead the way, guiding him to the place where Hua Jiu monk\u2019s corpse had been hidden.After a while later, the Wine Gu retreated from the flower bud. Its body was slightly chubbier. While shaking its head back and forth, it looked like a normal human who was drunk. However, he totally did not take notice of Fang Yuan\u2019s existence.It then moved to another faint yellow wildflower, sat atop the flower\u2019s bud and continued sucking the wine.After this, he was finally full. The figure on the flower slowly curled up into a ball. Then, it gradually flew up. It flew at the height of one point five meters above ground, heading towards the deep area of the bamboo forest and flying away.Fang Yuan hastily chased after it.The Wine Gu had already been dead drunk. Its flying speed was decreased in half. Nevertheless, even so, Fang Yuan still had to use all his will to pursue it, to be able to catch up to its shadow.In a pitch black area, a young man was dashing through the bamboo forest, trying to chase after a speck of the snow pearl that was not far from him, under the soft moonlight and gentle cool breeze.Inside the bamboo forest, one by one emerald green spear bamboo appeared in front of Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes and then it was quickly being left behind as he dashed forward.On the ground, the lush green bush emphasized those beautiful wildflowers.Along the stones covered with lichenous was small faint yellow bamboo shoots.Fang Yuan\u2019 shadow was dashing quickly on the ground. As he passed by those green spear bamboos, he left behind a black streak.He attentively focused on that speck of snow shadow. In a gloomy and reeked of wine atmosphere, he widened his mouth trying to gasp for fresh air, constantly followed behind the Gu.Because of his fast speed, his eyes looking at the moonlight were as it was seeing water. The constantly moving shadows were making it look like he was dashing forward underwater with endless water plants flashing by.As the Wine Gu rushed out of the bamboo forest, Fang Yuan also did the same. The entire area was flickering with white shadows as the petals of those faint yellow bud flowers started to follow the wind and come flying out.The group of crickets was like a string of moving poems, coincidently flowing forward, passing by Fang Yuan. With a crashing sound, a red cloud suddenly busted out, revealing countless of fireflies looking like red starlight.There was a stream flowing along the path filled with pebble stones. The babbling water was reflecting the moon above the night sky. Bang Bang, the silently moving stream was broken into numerous silver ripples due to it being stamped on by Fang Yuan.I\u2019m afraid one brook, will be paved by the moonlight\u2019s white jade[1].Fang Yuan did notdid not stop his pursue. He still followed the Wine Gu closely.Going along the stream, he vaguely heard the sound of the waterfall. Passing by another sparse forest, he saw the Wine Gu flew into a small crack on a giant stone.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes immediately lit up. He stopped his step.\u201cSo it is here.\u201d He opened his mouth, gasping for air. His heart was beating frantically. With this sudden stop, he felt his whole body was soaked with sweat, a scorching heat was flowing through his veins, inciting his entire body.Looking around, he realized this place was a shallow river.Various sized pebble stones were scattered on the ground. The water level was only higher than those stones by a finger. There were also giant silver stones laid here and there.Behind the Green Thatch Mountain was a massive waterfall.The stream transformed with the change in meteorology. It was a drop of precipitation, hitting straight into a deep pool. The other side of the pool was the Bai Family Mountain Stronghold. Their vigorous power was not any less than that of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold.Waterfall also had branches. And, obviously, Fang Yuan was facing one of the branches of this waterfall.Normally, this pool was empty. However, recently, heavy rain that lasted for three days straight had accumulated enough water to fill up this pool.The giant stone that the Wine Gu had flown inside was the source of this stream.The stone was leaning straight against the mountain. A small waterfall was divided from that grand waterfall. It was like a giant silver snake, sticking to the mountain while hanging down, directly hitting on that stone. With time, it had opened a crack right in the center of this giant stone.Right now, as the waterfall was still running down, the stream was rumbling. Like a pure white roller blind, it had completely covered the crack on this giant stone.Following his observation, Fang Yuan was not in a hurry at all. Determination flashed in his eyes as he walked beside the giant stone, took a deep breath then lowered his head and dashed into it.The crack on this giant stone was quite big; it could fit at least two adults walking side by side. Moreover, Fang Yuan\u2019s body was just like a fifteen year old young man\u2019s.As he was dashing inside, the stream rapidly oppressed Fang Yuan\u2019s body, letting the ice-cold water soak his entire body.Suffering from the pressure of the water, Fang Yuan quickly stepped forward. Walking for a couple of steps, the pressure from the water was gradually decreasing.However, as he was getting deeper, the crack was also turning smaller. Fang Yuan could not help but turn his body and walk sideways.His ears were picking up exploding water sounds. Above his head was a layer of pure white light, and the giant stone was getting darker as he went deeper.What was hidden in the darkness?It could be a viper or a lizard with acute poison, or the mechanism traps set up by Hua Jiu monk, or it could be nothing.Fang Yuan continued to slide inside, slowly barged into the darkness.The stream above his head almost disappeared. The cliff covered with moss was constantly rubbing on Fang Yuan\u2019s white and smooth body.Fang Yuan was totally swallowed by darkness. The crack was getting even smaller. Gradually, he could not move his head freely anymore.Fang Yuan slightly bit his lips, continued forward.Walking for around twenty steps, he discovered a cluster of red light in the dark.Initially, he thought it was an illusion. But after blinking several times, he focused his view, and determined that it truly was a light!This discovery made his mind shake.With another fifty to sixty steps, the red light was getting brighter and brighter. In front of Fang Yuan\u2019s pupils, it started to expand into a long, narrow crack.He stretched his left hand as he suddenly realized that the cliff was no longer there.Fang Yuan rejoiced. He knew that there was space inside this giant stone. He rapidly walked forward, and then slid inside this crack.The space inside had immediately opened up. An area about eighty square meters big appeared in front of Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes.\u201cSuch a long distance, I may have soon passed the giant stone. Right now it should be right at the center of the mountain.\u201d On one side, he moved his legs and hands back and forth, trying to smooth out his limbs. On the other side, he silently examined the mysterious surroundings.The whole space was filled with faint red light. He did notdid not know where the source of this light came from.Four cliffs encircled this space was moist and covered with moss. But the air in here was abnormally dry.Withered vines were still attached to those cliffs. The vines intertwined with each other had covered more than half of the cliffs. There were a few withering flowers and roots on them.Those withered flowers looked quite familiar to Fang Yuan.\u201cThey are the Wine Sack Flower Gu and Rice Pouch Grass Gu.\u201d Divine light abruptly appeared as he realized these withered flowers and vines.Gu had various shapes. Some looked like ore, such as Blue Crystal-Shaped Moonlight Gu. Some were like worms, like the Wine Gu that looked like a silkworm. There were some that took after the shape of flowers and grasses, like the ones in front of Fang Yuan right now, the Wine Sack Flower Gu and Rice Pouch Grass Gu.These two types of Gu were all level one natural Gu. It could grow only by absorbing the Primeval Essence. After growing up, the flower bud would produce nectar wine, while the grass pouch would emanate the fragrance of rice.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes followed the vines. Undoubtedly, he discovered that the withered roots had gathered together, forming a block.The Wine Gu was living in this block of dead roots. He was sleeping. It was as easy as eating a piece of cake right now.Fang Yuan walked over, retrieved the Wine Gu into his bosom. Then he crouched down and parted the block of dried rattan only to discover a white skeleton that was hidden inside.\u201cI\u2019ve finally found you, Hua Jiu monk.\u201d Looking at this place, the corner of his mouth twitched up to form a smile.When he was about to totally get rid of that dried rattan,\u201cI dare you to move again.\u201d A voice, filled with murderous intent, abruptly arose from behind Fang Yuan\u2019s back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: History Was Written by the WinnerTranslator: - - Editor: - -Sounds of the others talking had abruptly reverberated in the secret cave.Even Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but have all of his hair stood up and his scalp shook.I am being followed!Could it be since I go out too often that it has attracted other people\u2019s attention?Or are they uncle\u2019s men?Also, the image of that level one Gu Master named Jiang Ya at that tavern started to flash in his mind.Just for a short period, numerous thoughts, and guesses rushed in his head. Furthermore, he was also thinking about a method to solve it altogether.Fang Yuan could clearly feel the murderous intent that filled up this one short sentence.This made him silently exclaim. He himself was a beginner level one; he did not even have a Vital Gu. To a Gu Master, this represented his fighting capacity that was almost zero, how could he fight?\u201cToo weak, too weak!\u201d He shrieked inside.\u201cYou have been attacked by my peerless poisonous Gu. Without my corresponding detoxifying Gu, seven days later, you will definitely turn into a pool of blood and die,\u201d The voice arose again behind his back.Fang Yuan gritted his teeth, and with a calm expression and a low tone of voice, he said, \u201cYou want the Wine Gu? I can give it to you.\u201dHe slowly stood up and his movements were extremely tranquil.However, right at that time, another different voice suddenly resounded. This voice was filled with terrors, constantly shaking, \u201cI'll give it to you, I can give it all to you. I beg you; please spare me my life, honorable Hua Jiu monk!\u201d\u201cWait, this is...\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s brows almost turned into a lump. He abruptly turned around only to see the light on the cliff was transforming, displaying a scene.A Gu Master with sharp aura was standing on the peak of a mountain. Under his feet, was another Gu Master who was bowing down.Surrounding both of them was subsided abyss and scattering small stones. They obviously had been through a fierce fight.Not far from them, there stood a group of elders, silently watching. Looking at this scenery, they were all scared.The winning Gu Master in the center of the stage raised his head and laughed out loud, \u201cHahaha, Gu Yue Ying Xiong, it was a pity that you are still young, and even have a level five cultivation base. I supposed that you were a great hero, but I did not expect that it would be only to this extent. Humph!\u201dThe Gu Master who was laughing out loud had a pair of small eyes. He was wearing a faint red robe, with his cuffs swaying with the wind. He parted open his collar, showing his firm as white jade, chest muscles.What had caught people attention the most was his shining bald head that did not have a single strand of hair.\u201cHua Jiu monk!\u201d Fang Yuan could immediately recognize his identity with just a glance.\u201cCompared to the honorable Hua Jiu monk, I am nothing! I must have lost my consciousness when I had blindly offended Master Hua Jiu. Honorable Hua Jiu, please think about our sect\u2019s portrait of hospitality before and spare me my life!\u201d The Gu Master who was bowing to the ground was shaking. Cold sweats poured out, he begged for mercy with tears in his eyes.Fang Yuan squinted his eyes. He focused, and realized that that Gu Master was wearing clothing that was particularly made for the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s head. Looking at his appearance, he must be the fourth generation clan\u2019s head!And the elderly group standing aside must be the group of Elders of the clan that year.\u201cHaha, portraits of hospitality? You really have no shame by saying that! Initially, I was honest and sincere when offering the business of trading my Primeval Stones with your clan\u2019s Moon Orchid Flower. The price was reasonable too. It was you, who was filled with treacherous intent. Being a complete hypocrite, you have tricked me into this position, and also had the idea to put the poisonous Gu in my wine. You guys have underestimated me. I have rampaged through the whole world. I used Hua Jiu as my name, how could I be affected by such poison?\u201dHua Jiu monk pointed at the fourth generation clan\u2019s head bowing on the ground, sneering non-stop, \u201cIf we were to cooperate well, such circumstances would not have happened. In the end, you wanted to fish for fame with my head. This is the consequence of your reckless sin; you can\u2019t live!\u201d\u201cYour honorable, please spare my dog-worthy life!\u201d The fourth generation clan\u2019s head was petrifying, he yelled. He used his knees to approach the Hua Jiu monk, gripping his thigh.\u201cYour honorable, my clan possesses a spiritual spring that can produce Primeval Stones. Inside the underground cave, we have a vast field of Moon Orchid Flowers. I\u2019m willing to eat your Slavery Gu and become your slave. My life depends on your thoughts and I will imitate my whole life for you!\u201dFang Yuan watched the scene without saying anything. The visages of several Elders were changing drastically after hearing that.Hua Jiu monk squinted his eyes and his flame of anger had soon ceased, light suddenly flickering non-stop in his eyes, \u201cHumph, Slavery Gu is extremely precious. They are level five Gu\u2019s; you think I would have it? Nevertheless, you have been poisoned by my peerless Poisonous Gu, without my Detoxifying Gu, I\u2019m afraid that you cannot resist the poison. If it has already been like this, your clan has to provide me with thirty catty of Moon Orchid\u2019s weekly, with another three thousand Primeval Stones on top of that. After each period, I will come here to take the flowers. At the same time, I will detoxify the poison inside of you once every time, sparing you your dog-worthy life.\u201d\u201cThank you to not killing me, many thanks to you honorable master!\u201d The fourth generation clan\u2019s head was yelling and kowtowing non-stop. Blood was constantly flowing as his forehead was hitting the stone ground.\u201cHumph, you don\u2019t need to kowtow. This kind of fawning low-life people is what I\u2019m most annoyed of. What is with the genius of the Ancient Moon clan, level five supreme master, you did not live up to your name. Serving me well is also a way for you to save your life... A!\u201d Hua Jiu monk suddenly shouted in terror. A gleam of fear appeared on his face.He sent the fourth generation clan\u2019s head flying with only a single kick. His body swayed as he alarmingly stepped back, yelling at the fourth clan\u2019s head, \u201cHow could you still have Gu?\u201dThe fourth generation clan\u2019s head spurted out a gush of blood as he was kicked in the chest. He was hardly able to stand up and a smiled beam on his countenance as he had fulfilled his scheme, \u201cHahaha, people following the demon way come and receive your death sentence! This Moonlight Gu\u2019s best ability is hiding. Although it is only at level four, it could still restrict the power of the Primeval Essence in the Primeval Sea. You demon, you and me have fought with each other vigorously. You don\u2019t have many Gus left on you, how can you prevent the Moonlight Gu? Obediently surrender, become my slave, and serve me nicely, I will let you live!\u201dHua Jiu monk was enraged, he growled, \u201cF*** off!!\u201dEven when he had not finished his sentence, his body plunged over like lightning, striking the fourth generation clan\u2019s head right at his heart.The fourth clan\u2019s head did not expect Hua Jiu monk to make such move. He did not feel afraid about the fact that his Primeval Sea had been threatened. He also did not want to compromise. Under the tremendous power, the fourth generation clan's head was immediately ripped off and flew outside. His body was like a broken burlap falling to the ground.Pulp.He gushed out a mouthful of blood. Numerous fragments of his organs were mixed with the blood.\u201cAre you crazy? We can totally talk over it...\u201d He glared at Hua Jiu monk with his lips trembling effortlessly. Before he got to finish his sentence, his two feet had given up, head titled. He had died.\u201cClan\u2019s head!!\u201d\u201cPeople following the demon way are all crazy.\u201d\u201cKill him, kill this demon. Get revenge for the clan\u2019s head!\u201d\u201cHe has been attacked by the Moonlight Gu. He can\u2019t freely urge his Primeval Essence anymore. His Primeval Sea will also soon be threatened.\u201dThe Elders who were observing the fight suddenly roared in rage, dashing forward.\u201cHahaha, if you want to die, come!\u201d Hua Jiu monk loudly yelled while facing the sky. Facing the attacks from those Elders, he was directly confronting it.After a period of constant fighting, Hua Jiu monk quickly gained the upper hand. Those Elders were all wounded, then paralyzingly fell down on the ground.As he wanted to strike one last killing attack, his face suddenly changed drastically. He abruptly covered his stomach with his hand, \u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cI will deal with you guys later.\u201d Hua Jiu monk fiercely widened his eyes and glared at the elderly group then ran away like lightning. He escaped into the forest and disappeared without a trace in just a blink.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Collected All into the SackTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cI dare you to move again.\u201d\u201cYou have been attacked by my peerless poisonous Gu. Without my corresponded detoxifying Gu, seven days later, you will definitely turn into pool of blood and die.\u201d\u201cCompared to the honorable Hua Jiu monk, I am nothing! I must have lost my consciousness when I had blindly offended Master Hua Jiu. Honorable Hua Jiu, please think of our sect\u2019s portrait of hospitality from before and spare me my life!\u201dOn the cliff, the image started to repeat itself the second time.Fang Yuan stayed silent all the way until the image had repeated itself the third time, he then deeply sighed, said, \u201cSo it was like this.\u201dThis method of putting the image and sound on the cliff must be used by the Saving Images Storing Sound Gu of Hua Jiu Monk. This Gu could engrave the images. Moreover, it could also project it.The Saving Images Storing Sound Gu lived by absorbing light and sound. The cave which was illuminated by an unknowing red light was not being isolated from external sounds due to the crack that ran from here to the outside. Staying in here, Fang Yuan could still hear the rumbling sound of that small waterfall outside.That was why this Saving Images Storing Sound Gu could live on the cliff of this secret cave.Before, as Fang Yuan had parted open the dried rattan, it must have incited the Saving Images Storing Sound Gu hiding on the cliff.As long as one was not an idiot, with a guess, they could still know that this image must be true.That year, the fourth generation clan\u2019s head had failed to plot against Hua Jiu monk. After the unsuccessful ambush, although he was sent flying backwards, he still died. This length of history did not look too pleasant. The remaining surviving Elders then attempted to hide this by deforming the facts.They reversed the role of the fourth generation clan\u2019s head and Hua Jiu monk.Hua Jiu monk was turned into a sneaky loser and was killed on the spot. The fourth generation clan\u2019s head, on the other hand, became a candid and upright hero.However, this folklore had a flaw in itself.So even if Hua Jiu monk was killed on the spot, then his corpse should be in the hands of the Ancient Moon clan, how could another corpse appear out of nowhere again?In his last life, the Gu Master who found this place must have been horrified after seeing the images on this cliff.Those surviving Elders might have already passed away. But to prevent Hua Jiu monk from returning, the truth had been secretly passed on through generations of high authority in the clan.That Gu Master had realized that if he kept the entire hidden legacy to himself, it would be too risky. Later on, if someone discovered that he was somehow related to Hua Jiu monk, the high authority of the clan would naturally want to expel him.Hence, after fighting off the dilemma between \u2018take it or leave it\u2019, as he did not dare to hide this legacy, he decided to report to the high authority.Such performance only proved his loyalty towards the clan even more. His consequences had also shown that what he had chosen was a good choice.However, because he had done that, did not mean that Fang Yuan would also do that.\u201cIt was tough in searching for this hidden legacy. I should keep it to myself, why should I share it with others? So what if I am exposed? Without risks, there won\u2019t beany big gains. That Gu Master really is a coward.\u201d Fang Yuan coldly laughed. He did not care about the repeating images on the cliff, but turned around, and used the force to part open the dried rattan.Hua Jiu monk\u2019s corpse was also damaged. Initially, it had been whole. But right now, it had been broken into several pieces.Fang Yuan did not care for one bit. He kicked a thigh bone under his feet, crouching down again to look for the legacy.Firstly, he discovered a bag of Primeval Stones. As he opened it, he only saw fifteen stones.\u201cPoor ghost.\u201d Fang Yuan spat out a sentence. Hua Jiu monk looked neat on the outside, so he did not expect him to have only saved so little.Anyhow, he then soon thought of the reason. After the fierce battle, and being attacked by the Moonlight Gu, Hua Jiu monk would definitely have used the Primeval Stones to heal himself. Being left with fifteen Primeval Stones was already considered not too bad.After that, Fang Yuan also discovered several dead Gus beside him. Most of them were Floral Flow Gus. They had all withered.Gu was also a living entity; they also needed food to nourish themselves. Moreover, the majority of them were very picky. Although Flower Gu and Grass Gu had little requirements on food, since this secret cave did not even have a single beam of light,After that...After that, there was nothing after that.At first, Hua Jiu monk was leading a fierce fight with the fourth generation clan\u2019s head; then he had confronted over ten Elders. He had wasted most of his Gus. When he reached this place, he wanted to heal himself. That was why he had urged the Wine Sack Flower Gu and Rice Pouch Grass Gu. However, in the end, he was killed by the Moonlight Gu.After three hundred years, the remaining Gu that he possessed had been all dead.The last one was just the Saving Images Storing Sound Gu and the Wine Gu.This Wine Gu must have depended on the Wine Sack Flower Gu to live until now. However, as the Wine Sack Flower Gu was slowly dying one by one, it lost its source of food.This had urged it to go outside, looking for the wild Wine Sack Flower Gu.Afterwards, tonight, he was attracted by the thick scent of the Green Bamboo wine and went in front of Fang Yuan.\u201c The Saving Images Storing Sound Gu can only be used once; it is a consuming type of Gu. It seems that the Wine Gu is my biggest reward. No wonder that Gu Master wanted to inform the clan. The benefit is too small; it is not worth the big risks.\u201d A beam of enlightenment rose inside Fang Yuan\u2019s heart.In his memory, that Gu Master was already at level three, and the Wine Gu was only a level one Gu. To Fang Yuan, it could be very precious. But to that Gu Master, it was something he could either have or not have.However, obviously, because the Gu Master had informed them, the clan had also rewarded him.\u201cI should also report this, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Fang Yuan thought for a while then quickly erased this intention.The hidden legacy of Hua Jiu monk seemed to only have the Wine Gu and Primeval Stones.The truly valuable thing was the Saving Images Storing Sound Gu hiding on the cliff.Or to say, it was the repeated images which were being projected on the cliff.These images could totally be sold to other mountain strongholds. He believed the other two highest mountain strongholds on the Green Thatch Mountain would be extremely interested in such undeniable evidence that could strike a big blow on the beliefs of one clan. Stating a price, of course, was much more benefiting than the clan\u2019s rewards.What?Did you just say the honor of the clan and the loyalty?His deepest apology, Fang Yuan did not have a single bit of those.Not to mention this image could not create a strong impact as to destroy the clan. There were not many actual damages that were being caused by these images anyway.Moreover, the cold-hearted clan would not have valued Fang Yuan. He needed to try hard by himself, developing resources for cultivating as well as borrowing power from everywhere before the actual cultivating process.\u201cDepend on the clan? Haha.\u201d Fang Yuan coldly snorted, \u201cI can\u2019t be as naive as I had been in my past life anymore.\u201dDon\u2019t put your hopes on anyone. In this world, you have to depend on yourself.After ensuring that he had collected everything in this secret cave, Fang Yuan followed the previous path and returned.Passing through the water pressure, getting out of the giant stone, he once again returned to the outside of the mountain. Looking back at the giant stone, Fang Yuan suddenly recalled the memories in his past life. He remembered, they said that the corpse was found in a secret underground cave. But how could this be underground? It clearly was inside the mountain cliff.No wonder he had wasted his efforts in going around such big obstacles and not being able to find it in seven days straight.It seemed that in his previous life, after the clan had discovered this place, obviously, they would firstly destroy the cliff with the images. Then they would release untrue news, lying to their clan members.The discovery he had made tonight, one part was thanks to his luck, the other was his accumulation. But most of it was because of the Green Bamboo Wine.The thick and dense fragrance of this wine could be considered the best in the Green Thatch Mountain.Maybe, in his previous life, the wine that had made Gu Master drunk could be this wine.Nevertheless, none of that mattered anymore. Fang Yuan had collected all of Hua Jiu monk\u2019s legacy. Although the result was only acceptable, it was still reasonable. The most important thing was that Fang Yuan had achieved his initial goal of catching that Wine Gu. Right now, he almost had the thing he needed the most (Primeval Stones).\u201cNext, I have to focus on cultivating the Gu in the tavern. I can return to the schoolhouse with just this Vital Gu. I will also be qualified to stay at the dorm in the schoolhouse, as well as using the resources of the clan to cultivate. I should only stay at the tavern for one or two days. It costs too much.\u201d Fang Yuan considered as he did not stop his footsteps, running straight to the mountain stronghold.At first, he was left with two Primeval Stones. Now, he gained another fifteen on top of that, making the total come up to seventeen stones. However, to a Gu Master, that amount of Primeval Stones was still considered nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: The Beginning of Cultivating the Wine GuTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cWith my level C aptitude, the maximum Primeval Sea that my vain aperture could store is only at forty-four percent capacity. The speed that the Gu is using to expel my Primeval Essence is much faster than the recovering speed of my Primeval Essence. If I want to cultivate the Gu, I will then need to borrow power from external forces. In other words, I need to use Primeval Stones.\u201d\u201cGu with weaker willpower will have weaker resistance. Hence, my cultivating process will be easier. Anyhow, being a living entity, they always possess this willpower of wanting to live. If I want to cultivate the Moonlight Gu, I will need at least five Primeval Stones, or eight at most.\u201d Based on his profuse cultivating experience, Fang Yuan tried to calculate the total Primeval Stones that he was about to use.\u201cRight now, if I want to cultivate the Wine Gu, I would need at least ten Primeval Stones, and sixteen at the most.\u201d Although the Wine Gu was not much different from the Moonlight Gu, they were both level one Gus. However, as the Wine Gu was rarer, undoubtedly, cultivating it would also be harder.In other words, even though Fang Yuan had a total of seventeen Primeval Stones right now. After cultivating the Wine Gu, he could only save six Primeval Stones left, or only one at most, according to his words.The light from the crescent moon was emanating through the dark night.The moonlight was as gentle as the hands of a fairy, softly caressing the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold. The bamboo houses were like jade tablets, standing close to each other.The night breeze was gently flowing by.Under the moonlight, Fang Yuan returned to his tavern.The tavern was already closed.Fang Yuan then knocked on the door, bang bang sound constantly reverberated.\u201cI heard you! I heard you! Aiya, who would knock at this time....\u201d The servant of the tavern was mumbling while opening the door. He was still sleepy.However, as soon as he saw Fang Yuan at the door, his resentful and lazy expression immediately changed. He lowered his head, flatteringly smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s young master. It\u2019s my honor to open the door for young master.\u201dFang Yuan nodded. With a cold expression, he walked in.His expression made the servant smiled even pettier; he took the initiative to ask, \u201cYoung master, are you hungry? Do you want me to inform the chief to make some night snack for you?\u201d\u201cNo need to.\u201d Fang Yuan shook his head, then said, \u201cPrepare for me some warm water, I want to wash my face.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The servant hurriedly nodded, \u201cYoung master, please return to your room first. I guarantee that warm water will be brought to you immediately.\u201dFang Yuan mumbled a yes and then headed to the stairs, walking to the second floor.As the servant was looking at Fang Yuan\u2019s figure, his pair of eyes was beaming with light of admiration.\u201cThis is a Gu Master. If I also have an aptitude for cultivating, how nice would that be!\u201d He tightened his fist and then deeply sighed.This sole sentence had reached Fang Yuan\u2019s ear; he could not help but beam a bitter smile inside.Gu Masters possessed extraordinary power and became the higher class in society. Nonetheless, the price they had to pay was also not low. It was up high.The first problem was financial resources.Gu Masters required Primeval Stones for cultivating, fighting, and refining Gu, business trading.Without Primeval Stones, how could one cultivate?Such outsiders like the ordinary tavern\u2019s servant would not be able to understand such distress.It was the same with when the young Gu Master named Jiang Ya from this evening had angrily vented on those hunters while throwing the jug of wine on the ground. Even I myself do not dare to waste my Primeval Stones on this jug of Green Bamboo Wine. You ordinary hunter even dare to leisurely use money like that!A peep through a tube at a leopard[1], this could already conclude the situation of a Gu Master.Gu Masters possessed formidable powers. Compared to an ordinary human, they made more, but also wasted more. There were many times when they had to haggle over every single cent when talking about Primeval Stones, especially for low-level Gu Masters.Do not just look at the neat appearance of a Gu Master, inside; their lives were always in strict financial straits.\u201cMoreover, as their levels are enhanced, their requirements on resources would also increase. Without any backup, the cultivating path of a Gu Master is challenging.\u201d Remembering his past life, Fang Yuan had understood this point clearly.He returned to his room. As soon as he lit up the lamp, the servant instantly brought up a basin of warm water.Of course, there were also towels and basic neccesities used for washing one\u2019s face.Fang Yuan dismissed the servant. Afterwards, he closed the door, put on the latch, washed his face then returned to his bed.Although he was quite tired, a gleam of excitementstill remained in his heart, \u201cI have finally found the Wine Gu. The Wine Gu was much more rarer than the Moonlight Gu. According to that, it could enhance the aptitude of the Gu Masters!\u201dFang Yuan sat cross-legged on the bed, and took out the Wine Gu.The Wine Gu was still deeply asleep. It was relatively bigger than the Moonlight Gu. With a snowy white color, it looked like a silkworm.Underneath the lamp light, its body was covered with a layer of faint light, like a mellow and round shining pearl. Its eyes were like two black sesame seeds that were inlaid on its fat head, showing off a silly and palpable appearance.Holding it in his hand, it was not heavy. It seemed to be about the weight of half of a bird\u2019s egg.When carefully smelled, one could sense the wine fragrance coming out from its body.This fragrance was not that of the Green Bamboo Wine, but it was from the Gu\u2019s body. The faint scent was vague. Fang Yuan wrinkled his nose, trying to inhale the scent of the wine into his body.His breath carrying the wine fragrance immediately traveled down below, entering his vain aperture and intruding the Bronze Primeval Sea in the middle.The Primeval Sea slightly swayed and then quickly absorbed this breeze of the wine\u2019s scent. An extremely refined beam of Primeval Essence was released.Different from the normal emerald Primeval Essence, this one was flickering with a copper colored light.However, this beam of Primeval Essence was also dark blue. Compared to the initial Primeval Essence, it was more compact. This was the Primeval Essence that only an Intermediate level one Gu Master could urge.Discovering that dark blue beam of Bronze Primeval Essence, Fang Yuan satisfyingly smiled, \u201cMy current cultivation base is Beginner level one. Anyhow, being compacted by the Wine Gu, the Primeval Essence that I release after that can be the Primeval Essence of an Intermediate level one Gu Master. The wonderful thing about this really cannot be explained in two or three sentences.\u201dNevertheless, quickly after that, he had retrieved his smile, \u201cHowever, I still have not officially seized this Wine Gu. I have to totally refine this Gu, turn it into my Vitality Gu, being able to freely control it, then use its best efficiency to refine my own Primeval Essence.\u201dThinking like that, he did not hesitate anymore. He urged a beam of Bronze Primeval Essence from his Primeval Sea.The Primeval Essence tightly covered the Wine Gu, brought it to Fang Yuan\u2019s front, and started to intrude its body.As it could feel that something was threatening its life, the Wine Gu immediately woke up. It began to struggle fiercely. Urging the power from its body, it was trying to expel Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Essence.\u201cThis Wine Gu is resisting too harshly.\u201d With a solemn expression, Fang Yuan could feel that his Primeval Stone was being drained at a speed that doubled when he was trying it with the Moonlight Gu.\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m certainly able to refine this Wine Gu.\u201d A gleam of determination flashed in his pair of eyes. He continued urging the Primeval Essence, heading towards the Wine Gu.A calm candle light brightened up the interior of room in the tavern. The middle of the room was being shone upon, while the room\u2019s corners were filled with darkness.The candlelight shone on Fang Yuan\u2019s face, who had now already closed both of his eyes, focusing on handling this Wine Gu.A long beam of Bronze Primeval Essence was like a cloud of mists, emitting from Fang Yuan\u2019s entire body, gathering to where the Wine Gu was, encircling and suppressing it.The Wine Gu which was floating on air was not even one tchi[2] away from Fang Yuan. It was vigorously struggling in the middle of the Bronze Primeval Essence.Time silently flew by.The candle was melting down, making the candlelight turning dimmer. The crescent moon had almost descended from outside the window. A new day was dawning fast.The sunlight of the dawn was piercing through the window\u2019s crack, shining inside the room. As if it was outlining the window with sunlight.Fang Yuan opened his eyes, looking at the Wine Gu right in front of him.The Wine Gu\u2019s white body was somewhat turning towards a hue of dark blue. This was the result of Fang Yuan diligently working for half of the night.However, obviously, that spot of dark green color was not even one hundredth of the Wine Gu\u2019s body.Fang Yuan\u2019s face became solemn. The willpower of this Wine Gu was too tenacious. Its resistance was also extremely forceful. This had soon surpassed the limits of a level one Gu.\u201cThere is a high possibility that this Gu is Hua Jiu monk\u2019s Vitality Gu. Hua Jiu monk was a level five supreme master. Initially, this Gu was also at level five. However, through several years of lacking food, its grade has dropped. Right now, it is only at level one, but its willpower is as solid as stone!\u201dFang Yuan had accurately guessed this.This Wine Gu used to be Hua Jiu monk\u2019s Vitality Gu. Before, its natural willpower had been completely washed away by Hua Jiu monk. Afterward, it accompanied Hua Jiu monk, constantly fighting with him from north to south, and rampaged through the whole world.After Hua Jiu monk had died, he left a gleam of supreme willpower inside this Wine Gu. Right now, Fang Yuan wanted to refine this Wine Gu was like competing with Hua Jiu monk\u2019s willpower.This was much harder than refining a natural Gu.The willpower of a regular person was normally higher than that of a natural Gu. Facing death, a human could burst out unimaginable never-before-seen powers. And Hua Jiu monk was a supreme master on the Demon Path. Going on a rampage around the whole world by himself, his willpower had soon been tougher than that of the masters of the righteous sect\u2019s who were at the same level as him.\u201cIt is impossible for me to refine this Wine Gu in a month. Unless there is some supreme master, who can use their level two or three power to suppress this Wine Gu, oppressing its willpower to its lowest point. With such aid, I may be able to succeed.\u201d Thinking to here, Fang Yuan could not help but deeply sighed.His parents had all passed away. His aunt and uncle were deviously scheming against him. Without any backup, how could he find someone to help?It would be easier if he was a grade A aptitude. However, right now, he was only a grade C. No one in this clan valued him, who would be willing to waste such efforts in trying to help him?More importantly, the Wine Gu could not be exposed.The Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold did not have this kind of Gu. Fang Yuan would not be able to explain where this Gu came from.If it was exposed, there would be a high possibility that the high authority would realize this, hence, discovered its relation with Hua Jiu monk. By then, it would be easy to imagine the connection between the two.\u201cIf it is so, seventeen Primeval Stones would not be enough. It would have to be at least thirty! This is too annoying. But no matter how hard it is, I still want to refine this Wine Gu.\u201d With his will of steel, Fang Yuan had decided to refine this Wine Gu determinedly.A Vitality Gu had a great relation, as well as significant effects on the path a Gu Master chose to cultivate later on.Although the Wine Gu was not the most ideal Gu to be used as the Vitality Gu, it was still better than the Moonlight Gu. With Fang Yuan\u2019s circumstances, this was his best option.Gurgle, gurgle...Right then, Fang Yuan\u2019s stomach started growling.It was natural for him to be hungry since he had stayed awake the whole night diligently cultivating the Wine Gu.\u201cI should fill up my stomach first before thinking about saving up Primeval Stones.\u201d Fang Yuan stroked his stomach and walked downstairs.Entering the luncheonette, he sat down at a corner, and started to choose his meal.As soon as he began to eat, his didi Gu Yue Fang Zheng appeared.\u201cGege, why are you staying at the tavern? Why haven\u2019t you been coming home at night?\u201d He was blunt about it as an inquiring tone could be heard in his voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Making Past Events Drifting Like SmokeTranslator: - - Editor: - -Facing his didi\u2019s questions, Fang Yuan did not say a word but continued to eat his breakfast. He understood his didi\u2019s personality well. Fang Zheng was now impatient.As expected, as Fang Zheng saw his gege he did not even bother to spare him a glance, treating him as if he was air, he immediately used a resentful tone, then yelled, \u201cGege, what did you do to Shen Cui? After she had come out of your room yesterday, she was constantly crying. When I tried to console her, she cried even more.\u201dFang Yuan looked at his didi without any change of expression on his face.Fang Cheng furrowed his brows, staring attentively at his didi, waiting for his answer.The atmosphere was getting tenser and tenser.However, Fang Yuan only looked at him once, then lowered his head and continued eating.His didi Fang Zheng seemed unable to breathe for a while. Such attitude from Fang Yuan had meant that he was really despising him. As Fang Zheng was embarrassed, he slammed the table, shouted out loudly, \u201cGu Yue Fang Yuan, how could you act like this! She is just a small maid. I have witnessed how she has served you and cared for you for all these years . I knew you that you are lost; I also understand that you are dispirited. But even if you are only a grade C aptitude, you can not take your anger out on somebody else just because you can not accept it. This is unfair for her!\u201dHe did not even get to finish his sentence as Fang Yuan had immediately stood up and raised his hand as fast as lightning.Bam!A loud sound reverberated. Fang Zheng had received a firm slap.Fang Zheng, carrying an astonished expression, covered his right cheek and took two steps back.\u201cShameful! What kind of tone are you using to talk to your own gege?! That Shen Cui is just a servant. You have forgotten that I am your gege just because of a woman?\u201d Fang Yuan lowered his voice, rebuking.When Fang Zheng could react, the pain on his face had transferred to his nerve. He widened his eyes, breathing heavily while unbelievably saying, \u201cGe, you hit me? You have never hit me even when we were young! So what if I am measured out to be an A grade aptitude while you are only a C grade. You can not blame me; this is destined...\u201dBam!Fang Zheng was not able to finish his sentence when Fang Yuan had swept his hand backward for another slap.Fang Zheng covered his two cheeks with both hands, he was dumbstruck.\u201cYou blockhead, what can you still remember! From when you were young till now, how did I take care of you? When our parent passed away when our life was miserable when aunt and uncle gave us only one new suit of clothes, did I wear it by myself? Who did I give it to? When you were young, I have told the kitchen people to make a bowl of sweet congee for you every day because you had loved it then. When outsiders hadbullied you, who helped you regained your pride? There are several more things, but it is not worth talking about. And now, you used such a tone to talk to me, to question me, all because of a maid?\u201dFang Zheng\u2019s face was reddened. His lips were trembling; he was angry yet embarrassed at the same time. However, he could not find anything to retort to that.Because whatever Fang Yuan said were all true!\u201cSo what,\u201d Fang Yuan was coldly smiling non-stop, \u201cYou even forgot your own parents, and accepted someone else, what am I anyway?\u201d\u201cGe, you can not say it like that. You knew that I desired a happy family even when I was young, I...\u201d Fang Zheng quickly tried to defend himself.Fang Yuan waved his hand, preventing him from continuing talking, \u201cFrom today onward, you are not my didi, I am also not your gege anymore.\u201d\u201cGe!\u201d Fang Zheng was terrified, he opened his mouth, attempting to talk.But right then, Fang Yuan said first, \u201cYou like Shen Cui, do you? Do not worry; I did not do anything to her. She is still a maiden, an untouched virgin. Give me six Primeval Stones, and I will give her to you. From now on, she will be your personal servant.\u201d\u201cGe, how can you...\u201d As his intention was exposed, Fang Zheng fluttered. He did not expect this.However, at the same time, he was feeling certain inside. The thing that he was most worried about did not happen. (He was referring to what FY could have done to SC that night)That one night in the house, Shen Cui had served him his washings, all by herself.Even though nothing had really happened, Fang Zheng could never be able to forget that one mild night. Whenever he thought about Shen Cui, about her flexible hands, her plum cherry lips, he could not help but felt the throbbing feelings that arose in his heart.The adolescent passion had soon accumulated in his heart. Moreover, it was germinating.Hence, yesterday when he figured out the abnormal thing about Shen Cui, a fierce breath was suddenly released in his innermost desires. At that time, he had forgotten about refining the Moonlight Gu. On the contrary, he went to search around the whole mountain stronghold for Fang Yuan, wanting to have a word with him.As he did not hear Fang Zheng\u2019s reply, Fang Yuan frowned, \u201cPassionate love between a man and a woman is extremely normal. You should be more straightforward, why avoid it? Of course, if you do not want to trade, then forget it.\u201dFang Zheng instantly became anxious, \u201cTrade, how could I not. But for the price of six Primeval Stones, I do not have enough right now.\u201dAfter he had finished, he took out a big pouch while his face was still reddened.Fang Yuan received the pouch only to find six stones inside. However, one of them was half the size of a regular Primeval Stone. He immediately knew that this was the Primeval Stones that Fang Zheng was using to absorb the Primeval Essence, to quickly refine the Moonlight Gu.Followed its natural Primeval Essence being sucked out, the Primeval Stone became small. Its weight also became lighter.Although there were only five and a half, Fang Yuan knew: This were all the Primeval Stones that Fang Zheng had. He had not saved up any. Hence, these six should be what their aunt and uncle had given him that day.\u201cI have received these Primeval Stones. You can go now.\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s expression was cold; he put the pouch into his bosom.\u201cGege...\u201d Fang Zheng still wanted to talk.Fang Yuan slightly raised his brows, slowly spoke, \u201cIt\u2019s best that you disappear right now before I change my mind.\u201dFang Zheng was tensed. He slightly bit his lip, then turned around, and left.As he stepped out of the tavern, he unconsciously covered his chest as he felt wave after wave of fatigue was rising. It seemed like, in the darkness, his feeling was telling him he had lost something extremely important right at this moment.His heart quickly boiled up. He thought about Shen Cui, along with that enticing night.\u201c I can finally be with you rightly and properly, Cui Cui.\u201d He did not turn back while slowly getting out of Fang Yuan\u2019s vision.Fang Yuan\u2019s countenance did not change. He stood still for a while before slowly sitting down.The sunlight was piercing through the window, shining upon his visage of indifference, giving people an icy-cold feeling.The business of this luncheonette was quite tranquil. As loud sounds coming from the crowd walking on the street were reverberating, this place became even more lonesome.Because his breakfast had gone cold, the servant politely approached him, asking whether he needed to warm up his food again.Fang Yuan refused to hear it as his eyes were like fluctuated and indefinite clouds. He seemed to have remembered something.When the servant saw that Fang Yuan was baffled and did not reply, he slightly stroked his nose, then angrily left.After a while, consciousness returned to Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes.The memory he recalled was like smoke, which had gradually drifted away.He then remembered the real world, where the sunlight was shining on half of the table. The warmness of the food had already scattered, and the loud voices of the people walking on the street also resounded in his eyes.He used his hand to touch that five and a half Primeval Stones in his bosom, which was being separated by a layer of clothes. A bitter and mocking smile then flashed on the corner of his mouth.However, that beam of smile was instantly retrieved.\u201cServant, go warm up the food.\u201d As Fang Yuan was glancing at the food, he casually opened his mouth and yelled.At this moment, his pupils were incredibly clear.......\u201cWhat! Your brother said so?\u201d In a room, his uncle frowned. The voice carried a gleam of coldness.Aunt immediately sat beside him. As she saw the red palm print on each side of Fang Zheng\u2019s cheeks, she remained silent.\u201cYes, I saw gege when he was having breakfast at a tavern. And that what all that have happened.\u201d Fang Zheng respectfully replied.Uncle furrowed his brows even more, almost forming the word Chuan (\u5ddd).After several breaths, he deeply exhaled. He spoke with a solemn tone, \u201cFang Zheng, my son, you have to remember. The maid Shen Cui is not Fang Yuan\u2019s property, but what we have given him, how can she be traded? Not to mention, if you want her, you should have soon told us, we will give her to you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d After hearing that, Fang Zheng widened his eyes and mouth.Uncle waved his hand, \u201cYou should leave first. You have given Fang Yuan all of your Primeval Stones. I will give you another six. Remember; you need to use these on refining Gu. If you could rank first, we will be very proud of you.\u201d\u201cFather, I\u2019m ashamed...\u201d At the moment, Fang Zheng was touched as tears were falling down.Uncle deeply sighed, \u201cLeave, leave first. Go back to your room quickly and refine your Gu. You have wasted lots of time.\u201dWhen Fang Zheng left, uncle immediately displayed his anger on his visage.BANG!He fiercely slammed his hand on the table top, yelled in a low tone, \u201cHumph, you rascal, you even dared to do business with my men. You really are cunning!\u201dHis aunt hurried advised, \u201cHusband, please do not be mad. It was just six Primeval Stones.\u201d\u201cYou women, what do you know? Fang Yuan is a grade C aptitude. If he wants to refine a Gu, he has to use Primeval Stones. With his amateur skill in refining Gu, six Primeval Stones would definitely not be enough. But now he has twelve. This is more than enough.\u201d Uncle could not help but gritted his teeth.He continued, \u201cA Gu Master\u2019s cultivation base will increase fast as long as they have enough resources, and do not encounter any impasse. Within two or three years, the clan can already nourish a bunch of level two Gu Masters. With Fang Yuan\u2019s low aptitude, the possibility that he can take back the inheritance is even smaller after a year later Now, he is still young. As he has just started cultivating, if we create some impasses for him, we can make his cultivating process become slower than those at his age. The schoolhouse only rewards excellent disciples. With his aptitude, not to mention being left behind with the others, he will not be able to receive any resources. Without resources to aid his cultivation, he will be even worse. With things being like that, a year later, how can he still be qualified to inherit the inheritance?\u201dAunt was confused, \u201cEven if we do not stop him, after a year, the best level that he could possibly be at is just an Intermediate level one. Husband, your cultivation base is at level two. Why do you need to be so scared of him?\u201dUncle was so angry he was stomping, \u201cHonorable woman, you really have long hair but short mind! I am an elder generation, why should I be fighting against a younger generation? If he wants to retrieve the inheritance, it would be reasonable. Basically, we can not prevent him from doing so; we can only follow what was written in the clan\u2019s regulation. The clan\u2019s regulation has clearly declared: A person at the age of sixteen has to be at least at an Intermediate cultivation base to get married and open their own business,. If not, then it is clear why Fang Yuan does not qualify for wasting the clan\u2019s resources. Do you understand now?\u201dAunt suddenly saw the light.Uncle squinted his eyes, which were beaming with cold light. He slightly shook his head, exclaimed, \u201cFang Yuan is really clever and cunning. He could see through our seducing scheme, how can he be so clever? Having rigorous schemes and deep foresight at such young age, how terrifying! I was thinking about putting up another scheme, but he has left the house already. I wanted to use Shen Cui to look after as well as disturb him, but he has kicked her away, even gained six Primeval Stones from it.\u201d\u201cHaizz, it would be good if he could be as naive as Fang Zheng. That\u2019s right; you need to treat Fang Zheng better, he is a grade A aptitude. Moreover, as I see, he seemed not to give in or resigned to Fang Yuan. Such good emotion, we need to incite and cultivate it further. I can feel that, in the future, he will become the best weapon to handle Fang Yuan!\u201d.....Two days had passed in a blink.No light was being lit inside the room of the tavern. As the moonlight was piercing through, it shone on the open ground, showing a frost gray color.On the bed, Fang Yuan was sitting cross-legged. He urged the Bronze Primeval Essence and focused his mind on refining the Wine Gu.A small part of the Wine Gu\u2019s body had been dyed with a bronze-green color. However, its strong willpower still remained. It was struggling non-stop while being encircled inside the smoke-like Primeval Essence.Fang Yuan\u2019s refining Gu process was extremely tough. It could be said as walking with difficulty.\u201c I have spenttwo days and two nights, only rested for two hours each day, wasted twelve Primeval Stones. And all I can do was just cultivating this Gu to fifteen percent. According to the time, a few days from today, there will be people who have already succeeded in cultivating their Gu.\u201dFang Yuan could clearly see the circumstances.However, his aptitude was already low, but right now, he was refining a Gu with an extreme stubborn willpower. Compared to the Moonlight Gu, its willpower was even stronger. With that, creating such a retrogress situation, was extremely normal.\u201cTo temporarily fall behind is nothing, I just need the Wine Gu...\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s heart was like a mirror, did not have a single beam of anxiousness or discouragement.However, right then, the Wine Gu abruptly huddled its body and stood up, curling up in a ball.\u201cNot good, the Gu is rebelling!\u201d Fang Yuan widened his eyes as a ray of astonishment appeared in his eyes. In front of him, the Wine Gu was curling up in a ball like a shining wonton, fiercely releasing blinding white aureole.He decided to bet all of that on a single throw!Instantly, Fang Yuan felt a formidable intent that came from the Wine Gu\u2019s body, directly passed by his Primeval Essence and fell into the Primeval Sea in his vain aperture.It was extremely rare for a Gu to rebel. Only this kind of firm-willed Gu could have used all of its power to either make or break it.If this were another young man, facing such situation, he would definitely be terrified.However, Fang Yuan was not scared nor panicked. On the contrary, he was quite excited, \u201cEither make or break is also good. If I could handle his rebellion, I could significantly decrease his firm willpower. However, next, I have to congeal my mentality to cope with the intent of this Gu with all of my efforts. I can not be interrupted by any external forces. If not, then it will not be good. Haizz.... Let\u2019s just hope no one will interrupt me now.\u201dAfter thinking about it, he wanted to urge the Primeval Essence in his vain aperture, then confronted that Gu\u2019s intent. He was thinking about coping with it for good, fighting three hundred rounds with it.However, right then, an abnormality happened again!A Gu distinctively appeared in the middle of his Primeval Sea in his vain aperture.BOOM BOOM!This Gu was releasing an extremely formidable breath.The breath of this Gu was as if the Milky Way was pouring down in torrents, or had abruptly busted out of a flood, or a giant beast\u2019s prestige was being offended, wanted to see who had dared to intrude its territory!\u201cThis is the Spring and Autumn Cicada ?!\u201d Looking at this Gu, Fang Yuan was already thoroughly astonished !!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Level Six Vitality Spring And Autumn Cicada!Translator: - - Editor: - -During the refining process, the Gu abruptly fought back!The Wine Gu, which possessed Hua Jiu monk\u2019s firm willpower was intruding his vain aperture, casually fought back with Fang Yuan.This beam of formidable intent was heading toward the bottom of his Bronze Primeval Sea, fiercely attacking him.And the Bronze Primeval Sea fluctuated frantically, with waves after waves continually arising. Fang Yuan urged his intent, wanting to confront the great godlike Primeval Essence of the Gu, creating a surging wave soaring to the sky, outrageously welcoming the Wine Gu\u2019s intent.Just when both were about to come in contact at the center of his vain aperture, they bestially impacted with each other, a dull Gu suddenly appeared in the middle of the two forces, right in the empty space of his vain aperture.It was a cicada.The cicada was not too big. If the Moonlight Gu was a crescent-moon-shaped crystal blue color shining Gu, then this cicada was like a delicate handicraft made from the hand of an artisan master out of palm wood and tree leaves.Its head and body were light brown, coated with growth ring patterns as if it was a witness of time.A pair of big wings on his back was half transparent, looked like two overlapping tree leaves. Each of the wings also had veined patterns that were almost identical. These veined patterns were similar to that venation of a natural leaf. The center was a thick stem while the other veins were spread out to both sides from the stem.The Spring and Autumn Cicada!It was disturbed.It looked like a giant beast which normally was deep asleep inside a cave. However, as he was awakened, only to find his territory was being intruded.Who dare to act atrociously in my territory!As if his dignity was being offended, the Spring and Autumn Cicada was enraged, releasing distinctive breath.The breath was vague yet formidable, like a torrential Milky Way surging ahead wanted to wash away ten thousand miles of mountains, covering firmament and great deserts with its vast and mighty waves!Compared to this breath, the Wine Gu\u2019s intent was like an ant encountering an elephant!This breath expanded to sweep over the whole surroundings, like a terrifying tsunami being controlled by an invisible force. The Wine Gu\u2019s intent which wanted to encroach, was directly being swallowed by this tsunami, without having any ability to avoid it.Fang Yuan\u2019s chest felt uncomfortable.The beam of Bronze Primeval Essence that he had urged impacted this breath, which was like a giant wave striking the Tianshan mountain. The Primeval Essense he had congealed immediately crashed down then shattered like rain; all was spilled to the Primeval Sea in the middle.Bang!Waves after waves arose on the Primeval Sea\u2019 surface. It was as if a heavy rain had increased the fluctuation level.After several breaths, the breath of the Spring and Autumn Gu was spread downward, pushing down on the Primeval Sea.BANG!As Fang Yuan heard the faint buzzing sound, in a blink, the torrential Primeval Sea instantly became tranquil.The Spring and Autumn Cicada was using its breath to firmly oppress the entire Primeval Sea, like an invisible giant suppressing the mountains. There was not a single wave rolling on the sea surface; it was as calm as a mirror.It was like a former crooked paper was immediately smoothened by massive hands of a giant which was formed from its breath.This was a superior power!Fang Yuan felt as if his heart was being suppressed by a massive invisible mountain, like when the Five Elements Mountain was being put down on the Monkey named Sun[1]. No matter how hard he tried to urge his Primeval Essence, nothing arose.However, although he was shocked, he was not scared. On the contrary, a gleam of happy feelings appeared in his heart.\u201cI can not believe that the Spring and Autumn Cicada have been reborn along with me! So it is not a one-time usage Gu, but a multiple times usage one.\u201dThe Spring And Autumn Cicada was a level six Gu. In Fang Yuan\u2019s past life, it was his first level six Gu, and also was his last. To refine it, Fang Yuan had used all methods and resources. With tremendous strength and around thirty years of preparation, he had succeeded in refining it with much luck.Nevertheless, not long after that, when he had not even warmed up the Spring And Autumn Cicada, as the righteous sects felt a threat from Fang Yuan, they decided to use area attack to kill him.After being reborn, Fang Yuan could not notice the Spring And Autumn Cicada. Hence, he thought it had vanished. In fact, it had been placed in Fang Yuan\u2019s body,staying dormant.Turning back five hundred years had consumed much of its strength. It was weak, too weak that even its master - Fang Yuan, could not feel its existence.Although the Spring And Autumn Cicada had appeared, the situation was still troublesome.From when he was reborn, it always remained in its dormant state to recover itself. Why it had now appeared was because of its feeling about the threat towards the vain aperture. It was awakened by the Wine Gu\u2019s intent.It was feeble, very feeble, extremely feeble.In Fang Yuan\u2019s memory, the vitality of a Spring And Autumn Cicada was abundant. Its body was like a precious floor, emitting soft shining light. Its two wings werelight green. They were like two new leaves spurting out from inside.But right now, a whiff of stern and deathly stillness breath was released from its body. The body of the cicada did not show off any light. Only a coarse and dismal appearance could be seen, it did not look much different from a dead tree. The color of its pair of wings was not even faintly green, it was a dry yellow color, like withering leaves that almost fell in autumn. Moreover, the tips of its wings were slightly curled up. The damaged wings were as leaves with dwindling edges.Toward this, Fang Yuan was feeling lucky as well as painful.The painful thing was that this Spring And Autumn Cicada was severely wounded. Like standing on the edge, it was only a line away from death.As luck would have it, the Spring And Autumn Cicada were already fatigued to this extent. If not, he would be the one who would have encountered great trouble!One needed to know, at the same time, Gu Masters and Gu had to support each other. It was best for them to be at the same level.A level one Gu Master should use level one Gu. This was the ideal way.If the Gu had a lower level compared to the Gu Master, when the Gu Master used it, it would be like a strong man carrying a crabstick. It would be powerless.If a Gu had a higher level than the Gu Master, then as the Gu Master was using it, it would be similar to a child holding a heavy lumberjack axe. The will was there, but not the strength.The Spring And Autumn Cicada was a level six Gu while Fang Yuan was only a tiny Beginner level one Gu Master. Using images to compare, then the Spring And Autumn Cicada was a mountain, and Fang Yuan was only a squirrel. The squirrel wanted to lift the mountain to smash its opponent, but before that, it was already being crushed by the mountain.If the Spring And Autumn Cicada were at its peak status, as the little vain aperture of a level one Gu Master would not be able to hold it, it would directly be deadly broken due to the overwhelming breath.Luckily it was at the worst stage of its capacity, as Fang Yuan\u2019s Primeval Sea was able to contain it.\u201cI gave up the Moonlight Gu, trying my best to find the Wine Gu to refine it into my Vital Gu. But in fact, I have soon had my Vital Gu. The Spring And Autumn Cicada is my Vital Gu!\u201d After feeling the close connection he had between himself and the Spring And Autumn Cicada, Fang Yuan could not help but exclaim inside.Vital Gu was the first Gu that a Gu Master refined. It was extremely critical as it would have a significant role in almost every aspect of a Gu Master later on.Choosing a good Vital Gu meant it would be easier for the Gu Master to develop. A weak Vital Gu would affect the cultivating process of a Gu Master. He would stay behind compared to those at his age. The most critical thing was that it could also affect their battling in terms of being dead or alive.Fang Yuan clearly understood this point. Hence, even though he had chosen the suppressing Gu of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold which was the Moonlight Gu, he was still not satisfied. He had used thousand ways and hundred of plans to find the Wine Gu.In his memory, for an amateur Gu Master, the Wine Gu was already a top-notch decision. The Moonlight Gu was only a middle-class Gu.However, the most enticing things in life were the situations that no one would ever be able to know what awaited them.In his previous life, Fang Yuan had refined a Spring And Autumn Cicada. After being reborn, although the Spring And Autumn Cicada had fell asleep, this kind of refining relationship still remained.Moreover, after being washed by the River of Time, Fang Yuan discovered the connection between him and the Spring And Autumn Cicada was even tighter and closer than that of his past life. Fang Yuan was not able to sense it because the Spring And Autumn Cicada was getting too fatigued.Therefore, according to the genuine meaning, the Spring And Autumn Cicada was the first Gu that he had refined.Only that Fang Yuan did not refine this Spring And Autumn Cicada in this life, but it was the result of his effort five hundred years ago.The Spring And Autumn Cicada was Fang Yuan\u2019s Vital Gu.A level one Gu Master possessed a level six Vital Gu!If someone heard this, they might not be able to believe it anyway! This had broken the limit of a human\u2019s acknowledgment!However, this had really happened.The fact could not be doubted.\u201cThe Wine Gu is the best choice for a Vital Gu. But compared to the Spring And Autumn Cicada, it is just mud on the ground! My Vital Gu in this life is actually the Spring And Autumn Cicada, hahaha....\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: The Schoolhouse's Elder Is SpeechlessTranslator: - - Editor: - -The extreme happiness did not make Fang Yuan\u2019s thoughts become fuzzy. He quickly regained his consciousness, and started to think about the effects that the Spring And Autumn Cicada could bring to him,\u201cThe ability of the Spring And Autumn Cicada is rebirth. However, right now, it is fatigued to the max. A single touch could already kill it.. But it is still a level six Gu; I can totally take advantage of its breath. This would not cause any damage to its body.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Thinking like that, Fang Yuan retrieved his mind and opened his eyes.He only saw the Wine Gu which was floating in front of him, was shivering while being covered and oppressed by the Bronze Primeval Essence.Just now, because of its desire to live, it had bet everything on a single throw, resulted in its intent in easily being smashed by the Spring And Autumn Cicada. Therefore, he was severely hurt because of that. Its willpower right now was not even one-hundredth of what it had been before.\u201cSpring And Autumn Cicada.\u201d As Fang Yuan\u2019s intent slightly shook, a whiff of Spring And Autumn Cicada\u2019s breath drifted out.As the oppressing breath was put on the Wine Gu\u2019s body, the Wine Gu instantly calmed down. It did not move the slightest bit, as though it was dead. Its remaining willpower could feel the breath from the Spring And Autumn Cicada. Like a mouse that encountered a cat, under the intimidating force, it curled up into a ball, and did not dare to move.Fang Yuan laughed out loud. Taking advantage of the situation, he urged his Primeval Essence.Initially, when using the Bronze Primeval Essence to cultivate, it could hardly expand little by little. However, right now, Fang Yuan\u2019s Bronze Primeval Essence marched straight into it and rushed down a thousand li. Basically, it did not meet any obstacles.The bronze color on the Wine Gu\u2019s body quickly expanded. In a few blinks, it had turned the fat white pearl Wine Gu into a green Gu.Being on the decline, the last remaining willpower of the Wine Gu had finally vanished into the air after being attacked by Fang Yuan\u2019s intent.Just like that, he had finished cultivating the Gu!Compared to the hardship of passing over mountain ridges at the start, the refining process right now was like drinking a gulp of water with ease.A magical and amiable feeling connected Fang Yuan and the Wine Gu.Refining Gu was as a part of Fang Yuan\u2019s body. When Fang Yuan told it to huddle, it would do so immediately. As he commanded it to curl up, it would become a wonton-shaped. It was just like moving a fingertip.As Fang Yuan retrieved his Primeval Essence, the Wine Gu then returned to his white fat appearance.Afterward, he baselessly jumped up and entered Fang Yuan\u2019s vain aperture in a blink. Once it reached the middle of the vain aperture, it slightly slid over the Spring And Autumn Cicada, then penetrated into his Bronze Primeval Sea. On the sea surface, it recklessly stretched out its body, casually wringing its fat waist, feeling as comfortable as bathing in a warm bubble bath.\u201cWith the Spring And Autumn Cicada, I should change my plan.\u201d Fang Yuan retrieved his consciousness from the Primeval Sea, and then took out that Moonlight Gu.He did the same, releasing a beam of Spring And Autumn Cicada\u2019s breath and putting it on the Moonlight Gu.Feeling the breath of the Spring And Autumn Cicada, the Moonlight Gu\u2019s willpower immediately surrendered. It was so scared that it could only retract its head as much as possible into its body.Fang Yuan\u2019s surging Primeval Essence was pouring down, in a blink, it had turned the Moonlight Gu into a green jade.Finally, as his intent slightly shook, the willpower of the Moonlight Gu was easily strangled.Afterward, he retrieved his Primeval Essence as the Moonlight Gu also returned to its normal transparent crystal blue appearance.He retrieved the Moonlight Gu.This time, it did not enter his vain aperture but directly fell onto Fang Yuan\u2019s forehead, forming a faint blue crescent moon imprint.From the time when he started refining the Moonlight Gu to the end, it was not over five minutes.Such fast speed, compared to the hardships at the beginning, would create an extremely clear difference.Moreover, not only was the refining pace fast, but also the Primeval Essence that he had wasted, was incredibly little.These days, when Fang Yuan cultivated the Wine Gu, he spent about six Primeval Stones. However, tonight, he did not waste any Primeval Stones. Instead, the bottom of his Bronze Primeval Sea could be seen right now.\u201cHaha, having the Spring And Autumn Cicada in my hand is truly like having God\u2019s aid! From now on, with the oppressing breath of it, any level one Gu will become easy as flipping a hand. Although I am just a grade C aptitude, I also do not need the help from Primeval Stones. The difference from now and then really is like heaven and earth apart.\u201dFang Yuan was triumphal. Right now, he was like seeing the blue sky after it had pushed aside the gray clouds.Although the Spring And Autumn Cicada was extremely fatigued right now, it was still a level six Gu. It was like a tiger that had fallen down but still reserved its prestige, or a rotten ship that still had three-pound nails, just depended on its breath had become a big motivation for Fang Yuan\u2019s cultivation later on.At present.The moon was shining while the stars were sparse outside the window. As the moonlight pierced through the window, it shone upon Fang Yuan\u2019s countenance.\u201cInitially, I thought I would not be able to get in first place, but unexpectedly, a plot twist has happened. Time will not wait for me. Right now, I need to go to the schoolhouse to receive my reward for being the first one!\u201d The starlight inside Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes was sparkling.As his mind slightly shook, the figure of the Spring And Autumn Cicada inside his vain aperture immediately disappeared, entering its dormant state. He then called out the Wine Gu who was hiding in a corner on his bedhead.This was to prevent the schoolhouse\u2019s unnecessary inspection.A second later, at the schoolhouse.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was already deep asleep. However, while he was sleeping, he vaguely heard some knocking sounds.Being awakened by those knocking sounds, he opened his pair of eyes, unhappily said, \u201cIt\u2019s midnight, who is outside?\u201dA respectful answer immediately resounded from outside, \u201cElder Master, there is a disciple this year. He said he had succeeded refining the Moonlight Gu. You have ordered, whenever the first person appears, no matter what time it is, we have to inform you immediately.\u201d\u201cOh... So there is someone like that.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder frowned. He stood up and left his bed, wearing his clothes while asking, \u201cWhich disciple can be first this year? Is it Gu Yue Fang Zheng?\u201dHis subordinate replied from outside, \u201cIt seems so. As soon as I heard the news, I came to report to master immediately. It looks like he is from the Fang family.\u201d\u201cA, it should be the time he comes up anyway.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder softly laughed, muttered, \u201cExcept for this grade A aptitude genius, who else could it be? Even if a grade B disciple were using Primeval Stones, they would still be lower by one level. If not, then why should aptitude be so important.\u201dAs he finished talking, he opened the door and stepped out.Outside, his subordinate respectfully retreated two steps, kowtowed then added, \u201cMaster is right.\u201dIn the hall, bright shining light coming from more than ten burning candles were illuminating the whole space.The person who received Fang Yuan had now wanted to ask for more details from him. Under the candlelight, bewilderment covered his visage, \u201cWait, what did you just say? You are telling me you are Gu Yue Fang Yuan, not Gu Yue Fang Zheng?\u201dFang Yuan nodded. Right then, the Elder of the schoolhouse stepped in.Fang Yuan and the receiver simultaneously turned and showed their respects.As the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder looked at Fang Yuan, smiles were constantly beaming on his face. He stepped up to stand in front of Fang Yuan, then friendly patted his shoulder, \u201cGood job, Gu Yue Fang Zheng. You did not disappoint me. You really are a grade A aptitude genius! No matter how much effort those friends at the same age with you who are at grade B or C, they still cannot be compared to you. Ha ha ha.\u201dFang Yuan and Fang Zheng were twin brothers. Their appearances were identical, that was why the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder mistook.Fang Yuan was neither servile nor overbearing, he gently stepped back one step, avoiding the Elder\u2019s hand on his shoulder. He looked at the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder, putting his hands behind his back and casually smiling, \u201cHonorable Elder, you\u2019ve mistaken. Junior is Gu Yue Fang Yuan. Gu Yue Fang Zheng is my didi.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder slightly opened his mouth, a gleam of surprise appeared on his countenance.He confusingly looked at Fang Yuan while furrowed his brows. After several breaths, he started to talk, \u201cYou are Gu Yue Fang Yuan?\u201d\u201cYes, Junior is.\u201d Fang Yuan replied.\u201cYou refined the Moonlight Gu?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was dumbfounded inside. He widened his eyes staring at the crescent moon imprinted on Fang Yuan\u2019s head. The light in his eyes was shining brilliantly. It seemed he still asked even though he had already known.\u201cYes, there is something like that.\u201d Fang Yuan replied again.\u201cIf so, you are the first one?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was quite dumbstruck, but one could not blame him. Since the situation right now had surpassed his expectations.One must know that he had had plentiful of experience after dozen of years in taking charge of this schoolhouse. He had encountered a grade C aptitude receiving the first rank, but it would definitely not be this soon. Not to mention, this time, there were also disciples at the same age who were grade A or B aptitude.\u201cIf no one is earlier than me...\u201d Fang Yuan acted like he was considering, then he stroked his nose while continue saying, \u201cThen it seems like so.\u201dThe schoolhouse\u2019s Elder, \u201c....\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: How Can This Gege Get First Place?Translator: - - Editor: - -It was still dawn as the sun hadn\u2019t risen yet. The western sky had just started to turn pale. Darkness began to disappear while the fragrance of the night still lingered in the air.Seemed like there wasn\u2019t a single person on the street, but soft footsteps suddenly resounded from out of nowhere.The morning in the mountain was always quite chilly. Gu Yue Fang Zheng couldn\u2019t feel the coldness, but his heart was already filled with surging emotion.With a flush red visage, he strode towards the schoolhouse.\u201cThese days, I have been diligently cultivating. Using two Primeval Stones, and one sleepless night, I have finally succeeded in refining that Moonlight Gu. With my grade A aptitude, and such hard efforts, no one could be faster than me, no one! Father, Mother, I said so, that I wouldn't disappoint you guys.\u201dFang Zheng immediately felt a wave of joy and pride when thinking about uncle and aunt\u2019s gratified countenances if they heard such good news from himself.\u201cJust wait, the clan members that used to look down on me, also gege. From here onward, I will let you guys look at me - Gu Yue Fang Zheng, with different eyes!\u201dThe more he thought about it, the more he became excited. He couldn\u2019t help but tighten his fist; his footstep was getting livelier.He stepped into the schoolhouse.The schoolhouse\u2019s bodyguard looked at him weirdly; they asked, \u201cWhat, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, why do you return?\u201d\u201cWhat? My gege is here?\u201d As Fang Zheng heard this, a beam of astonishment and doubt couldn\u2019t help but flash on his face.\u201cLet\u2019s ignore that first!\u201d He basically didn\u2019t expect that Fang Yuan would have snatched first place away from him. He swung his head, with an arrogant tone, cupped his hands then spoke, \u201cTwo dage\u2019s, I am not Gu Yue Fang Yuan, I am Gu Yue Fang Zheng. I have succeeded in refining my Vitality Gu. I have come here this time to receive the reward for coming in first.\u201d\u201cYou are Gu Yue Fang Zheng? You two brothers look too identical, no wonder the Elder and everyone else kept mistaking you two.\u201d The bodyguard standing on the left side widened his eyes and yelled while the one on the right shook his head to say,\u201cYou\u2019re late by a single step. At yesterday\u2019s midnight, your gege Gu Yue Fang Yuan had already met the honorable Elder, confirming him as having first place.\u201d\u201cMy gege!\u201d Fang Zheng opened his eyes wide, cried out, \u201cWait, you said he came in first?\u201dHow could this be! His gege was only a grade C aptitude, isn\u2019t he?Came in first, are you kidding me?!\u201cIt\u2019s true. How can we joke about something like this?\u201d Looking at Fang Zheng\u2019s disbelief, the bodyguard felt unpleasant.\u201cThe schoolhouse\u2019s Elder has confirmed this. After that, he will release a list and publicly announce it. What, your gege didn\u2019t tell you this?\u201d Another bodyguard immediately added.Fang Zheng was dumbstruck standing in front of the door.The fact that was just dropped on his head was much different from what he had expected. He couldn\u2019t even understand in the end what had happened.In Fang Zheng\u2019s heart, there was also a couple of formidable opponents. Among them, there were two people who held the biggest threats to him. One was Gu Yue Mo Bei, and the other was Gu Yue Chi Cheng.These two were grade B aptitudes. Their backup were the two biggest lines in the clan; their grandfather were two Elders in power, possessing an abundance of resources.If it were those two that had snatched away his first position, then Fang Zheng had already been mentally prepared. Although he would feel lost, he could accept it.However, right now, the one that had come in first was not Gu Yue Mo Bei nor Gu Yue Chi Cheng. Moreover, it was not even one of his imaginary enemies.It was Gu Yue Fang Yuan, his gege!That grade C person!That dispirited person after the Sacrificial Ceremony!That person who came to class just to sleep it away!That person who would stay dead drunk and didn\u2019t return home at night!That person who harassed Shen Cui, who slapped him twice, who had taken all of his Primeval Stones!That person was still suppressing him, like a shadow entrenching his heart!\u201cHow can it be? This is impossible!\u201d At this moment, Fang Zheng shrieked in his heart, \u201cI have tried so hard, while he is drinking all day. And this resulted in him getting first place, where was the justice in this? Why? Why?!\u201dThe sun had ascended in the west. With the chirping sound of birdies, the thick air of spring was sweeping by the Green Thatch Mountain.Gu Yue Fang Zheng was covered with the warm sunlight. He tardily lowered his head, gritted his teeth, as he was looking at his lonesome shadow on the ground.The surging emotion inside his heart had soon been left with nothing like a balloon leaking air. Instead, it was doubt, discontented, indissoluble, unwilling, fear, and all kinds of complicated feelings.....As time went by; the sun was getting higher and higher.A new notice was put up on the wall of the schoolhouse. There were only two names being written on the notice. In succession, they were Fang Yuan, and Fang Zheng.Following the appearance of this notice, news started to spread out.Those young men who diligently cultivated after receiving their Gus were in a frenzy after hearing the news.\u201cHow can it be!\u201d\u201cI would believe it if Fang Zheng came in first. But Fang Yuan is just a grade C aptitude, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cIs there a mistake? Grade A aptitude Fang Zheng has lost to a grade C aptitude Fang Yuan; this is a joke right?\u201dAt The Mo Family House.The vigorous and greenish aura had filled the small courtyard, with the scent of tea fluttered in the wind.One of the Elders in power of the Ancient Moon clan, Gu Yue Mo Chen, was sitting on the table, looking at the spring scenery outside the window while casually drinking tea, \u201cMo Bei isn\u2019t refining Gu right now?\u201dThe housekeeper standing beside him hurriedly replied, \u201cAfter hearing the news about Fang Yuan, young master Mo Bei seems to receive a heavy blow, he doesn\u2019t feel like continue refining the Moonlight Gu. It\u2019s a pity; young master Mo Bei is only a line away from success. If Fang Zheng comes first, then it would be nothing, but it was that grade C aptitude, Fang Yuan. It\u2019s hard to blame young master Mo Bei for losing his interest.\u201d\u201cHumph! You don\u2019t need to speak for him.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen coldly snorted. His visage was solemn, he spoke with his iron-like tone, \u201cEvery step of cultivating for a Gu Master is always tough. Such a small setback is what? That Fang Yuan is just a grade C aptitude, getting first place is just based on luck. The Moonlight Gu he chose must have a weak willpower. That\u2019s why he could be that quick. If Mo Bei couldn\u2019t see through that and wasn\u2019t able to accept such small reverse, then how can he take charge of the Mo\u2019s family line in the future, how can he face the Chi family line? No one is allowed to convince him, let him think about that himself!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, master.\u201d The housekeeper didn\u2019t dare to talk back.At the same time. In the Chi family.\u201cHaizz, Gu Yue Fang Yuan...\u201d The Elder Gu Yue Chi Lian deeply sighed. He furrowed his brows, thinking then waving his hand, \u201cServants, tell young master Chi Cheng to come here.\u201dA short while later, Gu Yue Chi Cheng carried a lost expression, entering the room and bowing down, \u201cGreetings grandfather.\u201d\u201cIt seems like you have already known about the news.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Lian stared at his sole blood grandson. Using a gentle tone, he slowly spoke, \u201cI asked you here, is to help you avoid being affected by such a thing. Refining Vitality Gu looks at two things. One is aptitude; the other is the Gu.\u201d\u201cFang Yuan is a grade C aptitude. This time, he came in first. This means that the Moonlight Gu inside his hand has a much weaker willpower compared to the one you have. This is totally pure luck. Hence, grandson, you don\u2019t need to feel lost or dispirited. This is nothing worthy. He is a grade C aptitude, like you yourself. However, he doesn\u2019t have such an abundance of resources like you do. His advancing path is also tougher compared to yours. Believe in grandpa; and you can quickly surpass him.\u201d\u201cTherefore, just forget this tiny matter. Fang Yuan will not be your opponent; he also isn\u2019t worthy of being your opponent. Your real opponent is the grade A aptitude Fang Zheng, is Mo Bei of the Mo family. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI do, thanks to grandfather\u2019s words, I now understand this. Grandson will leave, and continue refining the Gu!\u201d The lost expression on Gu Yue Chi Cheng\u2019s countenance had disappeared. Instead, it was brimming with fighting spirit.\u201cGood.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Lian Elder satisfactorily nodded, displaying his soft and gentle smile, \u201cGood grandson. Although your aptitude is just a grade C, don\u2019t worry, your grandpa will use all efforts to help you. Wait for grandpa to use a level three breath to prevent the willpower of the Moonlight Gu, helping you refine this Gu!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: The Fluttering Moon BladeTranslator: - - Editor: - -The clear blue sky as if looked like it had been washed over once.The Sun was shining brilliantly.A flock of colorful parrots was chirping non-stop while forming into a pattern, soaring on the blue sky along with the floating white clouds.This kind of colorful parrots only appeared in flocks when spring came. The feathers of their entire body were in seven bright colors. Their figures were like eagles but smaller. Their heads and beaks were like parrots, but their long dragging tails were like a peacock\u2019s.It had been almost ten days since Fang Yuan had come in first place at refining Vitality Gu.Spring breeze was blowing by the entire mountain grass. Wildflowers were eagerly blooming while flock after flock of bees and butterflies were dancing with each other. The wonderful scenery was overwhelmed with surging vitality.The Martial Art Field couldn\u2019t be hidden behind such a dense spring breeze, even though being surrounded by four giant bamboo walls.This Martial Art Field took up three mus. The flat ground was tiled with graphite stone with a moderate thickness. Its surrounding was full of green spear bamboo. Those bamboos were dense, standing up straight, forming a layer of high green wall.Although stones were also being laid atop, green grasses were now almost visible in many areas around the corners. Among the bamboos, there were semi-wild roses penetrating from the outside, even climbing atop the wall.Fifty-seven young men at the age of fifteen were standing in the middle of this Martial Art Field. They formed a circle and attentively looked at the schoolhouse\u2019 Elder in the middle.This was a class on teaching those young men how to use the Moonlight Gu.\u201cMoonlight Gu is the signature Gu of our Ancient Moon Clan, like the Bear Power Gu of the Xiong Family, or the Stream Gu of the Bai Family. The majority of people here all use Moonlight Gu as their Vitality Gu\u2019s. You guys need to look closely. Next, I will demonstrate myself, how to urge the Moonlight Gu to attack. Disciples whose Vitality Gu is not Moonlight Gu also need to observe carefully. This method of long-distance attacks can be applied to different Gu\u2019s on your body. Its application range is extremely wide.\u201dAfter he finished talking, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder instantly stretched out his right hand, opened all five fingers then lowering his hand so that every young man could see his palm.\u201cFirstly, use your intent to urge the Moonlight Gu, shifting to your own palm.\u201d Following his voice, the crescent moon imprint represented the Moonlight Gu, came out of his hand, then moved to his palm.\u201cAfter that, urge the Primeval Essence in your vain aperture to enter the Moonlight Gu.\u201d A ray of silver white Primeval Essence light spurted out from the Elder\u2019s body. It was so thin one couldn\u2019t possibly have observed it. It then entered the Moonlight Gu in his palm.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was at level three. Only a level three Gu Master could condense the Primeval Essence into a silver-white light ray.A level one Gu Master\u2019s Primeval Essence was a Bronze Primeval Essence while a level two was the Scarlet Steel Primeval Essence. To a level three, it would be the Silver Primeval Stone.Absorbing the silver white Primeval Essence, the crescent moon imprint on the Elder\u2019s palm was getting brighter and brighter. Although it was broad daylight, it still emitted a cluster of faint blue aureole.\u201cToo powerful!\u201d\u201cHow pretty.\u201d As the young men saw this scene, they couldn\u2019t help but burst out their astonishment and compliments.A faint blue transparent as water aureole was flickering in the Elder\u2019s palm. With a glance, it looked as if the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder had grasped a handful of moonlight.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder slightly smiled, \u201cLook carefully. The last step is like what I just did, shooting it outside like that.\u201dAs he finished talking, he gradually closed his opened hand then slowly pushed it forward, gently dispersed a palm strike.The whole process was powerful and steady.Swoosh.The young men were picking up small explosion sounds.Followed the Elder\u2019s movement, the faint blue water-liked aureole congealed on his palm was pushed outside.The aureole turned into a small Moon Blade in mid-air. The Moon Blade was only the size of a fist, looking like the crescent moon in the night sky. It drew a straight line in the air then instantly struck a scarecrow that was standing ten meters away from it.With a swoosh sound, the scarecrow which was thirty centimeters thick was totally sliced apart. Its body swayed as its giant head instantly felt on the ground.The Moon Blade turned dimmer after slicing through the scarecrow. However, after flying for around six meters in mid-air, the Moon Blade then slowly disappeared, dispersing into the air.Looking back at the neck of the scarecrow to see the clean cut, which looked like it had been sliced by the sharpest sickle.The group of youngsters all widened their eyes in awe, astonishingly looking at such a scene. Some of them couldn\u2019t help but stroke their own necks, being startled by the power of this Moon Blade.After a short period of silence, the sound of admirable exclamations reverberated. All their eyes were sparkling; some were staring at the scarecrow, others were looking at the Elder\u2019s hand. Some of them gathered around and excitedly discussed.There was only one person who looked like he had disappeared into the crowd. Fang Yuan\u2019s countenance was solemn; he didn\u2019t move the slightest bit.In his past life, his cultivation base was at level six. On this continent, he created the Bloody Wing Demonic Cult with a couple of ten thousand disciples. Reputed to be the Demon Way Tycoon, his reputation was awe-inspiring.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was just a level three Gu Master. This kind of basic method was only for kids. It wouldn\u2019t have urged a single wave inside Fang Yuan\u2019s heart.\u201cNext, whoever it is that has successfully refined the Moonlight Gu, step out. One scarecrow per person! Based on my method just now, you will urge the Moon Blade and practice attacking.\u201dAs soon as the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder finished, more than thirty young men stood up.This time, there was about a hundred young men participating in the Sacrificial Ceremony. Fifty disciples had an aptitude for cultivating. Among them, thirty-five people chose the Moonlight Gu. After many days of hard work, they had all refined the Moonlight Gu.The rest were all grade D aptitude. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t think about refining the Moonlight Gu; it was because their aptitudes were not enough, they could only retreat before the impossible.To the young men of the Ancient Moon clan, the Moonlight Gu was not only a Gu, but it was the symbol of the clan\u2019s glory.Thirty-five young men stood up quickly. Ten meters away from each of them, there stood a scarecrow in front.Fang Yuan, who was standing inside the group, didn\u2019t attract much attention from the others.Practice had started.The youngsters simultaneously stretched out their right hand, transferring the Moonlight Gu onto their palms. After pouring their Bronze Primeval Essence light beam into the crescent moon imprints, one by one were emitting aqua blue aureole.However, when they set their palms upright, only seven to eight Moon Blades were shot out. These Moon Blades only appeared in a blink, and quickly dispersed. Some of them flew out for two to three meters, then shattered into blue light flows with a BANG. There were some that had flown far. However, their directions were changed drastically, directly soaring to the sky.Those youngsters furrowed their brows. What the Elder had just done, seemed easy. However, only when it was their turns to practice did they realize the secret inside of it. Wanting to release a Moon Blade and accurately hit the scarecrow was not easy.As the Elder was looking, a smile was beaming on his face. He had seen such scenes every year; so it was not unexpected.The other twenty-two young men standing outside of the field were looking in with admiration.After five minutes of practice, all the disciples there, could now gradually release the Moon Blade. In this moment, light blue Moon Blades were flying everywhere on the sky of the Martial Art Field.Some Moon Blades dispersed at mid-way, some unfortunately impacted with others, some even flew out of the Field, twisting around. There were only some Moon Blades that could hit the scarecrow once in a while. Of course, these were all purely lucks.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder started to coaching one-on-one.He focused on looking after the disciples with excellent aptitudes like Fang Zheng, Mo Bei, and Chi Cheng. He patiently fixed the errors in their postures as well as passing on his own knowledge. However, to grade C disciples such as Fang Yuan, he only helped him within two sentences.Fang Yuan was still concentrating on the blue aureole in his palm. A couple of times that the palm wind didn\u2019t cut through, was due to the fact that he didn\u2019t release it. It was only for show. Seeing the chaotic scene without any person focusing on himself, as his intent shook, the control over the Moonlight was released. Followed the palm that was slightly slanted, he made a movement to send out the blade from his palm.So as not to attract other\u2019s attentions, he didn\u2019t aim for the scarecrow in front of himself, but a little bit to the left.With a swoosh, a Moon Blade quickly flew out, penetrating the chaotic area in the middle. It drew a straight line in mid-air, accurately struck the scarecrow right by its neck.The scarecrow shivered. As its neck was being cut more than half, the green straw quickly started to grow, tangle together again and the wound had been healed.This scarecrow, of course, wasn\u2019t a normal scarecrow. It was a level one Scarecrow Gu; it possessed a small recovering ability from the floral element.Unless one had cleanly sliced through the scarecrow, turning it into two halves, the wound would have quickly reconnected to each other like before.\u201cWow, look at this Moon Blade!\u201d\u201cHow powerful, who released it?\u201dThere were only a few Moon Blades that could accurately hit the scarecrow. Fang Yuan was only carefreely struck, but it had created the clearest and most effective attack from the beginning until now. This made the group of disciples outside the field yell in surprise.Even the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was attracted, he asked, \u201cThe Moon Blade that was released just now is not bad, who released it?\u201dWith questioning eyes, he looked at a grade C aptitude disciple, because that scarecrow was in front of this disciple.The male disciple was constantly blinking his eyes. Facing everyone\u2019s attentive stares, he was perplexed. Truth to be told, just now, the whole scene was chaotic. With Moon Blades flying everywhere, he also didn\u2019t know whether this one was his.\u201cAnyhow, it seems like it could be mine anyway.\u201d As the young man was thinking, he unconsciously nodded.The youngsters around him instantly looked at him with different eyes.\u201cWho is he? What is his name?\u201d A few female disciples were asking around in succession.\u201cEven him could release the Moon Blade; I can\u2019t lose!\u201d A beam of determination flashed in Gu Yue Mo Bei\u2019s pair of eyes.\u201cSo it is not gege.\u201d Gu Yue Fang Zheng incomprehensibly sighed out in relief. After being consoled by aunt and uncle, he had recovered from those setbacks from before.\u201cGege, coming in first place last time was based on his luck, being able to choose a Moonlight Gu with a weak willpower. A Gu Master can\u2019t cultivate with just depending on destiny; I will defeat you.\u201d Fang Zheng silently encouraged himself inside.\u201cYou did well. Try harder, capture that feeling just now.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder patted the disciple\u2019s shoulders then smilingly encouraged.The young man excitedly nodded his head. His eyes were beaming with distinctive light.The Elder took advantage of the situation, announced in front of everyone, \u201cListen up, this is your homework. Practice hard after class. I will look at the result after three days. The one with the best result will be rewarded with ten Primeval Stones. You all hear me?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The young men loudly replied. Hearing there was a Primeval Stone as a reward, everyone couldn\u2019t help but become more excited.However, after three minutes, the number of Moon Blades in the air was lessened.\u201cDamn it; each Moon Blade wasted ten percent of the Primeval Essence.\u201d\u201cThe Moon Blade is wasting too much. I am only a grade C aptitude; my vain aperture can only contain thirty-eight Bronze Primeval Essences. I can only continuously release three Moon Blades.\u201dThe youngsters who stopped were all complaining.Seeing all of this, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder remaining calm and collected, but inside, he was exclaiming, \u201cThis is the advantage of a higher grade in aptitude. Using the Moon Blade focuses on these simple three words -- practice makes perfect. With a higher aptitude, one\u2019s vain aperture can contain much more Primeval Essences. The recovering speed for Primeval Essence is also faster. Hence, they have more opportunities to practice. If their aptitude is lower, they can make up with Primeval Stones to increase the chances to practice. For those with low aptitude and lack of Primeval Stone, even if they want to practice, it will be as carrying water to sea. Haizz, cultivation to a Gu Master, is that cruel. I should just take a better care of those high aptitude disciples then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Raising Gu Is Like Keeping a MistressTranslator: - - Editor: - -The sun had descended.The sunset was still blazing in the horizon. The mountain range from afar was muffled with a thick layer of ash. Moreover, it was getting darker and darker.The classes for today had ended as groups after groups of disciples were leaving the schoolhouse.\u201cWe had a great time today. We really did learn a lot. Especially how to use the Moonlight Gu.\u201d\u201cThe Moon Blade soaring in mid-air was really cool. It\u2019s a pity that my aptitude is not enough. In the future, I can only be a logistic Gu Master, and can\u2019t go on a real battlefield.\u201d The youngsters were talking with each other excitedly.Some people had immediately made some friends.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat together, then grab some rice wine after, how about that?\u201d\u201cSure, it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d\u201cYou guys go first. I have to stop by the store beside the schoolhouse\u2019s Gu Chamber to buy a scarecrow to practice at home.\u201d....Fang Yuan walked to the Gu Chamber alone.The Gu Chamber consisted of many Gus, varying in species. Fang Yuan\u2019s Moonlight Gu was chosen freely from here.After a period of time, disciples could be able to have a chance to receive a Gu for free. If they wanted to acquire more Gus, there would be a price for it.For the time being, Fang Yuan didn\u2019t think about refining any other Gu. He went to the spacious store right beside the Gu Chamber.Seven disciples were standing there, bargaining with the owner for scarecrows.\u201cOh, it\u2019s junior brother.\u201d A level one Gu Master was taking charge of the store. He was around twenty-ish. Seeing Fang Yuan coming, he was selling on one side, while taking the initiative to greet Fang Yuan on the other side.Fang Yuan had unexpectedly just found out that that Gu Master was Jiang Ya. The young Gu Master that had taught those hunters a lesson back at the tavern.\u201cSo it is senior brother.\u201d Fang Yuan nodded without changing his expression.Jiang Ya took out a scarecrow from behind the counter, putting it in front of a disciple, but smilingly turned to Fang Yuan and genially asked, \u201cJunior brother also came to buy a scarecrow? I will leave one for you for only for three Primeval Stones. This thing sells fast. I only have seven left here. There won\u2019t be any left if you wait until later.\u201dHe was arrogant and nasty toward ordinary humans. But to people like Fang Yuan, his attitude was much more friendlier.Fang Yuan shook. He felt ridiculous inside: This Jiang Ya really knew how to sell stuff. A scarecrow was only made from the Scarecrow Gu. Including the Primeval Essence being put into it, the price should not be any more than one and a half Primeval Stones.\u201cSenior brother, you are not fair. First-come, first-served, why are you keeping one for him?\u201d\u201cExactly, we came here sooner. There are also regulations when it comes to business.\u201d\u201cThere it is then. I will give you the Primeval Stones, give me the scarecrow then.\u201dThe young men standing at the store were all anxious after hearing that there were only seven left. They didn\u2019t even bother to bargain anymore but took out the Primeval Stones one after another.Quickly thereafter, seven people satisfyingly left.\u201cDoes junior brother want to buy scarecrow?\u201d Jiang Ya smiled and asked, \u201cAlthough I said they were out, there is still one more left, I hid it. If junior brother doesn't buy it now, you won\u2019t have another chance.\u201dFang Yuan wasn\u2019t interested in the scarecrows. He shook his head, taking a Primeval Stone out and putting it on the counter, \u201cI will buy ten petals of Moon Orchid.\u201dJiang Ya was dumbstruck. He intensely stared at Fang Yuan then took the Primeval Stones, pulled open a drawer under the counter, and took out a paper bag, \u201cTen petals of Moon Orchid, you can check it.\u201dFang Yuan took a look at it. After discovering no flaws, he left the store.Gu needed to be raised.A Gu Master refined Gu, used Gu, but also needed to raise Gu.Refining Gu was tough; one could be in a situation where they were caught off-guard by a dangerous backlash. Using a Gu was not easy, one needed to practice more. Knowledge for raising Gu was even more wide-ranging and profound because there were numerous types of Gu. Their food was also exceedingly strange.Some needed to eat soil, or light, or taking up tears, or sucking the Qi of the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Cloud.Talking about the three Gus that Fang Yuan was having right now, the Moonlight Gu ate Moon Orchid\u2019s petals, twice a day, one in the morning, and one at night. It would eat two petals per meal. The wine worm had to drink wine. A jug of Green Bamboo Wine could last four days. The Spring and Autumn Cicada was even more eccentric. It directly drank the water of the River of Time to maintain its vitality.The River of Time supported the operations of this world. It was not as far as the horizon but was right under one\u2019s nose. It flowed inside every person.Every movement of each living entity needed the actuation of time.Time was like flowing water, rapidly passing by. The River of Time was insubstantial and invisible while all living things were existing and living inside the river\u2019s water.After buying the Moon Orchid\u2019s petals, Fang Yuan walked to the tavern to purchase the Green Bamboo Wine.The Wine Gu could also drink unfiltered wine or rice wine to keep on living. However, once it had drunk such a second rated wine, the volume was much higher. It had to be several jugs a day. Fang Yuan had thought about it. It would be much better off buying the Green Bamboo Wine directly. Not only was it is more cost-effective compared to the second rated wine, but the others also wouldn\u2019t find him suspicious.\u201cYoung master, you are here again.\u201d The tavern\u2019s servant had already remembered Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan directly threw three Primeval Stones to him, familiarly said, \u201cGive me a jug of Green Bamboo Wine, and some good food. Keep the change here; I will take care of the rest when the month ends. If this is not enough, I will give you more. If not, you keep the change.\u201dAlthough he was staying at the schoolhouse\u2019s dorm right now instead of this tavern, he still came here for food whenever he went to buy wine.\u201cAlright. Young master, please sit over here. The wine and food will be served immediately.\u201d The servant replied, leading Fang Yuan to his seat. He took out the towel on his shoulder, carefully wiped the table and chairs, then left.It was like what the servant had just said. The wine and food were served immediately.As Fang Yuan eating, he was also calculating inside, \u201cOne Primeval Stone could buy ten petals of the Moon Orchid which the Moonlight Gu consumes four of them a day. Whilst a jug of the Green Bamboo Wine just costs two Primeval Stones; it could have at least sustained the Wine Gu for four days. In other words, just to raise these two Gus, I will need to spend around one Primeval Stone each day.\u201dIt looked little, but in fact, it was already quite a high rate of consumption. A typical family of four only needed one Primeval Stone to cover their living expenses for a whole month.It had been sixteen days from the time that he had refined the Gu. Just for raising the Gu, Fang Yuan would waste fourteen and a half Primeval Stones.\u201cFrom the hidden legacy of Hua Jiu, then taking the Primeval Stone bag from Fang Zheng, and the reward for coming in first, the total Primeval Stones I have right now is forty-four and a half. However, I have used up six and a half of them in refining the Gu, another fourteen and a half for raising the Gu, and another half for living expense. Hence, I am left with twenty Primeval Stones.\u201dFang Yuan took out his bag. As he opened it, Primeval Stones were being put inside.These Primeval Stones were of an ash-gray hue. They were oval shaped which were about the size of a duck\u2019s egg with similar volume.After counting it really came out to be twenty that were left.In other words, if Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t find some money, he would only be left with enough Primeval Stones to last him half of a month. He was different from those at his age. They all had, more or less, assistance from their families or friends. Particularly for Gu Yue Mo Bei, and Gu Yue Chi Cheng, they have never lacked of Primeval Stones.But Fang Yuan could only find a way by himself.\u201cAunt and Uncle have cut off my living expense. However, the clan\u2019s schoolhouse will give their students three Primeval Stones as an allowance each weekend. It seems like I should show off something at the examination in using the Moon Blade three days later to take the ten Primeval Stones reward.\u201d Fang Yuan thought as he was eating.He was at a growing age. Without knowing, he had eaten all the food.Taking the sealed Green Bamboo Wine jug, Fang Yuan left the tavern.\u201cYoung master, young master.\u201d The servant chased after him, \u201cI will tell young master this. Not more than a month later, a caravan will come to our mountain stronghold. Generally, they will collect all of the Green Bamboo Wine in our tavern. Young master only loves Green Bamboo Wine; you even come each week to buy several jugs. The owner has ordered me to tell young master this. We only have a limited amount of Green Bamboo Wine. After selling it to the caravan, I\u2019m afraid that not much will be left.\u201d\u201cSo it is like that?\u201d As Fang Yuan listened to him as he slightly furrowed his brows.Understanding the other\u2019s implication, Fang Yuan had five hundred years of experience over this. The tavern\u2019s servant and the young Gu Master Jiang Ya implied the same thing. However, Fang Yuan could naturally tell, Jiang Ya was lying while this servant was telling the truth.This was quite troublesome. Fang Yuan needed to raise the Wine Gu. In the long run, the amount of wine he needed would be massive.If this tavern didn\u2019t have enough of that, later on, he could only use the second rate wine to raise the Wine Gu.He couldn\u2019t be drinking several jugs of wine each day. After a period, people would be suspicious.Thinking about it, Fang Yuan took out ten Primeval Stones, \u201cI will take five jugs. Bring it to the schoolhouse\u2019s dorm with me.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d The servant received the Primeval Stones.Without proper storing methods, the petals of the Moon Orchid could only be kept for about five days. Hence, Fang Yuan only bought one bag a day. However, the Green Bamboo Wine could be kept for long. There would be no problems in regards to this.A few servants then followed Fang Yuan to the schoolhouse\u2019s dorm. As they put the jugs underneath his bed, they all took their leave.Looking at the decreasing amount of money in his bag, Fang Yuan deeply sighed.Refining Gu was tough but raising it was not easy as well.He didn\u2019t have to practice using the Gu thanks to his accumulated experiences from five hundred years ago. This meant his Primeval Essence wouldn\u2019t be wasted. He could save a significant amount from this.Those at his age would have to use their Primeval Stones to practice using the Moonlight Gu. Wanting to increase their proficiency, they would need to practice more and more. If their Primeval Essence was being wasted much, and if their recovering speed was too low, they could only replenish it by using the Primeval Stones. Buying a scarecrow had already cost three Primeval Stones even. This was all about money.\u201cI\u2019m lucky that my Spring and Autumn Cicada only eat time, but not any other food. If not, I would be broke soon. Basically, I won\u2019t be able to bear the costs.\u201d Fang Yuan suddenly felt incredibly lucky.The higher the class that the Gu was, the larger its quantity of food would be, or it would be exceedingly rare, even harder to raise. A level two standard Gu would have used at least one to two Primeval Stones a day.It was good that one could buy the food for it. There were some types of food for Gu that were incredibly hard to find. They basically weren\u2019t sold on the market.Like the Spring and Autumn Cicada\u2019s food was time. This was even rarer.There is an idiom that said money couldn't buy time.No matter how much money you have, can you buy time?You cannot!Theoretically speaking, there was no limit to the number of Gus a Gu Master could refine. If you wanted, ten, a hundred, or even a thousand Gus were still possible. One could refine how many Gus as he desired.But, in fact, a typical Gu Master only had around four to five Gus.Why?The biggest reason was that they couldn\u2019t raise them all.The higher the quality of a Gu was, the more expensive the cost of raising them would be. This would always cause too many troubles for the Gu Master.Another reason was that they couldn\u2019t use them all.Urging the Moonlight Gu to release a Moon Blade attack had already wasted ten percent of Primeval Essence. A grade C aptitude Gu Master could only activate the strike for three to four times before using up their Primeval Essence inside the vain apertures.Raising numerous of Gus but being unable to use them, then wouldn\u2019t it be useless?Therefore, a quote was being spread among the Gu Masters.Raising Gu is like keeping a mistress.Keeping a mistress, one would need to buy food, clothing, houses, etc. It was incredibly costly. A normal person wouldn\u2019t be able to keep many.Nonetheless, even if they could, a man\u2019s energy was limited. Hence, they wouldn\u2019t be able to use them all. Being addicted to raising one for no intentions?The level of a Gu Master was enhanced, carried along the quality of food for his Gu. Hence, don\u2019t say a Gu Master didn\u2019t know how to restrict their Gu\u2019s quantity. Typically, a Gu Master would only raise four to five of the same-level Gus.If it were more than this, the Gu Master would soon be broke!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Close Combat Gu MasterTranslator: - - Editor: - -Three days later.\u201cLowering oneself to dodge is the basic skill to restrain a swing. When your opponent is attacking you, quickly crouch down, then take advantage to strike back, attacking his crotch and abdomen. Don\u2019t be scared of their swinging fists. Usually, people who swings their fists right off the bat are those with no brains, with emotional impetus.\u201dIn the Martial Art Hall, the Fisticuffs Teacher was talking and demonstrating at the same time.When the right fist of a scarecrow horizontally swept over, the Fisticuffs Teacher vigorously crouched down, escaping the attack. After that, he threw a punch right at the scarecrow\u2019s abdomen. With several bangs, the scarecrow was utterly defeated.The disciples were sitting in a circle. However, the majority of them was dispirited and didn\u2019t seem to be interested.The schoolhouse imparted various courses. This one was a class of fisticuffs foundation. Compared to the cool and ruthless Moon Blade attack, putting energy in throwing a punch was nothing. Thus the group of young men didn\u2019t focus at all.\u201cThe next class is the examination in using the Moon Blade. How is your practice going?\u201d\u201cSo-so. I can release the Moon Blade for three consecutive times, but it hardly hits the scarecrows though. Usually, only two can hit the scarecrows.\u201d\u201cYeah, I am not much different. These days, because of practice, I even had to buy a scarecrow.\u201d...The young men were muttering. Their heads had soon left this place. They were all worried about the next examination.Because of this examination, they had practiced diligently after class. Right now, they were putting in all of their efforts. Hence, toward the exam, they had been eagerly anticipating it.The sounds of muttered discussion that was coming from the disciples were picked up by the teacher\u2019s ears. The fisticuffs teacher suddenly turned around, and loudly yelled, \u201cYou are forbidden to talk in class. Keep your mouths shut. Focus here!\u201dHe was a level two Gu Master with a sturdy figure. His naked muscular upper body was a brownish color with numerous scars. With a loud yell, his awe-inspiring presence abruptly suppressed the actions of every youngster that was present in the hall.The Martial Art Hall turned dead silent.\u201cFisticuffs foundation is the most important. Most especially during the initial development stages of a Gu Master, compared to the others, this is the most critical. Everyone has to focus on this!\u201dAfter rebuking, the fisticuffs teacher approached another scarecrow.This faint yellow scarecrow was two meters tall. The giant wooden feet were stamping on the bluestone tiles, reverberating crispy sounds. It opened its hands, and clumsily dashed toward the teacher.The teacher dodged his attack, and harshly grasped its waist, using force to push the giant scarecrow to the ground. Right after that, he seized the opportunity to straddle its back, rapidly throwing punches on its head.After a period of resisting, due to the barrage of punches that was being rained on it from the teacher, its head was smashed. It laid paralyzed on the ground, totally immobilized.The teacher stood up. With his breath being totally uninterrupted, he turned to the disciples and explained, \u201cIn close combat, when facing a tall and powerful opponent, don\u2019t be scared. A wise tactic to stop an opponent is to wreck their center point of gravity. Just like what I did, grasp their waists, control their pelvises, then use force to push forward. After straddling the opponent\u2019s body, using vigorous punches, people without any defending abilities will quickly collapse.\u201dThe disciples continuously nodded, although gleams of disapproval were beaming in their eyes.As the teacher saw all of that, he bitterly smiled inside.Previously, everything was like this. The nature of a young man was in being easily attracted by superb and dazzling stuffs. Without any experience and understanding of oneself, these youngsters wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend the importance of the foundations of Fisticuffs.In fact, toward the Gu Masters who were at their early stages, the Fisticuffs foundation that didn\u2019t look eye-catching was even more important than the attack from the Moon Blade.\u201c... Remember, when in close combat, you don\u2019t need to stare at your opponent\u2019s eyes, but you have to be mindful about their shoulders. Whatever fist attack they intend to use, their feet, and shoulders will always be the first to move...\u201d\u201c.... Speed is crucial in close combat. The speed I am talking about is not the speed of your hand in striking a punch, but the speed of your feet....\u201d\u201c.... The best defense is distance....\u201d\u201c.... Your feet needs to be flexible; it will then be easier to burst out its power....\u201d\u201c.... When you throw a punch, you need to maintain your triangle stance so that it reinforces your posture. If you can\u2019t control your bottom part, the opponent won\u2019t be defeated. On the contrary, you will fall....\u201dThe teacher was patiently explaining as he demonstrated. These were the valuable experiences he had accumulated by shedding blood and tears during his long-term fighting career.It was a pity that the disciples in the hall didn\u2019t seem to understand this point.They gradually gathered together, discussing about the Moon Blade examination that would take place in the next class.\u201cThis teacher is really pragmatic, but there is a problem in his way of teaching.\u201d Fang Yuan silently looked at him within the crowd, slightly nodded then shook his head.This teacher obviously didn\u2019t have any structure in his teaching. It was purely arranged as desired. He would teach whatever he had thought of at that particular moment. Hence, the teaching was messy, both too many and too complicated. Many disciples were focusing at the start but soon lost their interests, then putting their attentions on other matters.Only Fang Yuan carefully listened to him. The others were learning. He was reviewing. His fighting experience was much more abundant than that of the teacher. However, listening to the other methods that were being taught was also a kind of verification in cultivating.A Gu Master\u2019s way of fighting was divided into Close combat and Ranged combat.The Moon Blade attack was a kind of ranged combat style. However, if looking carefully, it could only be considered as middle-ranged combat. Because its effective attack range was merely ten meters.About Close combat, this teacher was the best example. They usually chose the self-growing Gu to start cultivating. These Gu brought them exceptional power, speed, reactivity, endurance, etc.Taking this teacher as an example, the skin on his body was dyed with a brownish color. This, of course, wasn\u2019t the color of his own skin, but it was the effect from a Copper Skin Gu.This Copper Skin Gu would increase the defensive power of his skin, helping the Gu Master to be able to withstand and endure more injuries.\u201cA Moon Blade will waste ten percent of Primeval Essence. When fighting, how many times can a Gu Master release that? The number of times will get smaller and smaller, especially for new recruits. Basically, they can create an effective strike. Being a deadly strike, its deterrence is better than lethality. To a level one Gu Master, the truly effective strike is the fisticuffs skill. Because it could be prolonged, and it is more reliable. However, they won\u2019t be able to comprehend such principles without further understandings about themselves.\u201dFang Yuan used a pair of dull eyes to sweep across those disciples who were at his age, and couldn\u2019t help but beam a cold smile at the corner of his mouth.The class of Fisticuffs had finally come to an end. After resting for a while in the Hall, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder slowly walked over under the anticipating eyes of the youngsters waiting for him.He waved his hand, pointing towards a line of scarecrows under the bamboo wall, and directly talked to the point, \u201cGood, today is the day to test your results. Five persons form into a group, getting up here in order, urging three Moon Blade strikes.\u201dSwoosh Swoosh Swoosh.The first group of disciples came up; the Moon Blades were flying in the air.Three rounds after that, only nine Moon Blades were able to hit the scarecrows accurately.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder slightly shook his head. He was not quite satisfied with this. The scoring rate was too low. The point was that among five persons, only two of them had successfully struck two Moon Blades.\u201cYou guys need to practice harder, especially you, and you also.\u201d The Elder reprimanded, then waved his hand again, \u201cNext group.\u201dThe two who were being reproved left dejectedly. Among them, there was a girl. The rims of her eyes were reddened. She was feeling sad.She was only a grade C aptitude, but she was reluctant in using the Primeval Stones to recover her Primeval Essence. Therefore, she didn\u2019t practice much in the past three days, resulted in being incompetent in urging Moon Blade.A Gu Master used money to refine Gu, used money to raise Gu, also used money to practice using Gu. But where could she have dug up such an amount of money?Even though her parents were assisting her, each family had its own problems. The difficulties that a Gu Master usually encountered were in having shallow pockets.\u201cNo matter what, it is hopeless to try to come in first place. Giving it up and saving some Primeval Stones are better anyway.\u201d Thinking like that, the girl calmed down.People having the same thought as her were not only a few.Because of the lack of practice, many of the disciples\u2019 performances were only considered as barely satisfactory.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder furrowed his brows even more.As Fang Yuan was looking at them, he was shaking his head inside, \u201cThese people are pitiful and sad at the same time. Because of a few Primeval Stones, they have given up their own opportunities to move forward. Primeval Stones are for one to use. Saving up Primeval Stones like a miser, how can you become a Gu Master then?\u201dIn other words, short-sighted people would always haggle over every cent, barter the trunk for the branches. And those who dreamed big usually showed off a tolerant and generous appearance, easily giving things up.\u201cFinally it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Right now, the hatchet-faced Gu Yue Mo Bei was carrying a confident smile, walking up.His figure was sturdy, displaying a beam of fierce aura. After he had stopped his footsteps, he urged three Moon Blades out of his palm. All three had accurately hit it\u2019s mark. Among them, one had hit the scarecrow\u2019s bosom, one on his left arm, scraping away several threads of blue-green grass.Such result was enough to make the other youngsters exclaimed.\u201cNot bad.\u201d The schoolhouse Elder\u2019s brows were slightly stretched out.Another group stepped up. This time, there was Gu Yue Chi Cheng.Gu Yue Chi Cheng had a small figure. His face was full of pockmarks. He seemed particularly nervous.He continuously released three Moon Blades. They all hit the scarecrow\u2019s bosom, forming three crisscrossed wounds. The wounds started to get less deep. After a few breaths later, because of the scarecrow\u2019s ability to self-recover, it had returned to its normal state.Anyhow, with such performance, he was equal to Gu Yue Mo Bei, and also received compliments from the Elder.Chi Cheng lifted his head and went down. On the way, he provocatively glared at Mo Bei.\u201cHuphm!\u201d Under the platform, Gu Yue Mo Bei coldly snorted. He didn\u2019t turn to look at Chi Cheng, but was glancing at the person who still had not come on stage, which was Gu Yue Fang Zheng.He understood well that, only Gu Yue Chi Cheng and Gu Yue Fang Zheng could truly be a threat to him.The former one was the same as him, a grade B aptitude with a limitless source of Primeval Stones. The latter was of a grade A aptitude. Although Fang Zheng wouldn\u2019t have such an abundant amount of Primeval Stones like them, he could only count on the Primeval Essence recovering speed according to his aptitude to practice as much as he could in such a short period.Right now, Gu Yue Chi Cheng\u2019s result had already been exposed. He was equal to Mo Bei. There was only Gu Yue Fang Zheng left.After several more groups, it was finally Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s turn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some disciples were muttering. Like always, there were people who could not differentiate those twin brothers, Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng.\u201cIt is Fang Zheng. Fang Yuan\u2019s face always looks solemn. Anxiousness will definitely not have appeared on his visage.\u201d Someone answered.\u201cAh, then I should see this. For three years, Fang Zheng is the only a grade A aptitude genius that has appeared in our mountain stronghold.\u201d One by one, everyone was searching with their eyes.Fang Zheng could feel the pressure lying in those pairs of eyes. This made him even more nervous.Standing on the platform, his fingers were trembling.He released the first Moon Blade. Initially, it was intended to head towards the scarecrow\u2019s bosom. However, because of his anxiety, he missed it. Thus, the Moon Blade chopped the scarecrow\u2019s neck.Soft astonishing gasps could be heard from the group of young men.The young men thought, that Fang Zheng had been doing it intentionally. He did not strike the scarecrow\u2019s bosom with ease, but aiming for the neck. That this was a strike to display his confidence.Hence, they couldn't help but anticipate his next move.Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Cheng\u2019s visages all turned solemn.In the field, of those being able to discover Fang Zheng\u2019s mistake, there were only the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder and Fang Yuan.\u201cHow dangerous!\u201d Looking at the Moon Blade, Fang Zheng cried out inside, silently felt lucky.He kept on gasping, forced himself to stay calm, then released another Moon Blade. This time, he did not make the mistake again. The two Moon Blade all accurately hit the scarecrow\u2019s bosom.Such results made the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder satisfyingly nod. Mo Bei and Chi Cheng also calmed down. Fang Zheng\u2019s performance was not much different from theirs. Let see how the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder decide on the score.The group of disciples immediately sighed. Fang Zheng\u2019s performance was not excellent. They were feeling quite disappointed.There was also nothing worth seeing in the next few groups. There was no one that could be as good as Mo Bei, Chi Cheng, and Fang Zheng.The youngsters then started to discuss softly.\u201cIt seems that the one getting the first place in today examination may be one of the three of them.\u201d\u201cThe three of them all hit the scarecrow accurately. I wonder who the Elder will value more.\u201d\u201cWait, in the last group, there is Fang Yuan.\u201d\u201cAh, he is that grade C \u2018Cold-hearted Genius\u2019? Haha.\u201dOnly until the last group did Fang Yuan casually walk to the platform.\u201cThat\u2019s Fang Yuan...\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei raised his head and took a glance at Fang Yuan. He then lowered his eyes. He could not care less.\u201cLast time, you got in first place only because you were lucky enough to choose a Moonlight Gu with a weak willpower. Let\u2019s see how you will perform this time!\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng crossed his hands, waiting to see Fang Yuan becoming a laughing stock.\u201cGege... This is different than last time. I have practiced diligently; I will definitely surpass you.\u201d In the crowd, Gu Yue Fang Zheng kept his mouth shut; his hands unconsciously turned into fists.From the last refining Vitality Gu examination, he had gotten a grade A aptitude, but he only came in second. Of course, he could not accept it.Especially when he knew that Fang Yuan\u2019s reason for snatching the first rank was purely based on luck. This made him even more unconvinced.To Gu Yue Fang Zheng, being able to win over his gege Fang Yuan had a specific special meaning.Numerous pairs of eyes were focusing on Fang Yuan. The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was also attentively looking at him.Fang Yuan did not change his expression but remained with his icy-cold visage.After he had stopped, fierce Primeval Essence was instantly being poured into the Moonlight Gu in his palm. As he raised his hand up, the first Moon Blade was discharged.The Moon Blade was flying up high, not only passing through the scarecrow\u2019s head; it was even higher than the bamboo wall. After flying for fifteen meters, the aureole got dimmer then slowly disappeared into the air.\u201cHahaha....\u201d Someone could not help but burst out laughing.\u201cThe slant is too excessive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d A person silently snorted.\u201cHe really is a genius. No wonder he got in first place for refining Gu.\u201d Another person mockingly said.In the early years, the fact that Fang Yuan had displayed his talent in writing poetry had made these people feel resentment towards him. After that, he got the first rank for refining Gu based on 'Luck'. This had added up their resentment, and also increased their jealousy.There were a lot of people who were waiting for a good play, waiting for this \u201cGenius\u201d Fang Yuan to humiliate himself. And Fang Yuan\u2019s Moon Blade did not let them down this time.Sound after sound of sneering arose non-stop in the crowd.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder slightly shook his head. He laughed at himself inside, why did he even pay attention to Fang Yuan? He was just a grade C aptitude. Getting in first place for refining Gu was just wholly based on luck.He had soon determined. Although Mo Bei, Chi Cheng, and Fang Zheng had similar results, he would still choose Fang Zheng to be the first rank.The battle between Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Cheng was the miniature of the political fight between the two greatest in power Elders in the clan. The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was on the middle ground. He did not even think about participating in this political whirlwind.He was leaning more on the clan\u2019s head, Gu Yue Bo. And Fang Zheng would possibly be the next generation clan\u2019s head. Moreover, he was a grade A aptitude. Choosing him to be in first place, treating him a bit better, these would help him get the acceptance from the higher authority in the clan.A warm spring breeze was gusting by, carrying waves after waves of fragrances, floating to the Martial Art Field.As the sunlight was shining upon Fang Yuan, a lonely shadow was reflected on the ground.His countenance was cold as always. Silently looking at the scarecrow over ten meters tall, the Moon Blade imprint in the middle of his palm faintly emitting aqua blue aureole.The first Moon Blade, of course, he deliberately made it plunge up to the sky. Right now, he only had two more chances. Considering the Elder\u2019s standpoint, if he wanted to come in first place, within these two Moon Blades, he had to create exceeding attacking effects that surpassed everyone.\u201cThere are only two chances left. It\u2019s impossible. Gege, I can finally defeat you.\u201d Light lit up in Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s pupils. Without adverting his eyes, he looked straight at Fang Yuan.From before until now, gege had casted a shadow over his life. Finally, at this moment, it had now gradually disappeared.Fang Zheng could feel that victory was almost within his reach. He unconsciously tightened his fists. Excitement struck him, making his body slightly tremble.\u201cGege, right now, when I defeat you, this is just the start. Next, I will continue to defeat you, over and over again. Straight until the shadow in my heart has been completely expelled. I want to prove to the clan members that a grade A is truly the great genius!\u201d Fang Zheng spoke to himself.However, right at that moment, Fang Yuan had acted.His hand was like a blade, striking down in mid-air.With a small echo, the dazzling aqua blue light left his hand, flying in mid-air. It slowly turned into a blue Moon Blade, aiming toward that scarecrow.At the next second, his hand immediately beamed with blue light once again.As he raised his hand, the third Moon Blade was discharged.His two continuous strikes were as smooth as flowing water and floating clouds. They were just perfect.Two Moon Blades in a row, flying in mid-air, they were not even half a meter away from each other.Under everyone\u2019s astonishing eyes, both Moon Blades accurately hit the target, which was the scarecrow\u2019s neck.\u201cThis...\u201d Fang Zheng\u2019s pupils drastically shrunk. A bad feeling started to vigorously arise in his heart.In that moment, the disciples were gasping their mouths in awe.They looked at the scarecrow\u2019s head. At first, it gradually slanted to a side, then fell down following its neck. Lastly, it laid on the ground, rolling off about two to three meters more.Fang Yuan had beheaded the scarecrow!Such a result had totally surpassed everyone\u2019s expectation.\u201cWas this luck, or competency?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder furrowed his brows.This doubt also lingered on the rest of the disciples.In that second, the entire Martial Art Field fell into silence.\u201cHow can it be....\u201d Fang Zheng muttered. He was dumbstruck, looking at Fang Yuan. The expanding feeling inside his heart suddenly deflated, making him fall into an abyss.Fang Yuan partly opened his eyes, as if he basically could not feel other looks falling on him.Cr-r-ruck, Cr-r-ruck...Under the blue sky with white clouds, a flock of colorful parrots suddenly flapped their wings, soaring to the sky. Dragging their phoenix-liked tails, they were gurgling, flying around happily.Fang Yuan stood in the middle of the field, raising his head facing the sky. Under the sunlight, the colorful feathers looked even more dazzling.With a faint expression, it looked as if the person who had just beheaded the scarecrow was not him.\u201cThe spring sunlight really is brilliant...\u201d He deeply sighed inside.Rate Translation Quality 2 comments \uff0cjoin in googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('chapter-ad-25'); });Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: The nature of all organizationsTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowAs it neared nightfall, the sun on the edge of the horizon looked like blood. The afterglow rays poured into the school where around fifty students sat upright. On the stage above, the academy elder was reading out names one by one, distributing allowance to them.This was the academy\u2019s weekly subsidy where every seven days allowance would be distributed. One could say it was financial aid for these young teens. After all with their capabilities, to feed and raise their own Gu was a lot of financial pressure.\u201cGu Yue Fang Yuan.\u201d The elder read aloud.Fang Yuan got up from the seat by the window at the last row. He walked up the stage, receiving two moneybags. In one bag was three primeval stones \u2013 the clan\u2019s allowance. The other bag held the reward of ten primeval stones.\u201cWork hard,\u201d the elder said. He gave Fang Yuan a deep look. Fang Yuan had continuously achieved number one, and this had let those elders who were originally disappointed in him start paying slight attention.Fang Yuan nodded his head and took the purse into his arms, returning to his seat.\u201cDamn it, he actually got number one again\u2026\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei fixed his gaze onto Fang Yuan firmly, his heart rather furious.\u201cThose two moonblades consecutively hit the neck of the puppet. Is this because of sheer luck or real skill?\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng narrowed his eyes. Since the end of the assessment until now, this question had been hovering in his mind.It was not just him \u2013 many students unconsciously drifted their sights towards Fang Yuan. This question haunted them. Although they had lost, their hearts were unsatisfied and they wanted to question what actually had happened.When the day was about to end, the academy elder announced a matter. \u201cYou all have been in the academy for an amount of time now, and you are familiar with how to use your vital Gu as well. In the next few days I will teach you all how to warm and nourish your aperture, advancing a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation realm. The higher the realm of a Gu Master, the more concise your primeval essence becomes. A Rank one Gu Master has green copper primeval essence; a Rank two Gu Master has red iron primeval essence and a Rank three Gu Master possesses white silver primeval essence. A portion of red iron primeval essence is comparable to ten portions of green copper primeval essence. Similarly a portion of white silver primeval essence equals ten portions of red iron primeval essence!\u201d\u201cYou must all remember, the Gu are just tools that we use. Cultivation is the foundation of us Gu Masters. The higher your rank, the stronger the Gu you are able to use. In the next three months, whoever can take the lead and promote to Rank one middle stage will receive a reward of thirty primeval stones. At the same time he will be able to choose the second Gu first. After three months, we will elect a class monitor and two vice-class monitors based on the results. The class monitor will enjoy a subsidy of ten primeval stones while the vice-class monitor will have an allowance of five pieces! Alright, that\u2019s all for today. You can all leave.\u201dThe elder\u2019s words made the academy burst with noise.\u201cTime to elect the class monitor and vice-class monitor!\u201d Someone clenched his fist in excitement.\u201cThe class monitor receives ten primeval stones every seven days, and the vice-class monitor gets five pieces? If I am able to be the first to reach Rank one middle stage, I will definitely be able to become the class monitor.\u201d Another had lights in his eyes.\u201cThe primeval stones are not the important focus. What matters here is the position of class monitor and vice-class monitor \u2013 it represents glory and places one\u2019s identity over others. When normal students sees the class monitor they must all bow and greet him.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei and Chi Cheng did not lack primeval stones, but they deemed the glory of the position very important.\u201cTo become the class monitor, without mistake it is the first person who promotes to Rank one middle stage first! That means when big brother see me in future, he would have to bow and automatically greet me. Hold up, where is big brother?\u201d Gu Yue Fang Zheng subconsciously looked back, but Fang Yuan\u2019s seat was empty.The students walked out of the academy.\u201cWhere\u2019s Gu Yue Fang Yuan?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei wanted to look for Fang Yuan and ask him face to face. However Fang Yuan was one step ahead and had long left.\u201cHmph, he sure ran away fast. Is he afraid? Looks like he got lucky again in today\u2019s test.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng sneered.\u201cWhatever, it\u2019s just ten primeval stones. I don\u2019t need to care about this small matter, right now what\u2019s important is to advance to middle stage and get that class monitor position.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei narrowed his eyes, looking at his side where Gu Yue Chi Cheng and Gu Yue Fang Zheng were.These two figures were his real enemy, while Fang Yuan was just a small C grade talent; he was not on par.\u201cIn the first two times, Fang Yuan got lucky and got number one. However this time it is a cultivation test, and the focus is on the talent of cultivation. When the talent is higher by a grade, the advantage becomes much greater,\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng thought, depressed in his heart. His real grade talent was only a C grade; it was only because of cheating that let him gain the illusion of having B grade.\u201cJust a mere class monitor and two vice-class monitor positions got them itching their fists. How hot-blooded and na\u00efve they are at this age,\u201d Fang Yuan sneered as he leaned against the gateway of the academy.The so-called glory was just a valuable tool the upper levels used to motivate those below them. In the end, it was just a layer of illusionary glory, it was useless!His five hundred years of experience had long allowed Fang Yuan to understand some of the secrets of life.\u201cWhether it comes to a clan, sect or demonic group, whether it is this world or earth, all organizations are like this. The high and low positions are established, making the law of promotion clear, letting those in the organization climb up non-stop from the bottom. Because chasing after profit is the nature of humans, and positions of authority often make people have superiority, creating the illusion that oneself is living a more valuable life than others.\u201d\u201cPower is like the carrot dangling in front of a donkey. The desires of humans are stimulated by it, and each of them secure their personal gains with someone with authority for it. After climbing up one level, there will be a higher level. While they are busy currying favour for personal gain, their hard work is squeezed out from them and their value is exploited by the upper position.\u201d\u201cIn every organization, as long as there is a chain of command, it is to give serve to those at the upper ranks. The so-called class monitor and vice-class monitor position is like the smallest carrot, luring everyone else into the structure of the clan. And to stop those below from realizing the truth, those at the higher positions integrate shared values, clear-cutting the idea of glory, meritorious deeds etc. The establishment of high and low positions are made along with unequal benefits. Sometimes the use of religion is done to dominate people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\u201cThis is the real truth, yet it is a pity that too many people in the world do not understand; they foolishly work hard for others. And for every organization in the world, the most fundamental of its essence is just one thing, and that is \u2013 The redistribution of resources, where the higher the position the more resources they can enjoy.\u201dIn his previous life Fang Yuan had founded the Bloodwing Demon Sect in the Middle Kingdom, where he taught up to tens of thousands of people. He erected the positions of demon soldiers, demon generals, demon sages etc. Each position gave their corresponding benefits, letting countless people flock over like ducks, letting Fang Yuan order them around. This kind of experience allowed Fang Yuan to understand clearly the way of thinking in this principle.\u201cThus any organization is just a representation, while the real basis is just one word \u2013 resources. Without food resources, one will die of starvation. Without water resources, one will die of thirst. Without cultivation resources, one will become weak and sooner or later, be bullied to death.\u201d\u201cAnd for a Gu Master, primeval stones are the most important resource!\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s two orbs were deep like an ancient pond, and as his mind reached this point the corners of his lips curled up slightly, creating the outline of a sneer.He had long left the academy, and right now he stood at the gate entrance of the school. He saw the first batch of students coming out, gradually walking closer towards him.\u201cIt\u2019s Fang Yuan.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing at the middle of the gate entrance?\u201d\u201cHmph, every time I see his dead dysfunctional state, I feel so pissed off.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s probably waiting for someone.\u201dThe young teens paid no attention to him. Just as they were about to walk over, Fang Yuan strode across and blocked them. \u201cI\u2019m plundering. Everyone must surrender a piece of primeval stone before they can leave.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You dare stand in front of the grand gates of the schoolhouse to rob us?!\u201d\u201cYou are so poor that you turned crazy? Who gave you the guts to put your intentions on us like that?\u201d\u201cF*** off, a grade C aptitude like you dares to stop us? Get lost, if not, I will kick you flying... A!\u201dFang Yuan abruptly acted.He fiercely threw a palm strike from his right hand. An accurate and rapid strike followed the direction of his hand, hitting the person standing on the left, right on the neck.How could this unlucky man expect Fang Yuan\u2019s sudden attack? He was cursing at him, then was severely attacked the next second. He instantly blinked, then went straight into a coma right then.\u201cSh*t! You really dare to fight!?\u201d The group was struck with surprise. One after another, unconsciously took a step back.\u201cGu Yue Bei Ju has fainted, what should we do?\u201d Someone yelled out in fear.What else could we do now! There are many of us, but there is only one Fang Yuan. Fight together, and beat him up good this time.\u201d A person shouted, bursting out his rage.\u201cExactly, he does not know about life and death, daring to provoke us all by himself. It seemed like he really had eaten a bear\u2019s heart and leopard\u2019s guts! Let\u2019s fight together, everyone!!\u201dHowever, Fang Yuan had already wanted to take action before they were even able to.He strode several steps ahead, towards the group of young men.He slanted his hand then hacked down, immediately hitting a young man\u2019s neck. The young man\u2019s pupils moved up exposing only his sclera. He fell down.\u201cA --!\u201d Another youngster loudly shouted. He clenched his hand into a fist and aimed straight at Fang Yuan\u2019s head.Fang Yuan crouched down, lifting his feet, kicking this guy right in the crotch.\"Oh my god --!\"Initially, the young man\u2019 shout was aroused by indignation. After this strike, his vigorous tone suddenly became sharper, almost like shrieking, full of misery and pain.Pup!He grabbed his crotch with both of his hands. As his knees gave out, he knelt down, rolling on the dirty ground. The sound of him yelling Ah, Ah, Ah, was reverberating. He was in so much pain that cold sweat was pouring forth from every single pore in his skin.Fang Yuan threw two continuous palm strikes, like a tiger entering a flock of sheep!He had five hundred years of fighting experience. And this group of young men was just newbies. They just started cultivating, how could they be considered his opponents?In a blink, the group had all fallen down because of Fang Yuan. They did not faint, but were laying on the ground, gasping for air due to being in pain, the pains made them feel as if they were half dead.\u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei was only one footstep slower; he cried out in fear. Looking at the grand gates of the schoolhouse, he saw that Fang Yuan was standing there, with five or six disciples fallen on the ground around him.\u201cThat, Fang Yuan, he wanted to snatch our Primeval Stones!\u201d A juvenile who was hugging his stomach on the ground angrily shouted.\u201cStill have lots of energy, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Fang Yuan kicked hard onto the young man\u2019s stomach while wearing a casual expression.AA!The young man was in so much pain he could not help but miserably yell out. His body was curling up like a shrimp. His visage displayed a gleam of fear. As his tears were falling down, he did not dare to talk anymore nonsense.Fear filled the hearts of the group of young men that were approaching Fang Yuan after seeing such a scene.\u201cGood, obediently give me one Primeval Stone each, and I will let you go. If not, these guys lying on the ground will also be your consequences as well.\u201d Fang Yuan stepped forward, talking with an icy-cold voice.\"Let me go my a**! A grade C aptitude like you can win over a grade B aptitude like me?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei was enraged. He raised his fist, aiming towards Fang Yuan\u2019s direction.Fang Yuan slightly moved his ankle, slightly leaned to one side, letting Gu Yue Mo Bei directly passed by.Afterward, he stretched out his left hand, putting his middle and forefinger together, aiming straight at the area below his throat and in the middle of his collarbone, accurately piercing into it.Mo Bei\u2019s eyes suddenly darkened. He fell down to the ground with a loud reverberation, and fell into a coma.Ss!.......After seeing such a scene, the young men who were intending to strike forward, one person after another, immediately stopped and gasped for cold air.Fang Yuan\u2019s attacking method possessed a profound mysteriousness in these young men\u2019s eyes.As they didn\u2019t take the Basic Fisticuffs seriously, they didn\u2019t remember these moves that had been mentioned in class. There were numerous areas in a human body where they were considered the weakest. And the areas which Fang Yuan had attacked were some of them. These areas, once struck, at the very least, that person would have immediately fallen into a coma. At most, their life would be threatened.Nonetheless, Fang Yuan was attacking with finesse.Those who were defeated either fainted or suffered extreme pains. They would have lost their abilities to fight for a short period. There was none who was severely wounded.This was the terrifying fighting experience that he had accumulated over five hundred years!\u201cYou are going to give it or not?\u201d Fang Yuan stepped up one step, forcing the young men.Those juveniles were glancing at each other. They all gritted their teeth or shouted out in anger while striking towards Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan was avoiding their strikes on one side. On the other side, he was fighting back. Although his cultivation base was low, but his capacity was still there. With a heart as calm as ice, his movements were fast yet accurate.BOOM, BOOM...Several breaths later, a group of people had fallen down to the ground again.\u201cToo fierce! Too cruel!\u201d\u201cThey would not, would they?\u201dThere were some female disciples, but they did not approach them. They widened their eyes. Looking at the scene, they were trembling even more.As Fang Yuan glanced over them, their visages instantly twisted. They hurriedly waved their hands while stepping back, \u201cNo, don\u2019t come over here. We will give it to you!\u201dAfter Fang Yuan had received the Primeval Stones, he let them go.The female group staggered along the way of exiting the schoolhouse\u2019s grand gates. Some other disciples were coming from afar.Wanting to exit this schoolhouse, they must have passed through these grand gates. Fang Yuan could stop every disciple when he was standing right here.\u201cWow, what happened?\u201d The young men were widening their eyes in surprise.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Gu Yue Mo Bei?\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng opened both his eyes and mouth widely looking at Mo Bei who had fallen into a coma on the ground.After Fang Yuan had spoken up, those young men once again angrily attacked him, then fell down.\u201cHonorable Elder, we will just stand here looking without stopping him? How could we clean up the consequences if someone were to die?\u201d The guards were all worried.And one of them was full of resentment, \u201cThis Fang Yuan, his guts is too big. He dared to rob his schoolmate\u2019s right at the grand gates of the schoolhouse which is under our control. He really doesn\u2019t have any regards for law or discipline! Master only needs to say a word, and I will immediately seize this guy.\u201dFang Yuan had blocked up the schoolhouse\u2019s grand gates, and fiercely and publicly robbed his schoolmates. From the beginning, this had caught everyone\u2019s attention.However, the guards, who were just normal people, did not have the power to punish the disciples. They could only report to the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder.As the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder heard the news, he did not immediately give any orders to stop him, but getting up to the pavilion and observing from afar.\u201cIt looks like he has a talent for fighting.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was getting more excited as he was watching the scene.Fang Yuan\u2019s performance on using the Moon Blade today had also made the Elder suspicious. Now, looking at him confronting every disciple by himself, he seemed to have that rampaging elegant manner in the battlefield. The doubts in his heart had been instantly washed away.In this world, there were people who were extremely sensitive when it came to fighting, this was a hidden gift. They were good at fighting and adored fighting. Toward fighting, they usually burst out with inspiration. Their creativity could usually have startled other people, to an extent of even creating unimaginable military exploits.\u201cThis guy was born to be a Battle Gu Master. It\u2019s a pity that his aptitude is just a grade C. It is still lower.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder deeply sighed.\u201cMaster, you don\u2019t intend to stop this farce? Letting him freely do what he wants, I\u2019m afraid that it will give a bad effect.\u201d The bodyguards beside him were displaying a gleam of worry on their visages.Rate Translation Quality 4 comments \uff0cjoin in googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('chapter-ad-27'); });Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stretched his hand, pointing at Fang Yuan from far away, then said, \u201cThis person has already taken control over the overall situation. Besides, he took action with finesse. When he hacked down on the disciple\u2019s necks, it was just beside it. He did not chop on the back of their heads. Because he knew, the areas on both sides of the neck could only incapacitate the other disciples instantly. Meanwhile, if it was at the back of the head, that person would have died in one strike. Hence, he did not attack in such a way,\u201d\u201cLook at the young men on the ground, is there anyone who is severely wounded? No! Even if they were wounded severely, so what? Depends on the Healing Gu Masters in our schoolhouse, we can\u2019t treat this kind of wounds?\u201d\u201cBut Honorable Elder, this person is too arrogant. He blocks the grand gates; he is obviously looking down upon us bodyguards. Not to mention he does not pay any attention to us, the point is that if the other clan\u2019s members saw this, what would they think about our schoolhouse? Letting a small grade C aptitude disciple to cause havoc in the schoolhouse without stopping him. If this spreads out, master\u2019s honor will also be affected.\u201d The bodyguard squinted his eyes, respectfully said.\u201cHumph, feeling this guy doesn't even care about your existences, you all feel that your dignity is being offended, don\u2019t you?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was displeased. He snorted, then using a sharp pair of eyes to sweep over them. As he did so, the bodyguards all lowered their heads, and did not dare to speak up.\u201cWhat isn\u2019t good about fighting? As long as it does not result in somebody\u2019s death, then it could incite the competitive thoughts in them, as well as temper their fighting willpower. Forbidding fighting is like strangling the fighting passion inside these young men! Before, fights still happened, don\u2019t they? They happened all the times, frequently even. It was just half a year ago. When the young men all possessed several fighting strategies, with power, they would feel the itch to exercise their skills; they were also in their warlike youth. Why didn\u2019t you stop them at that time?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder coldly questioned.\u201cMaybe before, fighting was just one on one. There is really few of those which could be at this scale. However, this time Fang Yuan has already created confusion among the disciples!\u201d The leader of the bodyguards answered.\u201cNo no no.\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder shook his head, \u201cThis was because you did not dare to stop them.\u201d Because after half a year, Gu Masters will surpass ordinary human\u2019s in term of fighting powers. You guys possess ordinary human bodies; how you can you stop them? Right now, you guys want to stop Fang Yuan, because you feel that he has just started to cultivate, he does not have enough power. Moreover, he\u2019s looked down upon you guys, making you guys felt like your dignities were being offended. But you guys need to remember; the disciples are all Gu Yue! They are the members of the Ancient Moon clan. They are your masters! No matter if they are young, or their powers are weak, they are still your masters!\u201dThe Elder\u2019s tone suddenly became solemn.\u201cYour surnames are not Gu Yue, what can you do? Because of your loyalty, I gave you this position as a bodyguard, rewarded you with some benefits. But actually, you guys are still servants. Only servants! A servant also dares to criticize his master, managing his master\u2019s things?\u201d The Elder\u2019s countenance was as calm as water.\u201cSubordinate don\u2019t have this thought, really don\u2019t have this thought!\u201d\u201cSubordinate don\u2019t dare to! Don\u2019t dare to!\u201dThe bodyguards were so scared that their faces had turned into the dusty ground color. They knelt on the floor one by one, constantly kowtowing.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder coldly snorted. He pointed at the leader of the bodyguard group who had just said that Fang Yuan had created confusion, \u201cCriticizing your master, remove yourself from the leader position.\u201dHe stopped for a while before he spoke up to everyone else, \u201cHalf a month later, I will hold another examination for the leader position.\u201dThe eyes of other bodyguards instantly lit up. They all felt excited inside.\u201cBeing the leader of the bodyguard group, they can receive half a Primeval Stone each month!\u201d\u201cBecoming a leader is a step higher than others. Except for the master, who would dare to confront the leader?\u201d\u201cIf I could become the leader, such glory ...\u201d\u201cEnough, why are you guys still here? Quickly leave. Wait until the fight is over then clean up the field!\u201d The Elder shouted.\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d\u201cSubordinate will take his leave!\u201dThe bodyguards were leaving the pavilion in fear. As they were walking on the stairs, someone stumbled and fell down the stairs. Immediately, the sound of people falling resonated continuously.However, being afraid of the schoolhouse Elder\u2019s power, the bodyguard was restraining themselves to the extent where their faces had reddened. They endured it with hardship, and did not make any other noises.\u201cHumph, servants are like dogs. After a period, the bones in their bodies will become itchy. Someone needs to knock on them a bit to make them scared. Throwing a small bone as incentive in turning them into dog biting dog; fighting with each other, to devote themselves for my clan. What is called holding the stick with one hand and holding a carrot with the other [1] is the one and only path for the high authorities.\u201d As he heard the sound from downstairs, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder satisfyingly sneered. He then turned around, pierced through the window and looked toward the direction of the grand gates.There were ten more disciple\u2019s lying on the ground beside the gates.Fang Yuan was raising his head and standing proudly. He was facing three female disciples who were having their backs against each other, shrinking on the side.\u201cYou, you, don\u2019t come here!\u201d\u201cIf you continue, I will use my Moon Blade to attack you!!\u201dAqua blue aureoles had all appeared on their palms. It seemed they were too anxious, could not help but invoke their Primeval Essence to urge the Moonlight Gu.Fang Yuan\u2019s body was one of a normal fifteen years old young man. If they released their Moon Blade attack, it would not turn out good.However, he wasn\u2019t scared. He scornfully sneered, approaching them step by step, \u201cYou guys really have the guts. Did you forget the schoolhouse\u2019s regulations? Inside the schoolhouse, one is forbidden to use Gu for fighting. If not, expulsion will be the result. If you want to be expelled, then by all means, please feel free to take action.\u201d\u201cThis...\u201d The female disciples were hesitating.\u201cThere really is such a regulation.\u201d The blue aureole in their palms gradually dispersed.Light flashed in Fang Yuan\u2019s solemn pupils. Seeing the gap, he instantly plunged forward, raised his hand, ruthlessly without caring if the other side were all women, with a \u2018bang, bang,\u2019 sound, he hacked down his hand on two people, incapacitating all of them.The other one did not have any more fighting will. Both of her knees had gone soft, paralyzed then falling on the ground. She cried like a pear blossom bathed in the rain, turned to Fang Yuan and pleaded, \u201cFang Yuan you don\u2019t need to come here, please spare me.\u201dFang Yuan looked at her from above, and coldly spoke up, \u201cOne Primeval Stone.\u201dThe soft figure of the girl slightly trembled. As she suddenly realized it, she hurriedly opened a big bag, taking out three Primeval Stones. Putting them in her palm, she raised it up toward Fang Yuan, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hit me, I will give you all of it, I will give you all!\u201dFang Yuan\u2019s expression did not change. He slowly used his right hand, stretched his thumb and forefinger to take one Primeval Stone from the girl's hand gently.The girl\u2019s soft body was constantly shivering. Fang Yuan\u2019 small hand, even though it carried the signature pale and delicate feeling from a young man\u2019s hand, to her, it was like a scary and terrifying demonic claw.\u201cI have already said, only one Primeval Stone.\u201d Fang Yuan stopped for a while, and casually said, \u201cYou can go now.\u201dThe girl looked at Fang Yuan in surprise for a long while. As she wanted to get up, her limbs had gone soft. She could not even stand up.The feeling of being scared of Fang Yuan had filled her heart. She was too frightened that she could not even use a single gleam of her strength.Seeing such a scene, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder could not help but shake his head.Taking advantage of this situation to figure out the innate talents in fighting in the disciples was his first purpose of observing.The girl who was paralyzed and fallen to the ground was a grade C aptitude. However, with such temperament, she could only be a Logistics Gu Master or engage in the production process of the clan. Do not expect her to go on the battlefield.\u201cBut in fact, this Fang Yuan...\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder stroked his chin as he squinted his eyes, which were flashing with light.He felt that this Fang Yuan was really interesting. Not only did he have a talent for fighting, but he also knew his limits. He had not surpassed the underline inside the Elder\u2019s heart when shaking them down for only one Primeval Stone. If Fang Yuan were to snatch two, then he had overdone it, the Elder would have stepped out.The allowance the schoolhouse gave out was only three Primeval Stones. Having taken one, then it did not have much effect. However, if two were snatched away, then what did they send out the allowance for? It was good enough just for it to be directly handed to Fang Yuan.Quickly after, the last group of disciples was coming over. There were only five of them, and Fang Yuan\u2019s twin brother was also among them.\u201cGege, how can you?!\u201d Your gut is too big. You dare to pick up a fight right at the grand gates, then even extorting their Primeval Stones!\u201d As he saw this, Gu Yue Fang Zheng was widening his eyes and mouth. He really could not believe the scene being displayed in front of him, \u201cYou should quickly and sincerely admit your mistake with the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder. This is not a joke; you can even be expelled!\u201dFang Yuan smiled, \u201cSounds reasonable.\u201dFang Zheng sighed out in relief. It seemed his gege had not gone totally crazy. It was good enough that he still listened to his advice.However, he suddenly heard Fang Yuan speaking, \u201cOne Primeval Stone per person.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Fang Zheng opened his mouth in surprise, \u201cYou want me to give you one too?\u201d\u201cMy lovable didi, of course, you don\u2019t need to give me.\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s tone was extremely gentle, \u201cBut your result will be the same with them.\u201dFang Yuan pointed at the young men who were lying on the ground, they were either incapacitated or moaning.\u201cYou don\u2019t even let your blood brother go!\u201d\u201cFang Yuan, you are crazy, you are too cruel...\u201d\u201cWe cannot beat him. A true hero doesn\u2019t look for trouble. We should just give it to him, getting through this crisis first.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Give him the Primeval Stones first. It is just one anyway. Afterward, we will report to the teacher, he will be sorry!\u201dTaken warning by others\u2019 failures, the rest of the youngsters obediently accepted Fang Yuan\u2019s shakedown while carrying a gleam of refusing to give in in their eyes.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d As they were about to leave, Fang Yuan called them back.\u201cFang Yuan, you aren\u2019t keeping your words now?\u201d The group of disciples suddenly became anxious.Fang Yuan turned to the young men who were lying on the ground, and deeply sighed, \u201cYou feel that I will crouch down and search through each of their bodies?\u201dThe group of young men was dumbstruck for a while. Then, they immediately shook, hesitantly standing still.Fang Yuan stared at them, and slightly squinted his eyes.As the cold light flashed in his eyes, five youngsters instantly felt their hearts beating faster, and their scalps were trembling.\u201cAlright, Fang Yuan, we understand your intention.\u201d\u201cI will help you this time then.\u201dBeing suppressed under Fang Yuan\u2019s tyrannical abuse, they could only lower their heads, searching for the money bags from the young men lying on the ground, taking out one Primeval Stone from each. Afterward, they gathered them up, handing them to Fang Yuan.There was a total of fifty-seven people in his class. As he had taken one Primeval Stone from each of them, Fang Yuan had a total of fifty-six Stones in his hand.He had already had twenty Primeval Stones before, but he used ten of them to buy a couple jugs of Green Bamboo Wine. Moreover, with the allowance and reward from today, in total, he had seventy-nine Primeval Stones now.\u201cExtortion, this kind of business without capital is the way to earn the most money.\u201d Fang Yuan put his money bag which had suddenly risen significantly into his bosom, then swaggered away.He left behind a bunch of young men who was lying still on the ground.Some other young men, including Fang Zheng, were dumbstruck, looking at Fang Yuan\u2019s figure which was going further away.\u201cQuickly.\u201d\u201cSpeed up, taking good care of the young master.\u201d\u201cWhere is the Healing Gu Master? Quickly, ask them to come over!\u201dThe group of bodyguards was yelling non-stop, all of them were competing to perform their best. Because of a little leader position, they were full of energy.Rate Translation Quality No comments.

    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cPut the wine jugs under my bed.\u201d Fang Yuan ordered the four servants of the tavern.Each of them was holding several jugs of Green Bamboo Wine. These were the twenty jugs of wine that Fang Yuan had come to the tavern to buy after extorting the other disciples.One jug costed two Primeval Stones. Because of the Wine Gu, Fang Yuan had spent forty Primeval Stones all at once.His bag which had just been puffed up had become deflated more than half in size in just a blink. There were only thirty-nine Primeval Stones left. However, it could still be considered worthy as such an amount of wine could support the Wine Gu for an extended period of time.\u201cYes, Master.\u201d The servants hurriedly answered. To the Gu Masters, they did not dare to show any disrespect.Moreover, since Fang Yuan had bought such a large quantity of wine; he could now be seen as the tavern\u2019s important customer. If he had just slightly said something to the owner, servants like them, could have easily lost their jobs as a result.After everyone had left, Fang Yuan closed the dorm\u2019s doors, then sat cross-legged on the bed.The night had fallen.In the sky, stars were scattering as the faint aroma was flowing with the night wind.Light wasn\u2019t lit up in the room. Fang Yuan consoled his mind, then put it into the Primeval Sea.One after another, waves were rising in the Primeval Sea. The sea water was emitting a signature bronze color glow. Each drop of sea water was the Bronze Primeval Essence that was distinctive to level one Gu Masters.The total mass of the Primeval Sea was only at forty-four percent capacity of the vain aperture. This was the limit for grade C aptitude Fang Yuan.The vain aperture was bounded by walls, which were a layer of thin, white light membrane, encircling the vain aperture to support it.There was nothing in the space above the Primeval Sea. The Spring and Autumn Cicada had hidden itself under Fang Yuan\u2019s command. It was deep asleep while self-cultivating.However, on the surface of the sea, a cute white fat Wine Gu was floating atop.It was freely gamboling in the sea water. Sometimes it would dive down, or wag its tail, splashing drop after drop of water.As Fang Yuan\u2019s mind shook, the Wine Gu would immediately respond. It stopped playing around, curled up into a wonton-shaped then slowly floated up to the center of the vain aperture, leaving the surface of the Bronze Sea.\u201cGo.\u201d Fang Yuan urged ten percent of his Primeval Essence to form a fine flow, plunging upward and pouring into the Wine Gu\u2019s body.The Wine Gu had soon been refined by him as it did not refuse anything that entered its body. It then completely absorbed this gleam of Primeval Essence into its body.Almost instantly, the forty-four percent sea surface had decreased by a bit.Turning the Primeval Essence into power, the Wine Gu which was curling up like a ball started to illuminate a white aureole. The halo mixing with wine fragrance gradually appeared then accumulated into a cluster of faint white wine mist.The magical wine mist did not disperse but encircled the Wine Gu\u2019s body.\u201cRise.\u201d Fang Yuan urged his intent and propelled another ten percent of the Primeval Essence.The Bronze sea water pounced on the wine mist. It then absorbed the sea water, little by little, until there wasn\u2019t even a trace that was left behind. Moreover, half the volume of that ten percent Bronze Primeval Essence had disappeared into thin air, only half had been left behind.However, this five percent of Primeval Essence was even more condensed than before. The former Primeval Essence was an emerald cover, emitting bronze glow. Right now, although this Primeval Essence was illuminating with the same bronze glow, the green hue on it was getting darker, turning into a pale green color.Pale green Primeval Essence was the color of the Primeval Essence that had belonged to an Intermediate level one Gu Master. The effect of the Wine Gu was to condense the Primeval Essence, increasing the Primeval Essence of a Gu Master to a higher small stage!A Gu Master had nine grand stages. From top to bottom, it was level one, level two, all the way to level nine. At each level, it will be divided into four small stages, which were Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Peak.Righ now, Fang Yuan was a Beginner level one Gu Master. However, with the aid from the Wine Gu, he had become an Intermediate level one Gu Master!\u201cTo condense five percent of the Intermediate Primeval Essence, it will require using twenty percent of the Beginner Primeval Essence. If I want to transform the entire forty-four percent of the Primeval Essence in my vain aperture to the Intermediate Primeval Essence, I would have to use almost eighteen hundred percent capacity of a Beginner\u2019s Primeval Essence. If I want to achieve this goal quickly, I would need to use the Primeval Stones.\u201dThinking like that, Fang Yuan opened his eyes, taking a whole Primeval Stone the size of a duck egg out from his bag.The Primeval Stone was an ash gray colored oval-shaped translucent stone. As the natural Primeval Essence inside of it was being absorbed, it would also constantly shrink.He gradually tightened his right hand, holding onto the Primeval Stone in his palm. He kept on consuming the natural Primeval Essence to replenish his own.The sea surface inside the vain aperture which was formally declining had slowly risen up again.Fang Yuan was not stingy when it came to using the Primeval Stones. He did not save any of it.\u201cI don\u2019t have any backup, friends or families to help. I can only depend on extorting other people. Today is the first day. Afterwards, when the schoolhouse sends out allowance after every seven days, I will continue collecting the toll at the schoolhouse\u2019s grand gates.\u201dHow could one bout of extortion satisfy Fang Yuan\u2019s desires? When a Gu Master cultivated, they would desperately lack Primeval Stones.About the consequences fromextorting the students, Fang Yuan could not care less.This world was different from Earth.On Earth, schools usually forbade fighting. They would mainly rely on keeping the peace and harmony of the school. However, in this world, fighting was the main theme.No matter if Gu Masters were still mortal, they still had to fight to survive. Sometimes it was wrestling with terrifying wild beasts, or joining together to fight against vile and frantic weather, or even battling the other Gu Masters due to vie over resources.So instead of restricting fighting, on the contrary, it was being encouraged and advocated.From youth till adulthood, from trivial fights to deadly battles, this was the portrayal of the majority of the humans.This world seemed as if it did not have any boundaries. Just the southern border where Fang Yuan was living, was even bigger by seven to eight times the total surface area of planet Earth. The living environment here was even crueler. Humans usually used the form of clans, established mountain strongholds, huddling up together.After a certain period of time, the mountain stronghold would be under the attack of either a flock of beasts or extreme weather conditions.Gu Masters then became the backbone in protecting the mountain stronghold. Each year, the decline in the armed force seemed relatively serious.The life called for supreme master with formidable fighting willpower. The clan called for a limitless number of Battle Gu Masters.Besides, Fang Yuan had his limits when taking action.He did not attack the chin area because it could easily fracture, hence, caused deadly accidents. He also did not attack others on their hindbrains. Moreover, he did not use his fists or his fingers to pierce them. He only used his palm. The number of times he kicked could only be counted on the fingers of one hand.None of the disciples who fell down had undergone severe injuries, at most were just minor wounds.Fang Yuan also did not like killing. It was just that he only considered killing as a method.Every time he had taken action, he always had a specific goal. Whatever method it was, as long as it could be a shortcut leading him to his goal, he would have used it.In other words, he either did things by fair means or foul.....Black clouds were coming over, covering the moonlight.A layer of shadow enveloped the whole Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold.As the night watchman hit his clappers, a \u2018bang, bang\u2019 sound started to reverberate that reminded people that the night had fallen. Also to beware of the fire, carefully guarded oneself against wild animals and also the Gu Masters from the different clans who would sneak in.In the mountain stronghold, several lights had not been put out yet.In Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s study room in the mansion of the Chi line, light was still illuminating.The high authorial elder used a gentle tone to console his grandson, Gu Yue Chi Cheng, \u201cI heard you were beaten by that Fang Yuan?\u201dGu Yue Chi Cheng\u2019s right eyes were bruised in a circle; he angrily said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Grandpa. That Fang Yuan is just a grade C aptitude, but he is too arrogant. He blocked us at the grand gates, regardless of the relationship of being schoolmates, he still robbed us, asking for Primeval Stones. What is even more annoying is that the schoolhouse obviously has their eyes half shut. Only until Fang Yuan had left did the bodyguards come rushing over. Grandpa, this time you need to help grandson in getting rid of his shame!\u201dGu Yue Chi Lian shook his head, \u201cThis is between you juniors. He only snatched away one Primeval Stone from you anyway; you weren\u2019t seriously wounded on top of that. I have no excuses to take action. Moreover, even if you were beaten up with severe injuries, grandpa would still not speak out for you, you understand why?\u201dGu Yue Chi Cheng was dumbstruck. He painfully thought, then hesitantly spoke up after a while, \u201cGrandpa, I can quite understand your opinion. You hoped I could count on myself to bring back my own dignity, did you not?\u201d\u201cThat is an aspect of it.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Lian nodded, \u201cYou have to remember, you aren't just representing yourself, but our Chi line as well. We have been confronting with the Mo family for several years. Your slightest movement can stand for the hope of the Chi family\u2019s future. Grandpa can silently help you, but you still have to stand up for yourself, creating your own independent image. If not, the hope of continuing the Chi line of our Elders would disappear.\u201dTalking to here, Gu Yue Chi Lian deeply sighed, \u201cThis is also the reason why grandpa had helped you to plagiarize, letting you pretend to be a grade B aptitude. Our Chi line needs a powerful yet formidable heir to be able to help maintain the Chi line in the future.\u201dGu Yue Chi Cheng was startled, \u201cGrandpa, grandson has understood.\u201dGu Yue Chi Lian shook his head, \u201cYour understanding is still lacking, you need to put more effort in it. Fang Yuan is just a small problem. Next, you have to diligently train the Basic Fisticuffs and get your feet back together. At the same time, don\u2019t forget to cultivate, quickly reaching Intermediate Level one. It will be best for you yo come in first place. It would be a big glory, as well as bringing assistance to our Chi Line.\u201d\u201cYes, grandpa.\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng loudly replied.\u201cHahaha, this is the true spirit a heir of the Chi line should have. Grandson, you need to try harder. Grandpa will use all his efforts to help you.\u201dRate Translation Quality 1 comments \uff0cjoin in googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('chapter-ad-29'); });Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlmost at the same time, on the other side.\u201cFather and mother, that was what happened.\u201d Fang Zheng stood up straight while respectfully said.In the middle of the hall, there sat Fang Yuan\u2019s uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu and his aunt. They were frowning while leaning on the back of a big chair.Aunt was gritting her teeth. She was feeling incensed by injustice because of Fang Zheng, yet happy in seeing the other\u2019s misfortunes, \u201cFang Yuan this rascal. He did not only extort others, but also, he did not even let his own brother off. Heartlessly cutting off their relationships like that! However, this time he has made such a big mistake, it seems that it is only a matter of time before the schoolhouse expels him.\u201d\u201cAlright, shut your mouth for a bit.\u201d His uncle sighed, then turned to Fang Zheng and said, \u201cYou only lost one Primeval Stone, don\u2019t worry. Go to the accounts office and get one more. Leave and diligently cultivate. There is nothing for you to do here now. With your grade A aptitude, there is a high possibility that you can be the first one to reach the Intermediate level one. You should not waste your innate talent. Your mother and I, all hope that you can come in first this time.\u201d\u201cYes, father, mother, I will take my leave.\u201d Fang Zheng left; his heart was full of worries.He silently asked himself, \u201cToday, gege blocked the schoolhouse\u2019s grand gates, extorting the other disciples. Creating such tremendous effects, there can be a high possibility that he will be expelled. If that happens, should I intercede for him?\u201dTwo voices started opposing each other inside his head.A voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to plead for him. He even snatched the Primeval Stones from his own blood brother. Even if he were to be expelled, he only has himself to blame. You may escape an untoward act of God, but never the evil of your own!\u201dAnother voice resounded, \u201cBut he is your blood brother, with a similar face, blood is thicker than water. Alright, even if you don\u2019t accept him, you have to plead for him. If you did not, how would outsiders see you? They would feel that you are a heartless person.\u201dSeeing Fang Zheng having left the room, aunt could not stay patient anymore and happily said, \u201cHusband, we should completely cut off Fang Yuan\u2019s living allowance. This rascal was too impatient; he\u2019s made a big mistake this time! He even dared to fight right at the grand gates of the schoolhouse, even extorting others. This is provoking the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder. I think it is a highly possiblility that he will be expelled.\u201dUncle shook his head again, \u201cYour thought is too simple. Fang Yuan won\u2019t be expelled. Moreover, he might not be receiving any punishment at all.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Aunt was confused.Uncle coldly snorted, \u201cFighting is encouraged, as long as there are no serious consequences. The fight this time, were there any disciples that had died? No.\u201dAunt still could not accept it, \u201cHow can you know there was none? Unexpected things always happen when it comes to this kind of fighting.\u201dUncle closed both of his eyes while leaning back on the chair, \u201cYou women, really are naive. You think the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder is just for decoration? When will the bodyguard appear? If they hadn\u2019t appeared, it meant that the situation was always under control. If someone was severely hurt, they would have soon come over, and would not wait until the end.\u201d\u201cYou are not a Gu Master; so you won\u2019t understand. The schoolhouse does not forbid its disciples to fight; they even maintain an encouraging attitude toward it. The more they fight, the better it helps them in their battles later. Some disciples could even create a lifetime friendships while fighting. The seniors won\u2019t look into this. This is already a customary rule. Whoever wants to put a spotlight on this, they will destroy such a rule.\u201dAunt widened her mouth upon hearing this; she unwillingly said, \u201cFang Yuan has grabbed a big amount of Primeval Stones, but nothing will happen to him? Will they just let him go like that? Having such an amount of Primeval Stone is a tremendous aid for his cultivation.\u201dUncle abruptly opened his eyes; cruelty could be seen on his visage, \u201cWhat can we do now? You want me to meet him then directly snatch away his Primeval Stones? However, it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t take advantage of this. Regardless of Fang Zheng being his blood brother, he still robbed the Primeval Stones from him. This is his faulty stroke. Fang Zheng is a grade A aptitude. One day, he will be much more powerful than him. We can exploit this and incite disharmony to split up Fang Zheng and him. Letting Fang Zheng completely stay away from Fang Yuan, being freely used by us!\u201dJust like that, three days had passed by.The dispute of Fang Yuan extortingdid not spread out nor being stirred up but was rather settled down.Without any seniors came to break the customary rule, or make it difficult for Fang Yuan, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder also casually had his eyes half opened.However, during this period, there were two or three youngsters who were annoyed about the result that their Primeval Stones were snatched away, so they came to Fang Yuan to challenge him.But Fang Yuan could easily have beaten them afterwards. Everyone knew that if they did not diligently train the Basic Fisticuffs, it would have been impossible to defeat Fang Yuan.Inside of these young men\u2019s hearts arose a surging wave of wanting to practice the Basic Fisticuffs diligently.The fisticuffs teacher was cheerful. He had never ever seen so many disciples who were this passionate and stubborn about learning fisticuffs. Before, when he was teaching them, the disciples were dispirited and yawning non-stop. Today they were bright and lively, constantly asking for advice.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder deliberately came over to ask about the situation.The fisticuffs teach carried a gleam of excitement in his tone and reported, \u201cThe disciples are unexpectedly enthusiastic. The change is drastic. However, the one called Fang Yuan is still lazy like before.\u201dThe schoolhouse\u2019s Elder laughed out loud, patting his shoulder then spoke up, \u201cThis disciple that you are talking about is the source of the changes that is now evident in the others.\u201dThe fisticuffs teacher was confused and astonished.Of course, these were not the only changes.Afterward, Fang Yuan undoubtedly became the enemy of every disciple, being hostile to and was isolated by everyone.No one would talk nor greet him.The young men put all of their efforts in secretly training the Basic Fisticuffs. After being encouraged and inspired by the seniors staying behind them, they had determined to regain their dignities on their own.The calmness from the outside had hidden the turbulent undercurrent.Four days passed by.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder had sent the allowances out again and Fang Yuan had come to take action again also.\u201cFang Yuan once is not enough; you still want to rob our Primeval Stones?!\u201d The disciples were being blocked by Fang Yuan at the grand gates started to feel scared.Fang Yuan stood at the center of the grand gates. Putting both hands behind his back, with a grim expression, he said with a calm tone, \u201cOne Primeval Stone per person and they will avoid some physical pains.\u201d\u201cFang Yuan, you are going too far. I want to challenge you!\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei angrily roared, then took the lead to fight.\u201cWhat?\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s brows slightly rose up.Mo Bei raised his two fists up, aiming forward. After several rounds, he fell and fainted on the ground.\u201cMo Bei you are useless, look at me!\u201d Gu Yue Chi Cheng yelled then headed to Fang Yuan.After changing stances from attacking to defending several times, he also followed Mo Bei\u2019s footstep.Fang Yuan\u2019s fighting experience was almost ten thousand times better than them. Although he had just started cultivating, the portion of the power that he used every time was just enough.These young men had just set out, if they all came up at the same time, they could possibly have created some tiny problems for him. But one by one was coming up like this; it was even easier than the first time that he had extorted them.A while later, he brought the bulging bag of money with him and casually left. The young men were left lying on the ground, some fainted and did not move even the slightest, some were clutching their stomachs or crotches, groaning and howling.\u201cBrothers, quickly come over and clear up the consequences.\u201d The bodyguards shouted, then came running over, one by one.Rate Translation Quality 1 comments \uff0cjoin in googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('chapter-ad-30'); });Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI diligently trained the Basic Fisticuffs for seven days straight, only to be knocked out by Fang Yuan after two strikes. Shame, shame !\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei was enraged, feeling ashamed and resentful inside his heart.In his house\u2019s courtyard, he was constantly throwing punches and kicks at the scarecrow. It was trembling while resonating bang bang sounds due to being beaten.Right then, a low laughter arose, \u201cDo you have a profound resentment with the scarecrow? Why do you hate it so much?\u201dListening to the familiar voice, Gu Yue Mo Bei\u2019s countenance was relaxed. He stopped then turned his head around, \u201cJiejie[1], you are back!\u201d\u201cYeah, the clan has appointed me on a mission to conduct an investigation, I\u2019ve been out for more than ten days...\u201d Gu Yue Mo Yan smiled then replied. She was Gu Yue Mo Bei\u2019s blood sister and was now an Intermediate level two Gu Master.However, her visage twisted quickly. A sharp look flashed in her eyes, \u201cYounger brother, what\u2019s with the wound on your face? Who bullied you?\u201d\u201cAh, it was nothing. I accidentally stumbled when walking, knocking my head on the ground.\u201d A gleam of confusion appeared on Mo Bei\u2019s face. He casually prevaricated a reason. He didn\u2019t hope for jiejie to know about such an embarrassment. He was the future heir of the Mo line, the blood grandson of Gu Yue Mo Chen, but he had been beaten unconscious twice in a row.However, the lucky thing was that he was not the only one who had encountered such a miserable misfortune. Everyone had their unfortunate due part.\u201cA, so it is like that. Be careful in the future then. Oh right, if you want to practice fisticuffs, you can\u2019t do this. You don\u2019t have the Defending Gu which can help wrap you with thick fabrics to protect your limbs from incurring any injuries.\u201d After advising several sentences, Gu Yue Mo Yan left.\u201cGreeting, Mistress.\u201d\u201cGreeting to you, Mistress.\u201d\u201cMistress has returned. Servant humbly greets Mistress,\u201dKeeping an icy-cold visage, Gu Yue Mo Yan strode over. The servants who bumped into her on the way all bowed down to give their greetings to her.She walked to the study room, didn\u2019t report but directly pushed the door open then entered.In the study room, Gu Yue Mo Chen was facing her with his back, standing in front of the table to practice his writing.\u201cYou are back?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Bei directly asked without turning around, \u201cInvestigating for more than half a month outside, what is happening with the wolf nest?\u201d\u201cGrandpa, how did you know it is me?\u201d Mo Yan was surprised.\u201cHumph, in this whole family, the only person who can rely on my favor to not follow the rules, whom doesn\u2019t even knock the door, could only possibly be you, who else can it be?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen\u2019s tone carried with it a gleam of criticism. However, when he turned around, his visage was gentle as he looked at Mo Yan with a smiling mood in his eyes.Mo Yan pouted, \u201cTalking about favor, grandpa has pampered didi even more than me. Because didi will be the family\u2019s future heir, so grandpa is strict toward him. That\u2019s why the outsiders could not see how you have pampered him inside.\u201dShe stopped for a while before continue asking, \u201cGrandpa, brother was beaten! I have just asked him but he lied. I didn\u2019t push him further, so I couldn\u2019t help but come here to ask Grandpa.\u201dGu Yue Mo Chen\u2019s countenance became solemn, \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201dHe put the brush down, dragging a chair over then slowly sat down.Mo Yan could not do anything but reply, \u201cThe Wolf Nest is also full. Based on the propagation speed, it seems there won\u2019t be a \u2018Wolf Tide\u2019 this year. However, there will definitely be a \u2018Wolf Tide\u2019 attacking our mountain stronghold next year.\u201dGu Yue Mo Chen asked again, \u201cThe \u2018Wolf Tide\u2019 basically happens once every three years. This is not unexpected. But among the pack, how many Thunder Crown Wolves are there?\u201d\u201cAround three.\u201d Mo Yan replied.Gu Yue Mo Chen nodded his head as he had calmed down. The Thunder Crown Wolf was the leader of the wolf pack. When the \u2018Wolf Tie\u2019 struck them, they were the hardest problem to clear out.Three Thunder Crown Wolfs were not that many because there were three mountain strongholds on the Green Thatch Mountain. If one mountain stronghold took on one, the power the pack used to attack them would also be erased.\u201cGrandpa, you still haven\u2019t told me about my didi.\u201d Mo Yan couldn\u2019t help but asked,\u201cI can tell you. Mo Bei was being beaten by someone else. The first time was seven days ago. Today was the second time. He was knocked out at the schoolhouse\u2019s grand gates. He had fainted right away both times.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen laughed then said,\u201cWho is it that has such big guts that had dared to knock out my younger brother?\u201d Mo Yan widened her eyes.\u201cIt was his schoolmate, named Fang Yuan. It was worthy for him to be beaten up....\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen loudly laughed.Mo Yan opened her eyes wide and asked in confusion, \u201cGrandpa, what are you talking about?\u201d Mo Bei is your blood grandson!\u201dGu Yue Mo Chen deeply looked into his granddaughter\u2019s eyes, then sincerely said, \u201cMo Yan, you are a woman, you may not be able to understand this. Failure and shame could improve other\u2019s capacity. Without failure, a skillful man won\u2019t be tempered out.\u201d\u201cGetting hit is Mo Bei\u2019s failure. He has now become clear-headed and started to consult with the guards on the Basic Fisticuffs. This is a type of improvement. And this improvement was brought to him by Fang Yuan. It has wakened him up. You are his blood sister. If you truly want to protect him, then you shouldn\u2019t interfere in his adolescence. Fang Yuan is a grade C aptitude poor kid. Mo Bei is a grade B and also has us as his backup. Sooner or later, there will be a day when he will stomp on Fang Yuan.\u201d\u201cKeeping such an opponent for Mo Bei. A woman\u2019s life calls for relatives, friends, and lovers. And in a man\u2019s life, those things are not essential. However, the only necessary thing that one can\u2019t lack is his enemies. You don\u2019t need to go and create trouble for Fang Yuan, understood? This is between the younger generation. If you interfere with this, it would be the big bullies the small. Breaking the customary rule, outsiders will also look down upon our Mo family.\u201dThere were several times when Mo Yan wanted to open her mouth to talk. However, seeing Gu Yue Mo Chen\u2019s attentive gaze, she could only lower her head and answered, \u201cYes, Grandpa. Granddaughter understands.\u201dShe hung down her head and left the study room. Even Gu Yue Mo Bei couldn\u2019t discover the different light which was beaming in her eyes.\u201cGrandpa, this is your way of pampering your grandson. I have my own way to protect my younger brother!\u201d Inside Mo Yan\u2019s heart, she had soon had another idea.....The luncheonette of the tavern looked quite noisy as several tables were all occupied by people who were eating their meal.One or two servants were holding a tray of food. They casually ran between the tables.Fang Yuan sat at a table beside a window. He ordered some food, then looking afar through the window while eating.At the horizon, the afterglow was like fire, silently blazing.The sun had descended more than half. It lingeringly gazed at the ground. Using the afterglow, it looked back.The mountain ranges from afar were already hidden by the sunset. On the street, there were people who were returning to their homes. There were some farmers who were walking barefoot, which were covered with dirt. Some herbalists were carrying herb baskets on their backs while hunters were lifting pheasants and wild boars, etc., with both hands. The rest of the people were Gu Masters. They usually wore a blue martial robe, looking capable and tough. A headband was tied on their heads as they put a belt on their waists.These belts were quite exquisite. To a level one Gu Master, the belt was blue. The middle of the belt laid a sparkling copper plate with the word \u201cOne\u201d carved atop.It was a red belt for level two Gu Masters. The copper plate in the center will have the word \u201cTwo\u201d.Fang Yuan was sitting next to a window. As he was observing, he could see six or seven level one Gu Masters. The majority of them were young men. There was a level two Gu Master. He was a middle-aged man.Normally, a level three Gu Master were the Elders. Level four was the clan\u2019s head, the leader of the mountain stronghold.A level five Gu Master was very rare. In the history of the Ancient Moon Clan, there were only the first and the fourth generation clan\u2019s head.\u201cIn fact, measuring the capacity of a clan is very easy. One only needs to find a place in the mountain stronghold to sit down and attentively observe the passer-bys to see how many level one and level two Gu Masters there are. That way; one can make out the clan\u2019s concrete details and capacity.\u201d Fang Yuan concluded some experience from the previous five hundred years he had been living.Take the Ancient Moon Clan as an example. Among twenty people who were passing by the street, six of them were Gu Masters. Among these six Gu Masters, there was half a chance that one of them was a level two Gu Master.With such competency, the Ancient Moon Clan had seized the best area that was ladened with resources, on the Green Thatch Mountain. They could be considered the overlord of the Green Thatch Mountain.Nevertheless, Green Thatch Mountain was just a tiny corner of this vast southern borderland. If looking at the whole southern border, then the Ancient Moon Clan could only be seen as a middle-class clan.\u201c I have only recently started to cultivate. With a Beginner level one\u2019s cultivation base, I am not even qualified to stomp into the southern borderline alone. I have to at least be at level three to be able to go farther.\u201d Fang Yuan deeply sighed inside as he ate his meal.The Green Thatch Mountain was too small; it couldn\u2019t load his ambitions. He definitely had to leave.\u201cHaha, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, I have finally found you.\u201d Right then, a middle-aged man grinned and came over.\u201cYeah?\u201d Fang Yuan slightly turned back only to see a yellow shaded visage like candles. His two eyebrows were touching each other. He had a tall figure yet a sturdy body. Right now, the one who was approaching him had his arms crossed over his chest. He stared at Fang Yuan who was eating his meal from above. An icy-cold gleam appeared in his small and long eyes.\u201cFang Yuan, disaster is hanging over you, do you know that? Hahaha, you even dared to hit the young master of our Mo family. Right now, the mistress of the Mo family is looking for you everywhere.\u201d The middle-aged man couldn\u2019t stop laughing. He was eyeing Fang Yuan from top to bottom. A gleam of threatening aura was emitting from his body.Rate Translation Quality No comments.

    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Making FunTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowIf a normal person was stared at by this middle-aged man, they would have probably developed fear in their hearts already.However, Fang Yuan lost interest after looking at him for a second and continued focusing on his meal, treating this man as if he were invisible.\u201cWho\u2019s that guy? He wears the clothing of a family servant, and he is not a Gu Master. Why would he dare to question young master Fang Yuan?\u201d An employee wondered as he hid at the corner of the inn, sensing that the situation may turn ugly.\u201cHmph, he\u2019s like a fox assuming a tiger\u2019s ferocity! By using the Mo family as his backing, this servant man dares to clamor at a Gu Master. If it were any other mortal man, they wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do this,\u201d someone beside the employee replied in disdain.\u201cEven so, as a mere mortal he has the guts to cause a ruckus towards a Gu Master. Tsk tsk, this kind of experience must feel really great.\u201d\u201cTch, you shouldn\u2019t think that a Gu Master is always high and mighty. Young Master Fang Yuan is merely a Rank one initial stage Gu Master, and he has just managed to refine his vital Gu. If they were to fight now, he may not be the opponent of this muscular and strong mortal.\u201d\u201cSigh, let\u2019s just hope that when they fight later, they will spare our inn and the furniture.\u201dThe employees chattered back and forth, but none dared to take a step forward, only staring from a distance.\u201cEh, you still have the mood to continue eating?\u201d Seeing as how he did not manage to intimidate or scare Fang Yuan, the muscular middle-aged man had a hint of doubt in his eyes. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m lying to you? There are already people reporting to young Miss and she will be here shortly. Do not attempt to run away young lad, because you won\u2019t be able to get away. My job here is to make sure you stay put. There will be much suffering for you later.\u201dFang Yuan paid no heed to the man and continued eating his meal.The middle-aged servant frowned as he did not see a hint of panic or shock from Fang Yuan. This made him feel ignored and his pride was severely offended.He had been a servant in the Mo family for over a decade, and he had acquired the trust of his master. Over a long period, he would naturally come to learn about the details of Gu Masters.Rank one Gu Masters mostly relied on their physical combat skills. In battle, a Gu worm\u2019s worth was attributed more to its deterrence factor than as a fighting force.He knew especially that for a young Gu Master like Fang Yuan who had just started cultivating, his physical strength was far inferior when compared to a grown man. If it came down to close combat, he who had trained for many years would gain the upper advantage.At the same time, Fang Yuan had supposedly only refined the Moonlight Gu, so at the max, he would only be able to shoot out several moonblades.The middle-aged man was used as a sparring partner from a long time ago, so he knew deeply that if a Rank one initial stage Gu Master were to use his primeval essence to unleash the moonblade, the most it could do was cut several palm-sized wounds and cause limited damage if it managed to hit the human body.Additionally, the man had the backing of the Mo family, so when he confronted Fang Yuan he had no fear, and was wholeheartedly trying to show off his worth to his masters so that he could be rewarded and deemed more useful to the family.\u201cYoung lad, you sure are courageous huh?\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s tone was turning unfriendly as he folded up his sleeves, revealing his well-toned and muscular forearms. His two arms were large and full of scars. The forearms had thick protruding veins and were even thicker than Fang Yuan\u2019s legs.The inn employees watched in fear and several customers were already getting up, paying the bills and leaving this land of conflict.\u201cFang Yuan has been found?\u201d Suddenly, the door emitted a proud, loud female voice.Mo Yan strode forward in big steps and entered the inn. Behind her were numerous family servants.Her body figure was decent, slightly tall and had the proper curves. But a long face like a horse\u2019s, an inherited gene from the Mo bloodline, caused her looks to be greatly affected, and thus she was only a middle-upper tier beauty.However, she wore a dark blue uniform, and a red belt, affixed with a square steel plate, tied around her waistline. The steel plate was engraved with a \u201c2\u201d.Additionally, she had just returned from after a clan mission, so there was still lingering traces of the hardship that she had just gone through.These added up to create a field of pressure and threat that was emitted to her surroundings. Thus, once she stepped into the inn, the entire place went silent under her aura.\u201cYour servant greets you, young Miss!\u201d The middle-aged man changed his attitude completely upon seeing Mo Yan. He tried to smile charmingly and he bent his body as he walked a few steps and knelt on the floor, greeting Mo Yan.Upon seeing this change in behavior, the workers in the inn could only stare in shock with their mouths wide-open.The tall and muscular figure, as opposed to his humble groveling attitude, was a great mismatch, and was seemingly amusing. But the employees of the inn did not laugh as his behaviour only greatly showed off Mo Yan\u2019s imposing pressure and status.Some of the inn workers could not help but worry for Fang Yuan as he was their major customer. If something were to happen to him and made him unable to patronize the inn any further, it would be a huge loss.More of them were secretly praying for Fang Yuan to surrender. If a fight really broke out and destroyed the inn\u2019s property, that would be worse.Mo Yan did not even take a look at the groveling Gao Wan; her eyes were fixed on Fang Yuan. She took a few steps forward and demanded in a fierce tone, \u201cSo you are Fang Yuan? You seem to be having a good meal. Hehehe, have you ever had a knuckle sandwich? I\u2019ll give you a taste of it, it might be even more delicious.\u201dEven though she said that, Mo Yan did not make a move.Fang Yuan\u2019s actions were too calm. It was strange. Did he have any secret backers that were protecting him?\u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be so, I\u2019ve checked before coming. This Fang Yuan only has an uncle and aunt that dislike him, while both his parents are deceased, and he even got chased out of the house by his uncle and aunt. In addition, he only has C ranked talent, so how could such a weak young man have any sort of background?\u201d Mo Yan thought in her mind.Regardless of this, the situation was still too peculiar. She had to test and probe further. Fang Yuan laughed and squinted at Mo Yan, saying, \u201cWho told you I was Gu Yue Fang Yuan?\u201dMo Yan was momentarily stunned, then she took a look at Gao Wan.He had just stood up, but upon seeing this he immediately knelt back down with sweat pouring out of his forehead. He stammered and could not give a coherent reply, \u201cMaster, your servant, your servant\u2026.\u201dThey had a drawing of Fang Yuan, but they did not know that Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng were twins that looked almost identical.\u201cNo wonder this young man looked like he had no fear. He is actually Fang Zheng and not Fang Yuan.\u201d Mo Yan\u2019s servants guessed in their minds.\u201cFang Yuan cannot be compared to Fang Zheng. The former is merely a C ranked loner with no background. The latter however has A ranked talent and was pulled into the clan head\u2019s faction at the Awakening Ceremony, and as long as he grows smoothly, he has a bright future ahead!\u201d Mo Yan did not get proper a reply from Gao Wan, causing her to be even more hesitant.At this point, the only ones who knew Fang Yuan\u2019s identity were the inn employees. However, they could not afford to offend either parties so they only kept their mouths shut.Fang Yuan was satiated from his meal. He stood up and glanced lightly at Mo Yan, \u201cYou want to find Fang Yuan? Come with me, I\u2019ll bring you to the school hostel to look for him.\u201d\u201cIf the person in front of me is Fang Zheng, I would not want to offend him. However, even if he is really Fang Yuan, I will follow him closely on this trip so I have no fear of him impersonating Fang Zheng.\u201d In an instant, Mo Yan made up her mind.\u201cAlright, I will go together with you to the school hostel. After you!\u201d Mo Yan turned her body to make space for Fang Yuan, stretching out her arm and indicating for Fang Yuan to take the lead.Fang Yuan laughed nonchalantly and strode forth. Mo Yan followed closely behind with her servants trailing at the back.\u201cSo close!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re finally gone!\u201d\u201cEven if they start fighting, it is none of our inn\u2019s business anymore.\u201dThe employees that were left behind all sighed in relief as they patted their chests.A group of people approached the school hostel.\u201cHalt!\u201d\u201cStop right there, the school hostel only allows our clan\u2019s Gu Masters to enter and leave.\u201d The two guards at the door stopped Fang Yuan, Mo Yan and her gang.\u201cInsolent! Do you not recognize who I am? How dare you stop me!\u201d Mo Yan stared at the two and screamed.\u201cWe dare not,\u201d the two guards hurriedly gestured.\u201cYoung Miss Mo Yan, this guard holds you in high regards. However the clan rules are absolute, so how about this. You can bring one servant in. This is the most we can do for you.\u201d An elderly guard politely responded.Mo Yan clicked her tongue. Her heart was full of dissatisfaction, yet in the presence of the clan rules, she did not dare to break them.The Mo family was prosperous, and thus they had many enemies. Do not forget that aside from the Mo family branch, there was also the Chi family to contend with. Apart from the Chi family, the clan head\u2019s faction also wanted to get a hold on the Mo family.\u201cAll of you stay behind. Gao Wan will follow me.\u201d Thinking about it, Mo Yan gave her orders.Gao Wan immediately held his chest up high with a look of joy on his face: \u201cThank you, young Miss for the opportunity!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, junior.\u201d Mo Yan smiled at Fang Yuan with a questioning look.Fang Yuan remained unfazed as he led them in. He reached the dormitory door, opened the lock and pushed the door open.He then took a step into the room and stopped.Within the room, there was nothing extra. It was all simple furniture, and there was no one else.Mo Yan stood at the doorstep, took a look inside and her face turned grim. \u201cJunior, you better explain yourself well, there is no one in the room!\u201dFang Yuan smiled faintly: \u201cAren\u2019t I someone?\u201dMo Yan stared at Fang Yuan, a glint flashing in her eyes as she suddenly seemed to have understood. \u201cI am looking for Gu \u2013 Yue \u2013 Fang \u2013 Yuan!\u201dFang Yuan snickered, \u201cYou know, I never said that I wasn\u2019t Gu Yue Fang Yuan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The angry hatchet-faced appeared as she finally understood that she had been played around with, by Fang Yuan all along.\u201cHa, you really have big guts, you even dared to make fun of your grandaunt!\u201d After she had finished, she stretched out her right arm, and attempted to grab Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan took one step back, raised his head and laughed out loud, \u201cMo Yan, you should have understood it!\u201dMo Yan stopped her moves. Her feet were still outside of the door. With her right hand raised still, in mid-air, a gleam of hesitation and anger flashed on her visage.There were clear and relevant regulations in the clan. The disciples staying in the schoolhouse were under their protection. No one was allowed to stomp in unauthorized and capture any disciples. Today, Mo Yan had thought that she would teach Fang Yuan a lesson, letting him try the taste of pain. However, she definitely didn\u2019t want to bear the consequences of violating the regulations.\u201cIt would be fine if only I have to take responsibility for violating the rules. I am just afraid that I will implicate the family, as well as grandpa.\u201d Thinking like this, Mo Yan retreated her hand with resentment on her face.She widened her eyes looking at Fang Yuan inside the room. The rage inside her eyes, if it could turn into flames, it could have easily incinerated Fang Yuan into ashes within such a distance.\u201cI have never tricked you. I said I would bring you to find Fang Yuan. Now, you have found him. It seems like you have something to tell me.\u201d Fang Yuan put both hands behind his back. Beaming a soft smile, he sternly and fearlessly confronted Mo Yan\u2019s enraged pair of eyes, without being afraid of the awe-inspiring skill of a level two Gu Master.He was only a step away from Mo Yan now. One was inside the room while the other was outside.But such a distance was already like that of a natural chasm.\u201cHa, ha, ha, Fang Yuan ,ah Fang Yuan, you have really thoroughly researched the clan\u2019s regulations.\u201d Mo Yan pressed down her rage, beaming an icy-cold smile, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you can only lengthen the time when depending on the clan\u2019s rules. It\u2019s impossible for you not to leave the dorm. Your grandaunt wants to see how long can you hide in here!\u201dFang Yuan brightly laughed, disdainfully looked at Mo Yan, \u201cI am more likely to know how long can you stop me for. Ah, when night falls, I have a bed to sleep in, how about you? If I don\u2019t show up at tomorrow\u2019s class, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder would definitely investigate this, what do you think that I would say then?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Mo Yan was burning with anger. She pointed at Fang Yuan, and was eager to take action, \u201cYou really think that I don\u2019t dare to come in and catch you?\u201dCreak.Fang Yuan widely opened the dorm room\u2019s doors. As his mouth sketched out a smile, his eyes were as deep as a pond. Using a tone as if he was certain about controlling the whole situation, he casually yet provokingly said to Mo Yan, \u201cThen please move.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026ha\u2026ha...\u201d Mo Yun, on the contrary, was clearly conscious. She squinted her eyes, looking at Fang Yuan, \u201cYou think I will be incited by you?\u201dFang Yuan shrugged his shoulders. He had soon discovered Mo Yan\u2019 s temperament.If he were to close the doors completely, or only close it by half, there would be at least half a chance where Mo Yan would fiercely stomp in. However, if he deliberately opened the doors widely, on the contrary, Mo Yan would be conscious. She would become more scrupulous, thus the possibility where she would break through it would be extremely small.After five hundred years, he had soon understood well the weaknesses of the human nature.He casually turned around, exposing his entire back to Mo Yan. If Mo Yan wanted to catch him right now, she could have done it with just one strike. However, Mo Yan was still standing outside the door without the slightest movement, as if there was an invisible mountain that was blocking her path, right in front of her.Right when Fang Yuan had sat cross-legged on the bed, Mo Yan was still looking at him with resentment. She gritted her teeth and still didn\u2019t move.\u201cThis is the sad part of humans.\u201d Fang Yuan was sitting cross-legged while looking at Mo Yan who was foolishly standing outside the door, then exclaimed inside, \u201cSometimes, to stop a person, one doesn\u2019t need to depend on a material basis, but the shackles of the mind.\u201dIn terms of cultivation base, right now, Fang Yuan was not Mo Yan\u2019s opponent. But even though she had a level two cultivation base, she could only look at Fang Yuan helplessly and wasn\u2019t able to any take actions.She was just a few steps away from Fang Yuan. Not to mention that the door was wide open, without any obstacles. The thing binding her right now was herself.\u201cHuman study by every possible means, to acknowledge the world as well as understand the rules with the main goal of exploiting the rules. If one is being bounded by the rules, they would be helpless due to their own learning and knowledge. This is the real tragedy.\u201d Fang Yuan looked over at Mo Yan before he slowly closed his eyes, putting his mind to the Primeval Sea.\u201cThis Fang Yuan just casually cultivates in front of my face! He really didn\u2019t even spare me a glance!!\u201d Seeing such a scene, Mo Yan was so angry that a twitchy feeling was bursting out of her chest, to the point that she wanted to spurt out blood.She couldn\u2019t wait to be able to stomp forward and throwing a few punches on Fang Yuan!However, she knew that she could not.Mo Yan suddenly felt a gleam of regret. She stood outside the door and fell into a state of embarrassment in knowing that she couldn\u2019t have stepped out once having entered.She was not willing to stop, but she couldn't have expressed it with her face. Dragging in lots of people by herself, she wanted to teach Fang Yuan a lesson but had ended up with having her head and face being filthily slathered with grime.Especially when there was another servant who was looking at her.\u201cDamn it! This brat Fang Yuan is such a misfit, too cunning!\u201d Mo Yan angrily thought. She started to scold and curse at Fang Yuan, in an attempt to incite him to get out.\u201cFang Yuan, you brat, have some guts and come out!\u201d\u201cFang Yuan, you are a man, take responsibility for what you have done. Turning into a turtle and shrinking its head right now, you have really made me look down on you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t put on an act in front of your own grandaunt, be tactful and roll out here for me right now!\u201d\u201cYou coward, good-for-nothing wretch!!\u201dFang Yuan ignored it as he didn't even respond.After cursing at him for a while, Mo Yan still didn't feel the normal satisfactory feeling when cursing people, but instead, she was feeling even more oppressed.She gradually felt like she was a clown or a vixen. This misdeed of standing in front of the house was really shameful.\u201cAh\u2026A..Ah\u2026, you really piss me off!\u201d Mo Yan was getting crazy then finally gave up on provoking him.\u201cFang Yuan, you may have gotten away today, but not tomorrow.\u201d She angrily stomped her feet, then unwillingly left. Before she was leaving, she ordered, \u201cGao Wan, you stay here, and look after him! Grandaunt doesn't believe that he won\u2019t step out.\u201d\u201cServant understood!\u201d The sturdy man, Gao Wan, hurriedly replied, using a respectful pair of eyes to send Mo Yan away. However, he was grumbling inside. When night fell, the mountain was damp and cold. He himself had to take guard here through the entire night. If he wasn't careful, he could easily catch a cold. This was true drudgery.Whooshing, whooshing...Waves after waves were arisen along with the tide inside the Primeval Sea.The Bronze Primeval Essence was gathered like water, forming tides that were constantly washing the four walls of the vain aperture under Fang Yuan\u2019s intent.The walls that surrounded a level one Gu Master\u2019s vain aperture were a layer of white light. Right now, under the dashing waves of the Bronze Primeval Essence was a brilliant aureole, which was creating indescribable miraculous sounds.Times was passing by, as drop after drop, of water was dripping. The Bronze Primeval Sea had gradually declined.With the initial forty-four percent, it had now become only twelve percent.\u201cWhen a Gu Master wants to enhance his level, he needs to use his Primeval Essence to replenish the vain aperture constantly. The walls of a beginner Gu Master are light layers, while an Intermediate Gu Master will be water layers. And for the Advanced stage, it will be a stone layer. If I want to enhance myself from a Beginner to that of the Intermediate stage, I have to carefully wash away the light layers of the vain aperture, replenishing it into water layers.\u201dThe memories of five hundred years ago had made Fang Yuan had the phases of cultivation at his fingertips, as clear as day.He gradually opened his eyes.At this time, it was already night.The crescent moon was hanging up high in the night sky while emitting pure white moonlight like water.As he opened the door widely, the moonlight immediately intruded, making Fang Yuan think about a line from a famous poem on Earth, Bright moonlight before my bed; I suppose it is frost on the ground.[1]The night wind blew by, carrying a gleam of coldness.Fang Yuan didn't have a Gu that was capable of preserving heat. With a body of a fifteen-year-old young man, he couldn't help but tremble.The night at the mountain was extremely cold.\u201cBrat, you finally open your eyes. How long are you intending to cultivate?! Get out quickly, whether you hide or not, you will die anyway. You have beaten up our young master Mo Bei, being taught a lesson by our Mistress is just a matter of time.\u201d Looking at Fang Yuan who had finally moved, the despotic servant Gao Wan, who was still standing outside the door had suddenly awakened.Fang Yuan slightly opened his eyes. Looking at his appearance, it seemed that the level two female Gu Master had already left.\u201cRascal, do you hear me? Roll out here for me. You have a room to stay in and a bed to sleep on. But your father is standing in the courtyard. If you don\u2019t come out, believe it or not, I will stomp inside?!\u201d Seeing Fang Yuan didn't react, Gao Wan threatened.Fang Yuan was indifferent as usual.\u201cScoundrel, roll out here and submit yourself. You have offended our Mo line; there will be no good days in the future for you anymore. Quickly bow in front of our Mistress and admit your wrong doings, then there may be a chance that she will forgive you.\u201d Gao Wan continued cursing.Fang Yuan ignored him. He took out a Primeval Stone from his money bag and held it in his hand. Then, he slowly closed his eyes again.In seeing that Fang Yuan was about to continue cultivating, Gao Wan got irritated then loudly yelled, \u201cYou are a grade C aptitude, at most is a level two Gu Master. What is there to cultivate? Just with you alone, how can you fight against the entire Mo line? Brat, are you deaf? Can you hear your uncle talking?!\u201dRate Translation Quality 1 comments \uff0cjoin in googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('chapter-ad-33'); });Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Loading Up My Fight On You!Translator: - - Editor: - -Fang Yuan wholeheartedly blocked his ears and refused to listen.He was absorbing the natural Primeval Essence from the Primeval Stone on one side and observing his vain aperture on another side.Initially, the sea surface of the Primeval Essence in the vain aperture was downcast. However, having followed the natural Primeval Essence that was being poured in non-stop, it had started to gradually rise again.The picking up pace was quite slow, but Fang Yuan wasn't feeling anxious.Once one\u2019s cultivation was accumulating, one couldn't be in a hurry.The one who was truly anxious was the middle-aged servant outside the room.About half an hour later, Fang Yuan\u2019s Bronze Primeval Sea had once again reached its forty-four percent limited capacity.Nevertheless, it was not done yet.The emerald hue that the Primeval Sea was showing off was the Bronze Primeval Essence of a Beginner level one.The Primeval Essence Fang Yuan had used to replenish his vain aperture\u2019s walls was not this Beginner Primeval Essence. It was the Intermediate Primeval Essence that appeared after refining the Wine Gu.\u201cWine Gu.\u201d As Fang Yuan\u2019s intent shook, the Wine Gu immediately soared up from the Primeval Sea. It was hanging in mid-air, curling up into a white wonton.Swoosh.He urged ten percent of his Primeval Essence to intrude the Wine Gu\u2019s body. Quickly after, it had been absorbed without leaving behind a single drop.Afterward, a pure mist carrying the scent of wine was emitted from the Wine Gu\u2019s body, gathering into a cluster.Fang Yuan urged another ten percent of the Primeval Essence to enter this wine mist.After the wine mist had consumed it, the initial ten percent of Beginner Primeval Essence had been reduced in volume. At the same time, the color was also changed from that of an emerald to a dark green hue.This was the Intermediate Primeval Essence.\u201cA normal disciple who wants to enhance their cultivation base has to use the Beginner level one Primeval Essence. But I had just used the Intermediate Primeval Essence, and the efficiency has already been doubled at the very least. At the same time, using the Intermediate Primeval Essence to urge the Moonlight Gu to release the Moon Blade will make it even more formidable than using only the Beginner Primeval Essence.\u201dOnly until his entire Primeval Sea had been extracted and refined into the Intermediate Primeval Essence did Fang Yuan open his eyes.Cultivation with no regards to time; right now, it was already dawn.The sky wasn't pitch black anymore, but instead, it was a shade of a dull dark blue hue.The rays of the moonlight had almost disappeared, leaving behind only a few dim stars.The entrance had been wide opened for the whole night. The under part of the wooden doors had been soaked, displaying the color of black mildew, due to being saturated with water.That was the bad thing about the schoolhouse\u2019s dorm. It was not as comfortable as those hanging bamboo houses but was directly situated on the ground. That was why the humidity was quite severe.Picking himself up, Fang Yuan then felt a cool air that was covering his own body. Due to sitting cross-legged for too long, his two legs were all numb.As he opened his right fist, ash gray stone powder, started to spill immediately.This was the remaining powder after the natural Primeval Essence inside the Primeval Stone had been completely absorbed.\u201cCultivating for a whole night, I have used up three Primeval Stones.\u201d Fang Yuan silently calculated inside.He was only a grade C aptitude, but because of chasing after the cultivation\u2019s speed, he always took advantage of the Primeval Stones to replenish his Primeval Sea. Afterward, the most critical point was that he had used the Wine Gu to refine his into the Intermediate Primeval Essence.The consumption of the Primeval Stones would then have a big increase in acceleration.\u201cAlthough I had snatched several away yesterday, I used up three Primeval Stones in just one night. If this continues, even if the Primeval Stones look many, it still wouldn't be able to bear the continuous consumption for cultivating... However, it\u2019s natural to pay a big price when one wants to chase after the speed and efficiency in cultivation.\u201dFang Yuan looked out the window again.He saw that the sturdy servant Gao Wan was crouching in the corner, curling up his entire body, looked like he was sleeping.\u201cIt seems that a level two female Gu Master has soon left. She had left Gao Wan behind to keep an eye on me. Haha.\u201d Fang Yuan beamed a cold smile at the corner of his mouth. He got off his bed and started to secretly practice the fisticuffs.As his body was heating up, he went out of the room.\u201cYou! This brat has finally come out. How is it? Obediently give up and follow me. You must kowtow to my Mistress to express your apology.\u201d As Gao Yuan\u2019s ears moved, he picked up Fang Yuan\u2019s footsteps, then immediately stood up.With his robust figure, his head was almost double the size of Fang Yuan\u2019s.Energy was surging in his body. Under his brows was a pair of small eyes which were flickering with bloody and malicious light. He looked like a starved hyena right now.Fang Yuan\u2019s visage didn't change as he continued walking forward.\u201cRascal, I would have forgiven you if you had went out earlier. But now, do you know how much hardships I have gone through just keeping an eye on you?\u201d He laughed on one side. On the other side, he stepped up and confronted Fang Yuan. His countenance was harboring evil intentions.Right then, Fang Yuan abruptly yelled before having jumped up high and throwing two punches straight at Gao Wan.\u201cYou brat have no idea of life or death!\u201d Gao Wan\u2019s face was twisted. The anger was brimming inside of him as he whirled his fists which were the size of a graveled stone, aiming towards Fang Yuan.The powers of these fists were intimidating. It broke through the air, bringing along the rustle sounds from the wind.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes were as cold as water. Seeing the fists coming to him, he directed his feet and dashed towards Gao Wan in a split second.He stretched out his fingers and pierced it into Gao Wan\u2019s waist.Gao Wan used his arms to block it. Thus Fang Yuan\u2019 strike didn't accurately hit his waist, but his left forearm instead.Fang Yuan knew his finger had hit an iron platter as his finger was struck with pain and was now numb.\u201cThis Gao Wan is already a mortal who is at the peak of the martial art skills. I only have the Moonlight Gu to fight now. Without the aid of other Gus, I am no match for him when it comes to fisticuffs!\u201d Light lit up in Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes. He immediately gave up on attacking. Instead, he stepped back several steps, maintaining the distance.In the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, only the members of the Ancient Moon clan were qualified to become a Gu Master.To the rest, no matter whether they had or didn\u2019t have an aptitude for cultivating, they were not qualified to be abe to participate in the Sacrificial Ceremony.However, this mortal could cultivate fisticuffs.It seemed the Gao Wan in front of him was not a Gu Master, but he had definitely cultivated with hardships on fisticuffs. His basic knowledge was relatively solid. Moreover, he was a middle-aged man, being at the phase of life when one would be the most youthful and powerful.Except for using the Moonlight Gu to fight, Fang Yuan only had a figure of a fifteen year old young man. No matter if it was power, speed, or tolerance, he was not Gao Wan\u2019s opponent.A martial master like Gao Wan was enough to kill a Beginner level one Gu Master. Even if it was a level two Gu Master, he could still hold some threats.\u201cYou! Brat is too cunning!\u201d Looking at the distance between himself and Fang Yuan, Gao Wan could still feel the sense of fright lingering in his heart.The waist was the vital part of a human. One it had been punctured with force, the pain that ensued, wouldn\u2019t be small. With an overwhelming force, it could have even created fatal incidents.Gao Wan had stayed outside for half the night. The cold and moist air had covered his entire body and slowed his reflex. Fang Yuan was only a line away from succeeding the strike from before. Luckily, although he had always flattered people, he was also constantly training. At the critical time, the instinct of the body overrode the reaction of the mind, so it was incredibly thrilling for him to block Fang Yuan\u2019 strike.\u201cI can\u2019t underestimate him anymore. This brat is a wolf cub. His action is cruel yet cunning. If I\u2019m not careful, I can get hit. No wonder young master was knocked out by him twice.\u201d Gao Wan wiped away the cold sweat on his head. Sweeping away the disdain from before, he now only had respect towards Fang Yuan.\u201cCatch this brat; I will accomplish a great merit. When that happens, Mistress would definitely reward me!\u201d A Beginner level one Moon Blade can only be considered as a knife. As long as it doesn't hit my vital parts, at most, it can only shed blood or cut skin.\u201dGao Wan\u2019s blood was boiling after thinking like that. Stretching out his hands which were like iron, he aimed to catch Fang Yuan.Bang, Bang, Bang.Fang Yuan was fearless. Facing Gao Wan, he was fighting with him at a close distance. During the time they were using their fisticuffs technique, they constantly switched from attacking to defending, reverberating ringing sound non-stop.When he had extorted the disciples, he only used his palms, using the subduing technique as the priority method to control the situation. However, he didn't hold back when fighting with Gao Wan now.There was a time when he would use his finger in an attempt to gouge out his eyes or pierce through his throat. Sometimes he would use the edge of his palm to hack down on Gao Wan\u2019s hindbrain or use his knee to hit his crotch. Sometimes, with his elbow, he would poke Gao Wan\u2019s waist.Gao Wan was fighting until his cold sweat was pouring.One strike after another, Fang Yuan didn't give up on Gao Wan\u2019s vital parts. His method was cruel yet pungent. He really wanted to push Gao Wan to the brink of death.Gao Wan was just a mortal. Unlike a Gu Master, although he had diligently trained his fisticuffs, his vital parts were still vital. Mortals couldn't tie their eyelids with steel. These were the limits of the martial art training for the mortals.On the contrary, Gao Wan didn't dare to use any fatal strikes on Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan was a member of the Ancient Moon Clan. If he had killed Fang Yuan, he would have enraged many people. He would certainly have his limbs torn apart from five horses. When that happened, the Mo family would have to face their first cleaning up rite of one of their members.Hence, he thought about catching Fang Yuan. It would be best if he could make him taste a bit of pain during the process.One side was holding back scrupulously while the other stored a killing intent. With such a situation, of course, Fang Yuan was loading his fight on Gao Wan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFang Yuan could only gain the upper hand for this time being, but not for long.The on-going fisticuffs had made him gasp. On the contrary, Gao Wan\u2019s breathing was at ease. The difference between the two of them in terms of their physical strength was enormous.Simultaneously, as Gao Wan was exercising, his body heat was also being emitted. His pace of throwing out punches and kicks were quicker which was washing away the numbness and slowness that was brought in by the cold air. This had started to truly display his capacity after dozens of years of training under intense hardships.\u201cBrat, you cannot win over me.\u201d Inside this schoolhouse, you are not allowed to use your Moonlight Gu; this is the clan\u2019s regulation. You are done for. Today, I will definitely make you my prisoner!\u201d Gao Wan fiercely laughed out loud. Having an abundance of battling experience, he attempted to use his words to crackdown on Fang Yuan\u2019s fighting willpower.\u201cI am still a young man. My body hasn't matured yet; its competency cannot be compared to this servant.\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s mood was like ice. After five hundred years of demonic cultivating, how could his fighting willpower, possibly be shaken?\u201cMoonlight Gu!\u201d When his mind shook, he urged the Primeval Essence on one side, and jumped back to the other side, keeping a distance with Gao Wan.Gao Wan, who wanted to chase after him, suddenly realized a dazzling layer of aqua blue aureole light that appeared on his palm.His visage became solemn in a second; he yelled, \u201cBrat, you are using Gu to fight in the schoolhouse grounds, this is against the clan\u2019s regulations!\u201d\u201cSo what if I go against it?\u201d Fang Yuan coldly sneered. He needed no reminders as he had already learned and thoroughly understood the clan\u2019s regulations. It was simply just because he didn\u2019t want to follow them.Right now, his palm was like a total void toward Gao Wan.With a small giggling sound, the blue Moon Blade was released, aiming straight at Gao Wan.Gao Wan gritted his jaw. He clasped his hands together and formed a hand-shield in front of him. At the same time, he didn\u2019t stop dashing forward, recklessly heading towards Fang Yuan. He had intended to solidly confront him in getting the job done quickly.The Moon Blade made a puff sound as it hit Gao Wan\u2019s arms. Blood splashed out under the moonlight. A sense of severe pain, immediately and unexpectedly, struck into Gao Wan\u2019s mind.\u201cHow can it be?!\u201d He abruptly stopped dashing forward. Looking at both of his arms which had been slashed, leaving deep gashes, he was now very frightened. Blood was constantly flowing out from the cut, as his body was covered with blood. Even his pale fractured arm bone was exposed, protruding awkwardly out.Gao Wan was feeling horrified inside right now, \u201cThis is impossible! Beginner level one Moon Blade could only cut through my flesh. How could it chop off my bone? Only the Intermediate level one could be able to do this!!\u201dHe, of course, didn\u2019t know that although Fang Yuan was a Beginner level one Gu Master, because of the refined Wine Gu, he had already had an Intermediate level one Primeval Essence.The Moon Blade that was released from the Moonlight Gu which had been urged by the Intermediate Primeval Essence, would normally have been more powerful, and surpassed that of the Beginner level.\u201cNot good, this brat is too strange!!\u201d Gao Wan was astonished, he couldn\u2019t be able to prepare for it as he had received severe wounds. His fighting willpower had completely dispersed. After having quickly decided, he wanted to retreat.\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d Fang Yuan coldly laughed. He started his pursue, while the Moon Blades were constantly being released from his hand.\u201cHelp me!!\u201d Gao Wan yelled out. As he was running away, the sound reverberated around the quiet schoolhouse.\u201cWhat happened? Someone is calling for help!\u201d The voice alerted the schoolhouse\u2019s bodyguards from nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s the despotic servant that Mo Yan Mistress of the Mo Family has left behind.\u201d The bodyguards approached them, however, stopped their footsteps after seeing the pursuit.\u201cThis is a servant; he is not worthy to protect!\u201d\u201cLetting him stay here is already keeping face for the Mo family.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be more careful? Prevent him from a counter-attack after being pushed to a dead-end and hurting Fang Yuan.\u201dThe anxious group of bodyguards that had rushed over didn\u2019t take any actions, but were only standing there, looking from aside.To this servant called Gao Wan who was now yelling his heart out, if he was to die, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with them. However, if Fang Yuan had died, or wounded, then they would definitely be responsible for it.Seeing such a scene, Gao Wan\u2019s heart had totally become numb; he desperately shouted out, \u201cOur surnames are all different from them. You guys cannot shut your eyes to people that are dying.\u201dHis blood loss was getting more serious as his pace was slowing down.Fang Yuan caught up to him from behind. With a voice as cold as ice, he sentenced Gao Wan with a death penalty, \u201cShout more, even if you were to shout out louder, it would still be useless.\u201dAfter he had finished, he flipped his wrist as two Moon Blades flew out continuosly.Swoosh, swoosh, they landed directly in the middle of Gao Wan\u2019s neck.Gao Wan only felt his heart was getting numb, as though he was falling into an abyss.Right after that, he felt like the sky and earth were spinning around with his vision. He could even see his own two legs, his bosom, his back... and his head that had been cut off.Following that, he welcomed the eternal darkness.Gao Wan was dead.Being beheaded by Fang Yuan\u2019s two Moon Blades, his head flew off as his body was still running away for about ten meters before falling down. Blood was spurting out from his neck like a waterfall, totally dying the whole surrounding with a blood-red hue.\u201cMurder!\u201d\u201cFang Yuan killed someone!!\u201dThe group of bodyguards couldn\u2019t help themselves but softly gasped. As they had seen the whole process with their own eyes, their bodies all shook. They could feel a frightening sense of being utterly terrified inside of their bones.Although Fang Yuan was just a gentle and frail-looking fifteen year old boy, he could still kill a sturdy adult without changing his expression. This really was the power of a Gu Master!The result of the battle had been set.Fang Yuan slowed down his footstep as he casually walked over.He was wearing a calm visage as if the thing he had just done was as trivial as eating a meal or drinking some water. This expression made the bodyguards feel the coldness that had swept through their hearts.Gao Wan\u2019s head was laid on the ground, with his two eyes still opened. He had died with an everlasting regret.Fang Yuan expressionlessly raised his leg and kicked the head flying off into the distance.The corner of the bodyguard\u2019s eyes shrank in seeing the scene.Fang Yuan approached Gao Wan\u2019s body as he realized this body was still trembling and blood had quickly flowed out, and accumulated into a small pool of blood.He looked closely at Gao Wan\u2019s wound with a solemn countenance. The wound was deep. It was deep enough to expose his secret about the Intermediate Primeval Essence.As soon as this secret was exposed, it could implicate his Wine Gu. If the people were to find out about the Wine Gu, they would have definitely associated it with Hua Jiu the monk.Hence, Fang Yuan had to protect this secret.\u201cBut the people who saw this scene are too many right now.\u201d Fang Yuan glanced at the bodyguards who were gathering around to watch. There were around ten of them. His remaining Primeval Essence was not even ten percent; thus he couldn't kill all of them.After thinking for a while, Fang Yuan bent down, and he picked up Gao Wan\u2019s ankle, dragging the corpse back.\u201cChilde Fang Yuan, just let us handle the rest.\u201d The bodyguards were enduring the chill in their hearts. They approached Fang Yuan and respectfully spoke up.Along with the respectfulness, there were still some clear terrors.As Fang Yuan silently eyed them, they consciously stopped breathing, lowering their heads one by one.\u201cGive me your saber.\u201d He held out his hand, and casually said.In his order was an unassailable aura.The bodyguard who was the closest to him involuntarily took out the saber on his waist, handing it over to him.As Fang Yuan received the saber, he continued walking forward.More than ten bodyguards who were left behind were dumbstruck, standing in one place, looking at Fang Yuan\u2019s figure.The sunlight had ascended from the east, as the first sunbeam pierced through the mountain ranges, and onto the interior of the schoolhouse.The fifteen year-old Fang Yuan had a figure of a small and thin boy, with pale skin.Under the light of the dawn, he was taking his time walking forward.His left hand was holding a shining saber while his right hand was dragging a headless corpse.As he was walking, he left a trail of red blood on the path which was covered with dark blue stones.The group of bodyguards standing behind him all shivered. The coldness had numbed their whole bodies.The sunlight of the dawn was shining upon them. However, they couldn't even feel a single ray of the warmness and radiance.Glug.Some unknown person was rolling their Adam\u2019s apple, swallowing a gulp of saliva.Rate Translation Quality No comments.

    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Dismemberment Present!Translator: - - Editor: - -\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Fang Yuan has murdered someone!\u201d A disciple whispered to his tablemate.\u201cI have also heard about that. He really has killed someone!\u201d The tablemate covered his chest while his face was paled.\u201cLots of bodyguards had seen it. Fang Yuan chased after that guy. He had asked for mercy but Fang Yuan didn\u2019t accept it. Hence, he directly chopped his head off!\u201d\u201cNot only did Fang Yuan kill that man but he didn\u2019t even let the headless corpse off. He dragged it back to his dorm then dismembered it.\u201d\u201cIs it true?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t be more accurate. I came here early today only to discover blood stains in the gaps between the bluestone bricks.\u201d\u201cHaizz, why should I lie to you! The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder has just called for Fang Yuan because of this!\u201dThe young men in the schoolhouse weren't in the mood to listen to the lecture but were whispering to each other.Murder was something unfamiliar and something incredibly scary to these fifteen year old youngsters.From when they were young until now, they had been put under the protection of their families. At most, they would have just learned by comparing fisticuffs or in killing useless animals.Killing a person seemed to be at a remote distance to them.\u201d\u201cWho did Fang Yuan kill?\u201d\u201cI heard he was a servant of the Mo family\u2019s line.\u201d\u201cAh, I knew this. Last night, I saw senior sister Mo Yan of the Mo family bringing along a group of servants to trouble Fang Yuan.\u201d\u201cThe Mo family? No good, Mo Bei will be troubled.\u201dSeveral disciples were glancing at Gu Yue Mo Bei.Mo Bei\u2019s visage was all pale. He sat still in his seat as he had just heard the news this morning. Fang Yuan had killed someone and that someone was Gao Wan, who he was really familiar with.Mo Bei knew this Gao Wan well. He was very active among the other servants, good at flattering; his fisticuffs technique was accumulated from the training of his hardships. He was a capable lackey.A while before, Mo Bei still used Gao Wan to practice his fisticuffs. He couldn't believe that Gao Wan was killed by Fang Yuan just like that!Therefore, Mo Bei was terrified inside. As compared to others, the implausibility in his heart was twice as much as theirs.The astonishment displayed was a type of anxiousness and fear.Facing the murderer Fang Yuan, Mo Bei who was only at fifteen years of age, if he had said that he wasn't scared, it would be an outright lie.In fact, there was not only him that was afraid, but the others were too.Fang Yuan had already twice extorted them andevery one of them had fought with Fang Yuan at least once.\u201cI have fought with this incredibly cruel murderer? And I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Lots of people were patting their chests and were feeling their post-traumatic stress.Fang Yuan did not only kill him. The critical point was that he had even dismembered him and minced the corpse, as well as chopping it into a pulp.This was too savage!The fact that such a terrifying crime had happened, struck hard into the hearts of these naive young men.....In a room, there were only the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder and Fang Yuan.The Elder sat down while Fang Yuan was standing. No one spoke up. The atmosphere was depressive.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder solemnly looked at Fang Yuan. A beam of complex light lit up in his eyes.Early morning, a bodyguard had reported to him about the fact that Fang Yuan had committed a crime of murder. This news had made him startled yet be in doubt.Being a level three Gu Master, not to mention that he was in charge of this schoolhouse, he definitely knew the fighting competency of a Beginner level one Gu Master.Fang Yuan having killed Gao Wan; this could be considered as the weak overcame the strong.As a matter of fact, at yesterday evening, a bodyguard had already reported to him about Mo Yan having seized Fang Yuan and intruded into the schoolhouse.At that time, he didn\u2019t care, and also hadn\u2019t stopped them.He was the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder. His goal was to nourish the future Gu Masters, not protecting them. As long as no disciples were to die, he would have silently encouraged the competitions.He was happy in seeing Mo Yan having troubled Fang Yuan.Firstly, he knew whether it was victory or defeat, that this fight would be helpful for Fang Yuan\u2019s growth. Secondly, he wanted to suppress Fang Yuan\u2019s limelight.Fang Yuan had blocked the grand gates and extorted the disciples twice. The limelight was too bright; thus it needed to be suppressed.However, he didn\u2019t expect that Mo Yan would return without any achievements and only leave the servant Gao Wan behind. Moreover, Gao Wan was not a match for Fang Yuan, and was killed by him!In this world, power was above all else. There was nothing to be surprised about killing a person. Especially for Gu Masters, this could be seen as an extremely normal matter.However, for a fifteen year old boy, murdering for the first time was not something trivial.The memory of his first time in having killed someone was still fresh inside the schoolhouse Elder\u2019s mind. He was a nineteen year old level two Gu Master then. While being in a conflict, he had killed a Gu Master of the Bai family\u2019s mountain stronghold.After murdering that person, he was muddled, and almost collapsed. His heart was a mess. After several days later, he lost his appetite, and didn't want to eat anything. Sleeping didn't help either, especially when he could only see that person\u2019s indignant pair of eyes as he was facing death whenever he had closed his eyes.Looking at Fang Yuan right now, his visage was calm as normal, where was the frenetic feeling? He didn't even look unwell in any sorts. It was as if he had had a deep sleep last night and the person who had killed that servant was not him.Particularly when the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder heard that after Fang Yuan had killed this servant, he didn\u2019t let him off, but dragged his corpse back to the dorm, using a saber to mince it into a pool of pulp to release his anger. Such a cruel method sounded even more terrifying!Therefore, complexity could be seen in the eyes of the Elder while he was looking at Fang Yuan.He exclaimed in admiration that Fang Yuan was indifferent towards people\u2019s lives, having an attitude that was solid and cold as ice. At the same time, he was quite enjoying the fact that Fang Yuan was an innate fighting seed. It had not been long since he has mastered the Moonlight Gu but he had already used it to kill a person. To a normal disciple, even if he was a grade A aptitude genius, it was still impossible for him. This was a talent in fighting! If he was nourished to fight for the clan, he would be the nightmare of their enemies.The third aspect was in being worried and distressed.He worried that as Fang Yuan had done such a thing, that his momentum was increasing even more, as he soon wouldn't be able to suppress him as time went on. Fang Yuan had a big gut. Not only did he violate the clan\u2019s regulation of using Gu in the schoolhouse but he also killed a person. He had to stop his limelight, if not, how could he himself, be able to manage this schoolhouse?He was distressed because no matter how good he had dealt with the aftermath, it was still related to the Mo family\u2019s line.\u201cFang Yuan, do you know why I called you in?\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder used a low tone to break the silence in the room.\u201cI know.\u201d Fang Yuan nodded, \u201cI urged the Moonlight Gu in the grounds of the schoolhouse and this had violated the clan\u2019s regulations. According to the rules, at the first violation, I have to compensate thirty Primeval Stones as a punishment.\u201dHe evaded the crucial point as he didn't even mention Gao Wan\u2019s death.The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was dumbstruck for a while. He didn't expect that Fang Yuan would have answered like that.His face turned solemn and he sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t act dumb in front of me! I ask you, what had happened with Gao Wan\u2019s death?\u201dFang Yuan furrowed his brows, \u201cHumph! This Gao Wan dared to go against me with a vicious intention. Last night, not only did he block me at the doors of my room but he also wanted to kill me. I had no choice but to use the Moonlight Gu to defend myself, then luckily killed this thief. I suspect that this guy could be a person from another mountain stronghold that came here and became an undercover. I\u2019m sure Elder will understand!\u201dAs the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder heard this, he furrowed his brows. At the moment, he didn't know how to reply.Right now, Gao Wan had died; Fang Yuan could say whatever it is that he wanted. He had a different surname. Hence, he was not a clan member. To the fact that he was dead, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder didn't care. However, he was worried about the Mo family\u2019s reaction. Gao Wan was the servant of the Mo family and he had died on the schoolhouse grounds. As the one in charge of the schoolhouse, he needed to give the Mo family a reasonable explanation.After thinking for a while, the Elder attentively looked at Fang Yuan and interrogated, \u201cI ask you, what did you do with Gao Wan\u2019s corpse?\u201dThe corner of Fang Yuan\u2019s mouth raised up to form a cold smile, \u201cI dismembered him, then threw it in a small wooden box, and left it at the Mo family\u2019s back door.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder was startled. He had almost jumped up from his seat.Not to mention the fact that Fang Yuan had killed their servant but he had also minced his corpse, and sent it to the Mo family\u2019s back door. This was clearly provoking!For the Elder who wanted to settle this dispute, this news was truly a bad one.Fang Yuan was just a small level one Gu Master, what would the giant Mo family do then?Thinking about this, the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder felt his head aching. The matter had exceeded his control. This Fang Yuan was really good at stirring up trouble!\u201cHaizz, if it has already happened, then it would be useless to waste words on it. Take your leave first. Prepare your mentality well to receive the punishments several days later.\u201d The Elder\u2019s thoughts were in a whirl. He raised his hand signaling Fang Yuan to leave as he wanted to silently and carefully consider a countermeasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Mo family.\u201cWhat did I tell you? Look at the good thing you did!\u201d In the study room, Gu Yue Mo Chen was angrily slamming the table.Mo Yan was standing in front of him, lowering her head. Astonishment and rage could be seen in her eyes. She had just known of the news that Gao Wan was killed by Fang Yuan!That fifteen-year-old boy could have such method and will. Gao Wan was the Mo family\u2019s servant. Fang Yuan having killed him had meant that he did not even bother to look upon the Mo family!\u201cGrandpa, you don\u2019t need to get angry. This Gao Wan is just a servant. So what if he dies? He won\u2019t carry the surname of Gu Yue anyway. Nonetheless, that Fang Yuan really has a big gut. Before you beat a dog, you should know who its master is. He did not only beat our Mo family\u2019s dog; he had beaten it to death!\u201d Mo Yan indignantly said.Gu Yue Mo Chen yelled out as he abruptly stood up, \u201cYou still talk! Your wings are firm now; you don\u2019t want to listen to my words anymore, do you? What have I told you? You have forgotten it all!\u201d\u201cGranddaughter doesn\u2019t dare to.\u201d Mo Yan was frightened and startled. She knew grandfather had now really become angry. She then knelt down.Gu Yue Mo Chen pointed at the window and criticized, \u201cHumph, not talking about the death of that servant, you still fix your attention on that Fang Yuan. Your vision is too narrow; you know nothing about the degree of seriousness in this! Do you understand the meaning of this action? The competition among the juniors is their matter. You are a senior; you don\u2019t need to be involved in it. This is the rule! Right now, you came to Fang Yuan and looked for trouble, you have violated the rule. You don\u2019t know how many people on the outside that are laughing at our Mo family right now!\u201d\u201cGrandpa, please don\u2019t be mad, anger is not good for your body. It is Mo Yan\u2019s mistake; I\u2019ve encumbered the Mo family. Whatever grandpa wants to do, Mo Yan will follow! It is just because I can\u2019t swallow his manner. That Fang Yuan is really repulsive and shameless. Firstly, he had tricked me into entering the schoolhouse. Then, he hid inside his room, no matter how much I cursed him, he refused to come out. As soon as I left, he killed Gao Wan. He really is extremely insidious and shameless!\u201d Mo Yan reported to him.\u201cAh, so it was like that?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen slightly furrowed his brows. Light couldn\u2019t help but flickered in his eyes as he first heard such news.He inhaled deeply, suppressed the flame of anger in his heart, stroked his beard then muttered, \u201cI have soon heard about this Fang Yuan. He can write poems at youth; he is an early boomer. It is unexpected that he is only a grade C aptitude. It is quite hard to empower him, so I had given up the invite for him. However, right now, it seems somewhat interesting.\u201dGu Yue Mo Chen stopped for a while before he used his finger to tap on the tabletop, \u201cServant, take that box over here.\u201dThe servants, who were standing outside, quickly held up a box, and came in. The box was neither big nor small but it was quite heavy. The servant was holding it with both hands while standing beside the table.\u201cGrandpa, what is this?\u201d Mo Yan looked at the box, feeling suspicious.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you open it?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen squinted his eyes and talked with a complicated tone.Mo Yan stood up, lifted the wooden lid open, then looked inside.At that moment, her visage drastically changed. Her pupils instantly shrank to the size of a needle. She couldn\u2019t help but quickly retreat and unconsciously cried out in fear. The wooden lid had slipped out of her hand and was falling to the ground.Without the lid, the interior of the box was immediately exposed to everyone that was present.It was a mass of pulp!The flesh had obviously been scraped into strips and chunks, and was then put into the box. The red blood stains were accumulated inside. There was white pale skin along with long strips of stomach with an addition of two bones, and if it weren't the leg bones, then it would be the ribs. In the pool of blood, one could still see two fingers and half a toe floating atop.Vomit....Mo Yan\u2019s pretty countenance had changed. As she quickly strode back, something was boiling in her stomach, making her almost vomit.She was a level two Gu Master. She had trained and also killed some people. However, this was the first time she had ever seen such a disgusting scene.The flesh inside this box was obviously a corpse that had been chopped up, broken into pieces, and was squeezed inside.A sky-soaring bloody smell instantly burst out and flooded the entire study room.The hands of the servant who was carrying the box were trembling as his face became pale. Although he had already looked into it and vomited after that, holding it in his hands right now, it still made him felt waves after waves of fright and nausea.Among the three people in the study room, only Gu Yue Mo Chen did not change his expression. He casually glanced over the flesh box, then turned to Mo Yan and slowly said, \u201cThis box was put in front of our house\u2019s back door by Fang Yuan.\u201d\u201cWhat? is it really him?!\u201d Mo Yan was scared. She couldn\u2019t picture Fang Yuan\u2019s appearance in her head.The first time she had ever seen Fang Yuan, was at the tavern.At that time, Fang Yuan sat beside the window, and silently ate his meal. He had a plain face, deep eyes, thin, and weak body, with a pale skin that particularly belonged to young people.He was obviously a young man who was normal and quiet, but he had done such a disgusting and frantic action!After fright was rage, as Mo Yan shouted out loud, \u201cThis Fang Yuan is too savage, he really has big guts! He had dared to do that; it means he has provoked our Mo family! I will go over there, detain him, and condemn him!!\u201d She intended to leave as she finished.\u201cDisgraceful! Stop right there for me!\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen was even angrier than her. He casually held up an ink well, that was made from stone on the table, then raised his hand, and threw it outside.The heavy and solid ink well hit Mo Yan\u2019s shoulder, then fell down on the ground with a thud.\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Mo Yan covered her shoulder and cried out.Gu Yue Mo Chen stood up, pointed at his granddaughter then spoke up with an agitated tone, \u201cIt seems that your training during these past few years is useless. You have really disappointed me! To handle a tiny Beginner level one Gu Master, not to mention that you had dragged in lots of people, but you are still being led by the nose. Right now, as anger has overwhelmed your mind, could you still understand the meaning behind Fang Yuan\u2019s action?\u201d\u201cWhat is the meaning?\u201d Mo Yan did not have a clue.Gu Yue Mo Chen snorted, \u201cIf Fang Yuan wanted to provoke us and amplified the scale of this matter, why did not he put this box at the crowded main door, but at the back door where only few people would see it?\u201d\u201cCould it have been a conciliatory act? Not right, if he wanted to reconcile, confronting and apologizing are good enough. Why did he want to give this box of flesh? This is basically provocation!\u201d Mo Yan said.Gu Yue Mo Chen shook his head then slightly nodded, \u201cHe wants to reconcile, but is still provoking us. If he had placed the box at the back door; then this is considered reconciliation. But putting dismembered flesh inside the wooden box, this means provocation.\u201d\u201cLook.\u201d The Elder pointed at the box, \u201cThis wooden box is not too big; it couldn\u2019t contain an entire corpse. Hence, inside are all pieces of one corpse. He wanted to tell us that he did not want to amplify the scale of this matter. He wanted to make concessions to avoid trouble. However, if the Mo family wants to grab on this matter without letting go, he would put the remaining dismembered parts at the front door, completely accelerating this matter. When that happens, both sides would suffer. The whole clan knew that it was our Mo family that had first violated the rules. The future heir of the Mo family is too weak he needs the pamperedness and protection of his seniors.\u201dAs Mo Yan heard this, she couldn't help but open her mouth in awe. She could never guess that Fang Yuan would have implied such deep intentions in his actions.\u201cThis method is truly profound.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen exclaimed, \u201cWith only an action, he has tempered inflexibility and yielding, combining with a sense of propriety. This simple wooden box has shown off Fang Yuan\u2019s compromise, yet displayed his threat toward our Mo family. Our Mo family has been threatened by him, time after time. If the reputation of our Mo family is damaged, quickly after, the Chi family would rise in revolt, and strike on the clan head\u2019s line.\u201dMo Yan suspiciously asked, \u201cGrandpa, are you overestimating him? He is just a fifteen-year-old brat.\u201d\u201cOverestimate?\u201d Mo Chen glared at his granddaughter with a displeasing look, \u201cIt seems you have gotten used to drifting with the wind for the past few years and nourished a bad habit. You can\u2019t even see the truth. Firstly, this Fang Yuan was calm in the hour of peril, tricking you in entering the schoolhouse. Then, he thought of an excellent idea at the crucial moment to hide at the dorm. Next, he did not boast even after hearing your cursing; this was patience and cool-headedness. After you left, he immediately killed Gao Wan. This was determination and bravery. Right now, bringing this box over, he has cleverly schemed it. You still say I am overestimating him?\u201dMo Yan widened her eyes and mouth in hearing this. She truly did not expect that grandpa would have taken an interest in Fang Yuan, she said unwillingly, \u201cGrandpa, he is only a grade C.\u201dGu Yue Mo Chen stoked his bread, sighed, \u201cTrue, he is a grade C. With wisdom like that but only has a grade C aptitude, such a pity. His aptitude only needs to be a level higher. At grade B he definitely will become an awe-inspiring person in our Ancient Moon clan. It\u2019s a pity that he is only a grade C.\u201dHis deep sigh was brimming with lament. It sounded pitiful, but also lucky.Mo Yan did not say a word. She couldn\u2019t help but recall Fang Yuan\u2019s appearance in her head. Under the effects of her mental reaction, Fang Yuan\u2019s frail-looking face from before was covered by a layer of a mysterious and ruthless shadow.\u201cYou have created this yourself. How do you intend to fix this?\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen suddenly broke the silence as he started to ask Mo Yan.After thinking for a while, with a cold tone, she said, \u201cGao Wan is just a servant, he had died anyway. Fang Yuan is just a grade C aptitude. This is also trivial matter. The critical thing here is to protect our Mo family\u2019s reputation. To settle this, we can kill Gao Wan\u2019s whole family, old and young, to show the clan our attitude in maintaining the clan\u2019s rules.\u201d\u201cRight, you can still start from the general situation, temporarily give up your own emotion, and protect the family\u2019s benefits instead. This is good. However, your method of handling this is still lacking.\u201d Gu Yue Mo Chen stroked his bread while commenting.\u201cGrandpa, please enlighten me.\u201d Mo Yan kowtowed.Gu Yue Mo Chen muttered, \u201cSince you are the person who raised up this matter, you are grounded for seven days. From here onwards, don\u2019t look for trouble with Fang Yuan. Gao Wan has offended the higher status. A servant that had dared to offend his owner; he was worth dying. He should be killed for such a crime! Because he is the Mo family\u2019s servant, the Mo family will also take up the responsibility of not strictly disciplining him. We will compensate Fang Yuan with thirty Primeval Stones. About Gao Wan\u2019s family, give them fifty pieces of Primeval Stones, then expel them from the mansion.\u201dHe continued after stopping for a while, \u201cIn these seven days, rest at home. You don\u2019t need to go outside. Also, think about the meaning behind grandpa\u2019s method.\u201d\u201cYes, grandpa.\u201dRate Translation Quality No comments.

As it fell down, it covered the Green Thatch Mountain with a layer of thin smoke.The fourth level of the tavern was desolated as always. There were only four guests.Fang Yuan sat beside the window as a gush of wind blew over that tangled up with the poetic and flowery fragrance.\u201cThe streets' rain run as crisp grass from afar, that can no longer be seen up close[1].\u201d Fang Yuan slightly exclaimed while looking out the window. After a while later, he retrieved his look.In front of him there laid delicious food and wine. They had both the smell and the taste. Especially the Green Bamboo Wine, which was emitting a scent of pure wine, was showing its freshness. The aquamarine wine silently stayed in the bamboo cup. From this aspect, it looked as if it was scattering amber that was like a gentle glazing.The last person to get a table was a duo of grandfather and grandchild. They wore plain and simple clothing; both were mortal.The older man was drinking rice wine while looking over at Fang Yuan with admiration in his eyes. He obviously was attracted to the fragrance of the Green Bamboo Wine. However, he couldn\u2019t afford it.His grandson was biting on marinated beans, making hammering sounds. At the same time, he clung on his grandfather, swaying his arm, \u201cGrandpa, grandpa, please tell me about the story of the Human Ancestor. If you don\u2019t, I will tell grandma that you are secretly drinking wine again!\u201d\u201cHaizz, I can\u2019t even drink wine in peace.\u201d The old man sighed, but his face was beaming with affection. He used his hand which was as skinny as a wooden stick to stroke his grandson\u2019s head, \u201cThen I will tell you a bit more. When the Human gave his heart to the Gu of Hope and had escaped his impasse....\u201dThe story of the Human Ancestor was the most popular folktale, as well as the most ancient legend.The old story the old man was talking about, was this one.He spoke of the Human Ancestor escaping the Predicaments by relying on hope. However, he had reached his 'old age'. Without power and wisdom, he couldn\u2019t continue hunting. Moreover, his teeth were all falling out. He couldn\u2019t chew on any wild herbs or fruits anymore.The Human Ancestor could feel that death was approaching him.Right then, the Gu of Hope told him, \u201cHuman, you cannot die.\u201d If you die, your heart would also die, and I will lose a place to stay.\u201dThe Human Ancestor didn\u2019t have a choice, \u201cWho wants to die? But heaven and earth want me dead; I cannot go against it.\u201dGu of Hope said, \u201cThere is hope in everything. As long as you\u2019re able to catch the Longevity Gu, you can lengthen your life span.\u201dHuman Ancestor had soon heard about the existence of the Longevity Gu but he couldn\u2019t help but give up, \u201cWhen the Longevity Gu stays silent, no one can discover it. Its flying speed is even faster than the speed of light. How can I catch it? This is too tough!\u201dThe Gu of Hope told the Human a secret, \u201cHuman, you can\u2019t give up your hope on the thing you are about to do. Let me tell you, on the ground of the northwest cape, situated a great mountain. In the cave on the peak of the mountain there are two Gus, one with a round-shape and the other with a square-shape. As long as you defeat those two Gus, there is no Gu in this world that you can\u2019t catch, and that Longevity Gu is also not an exception!\u201dThe Human Ancestor had reached a dead-end. This was his last beam of hope.He suffered countless of hardships to be able to find that great mountain, then went up the peak after being through every kind of thrills. Once he reached the entrance of the cave on top of the mountain, he only had a little bit of energy left to stagger in the cave.Darkness covered the cave as one couldn\u2019t even see their fingers. The Human Ancestor was walking in the dark. There were times when he would bump into something until his head was bleeding non-stop. Or there were times when he felt that this endless darkness was like another world. Except him, there was nothing around.He wasted lots of time but couldn\u2019t escape this boundless darkness. Not to mention he had to make those rounded and squared Gus to surrender.Right when he was about to fall into a coma, two voices started to reverberate in darkness.One said, \u201cHuman, you think of catching us? Go back. Even if you have the Gu of Power with you, it would still be impossible.\u201dAnother voice spoke up \u201cHuman, retreat. We don\u2019t want to take your life. Even if the Gu of Wisdom were here to help you, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to find us.\u201dThe Human Ancestor fell to the ground and was constantly gasping for air, \u201cThe Gu of Power and Gu of Wisdom have soon left my side. My lifespan is running out; I am facing a dead-end. However, as long as I have a single beam of hope left, I will not give up!\u201dUpon hearing the Humans words, the two voices died out.Only after a while later did they start talking again, \u201cI understand now. Human, you gave your heart to the Gu of Hope. No matter what, you won\u2019t give up.\u201dThe other voice continued, \u201cIf it so, we will give you a chance. If you can say our names, we will be in your hands.\u201dThe Human Ancestor was dumbstruck. Wanted to find only two accurate names in the ocean of names out there, this was basically finding a needle in the sea.Moreover, he didn\u2019t even know how many words there were in their names.The Human Ancestor quickly asked the Gu of Hope but it didn\u2019t know either.The Human didn\u2019t have any other choice but to patiently call out names. He said many names and had wasted a lot of time. However, there was no answer coming from the darkness. Obviously, it was all wrong.Gradually, the Human Ancestor\u2019s breathing was getting weaker. In the cave, from being in old age, he had eventually reached his declining years. It was like the sunset at nightfall, slowly descended. Half of the sun had fallen below the horizon, turning into the sunset.He didn\u2019t bring much food with him, as his brain was working at a slower speed, and his strength was also declining.The voice advised him from the dark, \u201cHuman, you are about to die. We will let you go. Take advantage of your remaining time and get out of this cave, take a last look at the world outside. However, you have offended us. For your punishment, leave the Gu of Hope here to keep us company.\u201dThe Human Ancestor quickly covered his chest and determinedly declined, \u201cEven if I die, I wouldn\u2019t give up on hope!\u201dThe Gu of Hope was touched, as it excitedly used all of its power to reply the Human Ancestor, it emitted a pure white aureole. At the spot on the chest where the Human Ancestor had covered, numerous white light spots appeared.Nevertheless, the weak white light couldn\u2019t be able to light up the darkness. It couldn\u2019t even shine upon the entire body of the Human Ancestor, but only on that spot on his chest.The Human Ancestor then felt a brand new invisible energy current that was viciously intruding the center of his body from the Gu of Hope.He opened his mouth and continued to call out names. He had become confused due to old age. There were many names that he had mentioned before but he couldn\u2019t remember them as he wasted more efforts in repeating them again.His life was flowing by with the time. The Human Ancestor was running out of his life span.In the end, when he only had one day left to live, he said a word \u2018Ju (\u77e9)\u2019.A deep sigh was speared in the darkness as a voice spoke up, \u201cHuman, I admire your persistence. You have called my name. From today onwards, I will listen to your orders. However, only when me and my brother are together are we able to help you catch every Gu in this world. Just based on my capacity, it will be impossible. Therefore, you should give up. You are almost dead. Use your remaining time to take a last glance at this world.\u201dThe Human Ancestor determinedly shook his head. He grasped his time to continue talking, guessing the name of the other Gu.After minutes and seconds had passed, he only had the time of one hour left.But at that time, he unconsciously spoke out the word \u2018Gui (\u89c4)\u2019. [2]In a blink, darkness had dispersed.The two Gus appeared in front of him. It was like what the Gu of Hope had told him. One Gu that was square-shaped, was named Ju. The other was round, named Gui. Together, it was \u2018Gui Ju (Rules)\u2019.Both Gus talked at the same time, \u201cNo matter who, as long as he can say our names, we will listen to his command. Human, if you have already known our names, you can use us as you please. However, you must remember. It will be best not to tell any living entities our names. We have to surrender to anyone who knows our names. Right now, you are our first master. Tell us your command.\u201dThe Human Ancestor was cheerful, \u201cI order you guys to catch a Longevity Gu for me.\u201dThe Rules Gu combined their powers and captured an eighty years old Longevity Gu.The Human Ancestor had almost reached the age of one hundred. As he ate this Longevity Gu, the wrinkles on his face immediately disappeared. His skinny limbs were replaced with a sturdy and beautiful body, brimming with youthful breath.He skipped up in joy.Looking at his body, he was extremely happy to know that he had returned to his old self, which was at the age of twenty!...\u201cTill here then. Let\u2019s go home first, good grandson.\u201d As the old man ended his story, he had also finished his wine.\u201cGrandpa, please continue, what did the Human Ancestor do after that?\u201d The grandson didn\u2019t want to follow him as he was still swaying his grandfather\u2019s arm.\u201cLet\u2019s go. If we have time, I will continue.\u201d The old man put on his bamboo hat then gave his grandson a smaller one.The grandfather and grandson duo exited the tavern. They walked into the curtain of rain, then gradually getting farther and farther.\u201cRules...\u201d Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes were dim as he turned the cup of wine. Looking at the Green Bamboo Wine inside the cup, a feeling arose in his heart.The legend of the Human Ancestor had been widely spread in this world. It seemed that there was no one that didn\u2019t know about that story. Naturally, Fang Yuan had soon heard of this also.No matter whether it was a legend or a folktale; different people had different views. In the folktale that the grandfather had told the grandson, Fang Yuan could taste the implications inside.Just like the Human Ancestor.When he didn\u2019t know about the rules, he would start groping in the dark. Sometimes he would stumble, bumping into things, getting bumped, bruised, and stuck in a dilemma. Sometimes, it would be a vast void. Emerging into the haziness, he lost both his directions and goals.This type of darkness was not the normal black and gloomy one. Power, wisdom, and hope all couldn\u2019t restrain it.Only when the Human Ancestor recognized the \u2018Rules\u2019 and called its name did the darkness disappear as the Human Ancestor welcomed the bright radiance.The darkness had the rules of darkness while the radiance also had its own.Fang Yuan adverted his eyes from the cup of wine to a further distance outside the window.He could only see the dusky and gloomy sky, along with the continuous verdant mountains, and fine rains were swirling in the air like mist. Up close were one by one bamboo houses, extending forever into the distance. A few people walking on the street got their feet soaked with rain water and stained with mud. If they didn\u2019t wear their ash green straw rain cape, it would have been a yellow cloth umbrella.Fang Yuan concluded inside, \u201cThis world is like a big chessboard. All living entities are chess pieces, following rules to move around. There are rules in the four seasons as the order of the cycle is spring, summer, autumn, then winter. Water flows following rules and flows downward. Heat also has rules as it will float up. Normally, human also has rules.\u201d\u201cEveryone has their own standpoints, desires, and principles. For the Ancient Moon Clan, the life of a servant is trivial whereas the life of their master is precious. This is the rule. Therefore, Shen Cui wants to climb up the stair of wealth. Even if it costs her many pains, she still wants to escape the life of a servant. Gao Wan used various methods to make his master happy, like a dog counting on its master\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cFor aunt and uncle, they are greedy at heart and want to seize the inheritance of my parents. The schoolhouse\u2019s Elder wants to nourish Gu Masters, and protect his own position at the schoolhouse.\u201d\u201cEvery person has their own rules, each industry has their rules, and each social group has its own rules. Only by thoroughly understanding the rules can one become a bystander that is always clear-minded, and going in circles from darkness to radiance is to temper one\u2019 skills.\u201dFang Yuan then associated it with his own circumstances and had soon come up with a scheme, \u201cTo the one in power of the Mo family, Gu Yue Mo Chen, he wants to protect his line\u2019s glory and benefits. Mo Yan having looked for trouble in me is the same as violating the rules. Hence, to protect his family\u2019s reputation, he will definitely not take any actions against me. He will even take the initiative to offer compensation for me.\u201d\u201cIn fact, based on the robust power that the Mo family possessed, even if they wanted to severely punish me for damaging their reputations, it would be impossible for me to resist. However, Gu Yue Mo Chen must feel scared inside. He isn't afraid of violating the rules himself. But he is worried that others will follow him and start to wreck the rules. If the seniors involved themselves in the competitions among the juniors, the degree of the seriousness of the situation will be amplified. If the higher authorities pick up the news, it will become a great threat to the entire mountain stronghold. Gu Yue Mo Chen is scared that someone would take action on his own grandson Gu Yue Mo Bei if any competition happened later on. His whole line depends on this one male. If he were dead, then what should Mo Chen do? This type of fear is something that maybe Gu Yue Mo Chen himself, can\u2019t even realize. He is only following his intuition to protect the rules.\u201dFang Yuan\u2019s eyes were clear. Toward such a matter, he could see it clearly from the start to the end.Gao Wan\u2019 s surname wasn\u2019t Gu Yue. He was an outsider, a servant.What could be so important about the fact that a master had killed a servant? In this world, this was extremely normal.Fang Yuan killed Gao Wan. Gao Wan\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the critical point. The critical point was his master, the Mo family behind his back.\u201cHowever, I gave them a box full of pulp; Gu Yue Mo Chen may understand the compromising and threatening implications in there anyway. This is what I want him to understand. If nothing unexpected happens, the Mo family won\u2019t investigate further on Gao Wan\u2019s death. Of course, if my aptitude were a level higher, a grade B, the Mo family would have been able to feel the threat. Based on their damaged reputation, they would definitely want to oppress me in the future.\u201d Fang Yuan sneered inside.One could rely on their formidable power but being weak could also be an advantage.Right now, Fang Yuan was on the chessboard. Moreover, he was also a chess piece. But because he had thoroughly understood the rules, he now had the heart of a chess player.A normal person would be like Gu Yue Mo Chen or the schoolhouse\u2019s Elder, only understanding their own rules. Differences in professions could make one feel the worlds that were apart. To be like Fang Yuan, it was hard to see the situation and clearly understand the rules!Rules were as the Human Ancestors, who must go through arduous training, hesitation, and haziness in the darkness.At that time, power, wisdom, and hope couldn\u2019t be used at all. He had to spend time, to comprehend by himself to gain such experiences.The Human Ancestor had wasted time to call out the names of the two Gus. He had tried numerous times under the pressure of death.Fang Yuan could understand the rules was because of the accumulated experiences he had gained from the past five hundred years.From when he was reborn until now, he was confident that he could create a glorious future. Not because of the reappearance of the Spring and Autumn Cicada, or his knowledge about numerous uncharted treasures, or holding the general direction of the future in his hands.But it was because of his life experiences in the past five hundred years.Just like the Human Ancestor that could had gotten ahold of the Rules Gu and then had easily seized thousands of Gus in the world!Fang Yuan, who thoroughly understood the rules, was like looking down from above with a pair of eyes that could pierce through the verbose affairs of life. It was either made from a painstaking investigation or a pointed remark. He saw himself as a haughty and proud person, coldly looking at the humans on this world as, one by one, chess pieces, following their own rules to gradually step up.Darkness had the rules of darkness while the radiance had its own rules.And now the reborn Devil was walking under the radiance.-------[1]The first two lines from a poem called Early Spring Drizzles by Chu Chuan Xiao Yu.[2]The two Gus combining name is Gui Ju (\u89c4\u77e9) = Rules. Gui had another meaning which is instruments for drawing circles, while Ju meant square. Hence the shapes of the two Gus.Rate Translation Quality No comments.

    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: The Toad CaravanTranslator: - - Editor: - -May was the transition between spring and summer.The fragrance of flowers filled the entire great mountain. The sun also began to bloom out its warm side.On the deep blue sky, white clouds were floating like cotton waddings.On the Green Thatch Mountain, the Green Thatch bamboo forest was still standing upright like spears, pointing at the blue sky. Wild grasses were growing everywhere as unknown wild flowers rosed up among them. . The wind was breezing by, swaying the grass as the air brimming of rich pollen and green grass scent rushed into one\u2019s nostril.On the waist of the mountain situated numerous stepped fields. Layer by layer, stair after stair of faint green planted wheat looked like a vast fresh and verdant sea from afar.There were many farmers who were working on the stepped fields. Some were checking up on the moat to begin watering, while others rolled up their trouser legs, standing in the field, and planting wheat.Naturally, these people were mortals which possessed different surnames. The members of the Ancient Moon Clan wouldn\u2019t have handled these types of lowly jobs.Jingle\u2026Jingle...The sound of a camel bell vaguely resounded along with the spring breeze.The farmers all stood up as they turned their heads to the waist of the mountain only to see a caravan that looked like a colorful serpent which gradually showed its head on the other side of the mountain.\u201cIt is the caravan!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It is May now; the caravan should have already been here.\u201dEveryone clearly understood this. The children stopped playing with the water andwith their muddy hands they excitedly ran towards the caravan.The Southern Border had hundreds of thousands of great mountains while the Green Thatch Mountain was only one of those. On each mountain was situated a mountain stronghold, where the people were maintaining it by blood ties.Between mountains after mountains, were deep and secluded forests or dangerous stone cliffs. The complex environment was placed where a large number of beasts and eccentric Gus had chosen to stay.It basically was impossible for a mortal to go pass it. An individual would need to be at least at a level three Gu Master to go through all these obstacles.Hence, they eventually encountered the depression of the economy as well as difficulties in trading, and the most important form of trade which was the caravan.Only a caravan at such an enormous scale could be able to gather up Gu Masters, giving them mutual aid to help themselves in passing through the dangerous and difficult path, from this mountain to another.The arrival of the caravan was like a cup of boiled water being abruptly poured onto the calm and peaceful Green Thatch Mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s usually in April each year. Today, the caravan has come in May. However, they have finally come.\u201d After hearing the news, the owner of the tavern sighed out in relief. The business of this tavern was extremely low in every other month. They could only hope that the arrival of the caravan could bring them enough profit to support them throughout the whole year.At the same time, he could sell the Green Bamboo Wine that he had stocked up in his inventory to the caravan.Not only the tavern, but the businesses of the wine shops would also rise.The caravan gradually entered the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold. Leading them was a Precious Brass Toad. The toad was two point five meters tall with a body covered with an orange hue. On its broad shoulder were numerous lumps, like those giant copper rivets on those city gates back in the ancient times.An abundance of goods was set by thick ropes that were tightly tied on the back of the Precious Brass Toad. In a glance, it looked as if the toad was carrying a giant backpack on its back.A middle-aged man with a round face full of pock marks and a round belly was sitting crossed-legged on the toad\u2019s head. His two eyes were turning into a line as he smiled. He held up his fist to greet the people of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold.He went by the name of Fu, with the surname of Jia. Being the leader of the caravan, he had the cultivation base of a level four Gu Master.The toad slightly hopped forward as Jia Fu sat on its head, steadily, and stably. When it jumped, the height that he was at could be compared to the windows on the second floor of a house. Even when they had landed, the height was still higher than that of the first level of a bamboo house.The spacious streets now seemed to be quite narrow. The Precious Brass Toad was like a beast that was intruding the bamboo forest.Behind the Precious Toad was a fat Gu. Its pair of eyes which were like colorful glass windows were vividly radiating as it was about fifteen meters long with a figure of a silkworm. However, it was covered with a thick layer of a black glazed armor. On the armor, numerous goods were being tightened by round after rounds of thick ropes. At a distance apart from the goods sat several Gu Masters, both young and old.There were also mortals who were all robust martial art masters. They were walking on the ground, slowly moving forward along with the Fat Black-skinned Beetle.Behind those Fat Black-skinned Beetles were Colorful-Furred Alpacas, Hairy Mountainous Great Spiders, or even the Two-winged Serpents. However, these were just a minority. The majority of the caravans were toads.These toads were the same species with the Precious Brass Toad. Only that their head were smaller and they had the appearances of oxen and horses. They were used to carry goods and people. With a bulging stomach, they were constantly hoping to move forward.The caravan wriggled its way into the mountain stronghold.Along the way, children were opening their eyes in awe. They looked at them with curiosity. Sometimes they would cheerfully shout out, other times they would scarily gasped.Numerous of second-floor windows started to open in succession in helping the hill people to have a closer look. Some of them had lights of fear beaming in their eyes; as others were waving their hands, showing off their warm welcomes.\u201cJunior Jia, this year you are quite late. It\u2019s been hard on you.\u201d Using the status of the clan\u2019s head, Gu Yue Bo personally came out to welcome the leader of the caravan.Jia Fu was a level four Gu Master. If he assigned a level three Elder to treat him, it would undoubtedly be a kind of negligence and contemptuousness.Jia Fu held up his fist and deeply sighed, \u201cThis year hasn\u2019t been going smoothly. On the way, we had encountered a group of Serene Bloody Bats; as it had cost me quite a few of my good men. We also ran into the mountain fog in the middle of a precipice so we didn\u2019t dare to move for quite some time. Therefore, it had taken up a lot of time. I have made brother Gu Yue wait for me.\u201dExtreme politeness could be heard in their words.The Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold needed the caravan for their yearly trading as the caravan also needed to make money.\u201c Hahaha, it\u2019s good enough that you came. Please, the clan has been preparing food and wine. Please let me give a dinner of welcome to my old brother.\u201d Gu Yue Bo held out his hand then said.\u201cThe clan\u2019s head is too polite.\u201d Jia Fu was flattered.The caravan had reached the boundary of the Green Thatch Mountain at dawn and was then stationed at the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold at noon. At nightfall, a large area of temporary stores had already been set up all around the mountain stronghold. Numerous of colorful cottages were being built up while they squeezed up thousands of small stalls.When night came, this place was lit up with bright lights.An endless line of pedestrians poured into this place from inside of the mountain stronghold. There were mortals as well as Gu Masters. The children were happily jumping up and down as joy of celebrating a festival also emerged on the visages of the adults.Fang Yuan went along with the flow of people, going in there alone.The crowd was bustling as a group of people would surround the stall or constantly get in and out the cottages.Peddling sounds were reverberating non-stop from every direction.\u201cCome over and take a look. First-rated Blue Ocean Cloud Tea Brick, have a sip of this tea and one can feel the joy like that of the Immortals! Even if you don\u2019t drink, using it to feed the Tea Gu is also considered as inexpensive goods. It only costs five pieces of Primeval Stones!\u201d\u201cBrute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, urging this Gu, a Gu Master can significantly enhance their powers. Something you cannot miss when passing by!\u201d\u201cBosom Grass, the first-rate Bosom Grass is here. Everyone, please look at its fineness as it is the same with freshly plucked grass. Two Primeval Stones for half a kilogram, such low price ...\u201dAs Fang Yuan heard that, his footsteps slightly stopped, before going towards the direction of that sound.He saw an alpaca pulling a two-wheeled handcart. There was a pile of green grass on the handcart. Each strand of grass was about a meter long, extremely thin, and long, with an average width of about a fingernail. Some even had long pointy tips and red heart-shaped buds.The Bosom Grass was one of the auxiliary goods for Gus. Its value lied in the fact that it could be combined with a few other foods to feed the Gus.For an instant, as Fang Yuan was raising the Moonlight Gu, it needed two petals for each meal. If he blended it with a strand of Bosom Grass, the Moonlight Gu would have gotten full with just one Moon Orchid\u2019s petal.Half a kilogram of Bosom Grass only cost two Primeval Stones, while ten petals of the Moon Orchid had a price of one Primeval Stone. With some calculation, one could easily know that it would be more cost-effective blending in the Bosom Grass to raise the Gu.\u201cHalf a month ago, I had killed Gao Wan. Because of using the Moonlight Gu on the ground of the schoolhouse, I was fined with thirty pieces of Primeval Stones. However, later on, the Mo family had compensated me with another thirty pieces. Hence, there was no loss there. These days, I had robbed the disciples two more times, with a total of one hundred and eighteen Primeval Stones. But recently I have been spending three Primeval Stones a day due to continuous consumption of the refined Intermediate Primeval Essence to nourish the four walls of the vain aperture. Added on to the cost of raising the other Gus and my own living expenses as well as paying Primeval Stones in constantly buying the Green Bamboo Wine, I now only have ninety-eight pieces in my hands.\u201dSince the murderous incidence, Fang Yuan\u2019s cruel image had been carved deep inside the other disciples\u2019 hearts. For the time being, no one dared to challenge him again. This made it become even easier for him to extort people. Every single time, there had only been a handful of people that dared to confront him.Fang Yuan started to calculate in his mind. As he shifted his glance, he continued to go deeper into the temporary stores' area.The Bosom Grass\u2019 stall was surrounded by a bunch of people. Most of them were Gu Masters or disciples, with Primeval Stones on their hands, desperately trying to buy the grass.It was not because Fang Yuan didn\u2019t have money to buy the Bosom Grass. He didn\u2019t have time.\u201cIf I remember it right, that Leprous Earth Toad was in that store. In my past life, a Gu Master had bet on it on the first night and made a fortune out of it. I should hurry and should not seek small gains and incur big losses.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: The Sleeping Toad Gu inside the Purple-Gold RockTranslator: - - Editor: - -The deeper that he went, the more beautiful and brisk the scenery became.Small stalls were getting less and less as they were replaced by cottages that were getting larger and larger as time went on.There were numerous of colorful cottages; some were square-shaped while others were round. Red lanterns were hung on two standing pillars in front of the roller blinds at the entrance of some stores. Some were shining with light while others were bleak inside.Fang Yuan looked around as he walked ahead. Finally, he stopped at a gray cottage.\u201cIt was here.\u201d He looked up and examined the place. There were two pillars at the entrance of the cottage. Using the sculpture techniques, a couplet was being carved on those standing pillars.The left side: Used tiny courage and gained the good fortune of all seasons.The right side: Showed one\u2019s skill and obtained wealth in every direction.The middle was laid with a horizontal scroll that said, \u201cFortune is smiling.\u201dYes, this was a gambling house.This gambling house took up one mu[1] of land and could already be considered as a large cottage.Fang Yuan went inside. In the cottage, on the side were placed three rows of counters. There were pieces of ambers or fossils on each counter. They were small as the size of a fist or as big as a washing basin. There were ones that were bigger and taller than a person. These couldn\u2019t be displayed on the counter, instead, they were directly placed on the ground.Different from the noisy and bustling cottages outside, this one was silent and peaceful.There were groups of three to five Gu Masters standing in front of the counter. Some of them carefully looked at the rocks placed on the counter while others picked up the fossil in their palms and were carefully rubbing it in feeling the sensations brought by doing so. There were people who were quietly talking with their companions and some were discussing the price with the servant of the store.However, no matter what they said, it was all whispers, so as not to disturb other people.This was a gambling field.In this world of Gu, there were all kinds of strange Gus existing in a large quantity. A Gu had its own specific food. Without the food, the Gu could only adhere to a certain period of time before dying.Nevertheless, towards life, nature had always been cold yet merciful.With a lack of food, the Gu could only have one hope of living, which was to fall into a deep sleep, self-sealing.For an instant, if the Moonlight Gu didn\u2019t have any Moon Orchid\u2019s petal, it might seal itself. It would try to shrink its power, which was similar to being in hibernation and fell into the deepest sleep. At this time, the blue aureole on its body would be dissipated. Moreover, from the transparent crystal state, it would turn into a piece of limestone as its body was being enveloped with a layer of stone shell. Over time, the stone shell would become thicker and thicker, until it completely formed a rock.Taking the Wine Gu as another example, if it had self-sealed itself, it would form into a white cocoon. It would then curl up its body, falling into a deep sleep inside the cocoon.Of course, this type of sleeping when sealing event, wouldn\u2019t occur on every Gu. The probability of it happening was extremely small. Under normal circumstances, the Gu wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep, but in being starved to death. Only a few individual Gus could self-seal in particular cases.Some Gu Masters would accidentally obtain the sealed Gu in the form of a rock or a cocoon. After the sleeping Gu had awakened, they could make a small fortune out of it. Some were advancing at a fast pace and were welcoming the sudden changes in their living orbit. These circumstances usually happened in the world of Gu Masters, often with either true or false rumors, making people daydream.These rocks had originated from this gambling field and from here onward. Of course, these rocks all had a deceptive appearance. Only opening it could one then determine whether or not there was any hidden Gu inside.\u201cLike this small gambling field, out of ten rocks, at least eight to nine of them are solid. There will be no Gu inside. Even if there were Gu inside, in most cases, they would be all dead. However, once one could find a Gu, they could make a fortune. Those Gu are extremely rare. One had to try to quickly enhance it before someone might have snatched it away.\u201dFang Yuan\u2019s mind was clear as he thoroughly understood this doorway.In his past life, he had also participated in a caravan in being a servant at a gambling field. Later, he had even operated a gambling field that was even bigger than this one. It was a medium-sized gambling field. He had defrauded several gamblers. Anyhow, there were several times when the gamblers had gained some precious Gus.Fang Yuan stood at the door for a while as his eyes glanced around once and he slowly walked to the left of the counter.A few meters behind the counter stood a shop servant. There were also male and females. Blue belts were tied around their waists. They were not mortals but level one Gu Masters. Most of them were Beginners; only a few individuals were at the Intermediate level.Seeing Fang Yuan having approached to the front of the counter, a female Gu Master near him immediately came over. A smile emerged on her face as she softly spoke, \u201cChilde, what Gu do you need? On this side of the counter, each rock costs ten Primeval Stones. If this is your first time gambling, you may wish to go to the right side of this counter, where the small bets are placed. The rocks there only cost five pieces of Primeval Stone. If you are looking for some stimulation, please go to the advanced front counter, where the rocks have a price of twenty Primeval Stones.\u201dThis was an experienced female Gu Master. She had spent a lot of time working in this gambling field.As she saw Fang Yuan coming in, from his appearance, age, height, etc. she had guessed that he was a disciple.The people coming to this gambling field were all Gu Masters. There were no mortals. Disciples could only be regarded as a preparatory Gu master, who had just set foot on the cultivation path. Normally, they would encounter economic constraint due to raising their Gus. How could they have any money to come here and gamble?This type of disciple often came in just to take a look, to open their eyes, to see a new picture. The vast majority just looked but didn\u2019t buy. There were a few that had a fairly good family\u2019s background; they would have tried once. However, usually, they would only buy the cheapest fossils.Therefore, regarding how many rocks thatFang Yuan would have bought, the female Gu Master didn\u2019t have great expectations.\u201cI will take a look first.\u201d Fang Yuan expressionlessly nodded to her, then buried his head inside to watch.In his memory, it should have been on this side of the counter.However, five hundred years was a long period. A lot of things were very vague, especially when the memory of five hundred years was a huge reserve. Honestly, Fang Yuan didn\u2019t remember it clearly.He vaguely recalled that on the first night that the caravan arrived in this year, there was a lucky person that had used ten Primeval Stones to buy a rock which was glowing with purple-gold color.When he opened up the fossil, he gained a Leprous Earth Toad. After selling it to someone else, that guy then earned quite a bit of Primeval Stones.Fang Yuan looked for a while; then he furrowed his brows.There were more than twenty rocks that were glowing with purple-gold light on this counter. Which one could have hidden the Leprous Earth Toad inside of it?On this side, each rock was priced at ten Primeval Stones. Fang Yuan now had ninety-eight pieces of Primeval Stone on him. According to this, the most he could buy was just nine rocks.However, in fact, it couldn\u2019t be calculated like that.No matter whether it was taking risks or gambling, one needed to consider the consequences.Fang Yuan wasn\u2019t a hot-blooded youngster or a pretentious gambler anymore. Those that thought about being favored by fate had usually ended up being teased by fate itself.\u201cI am all alone, without any aid from friends or families, I have to leave some Primeval Stones to support my life, and also buying food to raise the Gus.\u201d After calculating, to ensure his basic needs, he could buy seven fossils at most.\u201cThis one has a beautiful purple-gold glow, but it is flat as a cake. There won\u2019t be any hidden Leprous Earth Toad in there.\u201d\u201cThe light on this one is dazzling. However, it is only the size of a fist. If there were a Leprous Earth Toad, it might be three times the size of this one.\u201d\u201cThis purple-gold fossil is big. However, the surface is extremely smooth, and the Toad\u2019 skin is full of potholes. It is obviously not this one...\u201dFang Yuan was constantly observing and screening.After sealing themselves and having fallen into a deep sleep, they would turn into fossils, putting an end to most detecting means there were in this world. The rest of the methods to detect it were tough and ruthless. It would have directly killed the dying Gu inside.Hence, when a Gu Master chose his rock, he could only count on speculation, experience, luck, and even occasional flashing divine light.If that was not the case, this place wouldn\u2019t be called a gambling house.Of course, in this vast world, nothing was too bizarre. There were still mild means of detection that could let the Gu Master know in advance whether the rock possessed any Gu.In his past life, Fang Yuan had heard of some rumors. Anyhow, after verification, he had found out that they were all false.Fang Yuan silently envisaged: If such method really existed, it must be some secret inheritance and only stayed in the hands of a handful of mysterious people. These didn\u2019t affect the overall state of the gambling industry.This Green Thatch Mountain was better. The more one went toward the east side; the more popular the gambling houses were. Around the Whitehead Mountain, each mountain stronghold had a gambling house. Some large mountain stronghold even had large-sized gambling house. In the history of gambling houses, these three were known as the three major mountain strongholds: The Monolith, the Ancient Tomb and the Deep Blue Whale Mountain Stronghold, each had an ultra-large gambling house.These three ultra-large gambling houses had a history of thousands of years. Now, the business was still booming as the gamblers were as an endless stream. Things like being swept away never happened here.Today, the cottage where Fang Yuan was sitting could only be considered as a small gambling house.But if another fifteen-year-old boy came here, he would definitely be confused by all of these fossils. Even when choosing the rocks, he would just blindly point to one.However, Fang Yuan was different.First of all, he had already known a part of the answer in advance. Hence, the scope of selection was now narrowed down to thirty or fewer pieces.Of course, choosing one among twenty pieces of fossils wasn\u2019t anything easy.However, Fang Yuan had already had five hundred years of experiences to back him up. Relying on such robust concrete details, he observed for a while more before choosing out six purple-gold pieces that fitted the standard the most.He was eighty percent sure that the Leprous Earth Toad was deeply sleeping inside one of these fossils![1] Unit of measurement, classified for fields. 1 mu = 1/15 hectare.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Opening the RockTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cI want to buy a few rocks.\u201d After choosing some good targets, Fang Yuan told the female Gu Master.\u201cAmateur!\u201d The female Gu Master couldn\u2019t help but think of a word inside.Even if one was a skillful gambler, when wanting to buy it, they still had to examine in advance. First, they would have to observe carefully. After that, they would put the rocks on their palms and caress it, feeling its sensation as well as its weight.After the observation, if they felt that something was wrong, the gamblers would give it up. They wouldn\u2019t have bought it with just a glance.And with no doubt, people who had wanted to buy it right away just like Fang Yuan were amateurs that were clearly gambling for their first time.\u201cHowever, although the female Gu Master had thought so, she didn\u2019t show off any weird expressions. Using a flower-like smile like always, she softly asked Fang Yuan. \u201cWhich one do you want to choose?\u201dFang Yuan pointed, \u201cThis one.\u201dThe female Gu Master immediately took it out.Fang Yuan then pointed to another one, \u201cThis one.\u201dThe female Gu master was slightly surprised. She didn\u2019t think that this young man would buy two at once.\u201cIt seems this young man belongs to that majority of people who would bet big.\u201d She silently assessed.However, after that, Fang Yuan pointed again, \u201cAnd this one, this one, I will have all of those.\u201dThe female Gu Master froze for a moment. Feeling surprised, she couldn\u2019t help, but look at Fang Yuan and judged him again.\u201cIt looks like his family background is excellent, despite his ordinary appearance. Otherwise, such a normal Gu Master, how can he have that much money to spend for leisure purposes?\u201d Thinking of that, the female Gu Master then smiled even more softly and gently. She didn\u2019t anticipate that the young man who stood in front of her was really a customer.Such unforeseeable happiness.But, Fang Yuan once again left the female Gu Master with surprise as he pointed to the purple-gold rocks at a distance, \u201cThat\u2019s right, also two more on that side.\u201dThe female Gu Master\u2019s couldn\u2019t help but slightly be frightened, \u201cWhich family does this young man come from in this Ancient Moon mountain stronghold? He seems like a successor to a family\u2019s line of the clan. If I can seduce him, I may not have to be here and be stuck with being a little servant of a store.\u201cAfter thinking about this, the female Gu Master couldn\u2019t help but get gentler, and give Fang Yuan a look that was even more charming.Six rocks were put in front of Fang Yuan.He then took out sixty Primeval Stones and handed it to the female Gu Master without any hesitation.The scene of him instantly paying attracted the eyes of the other Gu Masters in the cottage.\u201cWhat? Someone is starting their bet.\u201d\u201cWe have watched for an hour but don\u2019t dare to start. It\u2019s good that someone is trying it. We can take a look.\u201d\u201cIt is a disciple. However, taking out sixty Primeval Stones at the same time, he must be rich. Such a hot-blooded young man, huh, he thinks he\u2019s that good when gambling? He may have just ran his head into a wall today.\u201dThe group of Gu Masters stood still and whispered to each other as they looked at Fang Yuan.\u201cYoung master, you want to open the rocks right now? The gambling house will do it for free.\u201d The female Gu Master softly recommended as her eyes were glittering.Fang Yuan looked at his surroundings before the corner his mouth formed a complicated smile. He crossed his hand, then rejected the female Gu Master, \u201cPurple-gold is my lucky color. This is also the first time I\u2019m gambling; it carries a special meaning. I want to open it myself!\u201dThe female Gu Master\u2019s eyes lit up; she silently thought: With such pride, he really is a young master.She would have never thought that Fang Yuan didn\u2019t have a single relative in the Ancient Moon mountain stronghold. Like duckweed, he didn\u2019t have anyone to help him. All he that he had done was based on his own efforts.\u201cTsk, it\u2019s good to have money.\u201d\u201cI wonder whose brat is that? Stepping on the money that had been hardly earned by his parents!\u201d\u201cThis brat doesn\u2019t know about limitations. Who would choose the rocks by luck? Haizz, this kind of misdeed is just as throwing Primeval Stones in the water, and then hit the water just to look at the bubbles.\u201dThe Gu Masters in the cottage couldn\u2019t help but look solemn. After seeing Fang Yuan as a prodigal son, their expectations immediately declined to the point where there was not much left.Some Gu Masters even adverted their eyes, turned around, and looked at the rocks on the counters.The changes from the surrounding didn\u2019t affect Fang Yuan\u2019s mood in the least bit. He was expressionless in silently urging the Primeval Essence inside his Primeval Sea to enter the Moonlight Gu.The next moment, the crescent mark in his right palm started to emit an aqua blue glow.Fang Yuan used his right hand to grab a purple-gold stone and placed it in his palm. After that, he closed his fingers, and slowly caressed the surface of the fossil.The blue light was constantly flickering as waves after waves of light started to ripple. The purple-gold rock was getting smaller and smaller with the rock\u2019s power that began to leak from the gap between his five fingers, then fell on the carpet of the cottage.\u201cPerfect technique!\u201d The female Gu Master instantly grabbed this chance to compliment him.\u201cThis young man really did a good job. There is real capacity.\u201d The Gu Masters who saw the scene all emitted light of confusion in their eyes. They now looked at Fang Yuan with different eyes.Fang Yuan used the blue light to grind the surface of the rock as this was absolutely a fine use of the Moonlight Gu. Usually, only those who had used the Moonlight Gu for two to three years could have achieved this level.With Fang Yuan\u2019s age and his disciple identity, to be able to do this was extremely tough.\u201cLook, he uses the signature Gu of our Ancient Moon clan, the Moonlight Gu.\u201d Some Gu Masters had figured out that point and instantly felt proud. Fang Yuan suddenly became less of an eyesore as well.\u201cHowever, such a method is still too rough on the rocks.\u201d Some experienced Gu Masters shook their heads.The purple-gold rock was getting smaller and smaller. Initially, he couldn\u2019t even tightly close his hand. After a while, it had turned into the size of a fist, being completely covered by Fang Yuan\u2019s fingers.The blue light was getting stronger as the fossil was now only the size of a marble. Until the end, there was only a pile of rock powder that had fallen on the carpet of the cottage.This was an entirely solid rock. There was no Gu inside.\u201cReality is unreliable.\u201d The group of Gu Masters constantly shook their heads.\u201cMaster, there are still five left.\u201d The female Gu Master warmly encouraged.Fang Yuan\u2019s countenance was calm as he wasn\u2019t affected. He grabbed the second purple-god rock and continued to grind it.However, the result of this one was the same. It was a solid rock, without any Gu inside.He changed to the third one only to receive the same result.Some Gu Masters were becoming impatient, \u201cStop looking! Select a rock based on its appearance, there is no need to bet.\u201d\u201cIf he can have a good Gu, I would eat all of this rock powder on the floor.\u201d Someone sneered.\u201cYoung master doesn\u2019t need to be discouraged. There are only three; you have only opened three of them.\u201d The female Gu Master slightly exhaled, cheering for Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan took the fourth rock. As the rock was getting to a fist size due to his grinding, his action suddenly stopped.\u201cAh? There is something!\u201d\u201cThe rock has changed. It isn\u2019t the purple-gold rock anymore but is showing off an ink-black color.\u201d\u201cHe really encounters sheer luck?\u201dCries started to arise from around the Gu Masters.\u201cMaster, please be careful from here onward. You mustn\u2019t move too harshly as the Gu which is deep asleep is extremely fragile. If you use too much force, you would kill the Gu inside.\u201d The female Gu Master didn\u2019t expect that such a situation would happen. She froze for a while then quickly reminded him.Fang Yuan\u2019s movement was getting slower. As he used his fingers to rub the rock, rustling noises started to reverberate. The sound was inarticulate rather than being continuous like from before.Black rock powder was drifting down as the rock was becoming smaller and smaller. Fang Yuan\u2019s actions were also slower and gentler.The pile of black powder was getting higher as the black stone inside Fang Yuan\u2019s palm had finally vanished.\u201cHaizz, unfortunately, it is just a rock in a rock.\u201d\u201cReally wasted my emotion, I really thought it was a Gu.\u201d\u201cYou guys are too easy to fool. Is gambling that easy?\u201d Among ten rocks, eight to nine of them are empty. Otherwise, how could this shop make money?\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2019s luck is actually splendid. You could open a rock in rock in your first time of gambling. Ordinary people couldn\u2019t do this.\u201d The female Gu Master changed her tactic in encouraging Fang Yuan. At the same time, she was easing his mentality for the upcoming results.Gambling without gaining any harvest was something like getting one out of ten. This was too common. From what she had seen, Fang Yuan was only doing this based on his mood. The possibility of him choosing out a potential rock was minimal.Fang Yuan laughed but didn\u2019t reply as he continued to take out the fifth rock.He carefully grinded the rock, this time, in the time of just ten breaths, the surface of the purple-gold rock had been completely rubbed off, as it was displaying a bumpy and rugged yellow ball.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: He really did find a Gu?!Translator: - - Editor: - -\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be another rock in rock, will it?\u201d\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be. However, it is quite weird. This loess is wrapped up in a solid layer of purple-gold rock; it should be pressed till smooth. How can the surface be bumpy?\u201d The group of spectators was all puzzled.Seeing the rugged yellow ball of soil in his own palm, Fang Yuan didn\u2019t change his expression as his insides slightly shook.He continued to rub the rock. As the aqua blue light was glowing as the soil was then turned into powder. The soil powder was mixed with soil lumps, one after another fell onto the pile of rock powder beside his feet.\u201cWould it have something?\u201d A few Gu Masters were approaching and widened their eyes in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Some people said with an uncertain tone.\u201cI feel that there is. It really feels like there is something.\u201d Someone whispered.The yellow soil ball was gradually grounded smaller. Right when it was getting around the size of a fist, someone abruptly stomped into the cottage and yelled, \u201cYoung man, take it easy. I Jia JinSheng want to buy this soil ball!\u201dFang Yuan suddenly stopped his movements. At this moment, the Gu Masters in the cottage all stared at the man who had just come.This person looked young, about twenty to twenty-five years old, wearing a golden robe, as he tied a silk belt on his waist. The middle of the belt laid a square jade plate. In the middle of the plate were some horizontal jade patterns, forming the word \u201cOne\u201d.Obviously, he was a level one Gu Master.More than twenty years old but was still a level one Gu Master. This proved that there was nothing good about his aptitude.However, his status seemed to be somewhat special. Seeing this person, the Gu Masters inside the cottage all kowtowed, then shouted out at the same time, \u201cSubordinate greet young master.\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201d\u201cHis name is Jia JinSheng. He is the caravan\u2019s leader, Jia Fu\u2019s half-brother...\u201d\u201cSo, this gambling house is something he opened then? However, his interference is considered breaking the rules of the gambling house, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSome Gu Masters started to discuss.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I am the owner of this store. Younger brother, you are gambling at such a young age. Aren\u2019t you scared that your family will scold you? I will buy the soil ball in your hand for forty Primeval Stones. What do you think? Forty Primeval Stones isn\u2019t a small amount. Not to mention, there\u2019s no certainty that a Gu is in that rock. It\u2019s just because I\u2019m in a good mood today. In thinking about how this is the first time that you are gambling, I don\u2019t want you to lose everything. Hence, regard this as compensation for your capital.\u201d Jia JinSheng strode to Fang Yuan as he said.\u201cForty Primeval Stones?\u201d Fang Yuan slightly raised his brows. He threw an oblique look at Jia JinSheng then sneered, \u201cIt seems that you want to buy the soil ball in my hand by force? Forcing a sale is violating the rules of the gambling house. Doing such a thing on the Green Thatch Mountain, you want everyone to look down on the surname Gu Yue that I\u2019m carrying?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Hearing Fang Yuan\u2019s last words, the other Gu Masters here couldn\u2019t stand still. They couldn\u2019t help but immediately raised a common hatred, as one by one looked, now having wanted to support him. The looks in their eyes toward Jia JinSheng had also turned worse.Jia JinSheng had thought that a fifteen-year-old boy like Fang Yuan would be easy to deal with. A couple words or two could already leverage his heart. He didn\u2019t expect Fang Yuan to have such mean methods. With just some small words, he had thrown him into an unfavorable situation!Looking at the Gu Masters who were full of support towards Fang Yuan, Jia JinSheng\u2019s countenance changed. He fixed his tone of voice then hurriedly waved his hand, \u201cLittle brother, you misunderstood me! I am the owner of this gambling house, how can I violate the rules that I myself have established? How can I continue my business after that? Hahaha. It is just because the soil ball in your hand looks quite interesting, that\u2019s why I want to buy it. If you don\u2019t want to, then forget it. However, if in the end there\u2019s nothing inside of it, you shouldn\u2019t blame me for not reminding you in advance.\u201dFang Yuan didn\u2019t care about him. He turned his head and focused on smoothening out the soil ball in his hand.His movements were very slow and detailed. Only after a while did the dry soil powder started to drop down as one strand by one strand.Followed his movements, a sleeping Gu was gradually exposed in front of everyone.\u201cMy god, there really is a Gu!\u201d\u201cHe really opened a Gu!!\u201d\u201cIs there a mistake? Just betting like that?\u201d\u201cThis young man\u2019s luck is bursting. He has actually gained a Gu with such luck.\u201dIn a moment, compliments of admiration started to reverberate among the Gu Masters.The female Gu Master subconsciously covered her mouth as she was looking at this incredible scene.Since she became a servant of this gambling house, she had gone through many mountain strongholds, encountered all kinds of people, lots and lots of customers, but she had never seen such a dramatic scene.\u201cThere really is a Gu!\u201d A touch of coldness suddenly flashed in Jia JinSheng\u2019s eyes. Hatred started to emerge in his heart constantly. He was a narrow-minded and was full of jealousy. The thing he loved most was to take advantage of others and the thing he hated the most was when someone else took advantage of him.He had opened this gambling house with a tightly organized underlying establishment. Once a customer gained a Gu from the rock, he would receive the news in advance. Normally, he would make a sale with force.Right now, Fang Yuan had found a Gu at his gambling house, right under his nose. Jia JinSheng felt that his heart was bleeding.The Gu which was found was a Toad Gu.Only his belly and back was a yellow color as his back wasn\u2019t smooth; since there were a few potholes on it. The toad was covered with its signature warts. One would have felt that the hair on their body had all stood up in glancing at this toad.It was not too big and was about the size of a palm. Holding it in his palm was as holding two or three bird eggs.Fang Yuan\u2019s visage was calm despite all the frightened, envious, and jealous looks. He carefully urged his Primeval Essence in pouring it into the toad\u2019s body.Almost instantly, this toad had been refined by him.The Gu which already had its fossil layer removed was extremely fragile. Not only was the strength of its body running out but its will had also been disordered. It didn\u2019t have the ability to resist. Hence, it could be easily refined by the Gu Masters.The toad, which was still sleeping, was suddenly wakened up by Fang Yuan. It gradually opened its eyes as its belly slightly grumbled and it softly called out.Rrrr.Although the sound was slightly weak, it had turned the looks on the people present here into that of being extremely excited.The difference between the value of a living and a dead Gu was enormous.\u201cIt\u2019s alive. He\u2019s found a living Gu!\u201d Some people were rubbing their eyes, feeling unbelievable.\u201cIt is a Leprous Earth Toad. Damn it! it really is a Leprous Earth Toad.\u201d People who recognized this Toad Gu excitedly roared up.\u201cYoung man, your luck is no joke. Why don\u2019t I have such fortune?\u201d There were people who were sighing. Their emotions were very complex right now, including both admiration and jealousy.\u201cYoung master, congratulation. This, this is the most precious Gu I have ever laid my eyes on!\u201d The female Gu Master was so excited that she couldn\u2019t manage her coherency.\u201cIt is a Leprous Earth Toad! This is the rare level two Gu, a full value of five hundred Primeval Stones. Damn it, damn it. I had let someone gained such a precious Gu right in my own store. Big loss, big loss!\u201d Jia JinSheng was pale. He attentively stared at the toad\u2019s eyes as a wave of fierce feelings arose in his heart. He wanted to snatch it away.However, he knew he couldn\u2019t. If he really did so, he would surely have suffered the consequences.This was not their own stronghold but the ground in the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s territory.\u201cMaybe I should offer more Primeval Stones; then he will give it to me. That\u2019s right; he is just a disciple. If I offer him five hundred Primeval Stones, there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t accept it. Why didn\u2019t I do so?\u201d Jia JinSheng was feeling upset inside.\u201cNo, this kid isn\u2019t aware of this good. Although he\u2019s found the Leprous Earth Toad, I should be able to suppress the price still, and then acquire it!\u201d A new ray of hope lit up in Jia JinSheng\u2019s heart.However, after that, this ray of hope was ruthlessly crushed by Fang Yuan\u2019s words.Fang Yuan indifferently stared at the Leprous Earth Toad in his hands, regardless of the exclamations and envious looks of the others.He used a calm tone to reply Jia JinSheng, \u201cThis toad is a Leprous Earth Toad, a level two Gu. It needs one jin[1] of yellow mud per meal, the muddier it is, the better that it will be. It is scarce as it is the most important element to be able to refine the Precious Brass Toad. In the market, it has a price of five hundred Primeval Stones. Jia JinSheng, you really want to purchase it?\u201d\u201cYou, you know about it so clearly...\u201d Jia JinSheng\u2019s mouth was trembling. With such a blow, he was speechless for a moment.Fang Yuan chuckled and then continued, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, forget it. I will sell it to someone else. Well, I believe someone will definitely buy it.\u201d\u201cWait, wait. I\u2019ll buy it. It\u2019s just that, can the price be any lower than that?\u201d Jia JinSheng\u2019s face emerged a bitter smile.Fang Yuan turned away.Jia JinSheng hastily caught him, \u201cStop! Don\u2019t go. I\u2019ll buy it; I\u2019ll buy it!\u201dFang Yuan didn\u2019t plan to cultivate this toad anyway.It was a level two Gu, and Fang Yuan currently was only a Beginner level one. Although it just needed yellow mud, the Green Thatch Mountain was only covered with green soil. Finding food for it would be extremely troublesome.Moreover, if he didn\u2019t sell this Toad Gu, Fang Yuan would then have to raise three Gus just by himself. Not to mention about the large consumption rate of the Primeval Stones. With the amount of Primeval Stones that he had right now, it won\u2019t be enough.Hence, Fang Yuan\u2019s goal was to sell the Leprous Earth Toad, earning five hundred Primeval Stones and considering it as seeking some profits.To a Beginner level one Gu Master like Fang Yuan, five hundred Primeval Stones was considered a large sum of money.The transaction was completed quickly as Fang Yuan publicly gave the Leprous Earth Toad to Jia JinSheng while receiving the five heavy pouches. Each was filled with a whole one hundred pieces of Primeval Stone.Initially, Fang Yuan\u2019s property was ninety-eight pieces. After using sixty pieces for gambling, he had thirty-eight left. As a result, his property was instantly doubled, with five hundred and thirty-eight Primeval Stones!Many Gu Masters who saw this scene had their eyes reddened.Fang Yuan put all five pouches into his bosom. He grabbed the last purple-gold rock and leisurely exited the cottage.\u201cYoung master, you won\u2019t open this Primeval rock?\u201d The female Gu Master constantly blinked her eyes. Looking at Fang Yuan\u2019s figure, she loudly reminded.Fang Yuan ignored her without turning his head back and he left the gambling house.Leaving the group of Gu Masters, who silently exchanged looks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWaves were rippling on the surface of the Bronze Primeval Sea.Above the sea, the Wine Gu curled up into a ball, distributing the wine fragrance like white mist.With a crashing sound, a wave of Primeval Essence soared up, directly intruding the wine mist. Once it came down, there was only half left as the color was getting more profound. From the emerald green beginner stage, it had now changed into the Intermediate dark green color.The Intermediate Primeval Essence fell into the Primeval Sea but didn't get mixed with the beginner Primeval Essence and it precipitated at the bottom as if it got heavier.The Primeval Sea was divided as the upper half was the beginner Primeval Essence and the lower half was the Intermediate Primeval Essence.With the time passing by, the wine mist was constantly floating in the vain aperture. Under the refinement of the Wine Gu, the Beginner Primeval Essence was lessened while the Intermediate Primeval Essence was rising.It could be clearly seen that the water level of the lower half Intermediate Primeval Essence was getting higher and that the lower half was continuously declining and had ascended unceasingly.On one side, Fang Yuan was refining his Primeval Essence, on the other side, he was absorbing the natural Primeval Essence in the Primeval Stones to quickly replenish the vain aperture in his body.Lastly, twenty percent of his Primeval Sea had been refined into the Intermediate Primeval Essence.\"Thanks to the Intermediate Primeval Essence, if not, in the gambling house, I wouldn't be able to open five rocks continuously like that.\" Sitting cross-legged on the bed of the dormitory, Fang Yuan gradually opened his eyes.It was already late at night.After coming out of the gambling house, he no longer visited any other stores, but directly returned to the schoolhouse.Although it was just around the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, a Beginner level one Gu Master that carried five hundred and thirty-eight Primeval Stones was just too much.This was not only because of the slightly heavy weight of the Primeval Stones that had made it become quite hard to carry around, but there were also people who were longing for it, with another layer of life crisis.Even if he was at the Advanced level one, if an evil intent arose inside the heart of a level two Gu Master, with Fang Yuan's current capacity, it would still be impossible for him to parry.\"Money is just an inherent part of a human being and if someone had died because of wealth, it would have been pathetic. The funny thing is that not too many people can see this point. How many people does a boat of benefits carry and how many people can board it before it sinks to their deaths?\" Fang Yuan's mouth sketched out traces of a cold smile as he looked at the gray Primeval Stone in his hand.A complete Primeval Stone was a size of a duck egg. However, the one in his hand right now was significantly smaller since half of its Primeval Essence had been absorbed.Fang Yuan didn't feel the slightest pain.There was acon to everything. He was only a grade C aptitude. Wanting to use the Wine Gu to refine his Primeval Essence, he had to consume double that of the same aged person. However, therefore, he could overcome the lack of aptitude. If the practice process was being evaluated, he could be ranked at the top three.Fang Yuan put the Primeval Stone back into his pouch and then took out that last purple-gold rock.He bought a total of six pieces of rocks in the gambling house as he opened five on the spot and had brought back this last one.Light immediately sparked in his eyes. He urged the Moonlight Gu again in rubbing the stone with his fingers as he began to open up the stone.Under the blue light, the purple-gold rock was rapidly reduced in size and ultimately disappeared, leaving only a pile of rock powder on the side of the bed.Fang Yuan wasn't surprised as gambling was like betting ten just to win only one.Even if he already had five hundred years of experience, at most, he could only get eight after betting on ten. The remaining two would be divided into a living Gu or a dead Gu.A dead Gu basically didn't have any value and a living Gu did not necessarily guarantee for it to be an extremely precious and rare one. If he had really found a valuable living Gu, on the contrary, he would have brought a fatal disaster to himself.Fang Yuan's current cultivation base was incredibly low and was currently the lowest among the Gu Masters. The Leprous Earth Toad that he had just found, if he wasn't on the ground of the Ancient Moon Mountain Stronghold, he might have been robbed by that Jia JinSheng.Gambling had never been a way to get rich. On the contrary, it was the primary reason for bankruptcy. This was also not the path that Fang Yuan chose to develop.Although he couldn't find a Gu inside this last purple-gold rock, Fang Yuan wasn't disappointed. On the contrary, looking at this pile of rock powder, he gradually beamed a smile.Exactly, the ultimate goal of entering the gambling house was this rock powder.The Leprous Earth Toad was just something he did out of handiness.As he secretly opened the rock, except him, no one knew the real goal.From now on, he could make an excuse that the Wine Gu was the Gu he founded when opening the purple-gold rock.This idea was wonderful.First of all, no one could determine what kind of Gu could be found in these fossils. Who could say that this Gu couldn't be sleeping inside this fossil? It was entirely possible!Secondly, he had some witnesses. The fact that he opened the Leprous Earth Toad had left a deep impression in those Gu Masters' hearts.Thirdly, even if someone had tried to pursue him till the end, he could still blame it all on luck. Fortune and luck, these kinds of things were the most difficult to understand. Even if there was someone who had suspected that this was the Wine Gu of Hua Jiu the monk, facing the word 'luck', one couldn't find a way to start with this excuse.The darkness inside the room was covering Fang Yuan's eyes.Blindly concealed was like a paper wrapped in fire as it would one day be exposed.To deal with this hidden danger of the Wine Gu, he had to take the initiative to show it out. This was Fang Yuan's way of doing things.Moreover, he had carefully thought about it. In the next stage of cultivating, he also needed to expose the Wine Gu.This kind of level one Wine Gu was extremely valuable to a level one Gu Master. However, level two Gu Masters wouldn't have cared. Hence, even if he had exposed this, at most he could only have caused some attentions. It won't have any harm toward the overall situation as it didn't matter. It was different from the Spring and Autumn Cicada, if that Gu was exposed, he might have died in the next moment without a trace.Five hundred years of life experiences had let Fang Yuan understood clearly about the humans' hearts, as clear as the veins in his palm.\"Two things from my memory including the hidden legacy of Hua Jiu the monk and the Leprous Earth Toad were all picked up by them. Next, I can only rely on my own effort to cultivate step by step.\"Fang Yuan deeply sighed. As he stretched his body, he could feel the tiredness that rushed in.When a Gu Master cultivated his own Primeval Sea, it couldn't replace sleeping.Fang Yuan got into bed as he had his eyes half opened while lying on the bed.Although he had hidden more than five hundred Primeval Stones behind the bedhead and stored lots of Green Bamboo Wine under the bed, he still felt a faint sense of crisis.Five hundred pieces of Primeval Stones had soon become a limit. Just as falling from the pinnacle of power, Fang Yuan clearly understood that his Primeval Stone consumption rate would be even more.And the majority of his income all came from extorting his schoolmates.He could feel that more and more of the disciples surrounding him were obviously making process. Especially the last few extortions from Gu Yue Mo Bei, Chi Cheng and his didi Gu Yue Fang Zheng had made great improvement regarding their fisticuffs technique. Before, he could defeat then within one to two strikes. But right now, he needed five to six strikes.\"After robbing them for three or four times, their fisticuffs technique would be tempered. Once all of them challenge me at once, with my physical strength right now, I won't be able to accept such a wheel war[1]. More than five hundred Primeval Stones sounded like a big amount, but if I use four pieces each day, it, in fact, is nothing.\"\"There is no treasure on the Green Thatch Mountain. However, around the White Bones Mountain, there is a level four Gu Master that had secretly passed it on as a formidable inheritance. However, such a good inheritance was really troublesome as its crucial entrance needed the combined power of two people to be able to pass it.\"\"Haizz, the main thing is that the legacy of Hua Jiu was too little. There was only a Wine Gu. Ah, There are still those images on the wall. Maybe I can sell it to the caravan...\"Fang Yuan was thinking as his eyelids were getting heavier and heavier until his sleepiness came by.--[1] Wheel war is the tactic of several persons taking turns in fighting one opponent to tire him out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: The Monkey Wine, the Wine Worm Refused to Give In to Destiny.Translator: - - Editor: - -At noon of the next day, after having his meal, Fang Yuan then returned to the store's area on the outskirts of the mountain stronghold.Because of their works, during the daytime, there weren\u2019t too many mountain people inside of these cottages.Based on his memory, Fang Yuan went to the place which sold The Bosom Grass, where he then saw an empty handcart staying in one place as there was a chicken alpaca attached to it that pulled the cart.It proudly stood there with a figure as large as an ostrich\u2019s with a shape like a chicken but there were bulges on his back, forming a curve.A pair of large wings was put on two sides of its body as its colorful feathers were shining brightly It raised its head up high, with a scarlet cockscomb like an agate crown as it was emitting a shining glow under the sunlight.\u201cIt seems I am slow and that the Bosom Grass has already been sold out. It\u2019s such a pity. If I can buy a few pounds of Bosom Grass then I can save up lots of Primeval Stones.\u201d Fang Yuan stopped his footsteps before leaving this place and continued to walk inside.\u201cCome, take a sip of the great wine in various mountain strongholds. We have more than a hundred kinds of good wine here. There is the best Lantern Wine, continuous delayed effect Nine Turns Wine, quiet and elegant Dragon Well Tea, sweet and sour Flowery Stone Liquor, Thousands of Ancient Springs that melted after a sip, and the strong wine fragrance - Three Autumn of Intoxication... \u201c Before the drum-shaped tent, folks were shouting out loudly.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes flashed as he instantly became interested, turned around, and entered the wine shop.The facilities in the wine shop were extremely special.At the very end of the tent was a long counter where the one who was looking after the store was a Gu Master, behind his back, there were large crystal ladybugs of various shapes and sizes.There wasn\u2019t a carpet on the ground as the rocky soil was directly exposed. On the ground, groups of colorful mushrooms had grown up.Those mushrooms varied in colors, as they were round and moist which made themlooked extremely lovely. Some were as big as a tabletop while others were as small as a low stool. Normally, a big tabletop-sized mushroom was surrounded by a couple of stool-liked mushrooms.\u201cThis is the Innocent Mushroom, being urged to grow by the Gu Masters. It absorbs the impure dust and purifies the air. It was a kind of grass Gu.\u201d Fang Yuan could identify the origin of these mushrooms with just a glance.He then sat down and chose a small mushroom. The surface of the mushroom was slightly caved in and made Fang Yuan felt like he was on Earth, sitting on his sofa.\u201cThis young master, this is the wine list. Which do you wish to see?\u201d A servant came over.Fang Yuan looked at the wine list and found out that the wine here was even more expensive than the Green Bamboo Wine.\u201cGive me a cup of Monkey Wine.\u201d Fang Yuan put down the wine list as he spoke.\u201cA cup of Monkey Wine!\u201d The servant turned around then loudly cried out.The level one Gu Master standing at the counter immediately turned around as he heard him and he took out a bamboo wine cup from the counter.Afterward, he held the wine cup, turned around in facing the back of the cottage. This cottage was blue and was made out of sailcloth As there were a couple dozens of giant crystal ladybugs hanging on there. They were having their head downwards while their tails were pointing up. It was like the ornaments of the tent on the mountain cliff.These crystal ladybugs were also a kind of Gu. With a hollow belly, it was often used by the Gu Master to carry precious liquids.Their whole body was transparent as if they were made of crystals. From the outside, one could see the ladybug\u2019s round belly that was filled with some kind of wine.The Gu Master then quickly found the Crystal Ladybug that contained the Monkey Wine among the crowd.He put the bamboo wine cup under the ladybug\u2019s mouth and he gently caressed the crystal armor of the ladybug.Followed by a thin strand of Primeval Essence that was fiercely intruding the Crystal Ladybug\u2019s body and it then opened its mouth. A stream of wine was flowing downwards as it was pouring into the bamboo wine cup.As the liquid was rushing inside, it stopped after just a while.The Gu Master put the bamboo cup full of Monkey Wine on the counter. The servant standing beside the counter had been waiting for a while as he hastily but carefully lifted the cup up, took a few steps, and gave the cup to Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan gently took a small sip. The Money Wine was a kind of cider. The pure scent and sweet taste continued to last even after swallowing it.He didn\u2019t drink again, but shook his mentality and called the Wine Gu out.The white and fat Wine Gu turned into a ray of white light. After drawing half a curve in the air, with a Bang, it entered the wine cup.Liquor was splattering, even onto the surfaces of the mushrooms.The Wine Gu was cheerfully rolling in the cup. The rapid decline of the Monkey Wine could be seen with naked eyes. After the time of several breaths, the wine cup was dried out; not a single drop was left on the bottom.\u201cIt is the Wine Gu!\u201d The Gu Master on the counter cried out as light suddenly lit up in his eyes. He was a level one Gu Master with a grade D aptitude, as he had followed the caravan and opened a liquor store. After all, he was sightseeing as well as looking for a chance.The Wine Gu could be used to refine the Primeval Essence and had advanced it to a new level. To a level one Gu Master, it could be said as an extremely valuable Gu. Wasn\u2019t this the rare chance that he was diligently looking for?\u201cYoung master, I am wondering whether your Wine can be cut apart?\u201d He excitedly approached then earnestly asked.Fang Yuan shook his head. With a determination to refuse him, he stood up, and intended to leave.The purpose of him coming here was to take the initiative to expose the Wine Gu. He had never thought of selling it.\u201cYoung master, young master, please stay. I am very sincere; maybe we can sit down and discuss this.\u201d The Gu Master reluctantly followed Fang Yuan to the entrance of the cottage. However, Fang Yuan didn\u2019t reply to him.Eventually, he could only stand still, looking at Fang Yuan\u2019s figure that had taken the turn and had gradually disappeared from his vision with the utmost regret in his eyes....Unconsciously, the sun had gradually descended as the crescent moon was flying up.In the night, the moonlight was like sprinkled water and had evaporated under countless of lanterns\u2019 light.The store's area at night was crowded with people just like last time. Fang Yuan was wrapped around by the crowd as all kinds of arguments were inevitably picked up by his ears.\u201cThe normal stores will open for three days and three nights. Tonight is already the second night. Until tomorrow morning, the caravan will be on the move again. Hence, if we want to buy something, we should hurry.\u201d\u201cYesterday I took an interest in a Golden Bell Gu. Haizz, extremely expensive. The owner had increased the price the whole day. Let\u2019s see if it is any cheaper tonight.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Last night, there was a boy who had gained a Leprous Earth Toad at the gambling house, with a full value of around five hundred Primeval Stones!\u201d.....Fang Yuan carefully listened as his heart couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. He hadn\u2019t heard any news about the Wine Gu.\u201cA Wine Gu is a level one Gu and has a significant meaning to level one Gu Masters. However, it can\u2019t be used to refine the Primeval Essence of level two or level three Gu Masters. Hence, the fact that no one is concerned about it is pretty normal. But also, I can\u2019t be too contrived about revealing the Wine Gu, or my intention will be exposed.\u201d Fang Yuan secretly thought while walking.Right at that moment, the crowd in front of him suddenly busted out.Then, Fang Yuan heard someone shouting, \u201cCome and take a look! There is a bad store, selling fake goods to our clan members!\u201dA voice filled with indignation suddenly arose from the crowd,\u201cWhat? There is something like that?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look! Which store dares to deceive our people like that?!\u201dFang Yuan followed the crowd to come over.He saw a group of people that surrounded the entrance of a large scarlet cottage. The huge crowds of people were in chaos. Some were curiously observing from the outside; some were crossing their arms and giving a cold look. However, the majority of them had a thin layer of anger covering their visages.Two people were standing in front of the entrance of the cottage.A young level two Gu Master, by the looks of his clothing, he was clearly the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s member.The other was an acquaintance of his, the gambling house\u2019s owner, Jia JinSheng.The young Gu Master held a pure black Gu in his hand, raising it up, facing people around and shouting, \u201cPeople, this person in front of me, had sold to me a fake Gu. He had tricked me in saying that this was a Black Hog Gu and sold it to me for two hundred and fifty Primeval Stones. Unexpectedly, when I came back to refine it, I had found out that this was not a Black Hog Gu at all, but obviously just a common smelly fat worm!\u201dJia JinSheng sneered again and again, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to sling mud at me. When did I say that this is a Black Hog Gu? Do you have any evidence?\u201dFacing Jia JinSheng\u2019s denial, the young man suddenly became furious; he seized Jia JinSheng\u2019s arm, \u201cYou profiteer even dares to deny still! You dare to trick your Gu Yue master in the Green Thatch Mountain? You want to find death?!\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d Jia JinSheng was also angry as he abruptly waved his hand and sprung out the young Gu Master\u2019s hand, \u201cYou should choose a better target if you want to create chaos and extort some money. I am not afraid of you! My gege is Jie Gu, a level four Gu Master; do you dare to offend me?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The young Gu Master angrily stared at him but he didn\u2019t dare to take action again. The words level four Gu Master had scared him.\u201cTsk!\u201d Jia JinSheng spat on the ground as he raised his head looking at the young Gu Master and he disdainfully laughed, \u201cYou want petty benefits but forgot to use your head to think. A Black Hog Gu can enhance the power of a Gu Master. How rare is it on the market? It is even rarer than the Wine Gu. Normally, the price will be around six hundred Primeval Stones. You think with two hundred and fifty; you can actually buy a Black Hog Gu? Daydreaming!\u201d\u201cBastard...\u201d Creaking sounds started to reverberate as the young Gu Master was gnashing his teeth as his whole body was trembling with angerand his chest was filled with a flame of humiliation.The crowd was buzzing and loudly discussing, but no one had dared to step up. The level four Gu Master Jia Fu was like an invisible mountain, suppressing the situation.\u201cThis kid is so hateful; he really is a profiteer!\u201d\u201cNo wonder why he dares to be so arrogant in the Green Thatch Mountain, he is Jia Fu\u2019s didi.\u201d\u201cI heard that he is half-blooded. He is only a level one Gu Master but relies on these relationships as he stays in this caravan and tyrannically abuses people.\u201d....\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d At that moment, a loud voice resounded.\u201cJia Fu is here!\u201d\u201cThe leader comes to deal with the dispute. Everyone, please make way.\u201dThe discussing sounds were suddenly oppressed and the crowd hurriedly spread out in forming a narrow aisle.A short and stout with a fat belly middle-aged Gu Master came in along the aisle, wearing a long-sleeved yellow robe, he really is the caravan\u2019s leader Jia Fu.\u201cJia Fu master, greetings.\u201d The young Gu Master didn\u2019t dare to flare-up even though he was filled with anger. He could only be patient, taking the initiative to hold his fists and greet Jia Fu.Jia JinSheng was stiff, standing in one place. It seemed that he hadn\u2019t expected the arrival of his brother as his face was pale and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.This tiny change in expression had made Fang Yuan, who was secretly observing from a distance, looked as if he was deep in his thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Understood One\u2019s Mind, Unconsciously Falling Into the UrnTranslator: - - Editor: - -\u201cGreetings, young Gu Master, is there any problem?\u201d Jie Fu went to the crowd and pleasantly asked.The young Gu Master was feeling flattered and he then bowed down as a greeting. He looked around at the people of the clan and bravely told him the whole situation.\u201cSo there is something like that!\u201d After hearing it, Jia Fu nodded. He asked Jia JinSheng, \u201cDidi, is there such a thing?\u201dJia JinSheng didn\u2019t overdo it as he sneered then looked away.Jia Fu pondered.The crowd was dead silent as they didn\u2019t dare to interrupt his flow of thoughts and just patiently waited for his answer.One thing to say, it was Jia JinSheng who had committed a fraud. However, this young Gu Master was also at fault. If he wasn\u2019t blinded by his greed, how could he be tricked?If Jia Fu really wanted to protect his own didi, with his cultivation base of a level four, even the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s head couldn\u2019t have stopped him.Jia Fu pondered for a while before he opened his mouth, \u201cI understand this as my brother is completely at fault. He has made junior brother suffer from buying a fake product. I apologize!\u201d As he finished his sentence, he clasped his hands together, kowtowing to the young Gu Master.\u201cHonorable Jia Fu!\u201d The young Gu Master was feeling surprised and he humbly said, \u201cYou are a level four Gu Master while I\u2019m only at level two. I can\u2019t accept this, simply can\u2019t accept this!\u201dJia Fu waved his hands, \u201cHaha, this thing isn\u2019t related to the cultivation base of a Gu Master. I always treat the fact as it is and not the individual. Wrong is wrong. I apologize to you on behalf of the caravan. As for compensation, since junior brother had lost two hundred and fifty Primeval Stones; I will represent the Jia family and compensate you with double that amount.\u201dHe did exactly as he said. The followers beside him immediately took out five pouches of money and handed it to the young Gu Master in front of everyone.Each of the pouches was full with a hundred Primeval Stones.The young Gu Master received the pouches and he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t utter a word.\u201cHowever, young man, senior brother wants to advise you.\u201d Jia Fu said with concern, \u201cThe Black Hog Gu is extremely rare as it could enhance the powers of a Gu Master. Although it is just a level one Gu, it is very difficult to find it on the market. Normally, as soon as it appears, people will buy it right away. The price is about six hundred Primeval Stones. Wanting to reply on two hundred Primeval Stones to buy a Black Hog Gu is highly unrealistic.\u201d\u201cJunior understood!\u201d The young Gu Master was convinced and then kowtowed to Jia Fu.There were cheers that arose from the crowd.\u201cHonorable Jia Fu is too wise!\u201d\u201cThis is excellent; he is indeed the honorable Jia Fu!\u201d\u201cEven though he himself is a level four Gu Master, still, he doesn\u2019t rely on his power to abuse the weak as Honorable Jia Fu really is a role model.\u201d...\u201cNot really, not really.\u201d Jia Fu smiled while he kowtowed in every direction and modestly said, \u201cThe business of our Jia family has always based on honesty and saying no towards cheating others. You folks, my brother is still young as he likes to tease others, in reality, his heart is still good, and I hope that everyone can forgive him.\u201dThe cheering was getting even more enthusiastic.\u201cTsk!\u201d Jia JinSheng\u2019s countenance was pale as he bitterly stomped away, directly turned, and entered his cottage. He then went through the cottage, to the back side, and exited it.Fang Yuan looked with the cool eyes of the bystander and he thought inside, \u201cIt seems like I can do something with the images on that cliff that Hua Jiu monk has left behind.\u201dHua Jiu monk had used the Saving Image Storing Sound Gu to record the disgraceful act of the fourth clan\u2019s head.He was disgruntled before he had died. Hence, he had used the Saving Image Storing Sound Gu to put it on the cliff in forming images on it.The images on the cliff were going in a loop as it showed the world the truth that had happened.To grasp a hold of the biggest advantage, Fang Yuan had soon thought about selling that image on the cliff. He was convinced that the other two clans on the Green Thatch Mountain, including the mountain strongholds of the Bai family and the Xiong family, would all be very interested in the images on the cliff.However, it wouldn\u2019t have been alright if he had personally sold the images on the cliff himself as his cultivation base was still weak. Bringing the images on the cliff to another mountain stronghold, he would likely be killed to keep such a secret safe.Even if the transaction was successful and he had received the payment, there was no airtight wall in this world. Once the news was leaked to the high authorities of the Ancient Moon clan, the lightest punishment he would receive was to be banished from the clan.Following Fang Yuan\u2019s plan, the Ancient Moon clan still had some uses to him.Hence, the safest way was to sell it to a merchant of the caravan. Those merchants were all outsiders as they didn\u2019t participate in the battle of power between the mountain strongholds on the Green Thatch Mountain, so they would be the most ideal choice.A day after, the caravan will leave the Ancient Moon mountain stronghold and head to the Xiong Family mountain stronghold next, then, later on, the mountain stronghold of the Bai Family.Selling it to them, Fang Yuan would be able to minimize the risk of trading and this would be the safest method.....\u201cGive me another cup of wine!\u201d\u201cWine, where is the wine?\u201d\u201cBring it to me quickly! Are you scared that I can\u2019t afford it?\u201dJia JinSheng harshly slammed on the table, growling.\u201cGu Childe, your wine!\u201d The servant quickly handed the wine to him.Jia JinSheng quickly grabbed the bamboo wine cup, raised his neck, and finished it at once.\u201cGood wine!\u201d He laughed out as his voice was bleak, yet hoarse.With a bang, he slammed the wine cup on the table, then roared again, \u201cGive your master another cup. No, give me all that you\u2019ve got!\u201dThe servant of the wine store didn\u2019t dare to offend him; he could only follow his demands.Fortunately, the wine store was almost full. Not only were people encircling the bench but the surrounding area was also full of people. Jia JinSheng was crazy for the wine as he was constantly yelling. However, inside this cottage, his voice wasn\u2019t very prominent.Jia JinSheng had a cup then followed up by another cup. He wanted to use wine to drink away his worries as he faced his back at everyone else, and that was why no one had noticed his tears were falling down as he was drinking.Who could have understood his bitterness and known of his worries?\u201dThere must be a reason behind every miserable man.Everyone had their own story.Among the brothers, he was the youngest. With a good-looking appearance, he also looked like his father the most. Hence, he then became his father\u2019s favorite. However, God had deliberately tried to tease him as he was only a grade D aptitude.Even when he was small, he had been oppressed by his brothers, and he didn\u2019t want to reconcile. He wanted to resist but because of his aptitude, he couldn\u2019t.As his father felt the calamities that were approaching, he wanted to split the inheritance. He let every two brothers received a caravan and in accordance to their own achievements, they each, would receive a different share of the inheritance.Jia JinSheng wanted to rely on his own to gain the inheritance of the family, as well as their recognition. However, he didn\u2019t expect that his brother Jia Fu would set his foot in.The moment that Jia Fu had appeared, he immediately knew that he had been tricked, from the beginning to the end, this had been a scheme, but what could he have done? Since the time that he entered this caravan, he had been firmly watched over by Jia Fu. The big gap between a level four and a level one Gu Master left him unable to fight.\u201cJia Fu!\u201d He squeezed out a name from his teeth. The flame of hatred was burning in his eyes. He wasn\u2019t willing to!\u201cDo you want to take revenge on your brother? I can help you.\u201d Just then, a voice landed on his ears.Jia JinSheng was shocked for a moment before turning around and found a person that was already unknowingly sitting down beside him.He shook his head a few times, blinked, and finally recognized the man.Who could it be beside Fang Yuan?\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d He stared at Fang Yuan with anger, \u201cI remember you! You are the lucky kid that had gained a Leprous Earth Toad in my gambling house! Do you want to make fun of me?\u201dFang Yuan looked at Jia Fu with eyes as cold as water, \u201cI have a big business. If you want to achieve a better result and receive more property, you might need to listen.\u201dJia JinSheng\u2019s visage suddenly showed a gleam of surprise. He sat straight up and then said, \u201cHow did you know about the inheritance of our family?\u201dThis was a secret. Outsiders couldn\u2019t be able to know about this. However, Fang Yuan had just said it out straightly.\u201cThese events of the Jia family aren\u2019t some big secrets, how can you hide it from the eyes of the whole world?\u201d Fang Yuan sneered. He couldn\u2019t help but recall the memory in his past life.The head of the Jia family was a legendary man as he had built his whole business from scratch. He rose his power from the caravan and revitalized the mountain stronghold of the Jia Family. As he got older, he felt that calamity had descended. He then assigned every two of his sons a caravan, splitting the inheritance according to their achievements. The better the result was, the more the property they would receive.However, his oldest son Jia Fu and his second son Jia Gui were all excellent. Being indirect competition for six to seven years, they still couldn\u2019t determine who was better. Even until the head of the Jia family had passed away, the outcome was still undecided.After the family head had passed away, he left behind an enormous inheritance. In order to snatch away the inheritance, Jia Fu and Jia Gui always competed with each other. From fighting internally, they then borrowed forces from the outside to join in the battle. After arousing a large scale Gu Competition, they had both perished. The Jia family\u2019s powerful era was temporary as it had soon declined in leaving the world sobbing.Jia JinSheng squinted his eyes. He didn\u2019t have any comment regarding Fang Yuan\u2019s explanation. He silently thought: Last year was when father announced the rules for dividing the inheritance. It is now the second year. There is no airtight wall in this world. Hence, the fact that this news was leaked out isn\u2019t too surprising.His true worry was whether or not this was a scheme from Jia Fu. But no matter what, at first, he wanted to listen to Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan didn\u2019t talk right away but looked around. This wine store was the one he had gone in that afternoon. The owner of the wine store had a unique operating method. The business was rising at night. Noisy sounds now filled the cottage as it was full.Discussing here was safer than when it was quiet as they could avoid some Eavesdropping Gu.He waved his finger at Jia JinSheng, \u201cCome over here.\u201dJia JinSheng unhappily sneered but was still tilting his body over.After he had listened to Fang Yuan\u2019s narration, he furrowed his brows, and was glancing at Fang Yuan with an icy-cold look, \u201cThis business involved the three pillars of the Green Thatch Mountain. Being a merchant, the most taboo thing is to get oneself involved in the battle over the power struggle in that area. Tsk, did Jia Fu send you here to trick me?\u201dFang Yuan had soon expected that he would have this doubt. He didn\u2019t explain but stood up and walked away, \u201cHaha, if so, then I will go discuss it with your brother.\u201dJia JinSheng squinting his eyes while staring at Fang Yuan. Right when Fang Yuan was about to exit the wine store was he not able to hold it anymore as he stood up and rushed over, passing Fang Yuan outside of the cottage, \u201cDon\u2019t go, we can still talk about it.\u201dFang Yuan put both of his hands behind his back, obliquely looking at him then coldly said, \u201cI know you have doubts about me. However, you are now being firmly oppressed by your brother; you will soon lose everything. It is either that you believe that there is still a glimmer of hope or there will be no hope at all. Let\u2019s see if you dare to bet on this one or not.\u201dJia JinSheng\u2019s visage drastically changed; he corrected, \u201cJia Fu is just older than me but I have never looked at him as my older brother! But you are right; I will bet on this.\u201dFang Yuan solemnly said, \u201cTwo thousand Primeval Stones, no bargaining.\u201dJia JinSheng bitterly smiled, \u201cThis price is very high and the sale is too risky.\u201d\u201cNo pain no gain.\u201d Fang Yuan shook his head, then spoke with a determined tone, \u201cIf you sell it to the other two mountain strongholds, I guarantee that you will gain a lot more.\u201dJia JinSheng nodded, a trace of seriousness emerged on his face, \u201cI really do believe in that point. In these past few years, the Bai Family mountain stronghold has quickly expanded their power as they also have a grade A genius, named Bai NingBing. He has great prospects and the power structure in the Green Thatch Mountain is gradually changing where the dominating position of your Ancient Moon mountain stronghold is shaking. If I sell it to the Bai Family, I believe the price will be at least doubled!\u201dAfter having listened to Jia JinSheng\u2019s thorough understanding of the power struggle of the Green Thatch Mountain, Fang Yuan couldn\u2019t help but look at him again and silently thought, \u201cBeing born with such a family background, this Jia JinSheng has been influenced by his family. He really isn\u2019t a good-for-nothing guy.\u201dJia JinSheng deeply sighed, \u201cNo matter whether this is a pit or not, I will still jump. I promise you. Two thousand Primeval stones, deal! However, I want to look at the goods first.\u201d\u201cOf course, follow me.\u201d Fang Yuan laughed then turned around and showed him the way. Jia JinSheng had entered the urn and everything was within his control now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jia JinSheng was suspicious. After all, this looked unfamiliar to him.Finally, he couldn\u2019t contain himself, \"I have a question. Jia Fu is a kind and friendly person, who bases on faith to work. He also has a reputation. I, on the other hand, am dishonest and deceitful. I buy and sell with force too. Why did you choose me as your customer but not him?\"Fang Yuan\u2019s reply was transmitted along the crack, \"Because his cultivation base is too high. If he sees the cliff with the images, he could choose to make the transaction, or even give up the transaction to directly report the cliff to the Ancient Moon clan\u2019s head. I don\u2019t like giving the initiative to other people\u2019s hand. Moreover, I never believe what integrity is. The so-called integrity is just sh*t. The benefit is too small to move the other\u2019s heart.\"The most important reason was his special position. The lower one\u2019s cultivation base was; the easier one could be manipulated. However, Fang Yuan naturally wouldn\u2019t have talked about such a point.\"Haha.\" Jia JinSheng beamed a hollow laugh, his doubts were reduced more than half, \"Your last word has won my heart.\"They had finally squeezed into the secret cave inside the mountain.As soon as Jia JinSheng saw the images on the cliff, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, \"Haha, I had bet on the right thing! You didn\u2019t trick me!\"Fang Yuan stood behind him and chuckled without saying anything.Jia JinSheng looked at the ever-changing images on the cliff and retraced the scene of that year battle between Hua Jiu monk and the fourth clan\u2019s head.After looking at it, he retrieved his look as he tilted his head to Fang Yuan, and mockingly said, \"It seems the fourth clan\u2019s head of your clan is just like that.\"Fang Yuan casually said, \"It is nothing. The Ancient Moon clan needed a hero, so the fourth clan\u2019s head became the hero. Soon after, if the Bai family wanted a despicable villain, the fourth clan\u2019s head would then become one. Heroes or villains are nothing but the views of others.\"\"Good saying.\" Jia JinSheng was clapping and laughing while looking around the secret cave.He landed his look on the remaining bones of Hua Jiu the monk and said, \"It is a pity for a level five Gu Master. Junior, you have gotten lots of benefits from him, haven\u2019t you?\"The legacy of a level five Gu Master was definitely not a trivial matter. Thinking till here, Jia JinSheng couldn\u2019t help but feel a shake in his heart as he couldn\u2019t help but had asked about it.Fang Yuan shook his head, \"It has been too long as most of the Gus had died and I only found a Wine Gu.\"Jia JinSheng didn\u2019t buy it, \"Junior, you don\u2019t need to lie to me. We had agreed on this business together and we are complicitors. I will not leak anything out. Tell me the truth, how good is it?\"Fang Yuan sneered, too lazy to reply, so he didn\u2019t explain anymore.Fang Yuan had soon predicted Jia JinSheng\u2019s reaction. This was also the reason why he had chosen Jia JinSheng but not Jia Fu.Jia JinSheng continued, \"Not talking about other things; I knew that Hua Jiu the monk had a famous Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula. This is the mount Gu of a level five Gu Master. It has a giant figure and is very good at drilling the ground. Hua Jiu the monk was a person on the Demon Path. The reason why he could have gone on such rampage was because of this Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula. It had helped him escape when he was surrounded by people from the righteous sects.\"Ah, there is such a thing?\" Fang Yuan slightly frowned as he really hadn\u2019t heard much about the news regarding Hua Jiu the monk.Jia JinSheng said triumphantly, \"Last year when I came to your mountain stronghold, I had heard about such legend. I felt that this was every interesting. Hence, I went home and asked about it. The Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula and Hua Jiu the monk are almost inseparable. This secret cave was what the Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula had made. Otherwise, the Green Thatch Mountain is full of green soil, how could such a secret cave be formed? Junior brother, you don\u2019t need to cover it up. Since Hua Jiu the monk had died here, certainly, his Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula is also here!\"Fang Yuan furrowed his brows deeper. He faintly felt a wrong feeling and said with deep eyes, \"Exactly, there is no other cave that leads to the outside. The Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula has a large figure. If it could go in the crack, it basically couldn\u2019t get out. However, it is possible that the Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula had been killed by the fourth clan\u2019s head. Look at those images on the cliff, Hua Jiu the monk hadn\u2019t summoned the Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula even though he was in the middle of his fight.\"\"This was even stranger as the secret cave couldn\u2019t have been naturally formed and it is certain that Hua Jiu the monk had made it. Without the Thousand Miles Crypt Tarantula, did he have any other methods?\" Jia JinSheng skeptically looked at Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan\u2019s brows were almost swelling. He felt that something was getting worse. With the new information from Jia JinSheng, he had vaguely figured out something: It seemed that he had missed some other point.He couldn\u2019t help but fall into his thoughts.Jia JinSheng was also thinking. The images from the cliff could no longer satisfy his desire. Right when he believed that such a thing really did happen, he extremely wanted to find out the hidden legacy of Hua Jiu the monk.However, they didn\u2019t expect that the abnormalities were happening right behind them!The images that were going in circles on the cliff suddenly flashed.The image of a bald head Gu Master who was seriously injured with a pale face was replacing the former images on the cliff.He effortlessly collapsed on the ground with his back against the mountain. His chest and limbs were all covered with deep wounds. However, the weirdest thing was that his flesh could already be seen on these wounds, but there was no bleeding. It was as if the blood in his entire body had been sucked out.\"I am Hua Jiu the monk.\" The bald-headed Gu Master laughed as his face was showing a ferocious look, \"The people who come here, no matter whom you are, if you can constantly play the images on the cliff for a hundred days; that is enough to prove that you have no favor for the Ancient Moon clan. Good, you will be my successor!! My legacy is left to you, under one condition. You have to destroy the Ancient Moon clan and destroy the mountain stronghold, without any mercy!\"Jia JinSheng was dumbstruck, standing in one place with astonishment on his visage.\"The successor of the level five Hua Jiu monk!\"He was stunned. For a moment, he could only hear buzzing sounds in his head as thoughts were rolling around in his mind.\"My god! Level five supreme master. What is this concept? An elder is at level three while a four level Gu Master can become the head of a clan. And the level five Gu Master is the lord of the mountain, who can tyrannically dominate the whole mountain. It\u2019s unimaginable that such a small place can possess the inheritance of the power of a level five Gu Master.\"\"Wait a minute, Hua Jiu the monk is a person from the Demon War. If I inherit his power, could it be worse? No, power has nothing to do with righteousness or evil. Hua Jiu wants his successor to destroy the Ancient Moon clan so should I do it or not? But he is dead and I just need to inherit his legacy. Then, I don\u2019t have to worry about other things.\"\"This is a big chance. Although I am just a grade D aptitude, after inheriting the hidden legacy of Hua Jiu the monk, maybe I could change my aptitude. This legacy might even have the rare aptitude enhancing Gu and in receiving this fortune, I could become a level four or level five Gu Master. Then I can compete with Jia Fu!\"\"Wait a minute! I almost forgot, there is an outsider here. What should I do?\"\"Should I share this inheritance with him? No, kill him! Only in killing him could I keep this secret. Yes, first, I need to reassure him, telling him I will share this inheritance with him to fool him, erasing the alert in his heart. Afterwards, I can abruptly use a deadly strike to kill him, and perishing him here. This place is secluded. Perfect! Even if I were to kill him, no one would know.\"In just a short moment of a blink, he had consumed all of those thoughts.Having decided, Jia JinSheng squinted his eyes and a wicked smile then emerged on his countenance.He slowly turned around, looking at Fang Yuan and as soon as he wanted to open his mouth, two blue Moon Blades immediately shot over!His pupils instantly shrunk into the size of a pin since the distance was too short; he basically didn\u2019t have time react!\"You...\" His voice stopped abruptly.The Moon Blade accurately hit the target, which was his neck. Right at that instant, his head flew up as blood was spurting out like springs.His body collapsed on the ground after another one to two seconds.Hot blood sprayed on the mountain cliff that was dying like the withered vine with a scarlet color.\"You don\u2019t need to think that much when killing a person.\" Fang Yuan casually glanced at the corpse on the ground before adverting his eyes to the image on the cliff.\"Unbelievable, such a turning point has appeared. Really interesting!\" He muttered as faint light was flickering in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Jia Jin Sheng, I actually did not want to kill youTranslator: Sigma Editor: SigmaThe rain crashed down heavily.Grey clouds covered the sky, and the continuous mountains far away blended into a mass of black ink.The rain curtain interwove the heavens and earth together.Crack!The sky flashed bright abruptly, and a bolt of lightning cut across the sky like a silver snake, then in an instant it was gone.Summer was approaching, and the end of spring\u2019s heavy rain seemed to bring about a trace of the warmth of summer.On Qing Mao Mountain, huge expanses of jade green spear bamboo stood tall and straight, resisting the winds and rain, the bodies of the bamboo straight like a spear as ever, the tips of the bamboo pointing towards the blue sky dome.In the Gu Yue village, row upon row of innumerable tall-pillared houses endured against the great rain\u2019s washing. Outside the village, the caravan had already set out on their journey once again.\u201cThe rain is heavy, take note of the pavement.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fall behind, Gu Masters better pull your Gu properly, especially the fat beetle, don\u2019t block the mountain road anymore!\u201d\u201cYou bunch of mortal martial fighters, better open your eyes wide and pay careful attention. Lose a single thing and you\u2019ll be paying for that!\u201dThere was an endless stream of shouts rising and falling in succession from the merchant caravans.After stopping over at the Gu Yue village for three days, it was time for this merchant caravan to leave the place and follow the mountain path through Qing Mao Mountain and head for their next destination.The heavy rain cleansed the heaven and earth, and the roads surrounding the village were paved with cobblestone, this was still alright. However after around five hundred meters the roads would turn into a muddy and narrow mountain path.The head of the proud ostrich chicken was drooping, its colourful rainbow feathers soaking wet under the rain, sticking into clumps, becoming the example of a drenched and bedraggled chicken.The fat beetle worm moved its fat huge body, walking extremely slow forward. The rainwater beat upon its black armor, forming streams of water flow, sliding down both sides of its body onto the earth.The shaggy mountain spider was also drenched, and its green-black coloured fur were adhered together.On the contrary, the toad Gu were happily calling out, carrying out the load and Gu Masters, hopping forward on the mountain. And the winged snake had already put away its wings, the thick snake\u2019s body cheerfully travelling on the muddy water.To protect the goods and prevent them from getting drenched wet by the rainwater, the Gu Masters were showing their magical abilities at the moment.On a few enormous fat beetles stood Gu Masters in the middle. Their two hands were raised high, each of them having a One-stretch Golden Light Worm floating in midair one inch away from their palms.The green copper primeval essence was like stream evaporating as it concentrated into the One-stretch Golden Light Worm\u2019s bodies. The entire Gu flashed like a golden bean, acting as the heart, supporting a tremendous faint gold coloured bubble dome.The hemisphere-shaped bubble dome had a rather huge scope. It was able to completely cover one fat beetle worm and still have some leftover space.As the rain smashed upon the bubble dome, it would bounce away, just like hitting on an umbrella. However this sort of One-stretch Golden Light Worm continuously consumed primeval essence, and in the long run the Rank one Gu Masters would not be able to take it anymore.As expected, after a while, a Gu Master shouted: \u201cNo more, my primeval essence is almost exhausted, who can take over?\u201d\u201cI can!\u201d Almost simultaneously, a Gu Master rushed forward and replaced his position.A few Gu Masters pulling the carriages or riding the mountain spiders activated the Green Silk Gu in their bodies.Under its influence, their hair started to grow furiously.A normal person\u2019s hair had at least one hundred thousand strands. A hundred thousand strands of hair, each being five to six metres, intertwining and covering the Gu Master\u2019s body along with the steed, formed an impenetrable hair raincoat.The Green Silk Gu was a Rank one Gu worm, often used for defense. It uses 30% of green copper primeval essence to activate, and was not a continuous expenditure type like the One-stretch Golden Light Worm.This Green Silk Gu can be combined with the Rank one Black Boar Gu to become the Rank two Black Mane Gu.The Black Mane Gu when activated would not only involve hair on the head, but also hair on all the pores. Within a few seconds, the Gu Master\u2019s body would gain a black mane protective armor.The Black Mane Gu\u2019s advancement path was the Rank three famous Gu, Steel Mane Gu.Other than the One-stretch Golden Light Worm and Green Silk Gu, many of the caravan Gu Masters also chose the Water Spider Gu. It can be seen that there was a thin layer of blue raincoat on their bodies.On the raincoat\u2019s surface, the water circulated randomly. As the raindrops hit onto the raincoat, it would immediately become part of the raincoat.Since the Gu Masters were continuously soaking under the rain, the raincoat on their bodies would grow thicker. Every now and then the Gu Masters would have to urge the Water Spider Gu and discharge away the excess water. At this moment the thick raincoats would be reduced to the original thin layer.As for those mortal warriors, they were constantly on the move, watching over the goods on the muddy road. Most of them wore raincoats made of straw, but in their rush and confusion the straw raincoats had limited effect from avoiding the rain, so they were already drenched wet by the rainwater.\u201cThis accursed weather!\u201d The warriors cursed in their hearts.In the rainy weather, the mountain trail becomes even harder to walk on.Under this weather, martial artists might be strong physically but they are still mortals. Once their bodies are drenched by rain and coupled with intensive labour, they would easily catch a cold. Getting a serious illness was the lightest consequence, perhaps they might catch repercussions, and if they catch a certain tough disease, it might cause them to get gravely ill and abandoned on the trip itself.If they encounter slippery roads on the mountain trails, or encounter wild beasts and Gu worms\u2019 attacks, they might lose their lives.The caravan may be big, and have many Gu Masters. But every time they went on a journey, there would always be a great decrease in numbers. Mortal martial artists die the most, while Gu Masters also have injuries and casualties.If the caravan was unlucky enough to encounter large-scale migrating beasts, they might even get wiped out completely.Other than natural disasters, there were also human-caused problems. Among the villages, there might be those who do not welcome the caravan. Some villages like to rob the outsiders.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving, see you next year!\u201d Some of the Gu Masters sat on the Gu worms and turned their bodies to bid farewell.At the entrance of the village, many people gathered as they sent the caravan off with their gazes.\u201cYou must come again next year!\u201d Reluctant to see them depart, the children shouted loudly.The adults had more complicated expressions.\u201cThe road ahead is unforeseen. In these hard times, for those who are able to come to the village next year, how many would still be familiar faces?\u201d\u201cBe it at the merchant caravan or in the village, it is not easy to earn a living.\u201dAs the caravan left further and further, as the crowd dispersed.The cheerful and lighthearted market atmosphere had also subsequently disappeared. The original spot that had erected tents and shops was left now with a huge mess. The grass turf had been walked upon continuously by the crowd, grassroots and mud soil trampled out. The rainwater hit on its surface, immediately forming mud and numerous little pot-holes that collected muddy water. In addition to that, there was a lot of garbage left over.Fang Yuan stood on a secluded hillside, watching the merchant caravan from far away alone. The merchant caravan was like a fat and colourful flower python, snaking through the narrow mountain road under the grey heavy rain, slowly entering the dense mountain forest.\u201cAh, the heavens are sending their blessings...\u201d Fang Yuan sighed lightly.He held a butter yellow paper umbrella, quietly standing in the rain.Fang Yuan wore the most plain flax cloth garment, his body slim, his skin bringing about the pale whiteness of a fifteen year old teenager, a settled clump of clean and short black hair atop his head. The ends of his hair trembled slightly in the wind under his umbrella.While others curse the weather, he was lamenting the timely appearance of the rain.He killed Jia Jin Sheng last night and cleaned up the scene, but because it happened so unexpectedly, there was bound to be areas of neglect. Especially with the bloody smell, because the cave is not ventilated, the smell could not disperse easily.With this rain, it cleaned up the air and environment, greatly reducing the chances of getting exposed by smell tracking methods. The crack was bound to have a small cascade of water flowing down, and once the fresh water vapour diluted the air, he would not be exposed for the short time being.Of course, once time passes, the chance of getting exposed increases.In this world there were all sorts of Gu worms, and investigative methods were abundant, even Fang Yuan only knew a portion of them.The rain produced pitter patter sounds as it hit on the yellow umbrella. Then following the shape of the umbrella, streams of water flowed down onto the limestones beneath Fang Yuan\u2019s feet, hitting and creating splashes.Seeing the caravan curve into a corner, completely disappearing into the forests, Fang Yuan did not show a sign of relief, but instead looked grim.\u201cAlthough Jia Jin Sheng\u2019s cultivation was weak and had little talent, he had a special status. The caravan\u2019s people are all busy with business, thus no one found out that he\u2019s missing. But once some time passes, it\u2019d definitely be found out. By then, Jia Fu would return to investigate, and the real challenge would be then.\u201d\u201cThe Jia family head intentionally arranged Jia Jin Sheng and Jia Fu to be on the same caravan, he had deep intentions. In terms of cultivation, they are worlds apart. In terms of cunningness, they\u2019re also incomparable. Such an arrangement is to inflict a blow to Jia Jin Sheng and let him be clear of reality, and live life peacefully. At the same time he is testing Jia Fu\u2019s nature, for if he is too overbearing on Jia Jin Sheng, how can he hand the position of clan head to him?\u201d\u201cJia Jin Sheng never truly understood his father\u2019s intentions. Although he had some intelligence, he only managed to scratch the surface of a merchant\u2019s wits, what a pity. A pity of such a good pawn piece.\u201dFang Yuan felt regrettable in his heart. With five hundred years of experience, he could easily see past the surface and understand the true nature of the situation.When he saw the dispute between the two that night, he could tell the complicated relationship between Jia Jin Sheng and Jia Fu, and thus he had a vague plan formed in his heart from then on.In his plan, Jia Jin Sheng was a very suitable pawn. His cultivation was weak but he held a high position in the caravan, and although he had some wits, he had little experience, thus Fang Yuan could easily manipulate him.Once controlled, this pawn would be extremely useful.For one, he could build a strong network of smuggling through his relationship, preparing up for usurping treasures from future killings.Secondly, Fang Yuan could hide in the background and use the image wall to stir up conflict among the Qing Mao mountain\u2019s three families, causing a civil war and enabling him to be able to reap the rewards.Thirdly, Fang Yuan could rely on him to make his way into the Jia family interior. The future Jia family dispute caused a large scale Gu fighting competition, it will be a huge affair with lots of benefits to gain. Fang Yuan could make use of this to acquire the greatest reward for himself.\u201cMy cultivation is still too low, restraining me greatly in doing things. If there was a pawn for me to use, I can do some things that I cannot attempt myself, it is not only convenient but also lowers the risk of doing so. If I get exposed, I can simply discard the pawn and stay safe myself.\u201d\u201cThe surrounding people know the situation well and are loyal to the family, thus they aren\u2019t good to manipulate. Only an outsider like Jia Jin Sheng can be used more efficiently to execute my plans. Unfortunately, I did not expect the Flower Wine Monk to leave behind his power inheritance.\u201dThe Flower Wine Monk is a Rank five Gu Master, his inheritance is definitely more valuable than this pawn.Of course, it\u2019d be good if he could get the best of both worlds, but in face of such treasure, Jia Jin Sheng could not longer be controlled, thus he had to be discarded.\u201cNothing will go smoothly forever in this world.\u201d Fang Yuan sighed and shook his head.The Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance appeared and disrupted Fang Yuan\u2019s original plans. In addition, after the changes to the image wall, the videos and images were all gone, only showing a line written in blood, telling Fang Yuan to destroy the image wall and reveal a cavern entrance. Following the trail, he would be able to get the inheritance.The blood writing only appeared for a few breaths before vanishing, and the image wall also turned back into the most ordinary mountain wall.Fang Yuan spent the entire night cleaning up the murder scene, and had no time to break the wall.\u201cKilling Jia Jin Sheng in a hurry, this would leave many problems for me in the future, and I am but only temporarily safe. Although I succeeded in getting rid of the evidence, there is bound to be trouble coming for me in the future. In this case, I would have to change my way of exposing the Liquor worm. I cannot go to the secret cave behind the wall crack either. I have to stay in the mountain village for some time to anticipate investigation in the near future.\u201dFang Yuan turned around and held his umbrella, walking in the rain towards the village.\u201cBut this is fine too. I can spend a large amount of primeval stones during this period to refine to middle stage primeval essence. Using it, I can nurture my aperture and break through into the middle stage. Once I reached the middle stage, my power will double, allowing me to get the inheritance more easily and with greater confidence.\u201dA demonic cultivator\u2019s inheritance was not as mild and gentle as a righteous cultivator\u2019s, for there was often dangerous tests and tasks, and if one cannot get through, they\u2019d have to pay the price with their life.\u201cThe world is hard to predict, but it is precisely this that makes it interesting.\u201d Fang Yuan smiled coldly.The green mountain beneath the heavy rain extended continuously and unending, its green mixed with grey, appearing stifling and heavy.A gust of wind blew, and the raindrops inclined a little, hitting onto Fang Yuan\u2019s shoulder and attacking him with a burst of chilliness.He thought about Jia Jin Sheng again.Sighing in his heart, he thought, \u201cJia Jin Sheng, actually I\u2026 did not want to kill you.\u201dWhat a waste of a good pawn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The green spear bamboo specially found on Qing Mao Mountain had started to grow wildly, and nearly everyday it would show an obvious increase in height.The grass and the trees began to change from emerald green into a dark green colour. The neverending green mountains started to look even more verdant and lush.The weather was clear for thousands of miles, blue like a crystal.Bang, bang, bang.At the training grounds in the academy, sounds of punches and kicks could be heard.After exchanging over ten blows, Gu Yue Mo Bei was kicked in the abdomen by Fang Yuan, taking five to six steps backwards, leaving the designated circle drawn in the arena.The martial arts instructor stood before the stage and evaluated the situation. Seeing this, he immediately declared, \"Gu Yue Mo Bei has exited the stage, Gu Yue Fang Yuan wins for the 33rd consecutive time!\"\"Hmph, I lost to you again.\" Gu Yue Mo Bei gritted his teeth, his eyes staring right at Fang Yuan, \"But don\u2019t be arrogant. One day, I will defeat you. I can already feel it, that day is nearing!\"Fang Yuan looked at him expressionlessly, and then his eyelids drooped downwards. \"That kick earlier caused you to have internal bleeding. I\u2019d advise you to treat that injury first.\"\"This small injury is nothing!\" Gu Yue Mo Bei was retorting halfway, when suddenly his expression changed and his throat gulped, vomiting a mouthful of blood.His face was pale, this was the first time he suffered this level of injury! His eyes could not help but show signs of fear.The martial arts instructor hurried over and pacified him. \"Don\u2019t worry about this level of injury, you just need to rest for a few days. Just stop practising your punches and do not do vigorous exercises during this period.\"The moment he finished saying so, two healing Gu Masters who were waiting outside rushed over and meticulously helped Gu Yue Mo Bei out.Gu Yue Mo Bei did not dare to say anything else, but he looked at Fang Yuan deeply in his eyes, filled with anger, hatred, regret and indignance.\"Mo Bei has good martial techniques, but he couldn\u2019t beat Fang Yuan.\"\"Fang Yuan is too good, basically no one can beat him!\"\"Mo Bei actually vomited blood, how scary. I don\u2019t want to fight a guy like this.\"\"Sigh, but the instructor said today is practice combat, up on the arena! Each of us needs to go up and fight once.\"The students stood outside the arena, some looking towards Fang Yuan in fear, some sighing non-stop, some were pale while others felt trepidation.Among them, some were injured. A few held their bruised faces, some held their limbs, gasping for breath. Others laid on the ground, rubbing their thigh.\"Next!\" Seeing that there were no challengers coming up, the instructor yelled.However, no one answered. Usually those who were courageous to challenge Fang Yuan were only Gu Yue Mo Bei, Gu Yue Chi Chen and Gu Yue Fang Zheng. But these three were already beaten.Silence swept across the students as others even retracted their steps slightly. The instructor frowned on seeing their fearful expression.He could not help but think of the academy elder\u2019s words: \"These days, Fang Yuan has gotten too dominant, we have to suppress him. The other students cannot even raise their heads under his pressure, and if this goes on, the courage in their hearts will be simmered. Our academy nurtures courageous tigers and wolves to fight enemies, not fearful sheeps and lambs.\"\"What\u2019s wrong with all of you? No matter how strong he is, Fang Yuan is only fifteen years old, he\u2019s one of your peers! He has the same age as you, eats the same food as you and drinks the same water. He does not have three heads or six arms, he\u2019s not a monster! Pluck up your courage and show me the pride of the Gu Yue clan within you!\" The instructor yelled, trying his best to motivate the students.\"But he is too strong, we cannot beat him.\"\"The classmates who fought him are in such a pitiful state. Mo Bei got beaten until he vomited blood.\"\"Fang Yuan is getting more ruthless with his strikes, instructor, we do not dare to fight him.\"The students spoke softly, weakly retorting.The instructor was stomping with anger. These ignorant youngsters!He was clear as a bystander. Fang Yuan had gone through thirty-three consecutive fights without any rest in the middle. Although he was constantly adjusting his breathing, his stamina had already depleted.Fang Yuan\u2019s attacks getting merciless proves this fact even further: He could no longer take it easy like before, he is losing control of his strength and the situation.If someone tries harder, his fatigue will be revealed. With just a few more people, he could be defeated on the stage!Once Fang Yuan is beaten, his dominating presence will be reduced sharply, the students courage ignited and the motive to suppress Fang Yuan achieved.But now, the students were deterred by Fang Yuan\u2019s tough front.At times, what defeats a person is not a strong enemy but one\u2019s own heart.The instructor was anxious in his thoughts, and continued to motivate them.But he was not good with his words. In the beginning he said these same words to ignite the hot-bloodedness in the youngsters and stirred up some challengers. But now that he had said this so many times, the youngsters are all numb already.Fang Yuan folded his arms and stared at this coldly. Although he was standing in the center of the stage, he was acting like a complete bystander.The instructor encouraged for ages but the students were still looking at each others, not one had moved.The martial instructor could not help but be angry and helpless. He turned to Fang Yuan, unhappily chiding, \"Fang Yuan, you\u2019re also at fault. Your blows are getting more vicious among classmates, you should be more gentle and friendly, how can you deal such vicious blows? Be careful from now on and attack carefully. If you cause another classmate to vomit blood, I will declare your loss and evict you from the stage!\"\"Instructor, you are wrong.\"Fang Yuan snorted, his gaze not showing any weakness, looking right at the instructor, \"Practising and fighting, we naturally have to give it our all, otherwise how can it achieve the aim of training? Don\u2019t tell me that when we are in battle, we also have to request our enemies to be more gentle and friendly?\"The instructor flew into a rage, \"Hmph, your attacks are vicious, you are harming your classmates and you dare to use twisted logic!\"\"Instructor, you\u2019re wrong again.\"Fang Yuan laughed coldly, \"You arranged this practice match and raised the winning prize to twenty primeval stones. Without your encouragement, would these people have gotten hurt?\"\"Bastard!\" The martial arts instructor was not good with words, and he pointed at Fang Yuan and scowled, \"Do you still want the prize or not? If you argue any further, even if you get first place, I will declare you a loser! You are so uncooperative and antisocial, and you dare to argue with your teachers, you have no rights to claim the twenty primeval stones as reward!\"Fang Yuan laughed heartily. \"It is but a competition that merely gives twenty primeval stones, do you think I give a damn?\"Saying so, he turned around and left. Under the class\u2019 distraught gaze, he walked out of the center of arena.Although he did not manage to sell the image wall, Fang Yuan still had several hundreds of primeval stones in his possession. Furthermore, his aim this time was not primeval stones.\"You!\" Seeing Fang Yuan really walking down the stage, the instructor was stunned without words, showing an expression of shock and confusion.A fifteen year old teenager, shouldn\u2019t he be competitive and full of vigor?Fang Yuan having such fighting talents, shouldn\u2019t his character be even more so? How could he just back out of the competition like this?Furthermore, Fang Yuan has no background, he should be tight on primeval stones. Why was the twenty primeval stones unable to attract him?At this point, the martial arts instructor stood on the spot, unsure of what to do.Fang Yuan did not step into the trap, but left the stage immediately.The instructor suddenly realized: There was nothing he could do to Fang Yuan. With his status, he could not find problems with Fang Yuan directly, and force him onto the stage right?The surrounding students retreated, maintaining a distance away from Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan stood on the grounds, with no one around him. With him as the center, the radius of five steps around him became a vacuum.What a pity.If they were beside Fang Yuan, they would hear Fang Yuan\u2019s panting sound.\"My stamina is depleted,\" Fang Yuan sighed. Although he showed an energetic outward appearance, under his clothes, his body was slightly shivering.After all, he was only fifteen years old and had no relevant Gu worm as support. After thirty-three matches, he was close to his limits.Although he had his rich fighting experience from his past life, during this time, the other youngsters\u2019 combat abilities had improved significantly. From them, Fang Yuan could already feel a strengthening sense of pressure.This kind of pressure reflected in Fang Yuan\u2019s attacks. His attacks got tougher as he gradually lost control of his strength. Compared to the past, when they were still too weak and he could defeat them easily, the youngsters would only end up in minor injuries. But now, his control over the arena was getting weaker, thus he had to strike harder to maintain his image.\"Experience is, after all, not omnipotent. Any thoughts or technique require a body with sufficient foundation before the value can be apparent.\" Fang Yuan narrowed his eyes. In actuality he had long seen through the martial instructor\u2019s thoughts.Fang Yuan was not surprised, as if he had expected this from the start, the academy elder\u2019s pressure on him.After he killed Gao Wan, the people who dared to challenge him diminished. When he extorted them, even more people oppressed by Fang Yuan\u2019s dominance did not dare resist, and they obediently handed over their primeval stones.After a long period, Fang Yuan\u2019s unbeatable image would be formed. This would leave some psychological trauma in the youngsters and make them unconfident in their martial arts techniques. This was what the academy elder did not want to see. He needed Fang Yuan to motivate and force the students to improve, not to completely extinguish their passion for battle.He wanted to see Fang Yuan\u2019s defeat.Once Fang Yuan was defeated, the image of invincibility that he had erected would be instantly destroyed.At the same time, it would awaken the students\u2019 fighting spirit. After some setbacks, it would mould their wills to be indomitable.But to Fang Yuan, he needed this form of pressure so that he could extort primeval stones with greater ease.If he was defeated, the youngsters would realize his weakness and attack together at once. Although Fang Yuan had ample of primeval stones in his hands, extortion was his main source of income. Without this source, he would be digging into his reserves.Thus, Fang Yuan\u2019s appearance in the arena and thirty-three consecutive victories was merely to maintain his deterrence towards the students, and not for the twenty primeval stones reward.If he avoided combat from the start, it would show his weakness, and if it raged on, he would expose his weakness.\"What are you all waiting for, why is nobody getting up on the stage, go on! The first prize is twenty primeval stones, you all don\u2019t want it anymore?\" The instructor yelled after snapping out of his thoughts.The rest of the students began to get motivated.Fang Yuan had already left the stage, and to them, it was a huge rock off their minds.\"I\u2019ll go!\"\"I\u2019ll come!\"Two youngsters squeezed their way up the stage and began to spar.\"Sigh, if I had known this, I would have waited and not rushed up the stage. Then I would not have been throw off the stage by Fang Yuan.\"\"What a pity, to think Fang Yuan left.\"\"He\u2019s really daring, see even the instructor is at a lost for what to do with him.\"Hearing their whispers, the instructor felt his reputation crumbling. He was extremely agitated in his heart and wanted to punish Fang Yuan thoroughly. However, Fang Yuan had done nothing wrong, and leaving the stage on his own accord was allowed.The instructor was both helpless and moody. Finally he looked at Fang Yuan and stared angrily at the latter.Fang Yuan\u2019s lips slightly curled up into an angle as he thought, \"Such boorish methods, this instructor is a little cute.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA pair of solemn eyes were staring at the faraway training grounds.The academy elder stood at the window of the third storey, looking at everything that had transpired at the arena.He frowned deeply.The instant Fang Yuan left the stage, he felt a sense of peculiarity in his heart, not expecting Fang Yuan to do this.\"This lad, he is rather hard to catch. He is proficient in the academy\u2019s rules, and normally will not commit any wrongdoings. Although he sleeps in class, once he is asked a question he can answer properly, leaving others with no flaws to pick on. Trying to get ahold of a weakness of his to suppress his dominance is going to be difficult.\"The academy elder could not help but develop a faint sense of loathing towards Fang Yuan.As a teacher, he naturally liked obedient and smart students, and hated those naughty students who did not obey the rules.But being the academy elder for so many years, his experience was extremely rich, he had seen many different types of students. Among them he had seen extremely obedient ones who followed orders without question. There were also those who caused problems day and night, constantly breaking the rules.His heart had already become still as water, impartial to all. At the same time, he carved the phrase \"as a teacher, one must treat all students fairly\" onto the right corner of his desk, treating it as his motto.He had never felt such disgust for a student.Feeling that sense of detest in his heart, the academy elder was also slightly shocked.In previous years, even towards the most naughty students, he was able to handle it with a big heart, tolerating their actions. But when it came to Fang Yuan, why did he lose this sense of impartialness?He thought about it again and again, and finally realized the reason.This lad called Fang Yuan, he had a form of arrogance in his blood!It seemed from the fundamentals that Fang Yuan did not respect his teachers for their status. Towards the martial arts instructor earlier, he not only disobeyed him, but even rebuked him in public.Actually, such cases of retorting against teachers were commonly seen in previous years. However, those kids always had an agitated state of mind. They were either rebellious, furious or stubborn, etc.The academy elder was clear that the more agitated the youngsters were, the more it implied that they were fearful in their hearts.But Fang Yuan was not.He had no fear in his heart at all, as if he had seen through the tricks of the academy.His expression was aloof, and even after he left the stage, his expression showed no signs of changing, as if he had done something insignificant.Yes, he treated the matter of disobeying his teachers as a trivial matter that was insignificant!In simple terms -------He was not afraid.It was just this point that caused the academy elder to already feel unhappy, developing a sense of disgust for him.The academy elder could endure a student more rebellious than Fang Yuan, or a teenager ten times naughtier than him. That was because these students knew fear and were moving based on their agitated emotions.As long as they were fearful, as long as they were impulsive, they would be easily manipulated and will not go out of control.But Fang Yuan was not.He was calm and uncaring, not treating his teachers with reverence.He was not respectful!Someone who has no reverence for the clan, even if they are nurtured, how can they be useful for the clan?\"Once they appear, this sort of person, they have to be suppressed, they must be suppressed! Otherwise, his existence will create a sense of irresistibility in the students. In the long run, it will affect the others, causing them to lose their reverence for their teachers, and as the academy, how else are we going to manage the students?\"The academy elder squinted his eyes, making up the decision in his mind.But then, his face showed a troubled expression very quickly.How was he going to suppress Fang Yuan?Fang Yuan had done nothing wrong, there was no weakness that he could exploit.Fang Yuan\u2019s cunning demeanour gave him a sense of helplessness. He had never met a student like this, one who was so familiar with the academy\u2019s rules and regulations.As the academy elder, he was always impartial to all students. He could not be like a slum gangster and purposely find trouble with a youngster like Fang Yuan.He had placed his hopes on the martial arts instructor, but now he was deeply disappointed.\"It seems that to suppress Fang Yuan\u2019s domination, we can only wait until all the other students advance to Rank one middle stage.\"A Gu Master\u2019s advancement is mostly influenced by their talents.With his rich experience as the academy elder, he had calculated before in his heart: the ones who had the greatest chance to advance first are Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Chi Chen and Mo Bei.They were an A rank and two B grades respectively, and with their elders\u2019 help behind them, they had no lack of primeval stones. No matter which one of the three, they were mostly likely to be the first to advance to Rank one middle stage cultivation.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Chi Chen and Mo Bei, these three are our hopeful seeds this season.\" The academy elder looked at the arena and sighed.With his experienced gaze, he could tell: in the arena, although the students seem to be standing casually, they had subtly already split into three factions.In one circle was Gu Yue Chi Chen and a bunch of similarly-aged clansmen, all crowding around him.The second circle\u2019s core was Gu Yue Fang Zheng, and the clan leader\u2019s faction\u2019s younger generation were subtly supporting this A grade talent genius.The third circle was led by Gu Yue Mo Bei. He had already been treated of his internal injury and stood on the arena with a pale face. The classmates beside him were asking him about his condition.\"This is the meaning of letting them compete with each other.\" Seeing the three factions, the academy elder was overjoyed and laughed.Allowing the students free reign to compete, this was not just to nurture their battle senses, but also to prematurely choose the leader-type characters.In past seasons, they had to wait until the end of the year to have the capacity to develop their own circles. But in this year, because of Fang Yuan\u2019s appearance, his extortion had brought forth the divergence much faster.Against Fang Yuan, the only ones who dared to compete against him were Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Chen.After a long time under imperceptible influence, the other youngsters would automatically regard these three as the leaders.As long as there were no mishaps, these three social circles would be the layout of the future family\u2019s higher-ups.\"But these factions are still not stable. Within them, there are still students moving around. Once the three take the lead and advance to the middle stage first, I will give them the positions of class chairman and vice chairman. With that differentiation, they would gain authority, and this will strengthen their social circles,\" the academy elder thought.Of course, there was someone not within either factions.Just one person, and that was Fang Yuan.Getting close to stronger people is human nature. In fact, although Fang Yuan extorted the students and acted against the students, there were a number of youngsters who wanted to attach themselves to him.However, they were rejected by Fang Yuan. To him, only those who were useful were pawns, and these youngsters had too little value.This was also another reason the academy elder hated Fang Yuan. He was too antisocial, not willing to integrate into the team. To such people like him, the clan\u2019s control over them was not as much as the other youngsters.The academy elder\u2019s gaze once again shot towards Fang Yuan in the arena.Fang Yuan stood alone at one corner with his hands behind his back, his eyelids slightly closed, allowing the students to fight for their prize. Even with the heated competition, his expression did not change the slightest.His surrounding was vacant, no youngster was willing to stand with him.Very evidently, he also did not wish for these people to be near him.Fang Yuan stood there alone, enshrouded in loneliness.He floated outside the factions.\"But I don\u2019t have to be too worried. This Fang Yuan is still young and can be changed slowly.\" The academy elder\u2019s gaze shone and he thought deeply.\"Next up will be the establishment of the class chairman and vice chairman. A year later, we will split into groups, creating team leaders and assistant leaders. Every academic year also has all sorts of honor and rewards, like the Small Redflower Award, Blue Neckcloth Prize and Five Outstanding Student Prize. He wants to cultivate so he needs resources, thus he has to compete for these positions and prizes. As time passes, with interaction among the students, he is bound to have kinship, friendship and love as his restraints. I don\u2019t have to worry about him going beyond the clan\u2019s control.\"These years, the academy elder had gradually understood something.When a new clan member is born, they would be brainwashed by the clan.First, they would be taught the clan\u2019s utmost value system. Next they would go into moral education and learn about the beauty and importance of kinship, friendship, love.After that, they would be taught honor, and in the process of growing up, many resources such as prizes would be used to attract them. Using the family\u2019s assigned roles, they would choose and recruit the most loyal clansmen into their factions.Do not look down on the small roles like chairman or vice chairman, for once they become one of these roles, they would be part of the clan\u2019s administration.Under such a system with constant influence, on one hand it brings about the benefits of having authority and the sweetness of power, while on the other hand, it brings the problem of detaching from the system. A carrot in hand and a stick in the other, who can break away from this system?Even the wildest of people or the most lonesome ones would gradually become a part of the family. One without loyalty would also be nurtured into one with loyalty. Without kinship, friendship or love, they would still be developed.This is the power of the system.This is the power of rules.This is the clan\u2019s way of survival!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moon was like a silver plate, appearing among the clouds. The thinly spread stars decorated the surroundings.Gu Yue Mo Bei stood in the courtyard, raising his head up, his eyes glistening under the reflection of the moon.\"Little brother, I heard you got injured today.\" Behind him, his sister Gu Yue Mo Yan\u2019s voice resounded.\"Sister, you are worried that after being beaten till I vomited blood today, I would have long lasting trauma?\" Mo bei turned around and curled his lips.Seeing her brother laughing, Mo Yan\u2019s heart felt at ease. Although she had truly worried, she said instead, \"No way, big sis here understands you best. Good brother, you have an indomitable will, the future head of our Mo family. How can you be frightened off by such a small injury?\"\"Hehehe, I knew sister doted on me the most,\" Mo Bei scratched the back of his head as he laughed sheepishly.\"You know what, sister?\" Under the glow of the moonlight, this fifteen year old teenager\u2019s eyes radiated brightly. \"Although I failed this time, I heard Fang Yuan panting during the match. Back then he easily beaten me in two or three strikes with an calm and composed manner. But his gasping already revealed his weakness. He is definitely not as strong as everyone else thinks. One day, I will defeat him fair and square.\"\"Good, as expected of a good man from my Mo bloodline!\" Mo Yan laughed, patting her brother\u2019s head, showing concern on her face, \"However, you suffered internal injuries, so please don\u2019t practise your martial arts these few days.\"\"Don\u2019t touch my head sister, I am already old enough.\" Mo Bei shrugged his head, using an unhappy tone, \"I understand what you are saying, I have a plan. These few days, I\u2019m going to nurture my aperture walls. To completely breakthrough from initial stage to middle stage and obtain the position of class chairman, and suppress Fang Yuan\u2019s dominance. I\u2019ll let him know that, what truly matters to a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation is still talent!\"\"I\u2019m glad you can think this way. I was only a vice chairman last time. If you manage to become chairman, it will fulfill my regrets too.\"\"Don\u2019t worry sister. The position of chairman, I certainly must obtain it!\"At the same time, in the Chi family.Inside the secret room, there was only one torch, attached to an opening in the limestone walls.The flame burned on, illuminating this small room.One of the two elders in power, Gu Yue Chi Lian, was sitting facing his grandson, Gu Yue Chi Cheng. The two sat on a praying mat with their shadows projected on the ground, wavering with the flickering of the flame.Gu Yue Chi Lian stretched out his hand, using his palm to touch Chi Cheng\u2019s abdomen area.Gu Yue Chi Chen\u2019s face was full of anxiety, his mind entering his aperture, suppressing the ripples in his primeval sea with all his concentration.In this world, there are no two identical tree leaves. Similarly to Gu Masters, there is no identical primeval essence as well.Once primeval essence from an external source enters the aperture, it will result in the natural resistance of the original primeval essence in the aperture.If Gu Yue Chi Cheng does not suppress it, and instead allows the his primeval essence to resist, it will result in a clash between the essences. Such intensive reaction can cause great damage to the aperture.The aperture\u2019s primeval sea is the foundation and roots of a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation, and is of utmost importance.Once the aperture is damaged, at the very least one\u2019s cultivation may lower, but if it is severe, their latent talent may be lowered as well. Once the aperture is completely shattered, the Gu Master would die immediately.After a while, Gu Yue Chi Lian gradually stopped transmitting his primeval essence, slowly taking back his hand.Gu Yue Chi Cheng took a deep breath of relief, his tense body relaxing. \"Thank you Grandfather, for nurturing my aperture and transfusing primeval essence to me every three days. It has been hard on you!\"Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s forehead was full of sweat, and he sighed and said, \"This is inevitable. Your talent is only C grade, so if we rely on your ability alone to rise to middle stage, it\u2019ll take a long time. The time will usually be twice of a B grade, and four times of an A grade. In such a situation, your talent will be exposed. Thus, even if this method is dangerous, we have to use it.\"\"Grandson understands grandfather\u2019s intentions.\"\"As long as you understand.\" The old man sighed, \"This method also has another sequela. After your aperture has been nurtured by my silver primeval essence, although the silver primeval essence has a greater effect, it is still an external source of primeval essence to you. Henceforth, even if your aperture walls change from a light wall to a water wall, it would still be mixed with my energy. The more external energy there is, the more impure your aperture will be, and this will stifle your talent, limiting your development in the future.\"Gu Yue Chi Cheng bit his lips, \"Grandfather, for the future of the Chi family, I am willing to sacrifice my future prospects!\"Gu Yue Chi Lian was pleased, stroking his beard. \"It is good that you have such thoughts. But the heavens always leave a glimmer of hope for you, for you are not hopeless yet. If we can find the Cleansing Water Gu, it will be able to cleanse your aperture walls and flush out all the external energies in your aperture sea, removing this sequela.\"\"In addition, I have also used my relationships to search for a Liquor worm for you. This worm is able to help a Rank one Gu Master refine their primeval essence and raise it by one small realm. In this way the primeval essence that is refined will be your body\u2019s own primeval essence and not an external one. Using this way to nurture your aperture leaves no repercussions and risks, it is a much better nurturing effect!\"Gu Yue Chi Lian was overjoyed. \"Thank you grandfather!\"\"However, the Liquor worm is hard to find. Among the Rank one Gu worms, the Liquor worm, boar Gu, and Bookworm etc, are all extremely rare Gu. Once they appear in the market they would be snatched up immediately. Of course, there are also some Gu in this world that are rumored to change a Gu Master\u2019s talent. But at this age, grandfather has never seen one, only hearing occasional rumors about them.\" The old man explained.The night winds blew in gently from the windows and into the room.Gu Yue Fang Zheng sat on his bed with his eyes shut, holding a primeval stone in both hands.The green copper primeval sea was raging without any winds, the waves crashing towards the white aperture walls.He has A grade rank talent, and his primeval essence occupied 80% of the aperture. His natural rate of recovery was twice of Fang Yuan!With such godblessed advantage, he is already close to Rank one middle stage.Phew.A while later, Gu Yue Fang Zheng puffed out a breath of air and opened his eyes.The moon was bright and stars sparse outside the window, the bluish green bamboo houses arranged in a line.A scene of peace and harmony.\"Time always flies when cultivating. In the blink of an eye, it is already late into the night,\" Fang Zheng muttered softly. He slowly opened his hands, and two piles of rock powder fell onto the floor in front of his bed.After a primeval stone\u2019s essence had been fully retrieved, it would turn into a pile of powder.Looking at the powder pile, Fang Zheng frowned.He took out his money bag; it was already close to empty.Opening it, he saw three primeval stones left inside.Fang Zheng would retrieve three pieces every seven days from the academy as resources, but since Fang Yuan would snatch a piece from him, he only had two left every week.Uncle and Aunt would also give him living expenses, but it was also three stones every seven days.Just with these primeval stones, how is it enough?Fang Zheng was determined to surpass his brother Fang Yuan, thus he took the initiative to approach his uncle and aunt multiple times to beg for some primeval stones.After many times, his aunt would look for him to have a heart-to-heart chat, telling him about how poor the family was, and how they had cash flow difficulties, having no spare money left. Since then, Fang Zheng did not have the desire to continue asking.\"Father and mother are already doing all they can to support my cultivation. I cannot make things difficult for them and ask for more primeval stones. I only have three left. I can only be more thrifty. If I use one piece a day, I\u2019ll have enough for three days.\"\"I have a feeling that in three or four days, I will definitely advance to middle stage! The only thing is, what is big brother\u2019s progress now?\" Thinking so, Fang Zheng subconsciously looked towards to academy living quarters.\"I have A grade talent, while big brother only has C grade talent. His speed is definitely slower than me. Big brother is not my match this time! Big brother, I will let you know the true power of an A grade talent!\"Thinking of this, Fang Zheng clenched his fists.\u2026...Academy dormitory.Fang Yuan\u2019s door was shut tight.In the darkness, he was not asleep, but sitting on his bed.A Gu Master\u2019s cultivation cannot replace sleep. Normally at this time, Fang Yuan would already have fallen asleep.But in cultivating earlier today, he already felt that he was just one step away from middle stage.\"I might as well not sleep tonight, I\u2019ll rush straight for middle stage!\" His eyes shone with determination.Soon after, he shut his eyes and his mind went into the aperture.44% of green copper primeval sea. Just a moment ago, they were all refined into pale green coloured middle stage primeval essence by the liquor worm.\"Rise.\" With a thought, the peaceful green copper primeval sea began to stir.The commotion got larger and larger, until waves were formed.Splash, splash, splash...The tides raced against each other, rushing towards the surrounding aperture walls.Like crashing on a reef, most of the primeval essence would break into emerald ripples and fuse back into the sea.A small amount of primeval essence was expended, turning into a small hint of invisible energy, penetrating into the white coloured light aperture wall.\"Rise again,\" Fang Yuan thought as the emerald ripples became larger in scale. The waves earlier were like rabbits and dogs, but now they were like troops of horses, marching towards the aperture walls.A horse-like dragon, the waves like the heavens!The primeval essence was expended quickly, and the water level fell sharply.Splash, splash, splash...The waves struck relentlessly, finally resulting in a change. The white coloured wall shook suddenly, the originally mild white colour radiating an eye-piercing brilliance.Seeing this scene, Fang Yuan was overjoyed as he knew that the crucial part had arrived, and he quickly activated all of his primeval essence to rush at the walls.The white light grew brighter, the light rays distorted and tangling together, giving people a feeling of thickness. After more than ten breaths, white strips of light bands appeared on the light wall, and the strips collided with each other like water flowing nonstop. In the process of collision, they continued to combine and merge, forming a white flowing light.Finally, the flowing light gathered into one piece and completely covered the light wall.The white light dimmed, and the original white light wall of the aperture was gone, replaced by a layer of spherical shaped white water wall. The light wall\u2019s surface was smooth with no impurities. The water wall however, was thicker than the light wall, the ripples of light flowing and flickering on it.The primeval sea regained its peace, the aperture still having 20% primeval essence left.\"I advanced to middle stage!\" Fang Yuan laughed heartily, opening his eyes.The bright sunlight creeped in through the openings in the curtains.Unknowingly, the night had passed, and it was already morning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look guys, his seat is empty.\"\"He\u2019s so bold! Today\u2019s lesson is taught by the academy elder, yet he dared to not show up.\"\"This is bad, the elder\u2019s expression is ugly, it seems that Fang Yuan is in trouble. Hehehe.\"In the academy, the youngsters discussed softly. A few glanced towards Fang Yuan\u2019s empty seat, as well as the academy elder\u2019s darkening expression. Ever since he started the extortion, Fang Yuan stood against everyone in the class. Seeing him in trouble, all the students were excited for what was to come.The academy elder\u2019s expression was stiff as he explained the crux of nurturing the aperture while secretly staring at Fang Yuan\u2019s seat.He laughed coldly in his heart, \"Fang Yuan, oh Fang Yuan. I was still worried about not being able to catch your weak point yesterday, and here you give it to me today. You are after all a fifteen year old teenager, I have overestimated you.\"His ugly expression was mostly fake. His motive was to use this opportunity to find trouble with Fang Yuan and punish him, eliminating his increasing dominance in class. Undeniably, as time passed, Fang Yuan\u2019s dominating presence was getting stronger, causing the other students to be barely catching their breaths.A one-sided dominance was not what the academy elder wanted to see. He wanted to see the entire class shining.\"Men!\" The academy elder raised a finger and knocked lightly on the table.\"Elder, your subjects are here.\" The two guards standing outside at the door entered.The academy elder snorted in public, \"This Fang Yuan is getting out of hand, being so lazy and skipping classes right under my nose. Go to the hostel and bring him here for me.\"\"Yes, elder.\" The guards went on their way. Seeing the guards disappear outside the door, the academy burst into discussion noises.Numerous students joined in the conversation.\"Fang Yuan is in deep shit now,\" someone said with his eyes shining brightly.\"Hehe, we have a show to watch later.\" Another laughed in pleasure towards Fang Yuan\u2019s misery.\"Big brother, you are too arrogant. This is challenging the elder\u2019s authority. No matter what punishment it is, you had it coming.\" Gu Yue Fang Zheng looked at the empty seat, sighing internally.Bam, bam, bam!The academy elder with a strict expression, slammed the desk thrice, \"Silence, no talking in class!\"His aura at this moment was like a volcano about to erupt, causing fear in others.Immediately, the academy fell into pin-drop silence. The students fearfully shut up, quickly getting into position. Except, although their expression was so, their thoughts were already deep into this matter.The class continued, the youngsters not concentrating at all.A few students by the window looked out constantly.As time passed, after a while, footsteps could be heard at the door. Instantly the students\u2019 ears twitched, tens of eyes showing bright expressions.\"Arriving...\" The academy elder heard the footsteps too and narrowed his eyes as a result.He had already thought of how to deal with Fang Yuan. He\u2019ll punish him to stand outside for three hours.Although the punishment was not heavy, it was enough for him to be humiliated.Throughout lessons, students entering and leaving would see Fang Yuan standing there.This way, it would ruin Fang Yuan\u2019s image of invincibility. When the students realize that Fang Yuan was nothing special, the impact he has on them would be greatly reduced. This would result in them gaining courage and stir their competitive spirit.The great part was, since Fang Yuan\u2019s punishment came from the academy, this would improve the academy\u2019s reputation.Only with reverence will they obey.Thus, while the method is simple, it has deep intentions underneath.The footsteps got closer, and finally someone stood outside the door.Knock, knock, knock.Knocking sounds could be heard.\"Hehe, I will open it!\" The student near the door volunteered and enthusiastically went to open the door.The academy quietened down, numerous eyes staring at the door.Crack.The door was easily opened by the student, exposing a gap.Sunlight infiltrated from the gap. The student opening the door suddenly froze, shuddering suddenly.\"AHH!!!\" He was stunned for a second before suddenly screaming, subconsciously taking a large step backwards. His body knocked onto the desk and he instantly lost his balance, falling with the table onto the ground.The boy\u2019s face was pale, his expression horrified, limbs trembling and unable to exert strength. Lying on the floor, he frantically tried to get up, but fell back down again and again.\"What\u2019s wrong?!\" In a moment everyone was astonished, all of them frowning deeply.Numerous gazes curiously looked towards the door.The door was slowly pushed opened by the person outside.The academy elder stopped his lecture out of reflex.What everyone saw first, was a hand on the door.A teenager\u2019s left hand.A left hand with dripping blood.A bloody hand!Seeing this bloody hand, many of the female students covered their mouths and screamed in terror.The door slowly opened fully.The brightness of the sunlight pricked everyone\u2019s eyes, causing them to squint. With the bright sunlight as his background, a dark shadow attached to a thin teenager appeared before everyone.He didn\u2019t know why, but the academy elder felt a strong feeling of unease in his heart.\"It\u2019s Fang Yuan!\" Someone screamed out loudly.Everyone who had gotten used to the sunlight could clearly see who the person was.What met their eyes was Fang Yuan, bathed in blood, standing outside the door as if he had gone through an intense battle.His left hand slowly retracted, his right hand grabbing onto some hair, dragging along a person. The person\u2019s left arm was entirely detached from the base. He was lying there motionless, evidently unconscious. Blood on his left shoulder gushed out.\"It\u2019s one of the guards who went to look for Fang Yuan!\" Someone recognised the person\u2019s identity.\"What exactly happened?\" Someone was going berserk.\"He murdered again, this time he killed the guards!\" Someone pointed at Fang Yuan, screaming in horror, getting louder and louder, as if it would purge the terror and fear in his heart.At once, the academy was rowdy.Many students forgot the rules at this time, and stood up from their seats. They looked towards Fang Yuan with fear, shock, and nervous expressions.In their imaginations, Fang Yuan would be dragged here by the guards left and right.But the truth was \u2014\u2014 Fang Yuan bathed in blood, his expression cool like a devil approaching. The two guards, one missing while the other lying motionless, blood oozing from his body quickly forming a puddle.A thick scent of blood permeated the academy.The academy elder was stunned, he did not anticipate such a scene!After his shock, came intense rage.The two guards were merely external martial artists. So what if they died? The academy elder did not really care.But the crucial point was their identity. They were the academy\u2019s guards, representing the academy\u2019s prestige. Representing the academy elder\u2019s face.This Fang Yuan was simply too bold. Not only did he kill Gao Wan, now he even went and murdered the academy\u2019s guards!No, this isn\u2019t just being bold. He was practically provoking, challenging the clan academy\u2019s prestige.The academy elder flew into a rage, pointing at Fang Yuan, screaming, \"Fang Yuan! What is this? You have to give me an explanation, a good reason to spare you. If not, with the crime of murdering the guards, you will be thrown in jail, awaiting the clan verdict!\"The students all shuddered.Even the windows trembled, the entire academy reverbing with the academy elder\u2019s screams.Only Fang Yuan was calm-looking, his eyes dyed a deep miasma, behaving like usual, unable to see any change in his emotions.After looking around, Fang Yuan let go of his right arm, and with a plop, the guard\u2019s head fell into the puddle of blood, splashing onto Fang Yuan\u2019s pants.He cupped his fists towards the academy elder, his calm voice echoing throughout the silent academy, \"Academy Elder, I truly have something to report.\"\"Speak.\" The academy elder spoke with both arms behind his back, arching his head as he looked at Fang Yuan, his expression ice cold.Laughing coldly in his heart, he thought, \"Fang Yuan, you\u2019re making more and more mistakes, increasing the severity. I\u2019ll see how you\u2019re going to explain yourself!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the academy elder with a stern expression, with his finger pointing towards the fainted guard.\"Reporting to elder, these two guards had impure motives, devious intentions! They broke into my room when I was at the crucial moment of breaking through into the middle stage. As everyone knows, a Gu Master cultivating cannot be interrupted. Especially so when one is trying to break through into higher realms. A moment of distraction would not only cause the breakthrough to fail, but their aperture would also get damaged. Thankfully my luck was good, because at the moment where they barged in, I had already stepped into the middle stage.\"\"However!\" Before the masses had reacted, Fang Yuan continued, \"These two did not admit their mistakes earlier. To my surprise, they boasted shamelessly about wanting to get rough with me, even scolding our clan\u2019s ancestors, lying that the act of disturbing my cultivation was the esteemed elder\u2019s decision. Your student did not believe so, and resisted furiously. These two had strong martial arts, and I had to fight for life before finally defeating these two people.\"\"But seeing as they were the academy guards, your student did not kill them immediately. I merely cut off one of his arms, and the leg of the other person. Although there was quite some blood loss, they are still alive. That is my report for this matter, please uphold justice for me, esteemed elder!\" Having said so, he cupped his fists towards the academy elder.His tone was urgent, saying a ton of information, and leaving no room for others to interrupt.After he had finished, the surrounding people slowly started to react.\"What did Fang Yuan say earlier, I did not catch it.\"\"I think he said he advanced to the middle stage!\"\"How is that possible, he is just a C grade trash, to think that he actually advanced to the middle stage first.\"\"He definitely lied, he is afraid of the academy\u2019s punishment, thus he lied!\"The students discussed loudly.When compared to Fang Yuan\u2019s advancement to the middle stage, the two guards\u2019 lives no longer mattered.They were not Gu Yue clan members, who cares if they\u2019re dead or alive?\"You said you advanced to Rank one middle stage?\" The academy elder\u2019s voice was ice cold, his expression unforgiving. \"Fang Yuan, this is not a laughing matter. If you admit your wrongdoing now, I can still take into account that this is your first mistake and deal with you leniently. If you want to continue lying and attempting to cover up your mistakes, then I can tell you now, lies are easily seen through.\"Fang Yuan did not explain himself further, he laughed lightly and said to the academy elder, \"Please inspect, elder.\"Even without his words, the academy elder had already moved forward.He placed his hand on Fang Yuan\u2019s abdomen, placing a trace of his spirit into it. Immediately he saw the inside of Fang Yuan\u2019s aperture.Within the aperture, there was no Gu.The Spring Autumn Cicada had already hidden itself. A Rank six Gu is way superior than a Rank three academy elder, so if it wanted to hide, it would not be found easily.As for the Liquor worm, Fang Yuan had placed it into the dormitory\u2019s wine reserves, and did not bring it along.The academy elder with his eyes shut, could see a green copper primeval sea, calm as still water.Drops of primeval essence inside were all emerald green colours of middle stage primeval essence.Seeing the aperture walls, the white coloured aperture walls were glowing with reflected light as if they were all made of water. Gushes of water flow rapidly moved along the wall.Water wall!\"He really advanced to the middle stage, how is this possible?!\" The academy elder shouted in his heart, a sign of shock under his calm expression. But he tried to hide it to the best of his ability, his face still expressionless.A moment later, after he had digested this fact, he drew back his hand, speaking in a solemn voice, \"It is indeed middle stage.\"The students had been holding their breaths, awaiting the results.The academy elder\u2019s verdict caused a huge commotion in the academy.The students were full of bewilderment and shock, each of their faces showing immense disbelief.Fang Yuan was only a C grade, but yet he was the first to breakthrough into the middle stage, this was against common sense!For a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation and breaking through realms, the most important aspect should be talent. How is this possible, a C grade was the first to advance? How would this make those A grade, B grades feel!\"This!\" Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s face was pale. He was still confident last night, but now that reality sat in front of him, he was unable to accept such a fact and fell to the ground.Gu Yue Mo Bei clenched his fists, and Gu Yue Chi Chen hatefully gritted his teeth.The academy elder could not be easily fooled, so how did Fang Yuan manage to do it?At once, all the youngsters stared at Fang Yuan, having one question in their hearts \u2014\u2014 with that C grade talent, how did he advance?The academy elder\u2019s heart was similarly full of doubt.Under such great empuzzlement, he ignored the idea of suppressing Fang Yuan and asked directly, \"Fang Yuan, I hope you can explain this, how did you manage to advance to middle stage.\"Fang Yuan laughed silently, \"Heaven rewards the hard-working, and as a result of student\u2019s persistent training, I managed to advance smoothly.\"\"Lies!\"\"Tsk, if heaven rewarded the hard-working, I\u2019d be first long ago!\"\"Diligently studying and training? Some time ago, I still saw him strolling around the shop district.\"The students were evidently not satisfied with such an answer.\"Is that so?\" The academy elder replied neutrally, his gaze staring at Fang Yuan, emitting pressure.Fang Yuan\u2019s expression was candid, making eye contact with the elder without fear.His body was bathed in blood, his linen shirt messy, as if he had gone through an intense battle.A pair of black abyss-like eyes, showing a kind of peacefulness, indifference, and even hiding a hint of amusement.Seeing such a gaze, the academy elder\u2019s heart wavered.\"This Fang Yuan, he is not afraid, not fearful, not threatened, and not shocked, how can he be interrogated by me right here? With his C grade talent, being the first to advance to middle stage, there has to be a secret. But since he does not want to say it, as the academy elder, I cannot forcefully interrogate him. It seems I can only investigate this privately.\"Thinking of this, the academy elder retracted his gaze and his cold expression became milder.Fang Yuan however did not let the matter go, \"Your student is frightened, esteemed elder. How are you going to deal with these two guards? They have lost a lot of blood, if they are not treated soon, they might die.\"\"Frightened? You?\" The academy elder retorted in his mind. His brows frowned deeply.At this point, as the person in charge of the academy, he had to step forward and settle this.\"But how should I resolve this?\" The academy elder could not help but feel troubled.He silently began to think.Fang Yuan took all of the academy elder\u2019s change in expressions into consideration. He laughed internally; the academy elder must be really troubled now.These two guards, they were merely outsiders, their lives cheap as grass. In normal times, no one would care if they died.But now the situation was different, they were sent out by the academy elder. If they really died, the academy elder would lose his reputation!Thus, the guards could not die, the academy elder is going to save them.The part that truly troubles the academy elder is Fang Yuan\u2019s verdict.In his original plan, Fang Yuan first played truant, and then killed the guards. This could be said to be defying his teachers, being arrogant and self-centered. According to the clan rules, he\u2019d be thrown into the clan jail, reflecting upon his mistakes inside.But when adding in the matter of Fang Yuan\u2019s advancement to middle stage, these wrongdoings became very different.Fang Yuan played truant and killed the guards because he was cultivating. This was reasonable.The crucial part was, he was successful in advancing to the middle stage, and became the first in this class. This allowed him to be on the side of reason.Just what did Fang Yuan rely on to advance to middle stage, this secret would be discussed later.Winners win all, losers lose all, the world only cares about result. No one would reprimand such an outstanding junior.The academy elder could not execute any punishments on him.What is the academy for? It is to nurture outstanding Gu Masters, and inject fresh blood into the clan.Now that we have such an aspiring young man, you as the academy elder still wants to find trouble with him? That would be neglecting your role!Just like a student who got good results, as a teacher he should be encouraging and praising him, instead of punishing and criticizing. A teacher who punishes and scolds a student for his good results is not one that would ever be recognised.Perhaps the other elders would secretly cause problems for Fang Yuan because they fear Fang Yuan\u2019s future prospects, or because of grudges and past grievances. But him alone, the esteemed academy elder, cannot do such a thing!Because he is in charge of the academy, he has to be impartial, at least on the surface.These are the rules!\"Do I just let him go like this? It was not easy finding a weakness of his.\" The academy elder was indignant. He knew in his heart that all the youngsters in the academy were merely spectators of this matter.They can only look at the matter as entertainment, but are unable to see the crucial point in this, they are unable to experience the excitement in this battle!The truth is, this is the one time where he as the academy elder, was battling against Fang Yuan the student.First he grabbed hold of the rules, and was bent on punishing Fang Yuan, removing his strong image in front of the other students.Next, Fang Yuan retaliated! His actions may seem rash, but it hit the matter on the point, and with the excuse of advancing to the middle stage, he got back his argument.As for those two unlucky guards, they were merely sacrificial pawns who were implicated by the two\u2019s battle of wits.\"This Fang Yuan, he is too cunning! If he had really killed the two guards, I can still retaliate against him with this reason. Although his talent is lackluster, with such a meticulous and experienced method, it is hard to believe that he is just a fifteen year old. The worst part is, I cannot retaliate. No wonder back in those days, the clan had rumors about his early awakened intelligence!\" The academy elder suddenly realised, he had lost.His loss was due to his status, he was the elder in charge of the academy.This was both his strength and weakness.One\u2019s strength is also one\u2019s weakness.Fang Yuan had understood this logic long ago!The academy elder was both helpless and frustrated.He had asked Fang Yuan to explain, and in actuality Fang Yuan\u2019s explanation was full of loopholes and easily exposable.These guards were chosen by the academy elder himself, they would not be so rash and retarded to scold the Gu Yue ancestors.Fang Yuan\u2019s words were on purpose, it was blatant accusation, framing and laying a trap in front of the other party!The academy elder was clear of this, but he knew that he could not pursue the matter.This was a trap.Once he looked into it, the truth would be revealed, and how would he handle this matter?If he did not punish Fang Yuan, the two guards would be pitifully framed, and as the academy elder, if he does not handle things impartially, how can anyone trust him?If he punished Fang Yuan, that would be suppressing and displaying jealousy of the talented! To suppress a junior of the clan for two servants who were not part of the clan, this matter would trigger the unhappiness of the clansmen.Thus, the best way to resolve this was to pretend to not see anything, and treat these two guards as discarded pieces. Admitting that they had performed a huge mistake, as well as praising Fang Yuan.This way, the clansmen would be satisfied, and the deceived guards, without additional information, would think of this as being impartial.If he handled the matter like this, it would give the academy elder the largest benefit.Logic told the academy elder that this is the way to handle it. But emotionally, he could not take it lying down.This Fang Yuan was too devious!The academy elder not only failed to suppress Fang Yuan, but he himself became the stepping stone for Fang Yuan, getting humiliated in public!Fang Yuan did not show the slightest respect for him and dared to oppose him like this in public, causing this esteemed academy elder to suffer such humiliation and frustration.The point was, in future if these two guards felt indignant and wanted to reveal the truth, as the academy elder, if he wanted to maintain his image and position, he would have to be the first to step up and suppress them.But this was all caused by Fang Yuan!What sort of feeling is this?For example, it would be like Fang Yuan pooping on the academy elder\u2019s face, but the elder himself still has to praise him and at the same time, clean his butt for him. If anyone wanted to point out that there was poop on his face, he has to be the first to shut that person up.This feeling of grievance, it was almost unbearable for the academy elder.There was a growing urge in his heart to give Fang Yuan a few tight slaps!But finally, the academy elder stretched out his arm and patted Fang Yuan\u2019s shoulder.\"Good lad.\" The academy elder\u2019s face was dim like stillwater, forcing the words out of his mouth.\"It is all thanks to the academy\u2019s nurturing,\" Fang Yuan replied plainly.The corner of the academy elder\u2019s eye twitched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Fang Yuan, you are appointed as class chairmanTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowEverything was going according to Fang Yuan\u2019s calculations.Thereafter, the academy elder ordered the healing Gu Master to save the two guards.The guards were saved, but they had suffered heavy injuries and were almost crippled, ending up getting fired from the academy by the elder.Fang Yuan did not receive any punishments, on the contrary he received compliments thoroughly.This result caused much fear in the other youngsters.But this issue was far from over. As time flowed, the commotion spread to the rest of the clan.Fang Yuan being the first to advance to the middle stage with his C grade talent became the after-meal gossip of the entire clan.After meals and tea breaks, everyone was discussing this matter.Subsequent to the initial peculiarity, everyone started to guess the secret behind Fang Yuan\u2019s quick advancement.\"Actually, with a C grade talent, surpassing A grade and B grade to advance first into middle stage is not something that strange.\"\"True, there are many methods in this world that can achieve such a thing.\"\"Take the Relic Gu for example. Once this Gu is used, the aperture walls would be enhanced and it will assist the cultivation to rise by a small realm, being the easiest method of breaking through.\"...At once, the crowd\u2019s discussion evolved into all sorts of possible answers and methods.As for theories about Liquor worms and external sources of primeval essence, these ideas were also naturally brought up by by many people.If Fang Yuan revealed the existence of the Liquor worm at the start, there would not have been such a commotion. But because he hid it, this resulted in the curiosity of many people being raised.Although it appeared peaceful, Gu Yue village had an undercurrent brewing.Numerous eyes were watching the academy elder, all waiting for his explanation.As the academy elder, if he did not know how a student that he had taught himself had advanced, that would be negligence of his role.Thus, the academy elder had to give an explanation.Days passed by.The second youngster to breakthrough the initial stage and advance to middle stage appeared.It was Gu Yue Mo Bei.Soon after, with just a three hour difference, Gu Yue Fang Zheng advanced too.He was after all, dragged down by the lack of primeval stones. Of course, there was also the reason of him being traumatised by Fang Yuan.The third was Gu Yue Chi Chen.Even if he had Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s infused primeval essence, the method\u2019s effectiveness was not very high and could only be performed once every three days, adding to the fact that it was very risky. But with his C grade talent, getting third position was already a success.On the fifth day, the academy elder once again handed out subsidies.\"Gu Yue Fang Yuan.\" He stood at the front, calling out Fang Yuan\u2019s name first.Fang Yuan stood up and walked towards him with a plain expression.The youngsters\u2019 attention was on him as he moved, revealing all sorts of envy, jealousy, inspection, and hatred, not one was the same.\"Today, the elder is not only handing out resources, he is also appointing the chairman and vice chairman positions!\"\"As expected, the first to be called up was Fang Yuan.\"\"He is the first to advance, the title of chairman belongs to him.\"\"It is hard to imagine that this would be the result. Before this, I thought it would be Fang Zheng who would come first.\"\"He was the first to advance to middle stage, it is so peculiar, there has to be a huge secret, but he refuses to tell us!\"\"Hehe, if it was me I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone either. Keep quiet and prosper.\"As the students conversed, Fang Yuan arrived in front of the academy elder.\"Gu Yue Fang Yuan, you are the first Gu Master to reach Rank one middle stage in this class, so this is your reward.\" Saying so, he handed him a white and blue money bag.Fang Yuan received the money bag and opened it in public, peeking inside.\"Be rest assured, there\u2019s a total of thirty primeval stones inside, the academy would not shortchange you.\" The academy elder smiled.Frankly speaking, he would never have expected that the first youngster to advance to middle stage would be Fang Yuan.However, Fang Yuan did not listen to the academy elder. He rarely trusted others, and only believed in himself. He checked carefully and found that it was indeed thirty primeval stones, not one less. He then placed the money bag into his bosom pocket.The academy elder upon seeing this action, thought that his finances were tight, and could not help but smile even more brightly.\"I guessed so, he is after all a C grade talent. Rushing to the middle stage, his primeval stone expenditure had to be huge. He has no funding from anyone as well, thus he has to be tight on primeval stones. As long as he has a need for primeval stones, we\u2019ll not be afraid of him leaving the control of the clan. Once he enters the clan\u2019s system, he would not be able to keep that secret, so even if we can\u2019t investigate it, one day, he will tell us.\" Towards this, the academy elder was full of confidence.The truth is, after that day, he had sent people to investigate Fang Yuan in secret. Almost everyday there would be progress in the search.But evidently, those people had not found out that Fang Yuan has a few hundred primeval stones in his possession, and was actually rather rich.The academy elder continued and said, \"Fang Yuan, you are the first to step into Rank one middle stage, and according to the academy rules, you not only will receive thirty primeval stones as reward, but you will also gain priority in choosing your second Gu soon after. Right now, I shall appoint you as class chairman!\"\"Fang Yuan was appointed as chairman after all!\" Upon hearing this, a few students sighed.\"Damn it.\" Gu Yue Mo Bei gritted his teeth, feeling indignant.\"Hmph!\" Gu Yue Chi Chen crossed his limbs, staring at the scene coldly.The one that was affected the most was Fang Yuan\u2019s brother, Gu Yue Fang Zheng.His face was pale, and his expression looked uncertain, a dark cloud looming over his head. \"Ordinary students, upon seeing the chairman and vice chairmen, have to bow and pay respects. With my results, I will definitely be a vice chairman. But from now on when I see big brother, I\u2019ll have to pay my respects to him.\"\"Hold on.\"But at this moment, Fang Yuan spoke.He smiled faintly to the academy elder and said slowly, \"Esteemed elder, your student here is not gifted and does not have high wisdom, hence being unable to properly take on the role of chairman. This role, should be given to talented people.\"\"What? You mean you do not want to be chairman? As the chairman, you\u2019ll get ten primeval stones every time. Are you sure you want to reject it?\" The academy elder frowned deeply as he spoke. For the last tens of years of teaching, he had not seen anyone reject this position!Actually he had already given much thought about this matter, and letting Fang Yuan be class chairman had its merits.Once he was the chairman, he would be inside the clan system. Fang Yuan will have to carry out his duties at the same time while enjoying his treatment.No matter what the chairman\u2019s role was, the least he had to do was to stop extorting his classmates.This was definitely not something a class chairman can do.This is like before, even though the academy elder was humiliated by Fang Yuan, he still had to praise him for his excellent cultivation results.As someone bound by the system, he would not be able to do as he pleases when handling matters, and many times he\u2019d be left with no choice.Of course, this was not because the academy elder was displeased with Fang Yuan extorting so many primeval stones every time.He was thinking for the entire board of students. Once Fang Yuan becomes chairman and stops extorting, this would allow the other teenagers to have a breather under Fang Yuan\u2019s pressure.Next, with some push of a hand, it would result in a multiway competition among the families. As long as he can nurture the clan\u2019s hopeful seeds - Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Chen, what is the cost of sacrificing a small role of a chairman?And yet, although he had a good plan, the truth was very different from what he expected.Fang Yuan rejected it!He actually rejected it!!Although this position is small, it is the first representation of honor among these hot-blooded youngsters.Besides honor, as the chairman, they get ten primeval stones as resources each time!This temptation, no youngster has ever resisted it before.But Fang Yuan actually rejected.Fang Yuan looked at the stunned elder, and asked him back, \"Did the academy rules state that the first has to be chairman? The position of chairman, is it irrefusable?\"The academy elder replied with a cold expression, \"Of course there are no such heartless rules.\"Fang Yuan laughed, \"Thank you elder for your understanding.\"Saying so, he cupped his fists and walked back to his seat.The students who saw this scene with their own eyes all flew into a commotion.At once, the academy was lively!\"Fang Yuan actually rejected it? Are you kidding me?!\"\"Is he sick in the head?\"\"Not sure why he\u2019s acting crazy, but hehe, he\u2019s gonna regret this later.\"...\"Fang Yuan gave up on being chairman, this means I am the chairman?!\" Happiness came too quickly, and the second place Mo Bei could not react in time.Chi Chen showed a look of disbelief, he was unable to comprehend that someone actually gave up the spot of chairman, he has to be beyond stupid!\"Big brother\u2026\" Fang Zheng stared with huge eyes as he looked at Fang Yuan disappointedly.According to his results, Fang Zheng was assured to be vice chairman.But when Fang Yuan gave up the position, Fang Zheng felt that this position no longer had any meaning.The academy elder\u2019s face was dark this time, really really dark.The last time when Fang Yuan skipped class, although he looked angry, it was just an act for the others to see.But this time, he was in a bad mood, worse than before.Fang Yuan gave up the position of chairman. This means he is rejecting the clan system. The elder had governed the academy for tens of years, but this was the first time he saw such a student, rejecting this huge temptation!He wanted to invite Fang Yuan into the trap, but since he wouldn\u2019t enter, the academy elder was helpless....The giving out of subsidies ended.Mo Bei claimed the position of chairman with his result of being second. Fang Zheng and Chi Chen each became vice chairman.The class chairman was given ten primeval stones. The vice chairmen got five.A few students who were not from well-to-do families were so envious that they almost drooled when seeing the three students\u2019 primeval stones.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: But I am the class chairman!Translator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe wheel of red fire, the sun slowly sank down on the west side of the mountain range.Its light was not eye-piercing, but it was a sort of bright and gentle ray.The west sky was dyed a shade of blushful red, the sunset glow continuously spreading out. It was just like an imperial concubine who had just been rewarded, happily crowding around the emperor, wanting to sleep together with him. (1)Qing Mao Mountain was engulfed entirely in a sea of rose red colour. Each of the tall-pillared buildings and houses were also draped over with a layer of golden yarn.The surrounding forest planted around the academy seemed like it was wiped with a faint stratum of oil. The wind blew slowly, and as the students walked out of the classroom with their bosoms carrying the primeval stones that were just passed out, they were in a relaxed and calm state of mind.\"I really don\u2019t know what Fang Yuan is thinking, to actually give up on the role of class chairman!\"\"Heh heh heh, his brain is fried. I bet he thinks of killing people all day, let\u2019s not concern ourselves with this kind of crazy guy.\"\"Come to think of it, that day when he burst into the academy I was really freaked out. It was just so terrifying, I had a nightmare on the day itself after I went home.\"The students were in groups of twos and threes as they walked.\"Good day class chairman.\"\"Mmm.\"\"Greetings class chairman.\"\"Mhmm.\"Gu Yue Mo Bei swaggered around as he walked, and wherever he went the students would bow and greet him without exception.His face was unable to stifle the expressions of excitement and infatuation.This was the fascination of authority itself.Even if it was just a tiny bit of difference in status, it could also make a person even more confident in his own self worth.Right now as the dying sun looked as red as blood, Mo Bei watched it while his heart sang, \"How is it that I have never realised before, this sunset\u2019s rosiness sure is adorable\u2026\"\"Hmph, going head over heels just because of becoming a chairman, as if it\u2019s so amazing.\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng purposely walked behind, since he just didn\u2019t want to greet Gu Yue Mo Bei at all.\"I really have no idea what Fang Yuan is thinking about, to think he actually let go of the position of chairman. However it\u2019s also a good thing, or else me as the third, how could I have been able to obtain the role of vice chairman?\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng was confused in his heart, but he also felt happiness and relief.\"Good day vice chairman.\" At this moment a normal student walked past him and immediately bowed to greet him.\"Heh heh, good day to you too.\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng instantly nodded, his face full of smiles.Once the student was gone, Chi Cheng naturally thought, \"The taste of vice chairman is rather pleasant. I\u2019m sure the feeling of being the class chairman is even better. If only I was not the vice chairman, but the chairman himself, how good that would be!\"The Chi Cheng who had just been rejoicing earlier was now already filled with insatiable greed, starting to amass expectations for the role of class chairman.Under the system of the clan, each rank that was higher than the last was just like a carrot getting bigger than the previous one, deeply enticing him.\"Although I am only a C grade talent, but I believe that everything will get better and better.\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng was full of hope for his future.However right now, the other vice chairman Gu Yue Fang Zheng was feeling very much terrible in his heart, his face expression also quite unsightly.\"Big brother, you!\" He looked wide-eyed with disbelief at the academy\u2019s gate entrance, where a lone figure stood.\"Old rules as usual, every person one piece of primeval stone.\" Fang Yuan stood while hugging his arms, his tone dull.Fang Zheng\u2019s mouth opened and closed a few times, then after some moments of effort he finally said, \"Big brother, but I am the vice chairman now!\"\"That\u2019s true.\" Fang Yuan was expressionless as he nodded, giving Fang Zheng an indifferent look, \"The vice chairman receives an allowance of five pieces each time. So you should give up three pieces instead.\"Fang Zheng was flabbergasted, and for a moment he was unable to say a word.A group of teenagers were crowding around Gu Yue Mo Bei as they walked over.When they saw Fang Yuan blocking the school gate entrance, Gu Yue Mo Bei flew into a rage, his finger pointing towards Fang Yuan. \"Fang Yuan! You sure have the guts to actually still dare hold us back?! Right now I am the chairman, and as a normal student when you see me, you should first bow and greet me!\"What answered him next was Fang Yuan\u2019s fist.Gu Yue Mo Bei was caught unexpected. After being hit by the fist, he could not refrain from retreating a few big steps backwards, his face full of disbelief. \"You hit me, you actually dared to hit me? I am but the chairman!\"What answered him again was still Fang Yuan\u2019s fists.Bang, bang, bang.After a few rounds of exchanging offensive and defensive blows, Gu Yue Mo Bei was knocked down to the floor by Fang Yuan, and he fell unconscious.The surrounding youths were all wide-eyed as they watched, all of them unsure of how to react for a moment.This was totally different from their imaginations!The guards at the gate entrance had also been watching everything that happened under their eyelids. They could not help but whisper among themselves.\"Fang Yuan just knocked down the new class chairman, what do we do?\"\"Salad dressing!\" (2)\"What do you mean?\"\"It means just watch them, then call some other guys and tidy up the place.\"\"But\u2026\"\"Hey hey, you want to provoke a person like Fang Yuan? I hope you remember what happened to Wang Da and Wu Er!\"The questioning guard immediately quivered and stopped saying anymore.The two guards at the huge gate entrance stood perfectly straight and upright. To let an incident happen right beside them, it was as if they were deaf and blind, unable to hear or see anything.After Fang Yuan sorted out Gu Yue Mo Bei, he also dealt with Fang Zheng and Chi Cheng.It was then that the other teenagers realised that nothing had changed. Fang Yuan was still the same old Fang Yuan, and the extortion would still continue as always.\"Each of you hand over one piece of primeval stone, vice chairmen three pieces, class chairman eight pieces.\" Fang Yuan announced the new rules.The youths could only sigh and obediently fish out their primeval stones.When they walked out of the school gates, suddenly someone slapped his head and exclaimed loudly, \"I\u2019ve thought of it, no wonder Fang Yuan did not want the position of class chairman. He wanted to continue extorting us!\"\"That\u2019s right. Everytime he does it he would get about fifty-nine piece of primeval stones, and right now it\u2019s gone up to about sixty-eight pieces. If he was the class chairman, he\u2019d only get ten pieces.\" Quite a few of them were enlightened.\"He\u2019s too treacherous, too cunning, too savage!\" Some of them were slapping their thighs, full of hatred and resentment.\"Sigh, this way it means that there\u2019s nothing extraordinary about the position of class and vice chairman. They\u2019ll also be extorted and be left with two pieces, just like the rest of us.\"It was unknown who just spoke, but when the youngsters heard it, they all could not help but turn silent.Bang!The academy elder slapped the table fiercely, feeling extremely furious.\"This Fang Yuan is just too absurd, what is he trying to do? To go as far as to continue extorting, taking eight pieces from the class chairman and three pieces from the vice chairman. With this, what is the difference of being a class and vice chairman in comparison with the other normal students?!\" The academy elder tried his best to suppress his voice, but his tone was filled with fury.When Fang Yuan rejected the position of class chairman, it meant rejecting his own integration into the clan\u2019s system. In strict terms, this was a sort of betrayal towards the clan itself. This was enough to make the academy elder very angry.Immediately after that Fang Yuan had gone to extort his fellow classmates. His handreach was getting further, and this had already gone beyond the academy elder\u2019s bottom line. After the extortion this time, the influence of class chairman and vice chairman would be completely weakened.Over time, the normal students would lose their respect and interest for these two positions.While Fang Yuan\u2019s actions this time seemed small, the meaning behind it was rather heavy.It was pretty much using oneself\u2019s own strength to challenge the clan\u2019s system!This was something the academy elder totally did not wish to see. He was raising the clan\u2019s fresh new hopes, not the clan\u2019s traitors. Yet despite knowing Fang Yuan had gone and challenge his baseline, he knew that he was unable to do anything to handle the matter.If he really did, the first one who would not let him go would be the clan head. The second and third person to have opinions against him would be Gu Yue Chi Lian and Gu Yue Mo Chen.The clan head put in all his hopes onto Gu Yue Fang Zheng, for Fang Zheng was the only A grade talent in three years. The clan leader needed a tenacious and independant genius, not a fragile and delicate flower who was cared for.At the same time for Chi Lian and Mo Chen, they also had placed their hopes onto their own respective grandsons, hoping that their grandchildren would grow in the midst of setbacks and frustrations.If the academy elder acted and replaced the students in punishing Fang yuan, once word got out then there would be the sayings of \"Mo and Chi family\u2019s future successors could not beat Fang Yuan and could only let the elders help them out.\"How unpleasant that would be.This would inevitably be a huge blow towards the fame and honor of the Mo and Chi family.Of course the academy elder was not afraid of a small little Fang Yuan, but he was instead worried that his intervention would attract pressure from the three sides - the clan head, Mo and Chi bloodline. They pretty much made up of almost the entire Gu Yue high authorities. As a lowly elder, how could he possibly endure?\"The root of this matter still goes back to Fang Yuan\u2019s secret. What in the world did he rely on to break through to the middle stage?\" The academy elder restrained the fire in his heart and shot his gaze at the three investigation reports on his table.The first report showed extensive info about Fang Yuan\u2019s family background.Fang Yuan was born into a good family; there was nothing strange about his identity and his life experience was perfectly clean and spotless. Both his parents had passed away and he was taken in by his uncle and aunt. However they did not get along, and ever since he attended the academy Fang Yuan had always stayed in the academy hostel.The second report was about Fang Yuan\u2019s life records.He had showed early intelligence during junior age, and was seen optimistically by the clansmen, predicted to be a possible A grade talent. Yet after the Awakening Ceremony, he was tested to be a C grade, greatly disappointing the clan.The third report was on Fang Yuan\u2019s recent trail.His everyday life patterns were very simple, and he had a rigid schedule. During the day he would always be attending lessons in the academy, and in the night he would always sleep in the dormitories. He was extremely hardworking in his cultivation, and would always enter a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation every night, nurturing his aperture. There were times he would go out to the village\u2019s only inn to have better meals and buy wine to drink.He had a special affection towards wine, and loved to drink the green bamboo wine. Under his hostel bed, he kept tens of pots of green bamboo wine.The academy elder looked carefully again at the three reports, his heart forming a deeper impression of Fang Yuan again.\"Both his parents died early, and he was unable to get along with his uncle and aunt\u2026 No wonder this brat Fang Yuan does not have a sense of belonging towards the clan. He was personally crowned as a genius among all by the clansmen, yet they also personally plucked him out of the sky and threw him down to the earth\u2026 No wonder he is so wild and unruly, and so peculiarly cold and detached. His life is so simple and he is assiduous towards cultivation. This is him holding back his breath, unwilling to concede, he wants to prove his ability to the clan! Thus that is why when I suppressed him, he retaliated so fiercely\u2026\"Once the academy elder carefully thought until this point, he could not help but heave a sigh.The more he learnt about Fang Yuan, the more he understood Fang Yuan.Of course, understanding does not mean forgiving. Fang Yuan went against him, offending his dignity, rejecting to be class chairman, and even extorting his classmates. These were things he could not tolerate.Shaking the information in his hands, the academy elder frowned again. \"Although these reports are detailed, they have nothing to do with Fang Yuan\u2019s advancement secret. It has already been a few days, these people are atrocious!\"Boom, boom, boom.At this time, knocking sounds were heard on the door.\"Come inside,\" the academy elder said.The door opened.It was the clan head, Gu Yue Bo\u2019s personal guard. \"The clan leader has orders, esteemed elder, please hurry to the main family pavilion, there is a matter to discuss.\"\"Oh, what\u2019s the matter?\" The academy elder stood up from his seat, he had felt the severity of the issue from the guard\u2019s tone and expression.\"The Rank four Gu Master Sir Jia Fu has come back, his brother Jia Jin Sheng has gone missing!\" The guard answered.\"Hiss...\" The academy elder instantly drew a mouthful of cold air.---(1) This analogy is unique to the author. I translated as closely as possible, yeah\u2026 Something about how basically two colors in the sky blend together like an emperor \u2018sleeping\u2019 with his concubine.(2) Salad dressing is a chinese wordplay that is very hard to contextualise.

With his extensive life experience, the academy elder knew that under normal circumstances, these sort of sudden disappearances often spelled death.Anyone can die, but Jia Jin Sheng cannot! Especially not dying in the Gu Yue Village.His identity was special, his father being the Jia family head, his brother being the Rank four Gu Master Jia Fu.A Rank four Gu Master has yellow gold primeval essence, and they have absurd fighting power. Within the Gu Yue clan, only the clan leader is Rank four and can match up to him, while the other clan elders were all Rank three.The Jia family head was at an even higher cultivation level. He was a Rank five, and under his lead the Jia family rose to prosperity, becoming a large sized clan and possessing the resources of an entire mountain, with a large number of clansmen. Compared to them, Gu Yue clan was just a middle sized one.If the two clans fought, Gu Yue village would definitely have the disadvantage.The most crucial part was, if this matter was spread, the Gu Yue clan\u2019s reputation would be tarnished. Many merchants are vigilant in choosing their routes. Without the interaction with merchants, the Gu Yue clan\u2019s surplus local resources would not have an avenue to sell, and the external resources they required would not be purchasable. As time passes, they would definitely weaken.\"This matter is severe, if we do not handle it well, it would be a disaster!\" The academy elder worriedly rushed towards the clan head\u2019s pavilion.Once he stepped into the conference hall in the clan head\u2019s pavilion, the academy elder felt the solemn and serious atmosphere.The main seat was occupied by the current clan leader Gu Yue Bo. The fat and short Jia Fu brought along five to six followers with him and stood at the center of the hall, adopting an accusative stance.Under the bright light of the lamp, the solemn faces of the elders who were standing at side of their chairs were evident.Jia Fu was a Rank four Gu Master, and since he was not sitting, these Rank three clan elders naturally did not dare to sit.This was the deterrent force of a Rank four Gu Master.It was also a form of respect for power.\"Greetings\u2026.\" The clan elders were about to pay their respects, but they were stopped by the clan leader Gu Yue Bo\u2019s hands.Gu Yue Bo who had grizzled white hair was using his finger to rub his temple, a look of distress on his face, \"I\u2019m not going to say more about the matter, the clan academy is always under your supervision. Let me ask you, where is Gu Yue Fang Yuan?\"The academy elder was shocked. Internally he thought, how does this have to do with that brat Fang Yuan?He answered politely, \"At this timing, he should be cultivating in the academy hostel.\"The clan leader sighed, \"Brother Jia is very suspicious now, he thinks that his brother Jia Jin Sheng\u2019s disappearance has something to do with Fang Yuan. I order you to go and bring him here immediately.\"The academy elder shuddered in his heart. \"Yes!\"He understood the severity of this issue, and hurriedly paid his respects before he turned around and left.\"Brother Jia, that Fang Yuan will be brought here immediately, have a seat.\" Gu Yue Bo pointed at a seat near him and said to Jia Fu.Jia Fu laughed bitterly, cupping his fists at Gu Yue Bo. \"I apologise to Brother Gu Yue! I was really anxious then, it has already been days since I\u2019ve seen my brother, I fear for the worst. I really cannot afford to wait.\"There are some things that, only after losing them can they be understood.Jia Fu only realised it in these few days, the reason why his father paired him up with the burden Jia Jin Sheng for the caravan.It was to test his nature. Seeing if he could, while suppressing his brother, remember their kinship, and at the same time take care of this little brother.If Jia Jin Sheng was dead now, how would his father view him?When he realized this point, he immediately held investigations in the caravan, and quickly set his target on the Gu Yue village.He rushed back without a single break.Now that he was standing, reluctant to sit, it was to create the impression that he was determined to get the culprit. This was both emitting pressure on the Gu Yue clan as well as giving his father a form of assurance when he return to the Jia family.\"Reporting to clan leader sir, Fang Yuan has been brought here.\" Quickly, the academy elder brought Fang Yuan to the hall.\"Gu Yue Fang Yuan pays his respects to clan elder, Sir Jia Fu, and the various clan elders,\" Fang Yuan said with an expressionless face.\"It\u2019s him?\" Jia Fu coldly observed Fang Yuan, at the same time, asked a female Gu Master.This female Gu Master was the one who Fang Yuan bought the purple gold rock from at the gambling den.\"Yes, it\u2019s him! There is no mistake,\" The female Gu Master stared at Fang Yuan, saying confidently.Jia Fu nodded. Immediately his gaze was like two steel blades, slashing at Fang Yuan. But he did not interrogate openly, for this was the Gu Yue village, thus he had to give the Gu Yue clan leader some respect.Thus he looked towards the Gu Yue clan leader.The Gu Yue clan leader had a serious expression. He knew that Jia Fu purposely conversed with the female Gu Master loudly; it was not only to confirm Fang Yuan\u2019s identity, but also to assert his motive.He was implying to the Gu Yue clan head that he had the evidence in his hands, \"I have sufficient confidence, so you better not overly defend your own clansman.\"This caused some displeasure in the Gu Yue clan leader\u2019s heart, thinking, \"You Jia Fu lost your brother, it was your mistake to begin with. Now you come here to our Gu Yue village with an accusative stance, do you think my Gu Yue clan can be easily bullied? My Gu Yue clan is impartial and works around based on logic, but don\u2019t be mistaken that this is a weakness!\u2019Thinking of this, he did not interrogate Fang Yuan immediately, but fiercely said to the female Gu Master, \"Did you see clearly? I\u2019m not afraid to tell you this, but Fang Yuan has a twin brother who looks extremely identical to him, are you really sure it\u2019s him?\"The female Gu Master was just a Rank one, and under Gu Yue Bo\u2019s pressure, she instantly showed a hesitant and nervous expression.Jia Fu frowned and took a step forward, blocking her from Gu Yue Bo\u2019s sight. Cupping his fists, he said, \"Brother Gu Yue, I\u2019ve always respected the Gu Yue clan. Especially the Gu Yue clan\u2019s first and fourth clan leader, these two were Rank five powerhouses. One built the clan from scratch, where he went through tough times and created the Gu Yue family\u2019s hundred year foundation. Another was a benevolent hero, for to protect his clan he sacrificed himself, and is worth respecting. Brother Gu Yue, as the clan leader, I believe you will act impartial, please interrogate this Fang Yuan.\"Hearing that his tone had softened, Gu Yue Bo nodded, but his heart had already decided.If this Fang Yuan was the culprit, then he would hand him over. After all he was just a C grade, there is no loss in losing him. As long as it is able to settle this dispute.If Fang Zheng was the one who did it, Fang Yuan also has to take the blame. Fang Zheng is an A grade genius, the only one in three years. The clan higher-ups still expect to nurture him greatly to go against that Bai Ning Bing from the Bai clan village.\"Fang Yuan, don\u2019t be nervous.\" Gu Yue clan leader smiled benevolently, using a gentle tone towards Fang Yuan, \"Let me ask you, do you know any information about that Jia Jin Sheng?\"\"Who is Jia Jin Sheng?\" Fang Yuan looked up and said calmly.\"He\u2019s lying!\" The female Gu Master from the gambling den shrieked right as Fang Yuan finished his question.The people in the discussion hall, upon hearing this shrieking, frowned and all looked towards her.The female Gu Master pointed at Fang Yuan, showing an agitated expression, \"It\u2019s him, it\u2019s him! At our gambling den, he bought six purple gold rocks, and the fifth was a mudskin toad. Young master Jia saw it and tried to use five hundred primeval stones to purchase it. This left a huge impression on me, even if a year or two passes I will not forget. Not only me, but the other Gu Masters at the gambling den saw it too.\"\"Is that so\u2026\" The Gu Yue clan leader\u2019s smiled disappeared, showing a stiff expression and dragging his question towards Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan only nodded now, showing a hint of nervousness, and pretended to suddenly realize, \"Oh it\u2019s him. Alright, if he\u2019s Jia Jin Sheng, then I do know him. But after the gambling den incident, I did not see him ever again.\"\"He\u2019s lying again!\" This time, it was not the female Gu Master, but a male Gu Master who called out in public.Fang Yuan looked towards him, and as if he had recognised him, showed an expression of shock, but quickly tried to hide it.His expression changes were reflected in everyone\u2019s eyes.Everyone started to ponder.\"Esteemed sirs, I am an employee at the wine shop.\" The male Gu Master first cupped his fists to everyone, and then vigorously pointed at Fang Yuan, \"That night, I saw clearly at the wine shop, he was sitting with young master Jia Jin Sheng, and the two secretly conversed for a long time!\"Once he said so, the hall erupted into a clammer of soft discussions.The academy elder used a cold gaze and looked at Fang Yuan.The Gu Yue clan master moved backwards slightly, slowly leaning on the large chair.\"How can that be!\" Fang Yuan showed an obviously frantic expression, hurriedly saying, \"The wine shop had so many people, how can you recognise me just like that? You might be mistaken yourself!\"\"Haha, I am definitely not wrong.\" The male Gu Master smiled, his gaze staring at Fang Yuan, at this moment he felt extremely confident.\"Not to mention it was young master Jia Jin Sheng who coming to our wine shop, we have to take care of him carefully. Even if it was not him, I would still have had recognised you, as you had given me a strong impression!\"Saying so, he raised his eyebrows, saying smugly, \"Do you still remember? That day you came to our shop, wanting a cup of monkey wine. But you only drank a mouthful. After that you released the Liquor worm and fed the remaining monkey wine to it. I saw the Liquor worm and was very agitated, wanting to purchase it from you but you refused to sell it and walked away immediately!\"\"Good, exactly what I wanted to hear.\" Fang Yuan laughed coldly in his heart, but showed an expression of shock on his face, subconsciously taking a step backwards.\"Liquor worm!\" The eyes of the academy elder behind Fang Yuan shone.But quickly he frowned again, and could not help but ask, \"Fang Yuan, where did you get that Liquor worm?\"Fang Yuan clenched his fists, gritting his teeth, but refusing to answer.The surrounding clan elders flew into a rage, starting to scowl.\"Fang Yuan, do you know the trouble you\u2019ve caused!\"\"Talk, exactly what happened?\"\"Tell us of what you know, own up. This Liquor worm, is it Jia Jin Sheng\u2019s?\"\"How can it be his? The Liquor worm is obviously obtained by myself!\" Fang Yuan raised his head suddenly, his expression worked up, as if he could not stand such a slander, and shouted loudly with an indignant emotion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The last one, I brought back to the hostel and after opening it, I found a Liquor worm inside. I was overjoyed as I had searched up information on it before, and knew that the Liquor worm is a rare Gu worm that could supplement my lack of talent, thus I refined it on the spot.\"\"Wait, you said that you bought six gambling rocks and opened a mudskin toad as well as another Liquor worm?\" The clan elders upon hearing this, could not help but ask in an unbelievable tone.\"So what?\" Fang Yuan answered as a matter of fact, then pointed at the female Gu Master, shouting, \"She can be my witness!\"Everyone on the scene were momentarily stunned before turning to look at the female Gu Master.The female Gu Master felt the pressure from all the gaze and did not dare to lie, so she honestly said, \"It is indeed true, Fang Yuan bought six rocks and opened the mudskin toad on the fifth. He brought the sixth piece away, but I do not know what he opened inside.\"\"Buying six purple gold rocks and getting two Gu worms consecutively, isn\u2019t this luck way too good?\" The clan elders mumbled.\"What\u2019s so hard to understand? It\u2019s luck, who knows, heh, back in the days when I gambled rocks I also\u2026\"\"Wait, Gu worms are hard to refine, why did it sound like Fang Yuan easily refined it?\" Some of the family elders asked suspiciously.\"You\u2019re muddled. Don\u2019t you know that when a Gu is extracted from a fossil, they\u2019re extremely weak, tittering on the brink of death? Even refining then from a lower Rank is possible. What\u2019s so peculiar about him refining the Liquor worm?\" Someone immediately answered.Fang Yuan continued, \"I refined the Liquor worm and went to the stores on the second day, I indeed went to a wine shop in the afternoon and bought a cup of monkey wine. At night, I went again and witnessed a scamming scene, Jia Jin Sheng was selling a smelly fart fat worm as a Black Boar Gu to someone in my clan. Next, Sir Jia Fu appeared and resolved the dispute.\"\"I went to the wine shop again, but I did not expect to see Jia Jin Sheng drinking wine in a poor mood. I had just obtained the Liquor worm and was extremely happy, so I asked him how many primeval stones I could sell it for. Who knew that Jia Jin Sheng upon hearing my Liquor worm, wanted to forcefully buy it. I obviously rejected him, I had no intentions to sell it, only wanting to know its value. Even if I wanted to sell it, that would have to be after I am Rank two, thus I left on the spot.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s words had brought out the matter of Jia Jin Sheng and Jia Fu\u2019s conflict, causing the clan elders to see Jia Fu in a different light.Under these pressuring gazes, Jia Fu coughed and asked Fang Yuan with shining eyes, \"Then did my brother chase after you?\"Fang Yuan nodded, half lying, \"He not only chased me, but also added an extra fifty primeval stones. But I did not want to sell it, so he was furious, claiming that the Gu Yue clan was no big deal, asking me to watch out. After saying that, he walked away. I never saw him again.\"Jia Fu nodded internally. With his understanding of Jia Jin Sheng, he definitely would have chased after Fang Yuan and gave threats as that was his style.If Fang Yuan said he did not chase after him, that would be a lie.But since Fang Yuan said so, this led Jia Fu to a predicament. His investigations led up only to this clue. Did Jia Jin Sheng really not search for Fang Yuan after that? Maybe he found Fang Yuan again afterwards, and as the two could not agree on the matter, he was killed by Fang Yuan ------ This is entirely possible.\u2018Speak, was Jia Jin Sheng killed by you!\" Thinking of this, Jia Fu interrogated fiercely, attempting to pressurize Fang Yuan with his aura.Fang Yuan denied once again, claiming that he did not see Jia Jin Sheng anymore.Jia Fu had no other evidence, and while one side questioned intensely, the other denied. At this point, it had become a stalemate.As Gu Yue Bo listened to their conversation, he turned displeased. That Jia Jin Sheng actually dared to threaten the Gu Yue clan on Qing Mao mountain, this was not giving the Gu Yue clan any respect! Now this Jia Fu dared to interrogate a Gu Yue clan member so intensely in front of all the Gu Yue clan higher-ups. Nevermind if he had evidence, but now that he has no evidence or proof, if this matter spread out, what would happen to the Gu Yue clan\u2019s honour?\"Brother Jia, it\u2019s not that I want to speak out of turn.\" The clan leader interrupted his interrogation and continued, \" Jia Jin Sheng has gone missing for so many days, hope is bleak. The culprit who caused this crime definitely left behind some traces. Did brother find anything yet?\"Jia Fu stared fiercely at Fang Yuan before raising his head and sighed, \"I understand brother\u2019s words! If there were any traces, I would not have come here to find the culprit. That criminal is obviously experienced with vile methods and meticulous handling. To speak the truth, all the clues are at a dead end, and on the day we left, there was a huge rain that could have washed away all the possible blood traces.\"Gu Yue Bo smiled faintly. \"Brother Jia, I heard that your Jia family has a tracing Gu worm called the Underworld Path Butterfly. It can emit soul fragrance and be implanted on Gu worms. The scent is colourless and odourless, and never fades. Your Jia family member\u2019s Gu worms all have this scent. As long as you use the Underworld Path Butterfly, following the fragrance, you\u2019ll be able to find the Gu worms and thus your brother.\"Jia Fu solemnly said, \"I used the Underworld Path Butterfly long ago, but there was no effect. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that once the Gu worm dies, the fragrance dissipates. Evidently the murderer killed all of the Gu worms in my brother\u2019s possession.Gu Yue Bo\u2019s words turned, \"That\u2019s strange. The murderer harmed your brother, but he did not go for the Gu worms, or for extortion to get primeval stones. The murderer killed this tiny Rank one Gu Master, what was the motive?\"Indeed, what was the motive?Regardless of whether Jia Jin Sheng was dead, there had to be a motive, right?If not for Gu worms nor primeval stones, then was it for love?But if it was a crime of passion, it had to be a long term process, and Jia Fu would not have come to the Gu Yue clan. The caravan members and clansmen would fall under greater suspicion as they have a long relationship with him.At once, the hall fell into silence.Fang Yuan followed everyone\u2019s gazes, and suddenly said to Jia Fu, \"Maybe Jia Jin Sheng was killed by you. I heard before that your family is splitting assets, now that one brother is dead, wouldn\u2019t you get more inheritance?\"\"Shut up!\"\"Baseless accusation, do not slander Sir Jia Fu.\"Immediately the family elders erupted.Fang Yuan kept quiet immediately, his gaze shining obscurely, but his objective had been reached.His earlier words were like a pebble that was thrown into the elders\u2019 sea of thoughts, causing waves of ripples.The clan elders followed this train of thought, and started to think, \"Jia Fu cannot kill Jia Jin Sheng, this causes more harm to him than reward. Wait, even if he won\u2019t do it, that does not mean others won\u2019t...\"\"The Jia family\u2019s internal dispute!\" A certain elder had a flash of inspiration and lightly muttered.His volume was not high, but in the silent hall it could be heard clearly.At once, the elders\u2019 gaze shone.\"Finally, they have thought of this.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s mouth twitched, his eyelids drooping, hiding away his cold gaze.The Jia family\u2019s clan leader wants to split the assets and impart the role of clan leader, and because of this his children underwent intense competition, especially Jia Fu and Jia Gui, both being Rank four Gu Masters and having their own supporters.In these few years, the Jia family situation is somewhat known by many of the mountain villages.Jia Jin Sheng\u2019s misfortune was too strange. Currently there was no evidence showing that Fang Yuan was the killer. It was obvious that the motivation for murder was not enough just based on the theory of killing just because of a Liquor worm. At the same time, the murderer\u2019s actions and methods would not be so meticulous and secretive.But if Jia Gui was the one acting in the shadows, then it could be explained.Everyone present was a higher-up, and as someone in a position of power, there had to be something capable about them. At least for political schemes, they had great intuition and perception.The Jia family dispute, this gave everyone\u2019s imaginations a pair of wings.The Jia family clan leader had arranged Jia Jin Sheng to join the caravan. One reason was to test Jia Fu\u2019s nature, to see if he was a good brother, and only suppressed but not bully his brother.Now that Jia Jin Sheng was in trouble, Jia Fu would be implicated, and who is the true winner?Obviously Jia Fu\u2019s greatest competitor --- Jia Gui!The criminal\u2019s actions were so fluid, causing all clues to come to a dead end, this showed how experienced the criminal was. How could this be done by a fifteen year old like Fang Yuan?All the answers were revealed at once!The discussion hall was still silent, but the elders exchanged gazes full of meaning.\"To make someone believe in something wholeheartedly, it is not through convincing, but directing.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s keen observation allowed him to see these glances, and he laughed coldly in his heart, but his face still showed an expression of indignance and stubbornness.Jia Fu\u2019s face was so dark and gloomy it could drip water.The matter of the Jia family internal dispute caused him to think of Jia Gui.At that moment, his soul shook!Who else had a greater motivation than Jia Gui?No one!\"I understand now, I understand everything.\" The academy elder stood behind Fang Yuan, looking at him. His eyes shone, \"Fang Yuan is both lucky and unfortunate, meeting Jia Jin Sheng at the last moment. With his age of just starting to attend school, how can he get rid of all the evidence? If he had such scheming abilities, how can he show this expression of indomitability. He denied it earlier just to hide the existence of the Liquor worm.\"At this point, everyone had dispelled their suspicious towards Fang Yuan!\"Getting rid of the suspicions on me is just the first step, what happens next is crucial.\" Fang Yuan was in grasp of the situation, and at this point, everything was going according to plan. He sighed internally and looked at Jia Fu.Jia Fu looked at him too, the unfriendliness in his eyes growing obviously more intense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since he could not accuse Jia Gui, he had to give his father some answer.And this answer was in front of him!\"That\u2019s right, if Fang Yuan is the scapegoat, it would at least help me get through this crisis. Once I get over it, I can get back at Jia Gui with twice the payback.\" Jia Fu thought deviously.He raised his pitch, interrogating Fang Yuan, \"Fang Yuan, how do you prove that you did not harm Jia Jin Sheng?\"The clan elders were stunned. This is obviously your internal dispute, why are you still grabbing onto my clansman?Only the Gu Yue clan leader looked grim, his expression turning sharp as he stared at Jia Fu.\"Fang Yuan, what proof do you have to show that you were not present at the time and did not harm Jia Jin Sheng? If you can\u2019t prove it, you are the murderer!\" Jia Fu pointed at Fang Yuan, his gaze furious as he threatened with his aura.\"He\u2019s trying to push our clan\u2019s Fang Yuan into being the scapegoat. How atrocious!\" At this point, the clan elders had reacted and their expressions all turned unkind.They had been fighting and scheming against each other for a long time, so if they thought about it, they would know easily about Jia Fu\u2019s standpoint and intentions.\"Witness? Of course I do! I prepared it long ago.\" Fang Yuan smiled internally, but showed an expression of shock, as if he wanted to speak but couldn\u2019t.\"No need for others, just tell me if you do or not!\" Jia Fu raised his voice again, forcing Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan showed an indignant expression, but finally gritted his teeth and said helplessly, \"No.\"\"Haha. Then you are \u2014\"\" Jia Fu was about to declare his verdict but at that point.\"Halt!\" The academy elder took a step forward and stood in front of Fang Yuan with a solemn expression, \"Of course he has a witness, that would be me!\"\"You?\" Jia Fu asked in shock.\"That\u2019s right, me.\" The academy elder, facing Rank four Jia Fu, was slightly overpowered. But seeing Gu Yue Bo\u2019s encouraging gaze, he gathered his courage and raised his head, \"These days when Fang Yuan unexpectedly became the first to break through the middle stage, I sent my men to investigate him. His everyday activities and actions are recorded down, there was no time for him to harm Jia Jin Sheng.\"\"Yes, this is it\u2026\" Fang Yuan hid behind the academy elder\u2019s back, where no one could see his curled lips, revealing a smile.Jia Fu\u2019s expression was dim, he did not expect the academy elder to stand out and protect Fang Yuan.The crucial point was, the Gu Yue clan leader did not object. This had a great meaning, for it meant the Gu Yue clan was going to protect Fang Yuan.\"I get it! I wanted to get Fang Yuan to become the scapegoat, but that was from my perspective, and I did not consider their perspective. Indeed, once Fang Yuan is criminalized, the Gu Yue clan has to bear the evil name of harming a Jia family member. From then on they will have to face the Jia family\u2019s retribution as well as losing their own reputation. Furthermore, future caravans would not dare to come here and trade anymore, the loss is too great!\"Thinking of this, Jia Fu was anguished and wanted to slap his own head.The Gu Yue higher-ups did have such considerations.Fang Yuan was a C grade, so if he really harmed Jia Jin Sheng, handing him over was nothing. But the point was, now that his suspicion had been cleared, if he was handed over, wouldn\u2019t the Gu Yue clan suffer a great injustice and lose out greatly?Knowing that this conflict could not be resolved, Jia Fu gritted his teeth, determined to get his way. He said, \"If so, why don\u2019t you let me use the Footprint Gu. Once this Gu is used, it will show the floor\u2019s last 30,000 footprints.\"The academy elder scoffed in displeasure.Jia Fu\u2019s words meant he did not trust them. But he has no reason to stop him, thus he let Jia Fu through.\"Come and test!\" Fang Yuan laughed coldly at Jia Fu, walking towards him with his head lowered.He was confident, having predicted this. Thus, these few days he kept his activities within the village and did not go to the secret cave.Under the Gu Yue higher-ups supervision, Jia Fu did not play any tricks.The Footprint Gu was very peculiar, it was shaped like a person\u2019s foot. Its material was like a translucent yogurt, giving others a feeling of smoothness, and the surface had a yellow-green luster.Its size was small, being only palm size.Jia Fu held it in his hands, sending primeval essence into the Footprint Gu.The Footprint Gu became brighter, and then suddenly with a \"bam\" sound, exploded into a cloud of yellow green powder.The powdery cloud enveloped Fang Yuan and spun around him before flying out of the discussion hall.Where the powder cloud passed through, the floor would show a series of footprints.These footprints glowed in a yellow green light around the same size as Fang Yuan\u2019s foot. They were Fang Yuan\u2019s footprints when he entered the discussion hall.The footprints extended from the family head pavilion into the academy hostel and then to the academy and circulated. Other than that, it reached the mountain village\u2019s inn.The powder cloud became smaller as it flew, and finally at the 30,000th step, it vanished.The results were clear, everyone had checked and knew that Fang Yuan was innocent, there were no suspicious points.Jia Fu sighed, taking out a small jade box.He opened the jade box, where there was only a jade piece inside.The jade piece was a translucent emerald colour, and there was a Gu sealed inside.This was a phasmids(1), its body long and slim, with the colour of jade, its entire body looking like a bamboo tube.The phasmids was normally longer than a palm, but this one wasn\u2019t, being only the size of a fingernail. On its surface, it emitted a white glow.\"Green jade as its body, white light enveloping its form, this is the Bamboo Gentleman!\" At once, some of the elders recognised this Gu worm and exclaimed.Even Gu Yue Bo was moved. He could not refrain from advising, \"Brother Jia, this Bamboo Gentleman is a Rank four Gu, it is not easily refined. Why waste it here?\"Jia Fu shook his head, looking at Fang Yuan: \"This Bamboo Gentleman was obtained through gambling rocks when I was young. The rock was only opened halfway before it could no longer be extracted. As everyone knows, this Gu worm is fed honesty as food, being able to detect lies from birth. Only an honest gentleman who has never lied can refine and feed this Gu.\"\"Fang Yuan, you just have to open this rock and keep the Bamboo Gentleman in your aperture. Whatever I ask you, you will answer. Next, we will take out this Gu and let everyone see if it changed colour. If the Gu changes colour, you\u2019re lying!\"\"No problem.\" Fang Yuan did not hesitate. He immediately opened the jade piece and did as Jia Fu instructed.The Bamboo Gentleman appeared in his aperture and emitted a faint green glow, covering the primeval sea.Fang Yuan felt that if he said a single lie, the Bamboo Gentleman could detect it and turn its body from green into another color.But he only accepted it because he had his trump card.\"Spring Autumn Cicada!\" With a thought, the Spring Autumn Cicada awakened and let out a trace of its aura.This aura was overpowering, and it immediately suppressed the Bamboo Gentleman.The Bamboo Gentleman emitted a green glow and immediately shrunk its body. Its entire body was curled up, trembling in fear. How could it have the excessive spirit to detect lies?Jia Fu begin interrogating, with his first question hitting home, \"Fang Yuan, did you harm my brother Jia Jin Sheng?\"\"No!\" Fang Yuan affirmed.Jia Fu asked, \"Do you have any other information about him?\"Fang Yuan shook his head, \"No idea.\"Jia Fu asked again, \"Did you say anything dishonest to us earlier?\"Fang Yuan shook his head again, \"No.\"\"Alright, you can take out the Bamboo Gentleman now.\" After finishing with three questions, Jia Fu instructed Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan took out the Bamboo Gentleman, and everyone saw that it was still an emerald green colour with no changes.The clan elders heaved a sigh of relief.Jia Fu\u2019s expression became milder as he kept the Bamboo Gentleman, cupping his fists towards Gu Yue Bo, \"Much offense this time, brother Gu Yue.\"\"No matter, the truth is what we wanted to see as well.\" Gu Yue Bo waved his hand, then sighed, \"But what a pity for this Bamboo Gentleman.\"The Bamboo Gentleman had the ability to detect lies and was a Rank four Gu, thus it was very valuable. But feeding and refining it was not easy. It had to be refined by an honest gentleman. If any other Gu Master had said a single lie, the refinement would fail and the Bamboo Gentleman would die on the spot.Its food was honesty. It would reside in the aperture of an honest gentleman and consuming the gentleman\u2019s honesty as food to survive.Now that the Bamboo Gentleman had been opened, it was extremely weak, but it had no food to restore its strength. After being treated so harshly by Fang Yuan, its death was set in stone.Jia Fu shook his head, looking at the Bamboo Gentleman in his head, not feeling any pity.He said solemnly, \"I have already done my best to investigate, but I received no results. This time, when I get back to the family, I will employ the divine investigator Tie Xue Leng(2), it would definitely get this matter cleared up! Goodbye.\"Saying so, he cupped his fists towards Gu Yue Bo and left, crisp and quick, with a certain elegance to it.Seeing Jia Fu and the rest leaving, Gu Yue Bo heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"You can all leave now.\"He waved at the clan elders, but suddenly thought of something and said, \"Academy elder please stay back.\"Without losing a single drop of sweat, Fang Yuan walked out of the family head\u2019s pavilion safe and sound.(1) Phasmids: Stick-bugs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasmatodea(2) \u94c1\u8840\u51b7 - Tie Xue Leng, Tie means Metal and is the name of the Tie clan. Xue Leng means cold blood. This name will be important.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Clan leader, what is the matter?\" The academy elder respectfully stood at a corner.\"It\u2019s nothing much, take a seat, I have a story to share with you.\" Gu Yue Bo squinted his eyes and said slowly.\"Your subordinate shall listen with full attention!\" Academy elder chose to sit at the seat closest to the clan leader.Clan leader Gu Yue Bo began his story on Ren Zu.Some say \u2014\u2014Ever since Ren Zu was able to get their names and subdued the Rules and Regulation Gu, his first order was for them to capture a longevity Gu.Rules and Regulation Gu, one round and other other square, worked together and could capture all the Gu in the world, a longevity Gu was nothing difficult.Ren Zu used the longevity Gu and got back his youth, becoming 20 years old again.But now the rules Gu said, \"Human, although you subdued us, every time you command us, it will add a rule and regulation.\"Regulation Gu continued, \"We can catch the longevity Gu for you, this is the first order. Our new rule and regulation is, we will not repeatedly catch the same Gu for you.\"That means, if Ren Zu wanted to catch a longevity Gu again, the two Rules and Regulation Gu would not help.Ren Zu nodded, having no choice but to accept.He gave his second command, \"Then, other than the longevity Gu, please capture all the other ten thousand Gu in the world for me.\"Rules and regulation Gu got this command and Rules Gu turned into a giant circle, encompassing the universe. Regulation Gu turned into a giant square, covering the large world.One square and one round formed a giant net together, enveloping the entire world.When they shrunk again and returned to Ren Zu, all the Gu in the world other than longevity Gu were captured.Ren Zu was overjoyed, with this all the Gu belonged to him, from now on he was the ruler of the world!But once he opened the net, with a swoosh, a large number of worms flew outside and the Gu that Rules and Regulation Gu worked hard to catch, all escaped fervently.When Ren Zu closed the net, only five Gu were left.\"Why is this?\" Ren Zu was astonished.Rules and Regulation answered him, \"Human, the world has over ten thousand Gu with all sorts of abilities. You have no strength or knowledge, how can you subdue them? We can only capture Gu for you, to subdue them, you have to rely on yourself to get them to work for you.\"Next they added, \"This is your second order, so we\u2019ll add a second rule and regulation --- From now on, we can only catch one Gu for you at a time.\"Ren Zu could only nod, and carefully opened the net, only showing a small gap.The remaining five Gu contained the Strength and Wisdom Gu. Seeing this, Ren Zu was overjoyed.He said to Strength Gu, \"Strength Gu, you left me back then, do you have any regrets? If you succumb to me now, I will return you your freedom.\"Strength Gu said, \"Human, you are wrong. I didn\u2019t leave not because I couldn\u2019t, but because I wanted to stay. You want to subdue me but that\u2019s impossible. I only succumb to those stronger than me, but you are out of the question. However we can deal again, give me your youth and I will temporarily obey you.\"Ren Zu was reluctant upon hearing this, he had just gotten back his youth, was he about to lose it again?But he desired strength, he knew that with strength, he would get stronger and life would get easier.Moreover, with strength, he could subdue more Gu.Thus, Ren Zu accepted, and formed a second deal with it.Ren Zu became middle-aged at once, and the strength Gu flew out of the web and landed on Ren Zu\u2019s shoulder.Ren Zu had strength, and was full of confidence.He said to Wisdom Gu: \"Wisdom Gu, you left me back then, do you have any regrets? If you succumb to me now, I will return you your freedom.\"Wisdom Gu said, \"Human, you are wrong. I did not leave not because I couldn\u2019t, but because I wanted to stay. You want to subdue me but that\u2019s impossible. I only succumb to those smarter than me, yet you are not smarter than me. But we can deal again, give me your middle age and I will temporarily obey you.\"Ren Zu upon hearing this, refused to do the same deal again.He treasured his life more, and he also knew that once he sold his middle age, he would be left with old age. Before long, the Strength and Wisdom Gu would leave him again, just like last time.Ren Zu refused to deal, but did not want to let go of the Wisdom Gu.Wisdom Gu was anxious, reluctantly giving in, \"Alright, Human, you win. I lost to you this time. As long as you tell me what method you used to capture me, I will admit defeat and not take anything from you, being at your disposal.\"Upon hearing this, Ren Zu was overjoyed and before the Rules and Regulation Gu could stop him, he said, \"I used the Rules and Regulation Gu to capture you.\"Wisdom Gu laughed upon hearing, \"I remembered it, so these Gu are called Rules and Regulation. Haha, now that I know your names, you can no longer capture me.\"Saying so, it turned into a flash of light and flew away, vanishing into thin air.Rules and Regulation Gu begin to complain, \"Human, we told u long ago that our name should be known by you alone, and not others. Otherwise, we would be used by others. Look what happened, now that Wisdom Gu knows our names, it spells trouble.\"Only then did Ren Zu realise that he was tricked by Wisdom Gu. He was anguished, for he knew he lost the only chance he had of capturing the Wisdom Gu using Rules and Regulation.Saying so, Gu Yue Bo\u2019s story came to an end. He looked at the academy elder with a meaningful gaze.Academy elder jumped from his seat. He had heard of Ren Zu\u2019s story long ago, but from Gu Yue Bo\u2019s mouth, it had a greater meaning.His gaze shone and his heart understood. He bowed slightly at Gu Yue Bo, respectfully saying, \"Clan leader, you are using this story as an analogy? Fang Yuan as the Wisdom Gu and the clan as Ren Zu. Although Ren Zu used the Rules and Regulation Gu to capture Wisdom Gu and managed to trap it, the Wisdom Gu eventually escaped.\"Saying so, the academy elder paused and thought about it for a while, before looking at Gu Yue Bo. \"Sir clan leader, you want me to let go of Fang Yuan and stop pressuring him? But he\u2019s getting more and more overboard\u2026\"Gu Yue Bo stopped the academy elder\u2019s words, holding out his hand, indicating for him to sit and speak.The academy elder sat and heard Gu Yue Bo sigh, \"You, your comprehension is still superb, being an intelligent person, easily getting my point. Unfortunately your grasp of the situation is still too small, you can only see that tiny plot of land in front of you. Let me tell you, the academy is a small matter, and the clan is really the important one.\"\"I know what you are worried about, afraid that the other students are heavily suppressed by Fang Yuan, eventually losing the fire in their heart. Hehehe.\" Gu Yue Bo shook his head, pointing at academy elder, \"You\u2019re overthinking it.\"\"What do you think the clan is doing? Just relying on your academy to nurture new people? Of course not, behind every student, there\u2019s their parents, elders, and friends. Only with these people\u2019s support, encouragement, expectations, our Gu Yue clan\u2019s new generation can have the confidence and motivation in their hearts.\"\"Fang Yuan has indeed repeatedly exceeded my expectations, he has a hint of outstanding excellence. I have been observing Fang Zheng secretly and I have long known about Fang Yuan\u2019s extortions, just let him continue. Use him to train Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng, these rough jades. There are many advantages in this matter, at the very least this round of students have the best fighting skills among all the previous seasons.\"Academy elder was worried, \"But clan leader, excessive hurdles isn\u2019t a good thing either, it will crush the jade. Especially that Fang Yuan has the Liquor worm now, this worm provides great help to a Rank one Gu Master. I\u2019m worried that at the Rank one stage, under Fang Yuan\u2019s suppression, no one can overturn the situation.\"\"Then let them be unable to turn over the situation!\" Gu Yue Bo snorted, showing the grace and callousness of a person in power, \"This tiny setback, what does it matter? Is it scarier than death? With their family elder\u2019s support, if they still lacked motivation, then they are not even jade to begin with and have no value to nurture. The clan has tons of new students into the academy each year, so if this season doesn\u2019t succeed, there\u2019s always the next. As for Gu Yue Fang Zheng, starting tomorrow night, I will teach him in secret.\"\"With the clan leader\u2019s personal teaching, that is really Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s fortune.\" Academy elder licked his boots at the appropriate timing(1).Gu Yue Bo\u2019s expression softened as he looked at academy elder, instructing, \"Do you know the reason why after so many decades, you are still the academy elder? Have greater tolerance, I know Fang Yuan infringed your dignity and made you humiliated, but do you really have to be so calculative with a junior from a younger generation?\"\"I know that Fang Yuan has some earlier wisdom, but he is still a youngster and tends to be rash. If not, he would not have hurt the guards in public and caused you to be in a predicament. He was furious internally back then and that is understandable. From being hailed as genius to a commoner, it is normal to be angry at the clan.\"\"He is actually very childish, you can tell from him trying to hide the Liquor worm. How can the Liquor worm be hid? He is not mature yet and is still innocent, don\u2019t think of him as a scary being. Comparing him to the Wisdom Gu, I am thinking too highly of him. At most, he has some small intelligence, but lacks true wisdom and knowledge. If he hid the fact that he rose to middle stage silently, or accepted the class chairman position without any displeasure, that would truly be deep scheming.\"\"Clan leader, your meaning is?\" Academy elder raised his eyebrows.\"What I\u2019m trying to say is, Fang Yuan is discontented with the clan, thus let him go vent his anger. An ant spitting at an elephant, will the elephant care? Emotions are meant to be let out and not bottled inside, so once he\u2019s done venting, he will naturally fuse into the clan. Our Gu Yue clan has been around for nearly a thousand years ever since the first generation founded it. There has been countless of people who were discontented with the clan, but eventually did any of them manage to overturn the clan?\"\"A clan is not just about rules and regulations, there\u2019s also blood relation and kinship. Ren Zu wanted to use the rules and regulations to capture wisdom. Yet not only did he lose, but he also informed wisdom of the rules and regulations. There is profound meaning in this story - the rules are dead, but people are alive, and relationships are deep. If you only know how to use rules and regulations to catch people, it will only increase resentment and cause Fang Yuan to be more dissociated with the clan. Fang Yuan is only a C grade, if he\u2019s lucky, after tens of years he\u2019d still be a low-ranking clan elder. But he is still Gu Yue Fang Zheng\u2019s twin brother, do you understand now?\"\"Understood!\" Hearing Gu Yue Bo\u2019s final sentence, the academy elder realized at once.\"Mmm, if a family only has rules and regulations, then the family is a pile of dead objects. But if you add in blood relationship, it\u2019ll be alive.\" Gu Yue Bo nodded, \"and one more sentence, I want you to remember.\"\"Please admonish me, sir clan elder.\"Gu Yue Bo, with a distant gaze, looked out of the window towards the moon, \"The sea can hold the water from thousands of rivers, it's big because of its capacity. A person is great when he can be tolerant and forgiving to many other people. Remember this, and leave.\"\"Yes clan leader sir, your subordinate takes his leave,\" said the academy elder as he left the hall.(1) Boot-licking basically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Due to its leaping method to move forward, the precipitous and narrow mountain path was unable to serve as a limitation or hindrance to it.Jia Fu and his crew sat on the back of the Treasure Brass Toad. After exiting the Gu Yue Village, they once again headed towards the merchant caravan\u2019s direction.The wind blew past their ears, and their view followed the Treasure Brass Toad as it moved up and down.The moonlight shone on everyone\u2019s faces and they all looked solemn, while Jia Fu\u2019s face was cold as ice.After a while, a close subordinate could not stand this atmosphere and asked Jia Fu, \"Master, what are we going to do now? Jia Jin Sheng\u2019s death, once master returns, how will you answer to old master? Should we find a scapegoat first...\"Jia Fu shook his head, but avoided the question, \"Do you know the story of Ren Zu?\"The subordinate was stunned, not expecting this answer. At once he did not know how to reply.Jia Fu continued, \"Ren Zu had the Rules and Regulation Gu, and could capture all the ten thousand Gu in the world, obtaining strength but losing wisdom. At that point his net still contained three Gu. He opened and saw that they were the Attitude Gu, Belief Gu and Suspicion Gu respectively. Ren Zu was unwilling to let them go, thus the three Gu could only bet with him. Once Ren Zu opens the net, they would run out in three different directions, and whoever is captured by Ren Zu would be subdued. Guess, who did Ren Zu capture in the end?\"The trusted aide thought, and answered, \"It\u2019s the Attitude Gu!\"\"Do you know why?\" Jia Fu asked. The loyal subordinate shook his head.Jia Fu laughed, \"Because attitude means everything. No matter if father \u2018believes\u2019 or \u2018suspects\u2019, I have already displayed my \u2018attitude\u2019. Jia Jin Sheng went missing, and I immediately conducted investigations in the caravan. Once I had a clue, I rushed towards the Gu Yue clan without stop. At the village, I risked the danger of being attacked by them and interrogated them on the spot. I did not even sit down, and to prove Fang Yuan\u2019s words, I went as far as to use the Rank four Bamboo Gentleman.\"\"Once I get back, I will even spend a ton of money to employ the divine investigator, inviting Tie Leng Xue to investigate this matter. Regardless of whether Jia Jin Sheng is dead or alive, as his brother I have already done all that I should, my attitude shows everything! I have thought it through earlier, we do not need a scapegoat. We shall go back in this honest state, because I was not at fault for this matter! Finding a scapegoat, that might just be a trap by Jia Gui. If I can find a scapegoat, he can also find someone to overturn the case.\"His subordinate was shocked and said, \"Master, you really suspect that young master Jia Gui was behind this?\"\"Hmph, who else but him can do something so perfectly?\" Saying so, Jia Fu\u2019s face distorted, anger bursting from his eyes, \"Before this, I was thinking about our blood relationship and did not do such a thing to him. But since he is so devious, I will have to pay him back an eye for an eye, don\u2019t blame me for being unscrupulous!\"He did not know that far away in a distant place, there were a pair of eyes sending him off.Fang Yuan stood on the hillside as he silently watched.The view tonight was truly spectacular.The golden yellow, round moon was high up in the night sky, shining so brightly that the entire earth was lit bright.The nearby green mountains were verdant and lush, all kinds of flora growing about. The Man Mountain\u2019s pine and cypress trees, as well as the Qing Mao Mountain\u2019s distinctive green spear bamboo grew in continuous clumps, cluster after cluster. A wide expanse of dark green colour poured down in torrents from the mountaintop and flowed down to the foot of the mountain.Faraway mountains ranged endlessly, forming a muddled heavy black shadow under the moonlight.The tortuous and entwined mountain road resembled goat intestines as it meandered into the distance, occasionally sheltered away by the forest, stretching out all the way.Jia Fu and his group sat atop the Treasure Brass Toad, following the mountain road as they moved forward. As they continued on the leaping toad, their figures were finally covered away by the trees.Although the mountain terrain could not affect the Treasure Brass Toad\u2019s speed, Jia Fu did not dare to recklessly cut through Qing Mao mountain, for if he barges into a monster horde, even with his Rank four cultivation he would still not come out unscathed. Hence following the mountain trail and moving forward is the best path.Not long ago, Fang Yuan was standing on the hill holding an umbrella, sending the caravan off. But now he was here again, watching Jia Fu leave.\"The trouble from killing Jia Jin Sheng is finally settled.\" He eyes were dark and remote while his heart was calm, a bout of peacefulness.Even since he killed Jia Jin Sheng that night, he had been considering how to tie the loose ends.He was clear that without base or support, if the truth was revealed, the Gu Yue clan would definitely sacrifice him. But if he just hid it blindly, the truth was bound to get exposed one day.A smart way to lie, is to have truth and lies, some truth in his lies, and some lies in his truth.He had to direct the trouble elsewhere!This incident was like a chess game with two sides against each other. One side is Jia Fu\u2019s caravan, while the other is the Gu Yue clan. In this incident, be it Gu Yue Bo, the academy elder or Jia fu, they were all pawns, heck even Fang Yuan himself was just a pawn.To protect the pawn that represents himself, he had to use the two opposing sides and find a chance in between.Few days ago, Fang Yuan had already started plotting.He first made use of those two guards to come up with a good show with the academy elder at the academy. Next he hid the existence of the Liquor worm and stirred the curiosity of the clansman, gaining great attention, attracting the higher-ups. Simultaneously, he allowed the academy elder to hold private investigations.Next, he extorted his classmates and expressed his rashness, wildness and displeasure towards the clan, \"showing weakness\" to the Gu Yue higher-ups.Then he counted the days and waited for Jia Fu.During the interrogation he displayed his immaturity and fear, which allowed him to lead the other\u2019s thoughts by the nose. Letting them find out the \"truth\".Lastly he made use of the Gu Yue clan and Jia Fu\u2019s opposing interests, and turned the academy elder who was suspicious of him and held investigations, into his eye witness.The Bamboo Gentleman was a small unexpected accident, but it was still a Rank four Gu and under the Spring Autumn Cicada\u2019s aura, the Bamboo Gentleman ironically became Fang Yuan\u2019s greatest evidence.Finally, Fang Yuan not only explained perfectly where he got the Liquor worm, but also pushed the blame to the innocent Jia Gui, while he himself got out of this incident without losing a hair.\"Academy elder was asked to stay behind, it seems that Gu Yue Bo is going to interfere in the academy\u2019s matters and get rid of the plan to pressurize me. With his nature, he does have this tolerance. But his real motive isn\u2019t me, it should probably be Fang Zheng. One of my motives for blowing up the matter was to stir a commotion and make the higher-ups notice. If Gu Yue Bo doesn\u2019t show up, there will still be Gu Yue Mo Chen and Chi Lian who would come out to defend their reputation.\"\"As for Jia Fu, he should be certain that Jia Gui is the culprit now. With the flames of revenge burning in his chest, hehe, I am looking forward to it. With my interference, their sibling conflict would be elevated. I wonder if that Gu Master competition would be brought forward?\"\"Oh yes, there is still that divine investigator Tie Leng Xue. Tie Leng Xue... hmph.\" Fang Yuan repeated this name, and after half a beat, lightly smiled, \"Among the righteous path, this is indeed a character. Unfortunately he is riddled with official business and has a tight schedule. For this matter, it is not easy to get him to come. Jia Fu wants to show his attitude thus he has to invite him, but the time is hard to gauge, at the very least it should be arranged in two to three year\u2019s time.\"In two to three years, he would have Rank two or three cultivation. By then, life would be in a completely different sight.The night wind blew over with the fresh cool air of the mountains, penetrating with a kind of fragrance.Fang Yuan breathed in, feeling more refreshed.He looked into the distance, his field of view wide. The unrestrained mountains were picturesque, looking tranquil and auspicious under the moon.\"The bright moon illuminates among pines, the clear spring flows upon stone.\" Fang Yuan lightly recited, he could not help but think of a verse from a fable from Earth.There were a group of monkeys that pursued the moon. They saw the moon in the well, and they wanted to fish it up. The monkey from behind grabbed hold of the tail of the monkey before it, and the monkey before it grabbed ahold of the monkey in front of him. Thus this went on repeatedly until the first monkey was able to touch the water surface of the well.Once it stretched out its hand, the water rippled and the moon disappeared.People in this world were like this. They would see the reflection of the moon, and think that it is the real thing.Not knowing it was just the moon in the well, the moon in their eyes, or simply the moon in their hearts.\"In this life I hope to become the real moon, rising above the mountains and heavens, toying with the clouds and seas, following the ancient times and walk in the darkness above the various heavens.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes were crystal clear, and the beautiful green mountains were reflected on his pupils.On the hill, the thin body of a teenager stood silently.A golden moon wheel shaped like a disk suspended high in the night sky.It has existed since ancient times, travelling through the night sky, casting the small shadow of the teenager faintly onto the limestones.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe night sky of early summer is beautiful.There was not a single cloud floating in the sky, and the stars flickered like crystals, shining with emotionally moving radiance.Sandalwood crickets appeared on stage to take over the place of the dragonpill crickets, and they sang their emotional songs in the grassy bushes, creeks and tree branches.The Gu Yue Village was radiantly lit, as if it was reflecting the bright starry sky.One by one the dark green bamboo houses stood in the night wind, and beneath the star dome it had a tranquil and peaceful ambience.Fang Yuan was not in the village now, but he had snuck into the secret cave among the rock cracks.He half-kneeled on the ground, his hand caressing the image wall, his palm emitting a lump of blue-coloured moonlight.On the image wall, the original scene was already gone, and it was now no different from the other surrounding stone walls. If Fang Yuan did not remember this position, who else would know that hidden under this image wall was Flower Wine Monk\u2019s strength inheritance?On a night over a month ago, the image wall transformed and the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s secret hideout appeared. The image wall first showed a video of Flower Wine Monk bathed in blood, but proclaimed he was leaving his inheritance. Next was a line of bloody words, hinting for the discoverer to break the image wall and the cave opening would appear. Then the words vanished, and the image wall\u2019s Photo-audio Gu\u2019s strength was depleted, and the image wall went back to being an ordinary wall.Although he knew about the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance, Fang Yuan did not have the time to explore it.As it was an unexpected occurrence, he had to kill Jia Jin Sheng on the spot and was busy that night getting rid of the evidence. Towards the impending interrogation, he had to plot carefully and had restricted his activities inside the village.Until when Jia Fu left and after the academy elder stopped his investigations, about ten days later, the attention had waded and Fang Yuan could finally sneak back into the cave.In the aperture, the green copper sea was reducing as Fang Yuan deployed his primeval essence into the Moonlight Gu on his right palm.The Moonlight Gu emitted a gentle moonlight and flickered continuously. Under its effect, the rock wall was shaved off slowly, and large amounts of rock powder fell on the ground.This was Fang Yuan\u2019s extensive control of the Moonlight Gu, the same method he used to open the gambling rocks.Compared to opening rocks, this method was more coarse, but in breaking this thick rock wall, this method seemed a little too gentle.This was the sixth day that Fang Yuan was using the Moonlight Gu to shave the rock wall.On the floor was a thick pile of dark red coloured rock powder.Logically speaking, Qing Mao Mountain\u2019s soil was all green-coloured. But here, the soil were strangely bright red and emitted a dark glow.But fortunately so, because of this source of light, Fang Yuan did not need to prepare a torch.In order to avoid being suspected, Fang Yuan did not use any tools. Steel hammers and pickaxe were undoubtedly better for breaking the rock wall, but if he did, the sound of the wall breaking would reverb all over the area.Regardless of whether the outside world would hear a faint or loud noise, Fang Yuan wanted to eliminate all such possible suspicious points.Fine details often decided in one\u2019s victory or defeat.To Fang Yuan, being cautious is not just his good point, it was more like a habit to him.In his past life he had been careless and carefree, but he quickly paid a hefty price. There is a saying that goes, \u2018people get more cowardly when they age\u2019. Yet actually this is not cowardness, but patient cautiousness. 500 years of experience ingrained the word caution into his soul.\"Puff...\" Taking in a deep breath, Fang Yuan slowly stopped the transmission of his primeval essence.He plopped onto the ground, extremely exhausted.He had dug around three inches of thickness out of the entire slab of image wall that was the height of half a man.Fang Yuan wiped the sweat off his forehead while exercising his shoulders and stretching his legs. Due to long hours of squatting, a sense of numbness was felt from his legs.\u2018Knock, knock, knock\u2019.Fang Yuan bent his fingers and knocked on the rock wall.Hearing the sound, he was slightly happy in his heart, as he could tell the wall was getting thinner.Closing his eyes to meditate, he checked the situation inside his aperture once again.The green copper primeval essence had less than 20% left.\"Continue working hard!\" Fang Yuan grit his teeth and stretched out his right hand again on the rock wall.The water-blue coloured moonlight sustained a glow for around fifteen minutes, then Fang Yuan suddenly halted his actions. He took out his right arm and found out that the rock wall had a small hole in it already.He immediately stood up and kicked.With a thunderous noise, the hole expanded and became as big as a bamboo basket.Fang Yuan cautiously took a few steps backwards. He felt a sense of staleness emitting from the hole and permeating into this secret cave.The secret cave\u2019s ventilation was not good. Fang Yuan thought about it for a moment and decided to leave the rock crack, returning to the outside world.Only after a while did he return.The stale feeling in the cave was slightly better than earlier, and Fang Yuan continued to expand the size of the hole, sometimes using the Moonlight Gu, and at other times using his hands to dig, or his legs to kick. After a while, he finally expanded the hole into a size that he could fit into.Looking from the hole, there was a diagonal path downwards.The path was initially narrow, but the deeper it was, the wider it got. A person must lower their head when entering at first, but towards the latter half of the path, they are able to take large strides with straightened backs.The cave\u2019s walls were a weird red soil colour, emitting a faint red glow. This caused the passage\u2019s interior to be visible.But the path was very long and extended beyond what the eye could see. Due to the angle, Fang Yuan could not see what was at the end of the path.He stood at the cave entrance and did not immediately step in, instead squinting and standing on the spot.A strength inheritance was not like a legacy inheritance.Legacy was when a Gu Master died and left behind his belongings. Those who find this legacy can find the items on the corpse.A strength inheritance is when a Gu Master who is on the verge of death and reluctant to let his legacy go extinct, or to benefit the future generations, or wants to leave behind his last trace of existence in the world, purposely set hurdles to test the people who arrive.Taking the Flower Wine Monk for example, he set up this inheritance with a clear objective - it is to nurture an avenger, to take revenge on the Gu Yue clan!If the person who comes along is able to pass these trials he(she) would obtain all sorts of benefits. The person who gets through the final test would obtain the entire strength inheritance.According to the two factions, strength inheritance is split into the righteous inheritance and the demonic inheritance.Righteous inheritances often had exquisite design, to test the nature and character of the person. Those who fail midway, would not be in any mortal danger.Demonic inheritance was more complex.Those demonic cultivators were often insane and persistent, cold-blooded, or a mass murderer, unable to be assessed by normal standards.Some demonic inheritances had trials that tested the mind. With lots of mind-boggling decisions to make, a lot of people would fall into deep and painful thoughts without getting a single result.Some demonic inheritances were extremely simple, being a secret room with Gu worms and primeval stones inside.Some demonic inheritances were extremely cruel, and failure midway often spelled death.Some were more extreme - a few demonic cultivator\u2019s inheritances were a huge lie, being a giant trap itself. They followed the rules of \u2018bringing someone down with them\u2019, and even right before dying, they would set up this trial and trick others.\"Which type does Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance belong to?\" Fang Yuan thought deeply.With his previous life\u2019s memories, he was clear of any future famous demonic inheritances. But this one in particular, no one discovered it in his lifetime, and Fang Yuan was left unaware of the details.\"By right, the chances of a trap isn't high. Otherwise the Flower Wine Monk would not design this image wall. But is there a hidden mechanism?\"Fang Yuan picked up a rock and threw it into the cave.The rock rolled in the path and quickly rolled out of Fang Yuan\u2019s sight; he could hear a series of colliding sounds echoing in the cave.Fang Yuan fell into deep thought. The rock testing results showed that it was safe.But he did not enter the path yet, and instead took out some rock powder and spread it around the entrance of the secret cave. At the same time, he spread a layer on the rock crack entrance.Next, he squeezed out of the narrow rock crack and left the place.Around a few hundred meters from the river in a hidden bush, he found the green bamboo wine that he had brought along this time. Opening the seal, he drank a huge mouthful and purposely spilled some of the liquor, getting it on his clothes and making him smell of alcohol.Carrying the wine, he went back to the village, and upon reaching the school hostel, it was exactly midnight.If he did not return at night often, people would get suspicious. This was better, going out early at night and returning late at night.When finding the Liquor worm, Fang Yuan already did this, and with that background, such behaviour was not peculiar.The stars fade and the sun appears, a night of silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bright morning sun shone on Qing Mao Mountain.In the academy, the elder spoke about important details. \"Tomorrow, we are choosing the second Gu worm for refinement. Everyone here has experience in successfully refining Gu worms, and this time you can solidify your experiences. For the selection of the second Gu worm, consider it carefully. With the experience of cultivating these few days and understanding of your own body, consider it as a whole. Normally, it is best if you pair the second Gu well with your vital Gu.\"A Gu Master\u2019s first Gu was known as the vital Gu, and once it was chosen it would be the footing stone of their development. After that, the second and third Gu worm would be nurtured upon this footing stone and decide the Gu Master\u2019s cultivating direction.After hearing the academy elder\u2019s words, the youngsters began to ponder, and only Fang Yuan was sleeping soundly on the table.He had worked hard for half the night yesterday, and after returning to the hostel, he still continued in his Gu Master cultivation, nurturing his aperture. When the sun had risen, only then did he sleep.The academy elder looked at Fang Yuan and frowned, but did not say anything.Ever since the clan leader spoke to him, he had adopted a \u2018let Fang Yuan do as he wishes, I am not going to give a care\u2019 attitude.\"Which Gu worm should I choose?\" As the students thought about it, they subconsciously looked towards Fang Yuan.\"Speaking of which, Fang Yuan already has his second Gu worm.\"\"Yeah, that is but a Liquor worm; to actually get a Liquor worm out of gambling rocks, his luck is off the charts!\"\"If I had the Liquor worm, I would advance to middle stage first too huh?\"The students\u2019 thoughts varied, having admirers and jealous people among them.Ever since that day after the interrogation, Fang Yuan\u2019s Liquor worm was successfully exposed. The origins of the liquor worm did not raise suspicion. The clansmen were both enlightened and also exasperated at Fang Yuan\u2019s luck.\"Why don\u2019t I have such luck, sigh!\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng who was also a C grade talent sighed deeply in his heart.Quite a while ago, his grandfather had asked around and tried to procure a Liquor worm for him. To think that even as a family branch\u2019s inheritor, he was not able to have one; to think Fang Yuan managed to get the Liquor worm before him.Compared to Chi Cheng\u2019s envy and depression, vice chairman Fang Zheng was full of spirit.\"Brother, I will definitely surpass you.\" He looked at Fang Yuan and said in his heart before looking away.These days his eyes were shining with light, and he felt a sort of excitement towards life. His face was flushing red and his forehead was glowing, even his steps were quicker and lighter.The academy elder saw all of it, and immediately understood that the Gu Yue clan leader had started secretly teaching Fang Zheng.These underhand methods were obviously not for the public to know.The academy elder turned a blind eye to this.Soon it was night once more.Fang Yuan entered the secret cave again.Ring ring ring\u2026...In his hand, a wild rabbit was struggling, and there was a bell was on its neck.This was a wild rabbit that Fang Yuan caught on the mountain, the bell was naturally attached by him.After a day, the stuffy smell in the secret cave has dissipated, and the air was fresh.The cave\u2019s passage entrance was open; it was silent inside. Fang Yuan half-kneeled on the floor as he inspected the floor. Yesterday he had sprayed rock powder all over the area, and this thin layer of powder was inconspicuous.\"The passage entrance\u2019s rock powder is intact, thus it seems that during my absence, nothing strange has crawled out of it. The rock crack entrance does have a footprint, but that\u2019s mine, so evidently no one else had come here.\" Fang Yuan felt at ease after his inspection.He stood up, using his hands to pull the dead vines from the wall. Next he sat on the ground and his leg was used to hold the wild rabbit in place, leaving his two hands free to weave the vines.This was work that normal Gu Masters wouldn\u2019t know, but Fang Yuan had too much life experience. In his past life, many a time was he so poor that he couldn\u2019t afford to feed his Gu worms, leaving them to starve to death one by one.For a time, he had primeval essence but no Gu worms; he became just like a mortal person, even living was difficult. Having no choice, he learned to weave the grass ropes into straw sandals, hats etc. and sold them in exchange for primeval stone fragments to feed himself.While twisting the grass ropes in his hands, Fang Yuan\u2019s memories resurfaced.The anguish and suffering from back then had transformed into his soundless laughter now. The rabbit underneath his foot continued to struggle, the bell ringing nonstop.A pair of two strings touch for long, ten thousands of twists and thousands of returns make their inseparable love numerous. (1)Delicately and slowly, with the passing of years, letting them converge. Complications, entanglements and turns present.Weaving the grass ropes, isn\u2019t it just like experiencing life?In the secret cave, the red light shone onto Fang Yuan\u2019s face, showing his youthfulness and experience intertwining together on his face.Time seemed to have stopped too, silently appreciating the young man weaving his ropes.Ring ring ring...An hour later, the wild rabbit rapidly entered the passageway, the bell on its neck ringing continuously. In a few breaths it left Fang Yuan\u2019s field of vision.Fang Yuan held onto the improvised grass rope that he wove temporarily, and on one end the rope was attached to the rabbit\u2019s hind leg, dragging into the tunnel with it.After a while, the rope stopped all movement.But this did not mean the rabbit had reached the end of the tunnel. It could have been killed by a trap or just decided to take a rest midway.Fang Yuan began to pull at the rope, retrieving it. The rope gradually tightened as he tugged.On the other end, a force of strength suddenly tugged back as the rope started to move towards the cave again.Evidently the rabbit on the other side had felt the tugging force and in its fluster, started to move deeper into the cave.After many attempts, the rabbit finally reached the end of the path, and no matter how Fang Yuan tugged at the rope, it only tightened and relaxed.Maybe the rabbit had reached the end of the tunnel, or maybe it had fallen into a trap and got stuck.It was simple to test and find out the answer.Fang Yuan started to retrieve the rope. His strength surpassed the rabbit by a mile, and eventually he dragged the rabbit out by force.The rabbit struggled at the other end, but the rope was made from materials acquired from the Wine Sack Flower Gu and Rice Pouch Grass Gu. Although it had been dead for years, it remained sturdy unlike normal grass.The wild rabbit was once again in Fang Yuan\u2019s hands jumping about. Fang Yuan inspected the wild rabbit and saw that it had no injuries, then he finally breathed out in relief.\"For now, it seems that this segment of the passageway is safe.\"With this result, the rabbit thus lost its value and Fang Yuan killed it instantly, throwing the corpse on the ground.He could not let the rabbit go, for animals also had memories. If it came back again, and like the Liquor worm, attracted outsiders, that would be very bad.He breathed in deeply. After several tries and probes, he finally stepped into the passageway carefully.Even with the wild rabbit exploring, there were many traps and mechanisms that specially targeted only humans. A small animal like the wild rabbit would be unable to trigger it. Thus, Fang Yuan still had to be careful.The tunnel was straight, diagonally slanting towards the bottom. The deeper it was, the wider and taller the passage became.Fang Yuan had to lower his head when entering at first, but after more than fifty steps, he was able to take large strides with a straightened back, and after a hundred steps, he could walk while lifting his upper arms and brandishing them left and right.The tunnel was not that long, it was only around 300 meters. But Fang Yuan spent around two hours venturing before he finally reached the end of the path.On the way, he was vigilant and explored step by step. At the end of the path, he was already sweating profusely.\"It is so troublesome without a detection Gu worm.\" Fang Yuan wiped the sweat off his forehead and after confirming his safety, calmed down and inspected the area.This time at one glance, he was stunned.At the end of the tunnel, there was a huge rock. The rock\u2019s surface was smooth and protruded towards Fang Yuan\u2019s direction, resembling Jia Fu\u2019s belly.This rock alone halted Fang Yuan\u2019s progression.Other than this huge rock, there was nothing around Fang Yuan.\"Is it because of an accident that the tunnel path was blocked, causing this?\" Fang Yuan squinted as he thought about the possibilities.Before the Flower Wine Monk died, he was eager to set up the inheritance. He used the Thousand Li Earthwolf Spider and created a tunnel path. The path led deep within the mountains and to guide the inheritor in.After hundreds of years, the passage was unable to withstand the corrosion of time and at one point, one of the areas collapsed due to lack of maintenance.All sorts of accidents often happen in life.\"If this is the case, won\u2019t I be stuck at this point?\" He went forward and touched the rock. This rock was halting his progression, its size was like a door, one could only imagine its overall thickness.Fang Yuan could use the Moonlight Gu to carve away at the rock wall, but if he wanted to grind off this huge rock, it would take at least a year or two.\"It seems like I\u2019m forced to use tools, I\u2019ll need to use spades and pickaxes to break the rock. Except if I do this, I might reveal some traces. The construction sounds might also travel out.\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan frowned deeply. He was weighing the pros and cons.If the risk was too huge, he would rather give up this strength inheritance.After all, if others found out this secret, all the plotting and acting that Fang Yuan had done would go to waste, and his life would even be in danger!(1) Seems to be a line from a poem.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sun rises, signifying the arrival of another day.The students lined up properly, faces flushed with excitement as they stood before the academy Gu storage room.Today was the day where they would pick their second Gu!As the first to advance to middle stage, Fang Yuan had the priority in choosing, thus he stood at the front of the queue.Behind him was Gu Yue Mo Chen, Gu Yue Fang Zheng and Gu Yue Chi Cheng.Creak.The Gu storage room\u2019s door was opened by the guards, and Fang Yuan was the first to set foot into it.The Gu room was not big, but was a sight to behold. The surrounding walls had square holes in them, some were big but others were small, holding all sorts of containers in them.There was rock pots, jade pots, cages made of weaved grass, and some porcelain ware.All sorts of Gu worms, being all Rank one, were stored in these containers. The academy probably spent more than 1000 primeval stones every day just to feed these Gu worms.Fang Yuan glanced through and found that in many containers, they were already empty, having no Gu worms inside.The Gu worms in the storage room were replenished once a year. Previously when they were choosing their vital Gu, most of the youngsters chose the Moonlight Gu, thus the storage room had no moonlight Gu left at the moment.The storage room had no windows, there was only a small skylight at the rooftop.The sunlight shone in from the skylight and formed a rectangular golden image on the ground.The first time when he entered the Gu room, Fang Yuan already had an objective and chose the Moonlight Gu immediately. But now, he had several possible targets in his mind.Yet these targets also depended on whether there was stock in the storage room.Fang Yuan moved along the left wall and strolled inside slowly while examining the catalogue.Five steps later, he paused.A square box frame near his shoulder had a bronze bowl inside, and within it was a Gu worm.This Gu worm was like a bedbug, flat and wide with a small head, having an oval body. It was yellow-orange throughout, and emitted a faint bronze-like glow.This was the Bronze Skin Gu, the choice for most close-combat Gu Masters. The academy\u2019s martial arts instructor raised such a Gu, and once activated, causes the body to glow yellow, greatly raising defense.Fang Yuan\u2019s knowledge was deep and broad, so of course he did not have any urge for this Gu. He continued forward and saw a Stone Skin Gu.The Stone Skin Gu and Bronze Skin Gu were similar in appearance, but the Stone Skin Gu\u2019s body was grey instead, like an art piece made of rock.After six Stone Skin Gu, there was the Iron Skin Gu.Iron Skin Gu and Bronze Skin Gu were outwardly similar but with only a tiny difference. It was silently staying in a iron bowl, unmoving. It emitted a black iron-like glow around its body.As humans have clans, so do Gu.The three Gu that Fang Yuan saw simultaneously were all from the same series. They were similar in appearance and had similar effects.\"Iron Skin, Bronze Skin, Rock Skin, Jade Skin Gu\u2026.. if there is a Jade Skin Gu, I might as well choose it.\" Fang Yuan mumbled as his heart felt a tiny flicker of expectation rising, and he continued walking.However he was destined to be disappointed, for after the Iron Skin Gu, he saw the Beast Skin Gu.The Jade Skin Gu and Beast Skin Gu belonged to the same series as the Bronze Skin Gu etc. But they had great difference in value - the Beast Skin Gu was the most common, even cheaper than the Rock Skin Gu, but it had more evolutionary lines and could fuse with more varieties of Gu.The Jade Skin Gu was the most rare Gu in this series. Its market value was only second to the Liquor worm, and at times the price would fluctuate and rival with the Liquor worm itself.Fang Yuan took a look, but he did not find a Jade Skin Gu. He was not disappointed, but laughed in relief, \"Gu Yue village is just a middle-sized clan, the academy Gu storage room is only of middle tier quality. To have a Jade Skin Gu, that is rather impossible.\"The left side of the wall had already been inspected, so Fang Yuan swapped to another wall and continued strolling.On this wall, there was mostly the Longhorn Beetle Gu.Similar to the Skin Gu series, Longhorn Beetle Gu was a large clan among the Rank one Gu worms.Their outer appearances were similar - they had long and circular cylinder figures, the back area having many outlines. A large part of the body was a black colour, giving out a metallic luster. It had a pair of feelers that were long and exceeded the body size; its chin was strong and it gave out screeching noises, like the sound of timber being sawed. With this, a few Gu Masters from some places would call them as the \u2018sawing tree bunch\u2019.What first entered Fang Yuan\u2019s vision was a Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu.Its entire body was a red metallic colour, and it had a pair of antennae that was coarser than the usual Longhorn Beetle ones. On the top surface of the antenna there was a bamboo joint-like growth with every small interval.This Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu was highly sought after in the market; earlier the caravan that came to the Gu Yue village had people who sold large numbers of this Gu.The Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu gave Gu Masters temporary super strength. It had the reputation of the strength of one bull, and could sustain for five breaths.But it had two weaknesses.One was that every activation consumed too much primeval essence. Rank one middle stage required 10% primeval essence, but if converted to initial stage, it would consume 20%.Another was sequela. If the Gu Master had a weak constitution, using this Gu a lot would cause their muscles to get injured, even experiencing muscle tearing. Only Gu Masters with a strong body would choose to use this Gu. A small-sized person like Fang Yuan was unsuitable for it.Fang Yuan knew this too, and walked past the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, continuing to look around.\"Oh? This is not bad.\" He halted his steps.It was a Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle Gu.The beetle\u2019s figure was a tiny bit thinner and longer than the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, the entire body coated in dark yellow colour. Its pair of long feelers did not have bamboo joints, and the roots were yellow in colour, slowly fading into black at the tip.The Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu could grant a Gu Master temporary strength, and this type of strength was immediate, only lasting for five breaths. But the Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle Gu could grant the Gu Master durability and allow their stamina expenditure to be greatly reduced, however it could only sustain for fifteen minutes. At the same time it had no repercussions.Among the Rank one Gu worms, the Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle had high market value, comparable to the Moonlight Gu and only losing to the Jade Skin Gu and Liquor worm.Fang Yuan inspected the surroundings and found that there was only one Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle.\"The Gu is not bad, but it is not compatible with me.\" Fang Yuan shook his head, giving up this Gu.Very quickly he walked and reached the corner of the wall, having finished looking at the second wall, but he was not satisfied.The Gu in the storage room were only of this quality, and if he wanted to get lucky or get a surprise Gu, the chances were slim.Fang Yuan turned to the third wall and continued inspecting.On this wall, the Boar Gu were dominant.Boar Gu was a series among the Gu worm.There\u2019s the Flower Boar Gu, Pink Boar Gu, Black Boar Gu and White Boar Gu.Pink Boar Gu had the least value, almost no Gu Masters chose them. It only had one ability, and that is to gain weight. After a Gu Master injects their primeval essence, the Pink Boar Gu would change their constitution and cause them to get fat. No matter how skinny they were, they would be able to become a big fat person.There was only two to three Pink Boar Gu in the storage room, obviously of no nurturing value.The Flower Boar Gu was the most abundant, having a dozen at least lining into a row. These Gu worms had flower patterns on the surface, either white and black, black and pink, or white and pink. There were even some that had all three colours.The Flower Boar Gu\u2019s use was similar to the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, temporarily adding strength to the Gu master.The Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu gave one bull\u2019s strength, and the Flower Boar Gu gave one boar\u2019s strength. The Flower Boar Gu spent the same amount of primeval essence as the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu but could sustain for ten breaths, twice of the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu.This was because the Gu Master gained lesser strength, thus lesser side effects.\"The Flower Boar Gu is the most common Gu worm, and it is sold most abundantly in the market. It\u2019s price is half of the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, truly value for money. But among the Boar Gu clan, only those two last Gu has greater value, being even more expensive than the Jade Skin Gu and Liquor worm!\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes showed a light of deep thoughts.A Black Boar Gu or a White Boar Gu could sell for 600 primeval stones in the market. Once it appeared, it was often sold immediately.The Black and White Boar Gu\u2019s ability was to change the Gu Master\u2019s body constitution and raise their strength permanently.Although the Brute Force Longhorn Beetle could grant a bull\u2019s strength, it could only last five breaths, uses too much energy to sustain and had strong after-effects.The Black and White Boar\u2019s strength increment, although little at a time, would be accumulative over time and once obtained, the strength would belong to the Gu Master wholly. Even if the Gu dies, this strength will still remain on the Gu Master\u2019s body.This is the reason why the Black and White Boar Gu\u2019s value is higher than the LiquorWorm.The public recognises that the Liquor worm\u2019s value should be slightly inferior to the Black or White Boar Gu.The Liquor worm can only refine primeval essence, and after an intense battle, a Gu Master\u2019s primeval essence is easily depleted. For the remainder of the battle, they can only rely on their martial arts and their physical strength. This is when the White and Black Gu show their worth; they are more reliable than the Liquor worm.\"If I can refine a Black Boar Gu or White Boar Gu, that would be good.\" Fang Yuan was just imagining the scenario, but with this type of Gu storage room which only has one Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle, how can there be White or Black Boar Gu which are so rare?He walked another round and saw all the Gu worms the room had to offer. As expected, there was nothing that truly captivated him.At last, he retrieved a Little Light Gu at a corner of the wall.There were five Little Light Gu in the storage room.This Gu was oddly shaped, looking like a pentagram, and only half as large as a fingernail.The Little Light Gu was mainly paired with the Moonlight Gu, a common assistance-type Gu worm for the Moonlight Gu. To Fang Yuan had chosen this Gu, it was merely an average option, but at least it suited his development path.\"Fang Yuan is out.\"\"Geez, finally out after so long.\"\"I wonder what Gu he chose?\"\"He already has the Liquor worm, this is his third Gu, maybe he won\u2019t be able to raise them properly. Hehe.\"Fang Yuan leisurely walked out of the storage room. The students were outside for such a long time and had started to become restless.\"It\u2019s my turn! I wonder what Gu has Fang Yuan chosen?\" Once Gu Yue Mo Chen saw Fang Yuan stepping out he hurriedly took big steps and entered the storage room.He checked and found that the sole Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle was still there. Mo Chen could not refrain from becoming overjoyed, immediately taking it away.Afterwards, Fang Zheng went in.\"I have the Moonlight Gu for offense, but I lack a defensive-type Gu worm.\" Gu Yue Fang Zheng after long consideration, decided to choose a Bronze Skin Gu.Gu Yue Chi Cheng was the fourth to enter.\"I need an evasion ability, so in future battles I will be able to hit others, but others cannot hit me. I\u2019ll be virtually unbeatable.\" He looked left and right, and finally chose a Dragonpill cricket Gu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Gifting the jade skin under the moon; white boar hidden in the ground flowerTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe sun lowers and the moon rises, the signal of the arrival of nightfall.This was one of the concealed courtyards in the Gu Yue Village.A locust tree that stood with complicated branches and luxuriant leaves, its robust and spacious treetop that was like a jasper imperial canopy, enveloped the entire courtyard.The moonlight was gentle like water, travelling through the leaves and branches of the locust tree, spilling into the courtyard.A gust of wind blew over, sending the tree leaves rustling, the shadows of the tree swaying slightly.It was under this tree that two people stood.Gu Yue Bo used a gentle gaze and looked at Fang Zheng. \"Fang Zheng, today you chose your second Gu, I wonder what it is?\"\"Reporting to clan leader sir, today I chose a Bronze Skin Gu.\" Gu Yue Fang Zheng stood rigid, saying with a look of admiration.Gu Yue Bo nodded, and after pondering he replied, \"Not bad, it is a good choice.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng stood before Gu Yue Bo, his body tensed and tightened. Hearing Gu Yue Bo\u2019s praise, he did not know how to reply for a while, so in the end he only laughed, \"Clan leader, I chose randomly.\"\"You think I\u2019m not serious in praising you? No.\" Gu Yue Bo stared at Fang Zheng, a smile on his face, \"Do you know? From choosing a Gu, it shows a person\u2019s disposition.\"\"You chose the Bronze Skin Gu for defense. Paired with the Moonlight Gu, it is both offense and defense. This shows your pure nature. In this world, offense and defense are like frontal and ambush, yin and yang, soft and hard, this is the king\u2019s path.\"\"Gu Yue Mo Bei chose the Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle, this Gu grants stamina and allows him to sustain battle. This shows his stubborn and strong attitude.\"\"As for Gu Yue Chi Cheng, he chose the Dragonpill cricket Gu, allowing him to increase his dodging ability. This shows he does not like frontal attacks, being a witty person, good at tactics, but also showed the weakness in his character.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng was stunned after listening, for he did not expect that such a simple matter could reveal that much information and logic.Consequently, his attitude towards Gu Yue Bo became even more respectful.\"Clan leader, what did my brother choose?\" Fang Zheng thought of Fang Yuan and immediately asked.Gu Yue Bo laughed, \"He chose the Little Light Gu, this Gu is used to assist the Moonlight Gu and can make the moonblade attack stronger. This shows his extreme, active and invasive personality.\"\"Indeed, big brother seems to be like that.\" Fang Zheng muttered.Gu Yue Bo took Fang Zheng\u2019s expression into consideration and etched it into his mind.Those who were rulers had their unique ability. Although Gu Yue Bo and Fang Zheng did not interact for long, Gu Yue Bo\u2019s experienced gaze had already seen through Fang Zheng.Him telling Fang Zheng about Mo Bei and Chi Cheng\u2019s decisions had deeper meaning.It was to help Fang Zheng analyze these two people, for he anticipated him defeating the two of them and establishing the role of clan leader with his A grade talent.But Gu Yue Bo would not say it out loud, and would not instigate Fang Zheng\u2019s actions.As the clan leader, his every word and action had political implications. If he directly controlled Fang Zheng and dealt with Chi Cheng and Mo Bei, if words spread it might be misunderstood as the clan leader\u2019s political assault. If that\u2019s the case, the implication would be huge and it might even cause a clan dispute, harming the entire village.There was another point - Gu Yue Bo was waiting for Fang Zheng to understand his intentions. He spent time and effort to nurture Fang Zheng, but it was not to nurture a Rank four or five fighter. A fighter without political knowledge was like a double edged sword. He needed the future leader for the clan!\"I analyzed Mo Bei and Chi Cheng\u2019s personality for Fang Zheng, but he did not notice my intention, instead asking about Fang Yuan\u2019s situation. It seems that he has great trauma regarding Fang Yuan, but he is also at his rebellious stage. He wants to beat Fang Yuan, that\u2019s understandable. Sigh, if only Fang Zheng had Fang Yuan\u2019s intelligence, I\u2019ve seen many youngsters these years, but when it comes to political wits, Fang Yuan tops them all. It is a pity he only has C grade talent.\"]Gu Yue Bo sighed internally but his smile got even more gentle.He took out a Gu worm from his pocket.\"This is ----- Jade Skin Gu?\" Fang Zheng on seeing this Gu worm, said lightly with his eyes wide open.Gu Yue Bo said, \"Compared to the Bronze Skin Gu, this Jade Skin Gu is much better, not only using less primeval essence but also gives greater defense. Fang Zheng, do you want it?\"\"Clan leader!\" Fang Zheng was shocked and he looked at Gu Yue Bo, stuttering, \"I\u2026 of course I want it.\"\"I can give it to you.\" Gu Yue Bo laughed even more amicably, \"But as the clan leader, I have to be impartial and cannot give it to you for no reason, thus I have a condition.\"Fang Zheng nodded repeatedly, staring widely, \"What condition?\"Gu Yue Bo\u2019s smile vanished, showing a stern expression, \"I want you to be the first to breakthrough Rank one into Rank two, be the first place in terms of cultivation! And this Jade Skin Gu is your advancement reward.\"\"Ah, advance to Rank two?\" Gu Yue Fang Zheng hesitated for a moment. He had just become Rank one middle stage; after middle stage was upper stage, and after that there was still peak stage.But now Gu Yue Bo wanted to him to be the first person to advance to Rank two.\"What\u2019s wrong, are you afraid? Then I can only give this Gu to others.\" Gu Yue Bo pretended to keep the Jade Skin Gu.Fang Zheng was incited by this sentence, immediately his brain heated up as he shouted, \"No, I promise you! I will defeat everyone and be the first Rank two cultivator!\"\"That\u2019s the way.\" Gu Yue Bo showed his gentle smile again, placing the Jade Skin Gu on Fang Zheng\u2019s hand.He thought in his heart, \"Fang Zheng, I know you feel inferior, but this inferiority complex is too harmful to your growth. The best way to dispel your inferiority is success. You have A grade talent, so advancing to Rank two first is your greatest advantage, and also the easiest success you can achieve. You must succeed, for if you fail even this, I would be too disappointed.\"At the same time, Fang Yuan stepped into the secret cave behind the rock crack again, getting into the end of the tunnel.This time, he did not bring any steel spade, pickaxe or hammer, but carefully observed the surroundings. He was discouraged by this setback the previous night, and on the way back to the village he felt something amiss.Only today in the dormitory where he used the Spring Autumn Cicada to refine the Little Light Gu did he suddenly understand the weird part of this situation.\"This huge rock blocking my path is too round and smooth, this is definitely man made. That is to say, the Flower Wine Monk purposely set this to block to path, but why did he set this hurdle at such a place?\" Fang Yuan pondered.He looked at the surroundings again.The ground of the path was smooth and the top was curved; the walls on both sides were red soil, emitting a red light.\"Eh?\" When he looked at the ground again, he found a point of suspicion.The ground near the giant rock was slightly darker in colour. This colour difference was not very obvious and not easily found under such a dimly lit environment.Fang Yuan knelt down, touching the ground, feeling a sense of wetness.No wonder the colour was darker, it was wet.But this path was so dry, where was the water coming from?Fang Yuan grinded the soil with his fingers, finding out that the soil on this patch of earth had issues. It was very soft and loose, not lumpy like the dry red soil.Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone. Experience and intuition told him that this area had the \u2018key\u2019 that the Flower Wine Monk had hidden.And this \u2018key\u2019 was the clue that would allow him to continue moving forward.Fang Yuan began to dig the soil. It was loose so he did not spend much effort.After digging for around an inch deeper, there was a peculiar fragrance rushing into Fang Yuan\u2019s nostrils.\"This fragrance is thick and luxurious yet not common, it seems delicate and elegant, could it be...\" Fang Yuan\u2019s heart moved as he thought of a possibility, his hands moving even faster.While digging, the area under the soil suddenly emitted a faint dark gold light.\"It really is what I\u2019m thinking of!\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone, his hand movement becoming more delicate, carefully digging the surrounding soil away, expanding this hole.After a while, a dark gold-coloured flower bud that was buried under the ground appeared in front of him.It was two inches deep in the ground, around the size of a stone mill, the bud\u2019s surface delicate and with the dark gold colour, it appeared to be mysterious and elegant.\"It really is the Earth Treasury Flower Gu!\" Seeing this, Fang Yuan breathed out deeply.He was not eager in peeling away the flower petals, but took a rest on the ground instead, wiping the soil off his hands. Then he slowly stretched his hand and pried open the dark gold-coloured petals.The Earth Treasury Flower Gu was like the combination of a lotus and kale. Its petals were tightly knitted together with numerous thick pieces, slippery when felt. As Fang Yuan opened the petals one by one, it was like revealing thick layers of silk.Once it left the main body, the huge dark gold-coloured petals would disperse quickly. It was like snowflakes that melted into the air.After uncovering around fifty to sixty pieces of petals, the bud had shrunk in half, revealing the flower core.The core\u2019s petals were smaller and thinner, its texture becoming more smooth and fine. It was no longer like silk, but more like thin pieces of paper. .Fang Yuan\u2019s movements became gentler and slower, only opening a piece of petal in a few breaths.The petals became increasingly transparent, and after a while, when Fang Yuan had opened the pieces of thin paper-like petals, he stopped his movements.The Earth Treasury Flower Gu at this moment only had a last layer of petals left.These petals overlapped each other, forming a fist-sized ball.The petals were translucent, thin as paper. Inside these petals contained a golden liquid and in the middle of this liquid, a Gu worm was sleeping inside.Fang Yuan looked intently, but he could only see a blurry shadow of the Gu worm, and he could not tell which Gu it was.He was close to it, and his breath was blown on the flower core. The spherical flower core began to shake, the golden liquid also moving gently inside the petals.Gu worms would die without food, and only a few Gu worms could seal themselves. To protect and conserve Gu worms, Gu Masters have had thought of many methods.The Earth Treasury Flower Gu was one of them.It was a one-time use type Gu, and once implanted on the ground, it could not be moved.Its food was simple, which was earth energy. As long as it was planted on the ground, it would be able to survive with sufficient earth energy.It only had one use, and that is to contain a Gu within the flower heart and immerse the Gu in the golden liquid.This golden nectar could to an extent, imitate the sealing state and let Gu worms fall into hibernation.\"The Flower Wine Monk planted this Earth Treasury Flower Gu, so the Gu within has to be for the inheritor.\" Fang Yuan stretched out a finger and peeled the remaining petals carefully, revealing an opening.The golden liquid flowed out along his finger, feeling like soybean oil.The flower core began to soften with the loss of the golden liquid. Fang Yuan moved his finger and the petals were split, allowing him to retrieve the slumbering Gu worm.It was a cute ladybug. Only the size of the thumb\u2019s fingernail.Its body was a milky white colour, and if overlooked from the back, it was like a circle.Its head only occupied a small area, while the rest of the body was its large fat stomach and bright shiny exoskeleton.Its six tiny limbs were also cream coloured, hidden under its stomach.\"White Boar Gu!\" Fang Yuan showed an expression of joy on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe temperature these few days had gotten higher.The sun shone intensely in the afternoon, hanging right over everyone\u2019s head.The caravan left and the inn\u2019s business fell again.Fang Yuan stepped into the cafeteria, immediately attracting the attention of the shop assistants.A familiar face rushed over and gave him a flattering smile. \"Oh, young master, you\u2019re here! Please take a seat!\"\"Give me a jar of wine and cut me 600g of beef, and serve a few side dishes.\" Fang Yuan strode through the cafeteria and approached the window seat that he always sat at.The shop assistant showed a difficult expression, \"Young master, my apologies but during the last time the caravan came, the innkeeper sold all of the green bamboo wine. We do not have this wine here anymore.\"Fang Yuan nodded, not feeling surprised, \"Then give me a jar of rice wine and tell the innkeeper, brew more green bamboo wine this year, I am pre-ordering a hundred jars. As for how much the advance payment will be, you can count first and report to me.\"Now that the Liquor worm was exposed and did not gather any suspicion, Fang Yuan did not have to be restrained in buying wine anymore.\"Alright, I will definitely convey your words! Please be at ease young master.\" The shop assistant patted his chest, sounding confident.Soon, the dishes were served.Fang Yuan drank and ate while staring out of the window.In such hot weather, especially during meal times, there were few people on the streets.The sunlight shone on the ground and the green coloured bamboo tall-houses.A few barefooted mortal farmers carrying cement, steel spades or shoulder poles walked in front. They had just finished their farm work, and were heading home.Two children held the bamboo frame of their windmill toy and ran about. The one behind chased while crying and shouting; it seems that the boy in front had stolen his windmill toy.At this moment, two young Gu Masters wearing green belts walked hurriedly on the street.\"Get lost, don\u2019t block the way!\" A Gu Master pushed the farmer in front of him.The farmers frantically gave way.\"Hmph.\" The two young Gu Masters walked through arrogantly.Fang Yuan looked with a distracted gaze in his eyes, as part of his mind was already focused on his aperture.Within the aperture, the water wall continued to flow as his green copper primeval sea rose with raging waves.The Liquor worm was playing around in his primeval sea, at times comfortably rolling around, and at times curling into a ball.The Spring Autumn Cicada was in deep slumber, hiding its appearance.The round body of the White Boar Gu spread its wings and drew circles in the sky.The White and Black Boar Gu were equally well-known, both being precious and rare Rank one Gu worms. Their market value was even greater than the Liquor worm.Although they had the same usage and similar appearance, their future advancement routes were greatly different.The Black Boar Gu and the Green Silk Gu would combine into the Rank two Black Mane Gu, and then into the Rank 3 Steel Mane Gu.But the White Boar Gu was most compatible with the Jade Skin Gu, where it would turn into Rank two White Jade Gu, and later into the Rank three Heavenly Mugwort Gu(1).The Steel Mane Gu could let the Gu Master\u2019s hair become tough as steel, raising both offense and defense. The Heavenly Mugwort Gu allowed the Gu Master\u2019s body to become tough as white jade while at the same time reducing the damage from attacks such as the moonblade.Fang Yuan was slightly happy over this.Getting the White Boar Gu was just one aspect of it, but what made him truly happy was the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s strength inheritance.\"The White Boar Gu can increase strength. The Flower Wine Monk set a giant rock to block the way, so it seems I need to refine this Gu and with enough strength, push the giant rock away and continue forward. This must be the first test.\"\"With the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s meticulous setup, I can infer that there has to be future inheritance trials, a second or third hurdle. Most importantly, I can confirm that he set this strength inheritance not as a trap, but with true sincerity.\"\"With this inheritance, I can reach Rank three faster and leave this Qing Mao Mountain, and venture outside, gaining greater opportunities!\"What does a Gu Master need most in cultivating?The answer is but one word \u2014 Resources.Fang Yuan needs to cultivate, thus he needs resources. But the clan\u2019s resources are limited, so if he wants more, he needs to fight for it.Not only fighting for resources, he also has to be victorious.To him, the more he fights and the more victories he obtained, the more he would reveal more of his trump cards and make others more wary.Wariness when accumulated to an extent, would turn into suppression and hurdles blocking his path.Fang Yuan killed a family servant, but why did the Mo family stay indifferent? Robbing the classmates, why did their family not pursue it? Fang Yuan resisted the clan and refused to be part of the system, but why did the clan leader choose to be lenient?It is all because he is weak, because he is C grade.They feel strong and do not feel like bullying the weak. Under the family\u2019s system, being petty with the weak Fang Yuan not only causes them to face humiliation, it also makes others feel that the person is cold and unfeeling, ruining one\u2019s social relationships.Weakness was a safety umbrella that Fang Yuan had for now.But with his continued competition for resources, Fang Yuan would appear stronger. This would make everyone start being wary of him, and begin to try recruiting him. No matter which side he chooses, he would face suppression and troubles from the other factions.Suppression and restrictions would drag down his growing speed.Fang Yuan was aware of his predicament, he was in a delicate position. He seemed to have offended everyone, but he had not violated any law in reality.Yet with time, his cultivation level will rise, and conflicts will arise and worsen.Fang Yuan knowns that this conflict would escalate, but the later it escalated, the greater benefit he would gain.Thus, the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance was perfectly timed!With this strength inheritance, he would have hidden resources. Using this, he could be free of the system\u2019s control and walk his own path, cultivating at his own speed and secretly accumulate strength.Once he was adopted into the system, he would need to side with a faction. Even if he did not want to compete, he would definitely be dragged into the political strife.Inside the system, one is a pawn. You first have to be a proper pawn for others to use you willingly. After they trust and use you, you have the chance to climb upwards, and even during that process, you have to be careful not to become a discarded pawn.Fang Yuan was clear of this procedure, he knew it too well. Even with his vast knowledge, there was nothing he could do to this situation. These were the rules!The more crucial part was his C grade talent. To the clan, there was no desire in investing in him. Often he would be treated as a discarded pawn.The most optimum progress route was to work alone. This way, he could avoid most competition. Towards the higher-ups in the village, the image he had created earlier would be sustained.\"This world\u2019s matters, it is always easily done secretly, but difficult to do openly. Using the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance, I can cultivate and gather strength secretly without gaining attention and suppression. But the extortion has to continue, for if it stopped abruptly, it would invite suspicion, and I also need primeval stones.\" Fang Yuan considered his future plans.He really needed primeval stones.Other teenagers of his age had only started refining and feeding a second Gu worm. He however, had also refined the Little Light Gu and recently acquired the White Boar Gu, thus having a total of four Gu worms.Previously, he needed around one primeval stone a day just to feed the Moonlight Gu and Liquor worm. Now after calculating, he needed more than two pieces everyday just as expenditure!If including his cultivating needs and living expenditures, he would need to use around five primeval stones a day!Five primeval stones was enough to feed a family of three mortals for five months.On hand at the moment, he had several hundred primeval stones, but it was not enough to sustain such an expenditure in the long run.More importantly, the further he got, the greater his expenditure would be. Especially after advancing to Rank two, every time he tried combining Gu worms, it would be cost a huge sum.Thinking of this, Fang Yuan felt troubled.The matter of primeval stones was a problem, and by relying on just extortion and the resources on hand, he could only delay this problem from erupting.Moreover, he had another problem, and that was the White Boar Gu\u2019s feeding.The White Boar Gu\u2019s food was pork.Boar, obviously referred to pigs. The Boar Gu series\u2019 food, was all pork.Black and White Boar Gu had huge appetites. Every five days they would need to eat around one fully grown pig\u2019s amount of meat.Pork in this world was not cheap, and mortals could only afford to slaughter one during the New Year celebration, and enjoy themselves. Without the large scale cultivation technique of Earth, the price of pork and beef was not something mortals could eat often. At the same time the topography of the Qing Mao Mountain was precipitous, the area of residence narrow, how much space could be allocated just for rearing livestock?You eat what you can procure at where you live, the villagers were able to eat pork occasionally because of the hunters hunting wild boars in the mountains.\"It seems that I have to go hunting myself from now on, for pork.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone with a glint.Relying on the village to purchase pork, first was the expenditure of primeval stones, second was that it would attract attention. Even if you loved eating pork, how could a person eat so much in such a short period?If he hunted himself, it would not only resolve this problem, but also alleviate his current financial stress.\"Shop assistant, bill!\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan hesitated no more, and after footing the bill, he left the inn.These few days the academy was on break so that the students could refine their second Gu worm. Fang Yuan decided that he could use this time well. He would leave the village and scout the mountains, and then kill some wild boars and get himself some pork.(1) Mugwort - A kind of plant. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_princepsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Quickly get lostTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe mountain forest was boundless, and Fang Yuan walked through patiently.The sunlight permeated through the huge and tall woods, shining and creating a ground of mottled and fragmentary tree shadows.The green grass beside his feet was like a mattress, and the wild flowers bloomed with bright colours.His ears picked up the sound of birds chirping, or the trickling of flowing water.The further he got from the village, walking towards the outer surroundings, the more risky it was. Thus Fang Yuan was even more careful.The wilderness was very dangerous, Gu Masters had to have at least Rank three cultivation to be able to venture the wilds alone and explore. But this did not mean they were safe, as many Rank three Gu Masters died in the wild, sometimes even Rank fours. Wild beasts, poisonous worms, human threats, and at times the weather, these were all causes of death.However, Fang Yuan wanted to kill the wild boars which were often found around the village\u2019s peripheral. Otherwise, the village hunters would not be able to catch wild boars.\"The environment around the village, every now and then, Gu Masters from the clan would come out and clear the area. This environment to a Rank one middle stage like me, is still safe. But I still have to be careful, wild beasts and Gu worms like to move around.\"With his experience from his previous life, Fang Yuan scouted carefully.Time gradually passed, but Fang Yuan gained nothing.\"Damn, Qing Mao Mountain is still too big for the current me. I have no scouting-type Gu and I am not familiar with this environment, plus Qing Mao Mountain is periodically cleared up, so to find a wild boar, it is too difficult. Let\u2019s go to the foot of the mountain!\"Fang Yuan\u2019s scouting was unfruitful, thus he changed his mind and went to the mountain foot.Qing Mao Mountain has three mountain villages. Gu Yue village, Xiong family village, and Bai family village. The Xiong family village was on the fore mountain, the Gu Yue mountain village was at the mountain waist, and Bai family village was at the back mountain waterfall.Other than the three villages, there was also tens of tiny villages at the mountain foot, all being inhabited by mortals.The three mountain villages split these small villages among themselves, being the ones controlling them behind the scenes. Once they lacked family servants, they would pick from these small villages.But they would not choose Gu Masters.Nurturing a Gu Master, they would only choose a clansman. Even if they knew that among these mortals were people with talent, although rare, they would still not use them.This world was heavily sided towards bloodline, and holding power among relatives was the political stability that the clan needed.In order to expand in size, many mountain villages had adopted outsiders into their system. Eventually their power flowed out and caused internal conflicts, thus causing the entire clan to breakdown or weaken.No matter the world, political power was still based off military force, this is the truth.And troops are the brute force department, representing strength. By controlling strength, one gains status and authority.Of course, the clan\u2019s rules are not ever constant, they also adopt new blood. Every year, there would be outsiders marrying into the clan, leaving their servant status, and the children they give birth to would be a Gu Yue, a new generation clansman.This is like connecting a tiny stream into a spring. Do not underestimate this stream, as without it, a spring would be still, and eventually rot. With it, there would be life, and the spring would grow even stronger.Fang Yuan\u2019s previous servant Shen Cui was betting on this idea of marrying into a Gu Yue and leaving her servant status.Fang Yuan left the mountain, and after thirty minutes, could see thick smoke rising from under the mountain.After a while, he could see a wide hill in his vision, and a village around that area beside a small river.The small villages around the vicinity were under the rule of the Gu Yue village. Although they were closeby, the small villages were not as safe, thus requiring regular clean up. For mortals to live in such conditions and manage to survive, to Fang Yuan, he naturally could accept such a fact.\"Oh?\" On the mountain path nearing the village, Fang Yuan sensitively found traces on the ground. His past experience told him that this was a wild boar\u2019s traces.\"Chase!\" Fang Yuan raised his spirits as he followed the clues, getting deeper into the mountains.Green moss spread over the stones, ancient juniper trees and tall pagoda trees completing the great forest.Under the strong light of the sun, the mountain woods of summer was even more profound and serene. The lush underbrush suddenly moved a little.A few deer eating the sumptuous grass looked up, vigilantly staring at the bushes, their ears twitching.The bushes that were half a man\u2019s height split apart, and a young man crawled out from within. His skin was pale and his black hair was short. He was wearing a modest linen shirt, it was Fang Yuan.Swoosh.A few wild deer were frightened, and their four thin limbs quickly moved, sprinting away. In a moment, they vanished from Fang Yuan\u2019s vision.\"These are female deer, their fur can be shaved to make warm clothing, and deer meat is also some Gu worm\u2019s food. If it\u2019s a male deer, the antlers are most precious, and some are even necessary ingredients for a Gu worm\u2019s advancement.The wild was dangerous all over, and at the same time it had great treasures.Fang Yuan looked at the direction that they were escaping in, and retracted his gaze. His target was wild boars, not these deer.He continued moving.There was the sound of buzzing.Nearing these noises, Fang Yuan stopped in his tracks.\"Beehive.\" He looked forward and saw a beehive hanging on a tree.The bee\u2019s nest was massive, the size was that of a wicker-basket. It appeared as a sort of greyish dark yellow colour. Outside the bee nest was a few dozen bee soldiers flying around; occasionally a few worker bees would enter and exit.\"Beehive has honey, and honey is the Bear Strength Gu\u2019s food. Thus, the Xiong family has great demand for honey. This beehive is only a small-sized one, and the chances of producing a Gu isn\u2019t high. If I had the Bronze Skin Gu, I could risk getting stabbed and collect the honey. What a pity.\" Fang Yuan thought.In this world, not all insects are Gu.Gu are the spirit of the world, the body of the laws, how can it be so cheap? Among a swarm of insects, normally only the insect king is a Gu.But that depends on their size and development, so if the swarm is too small, there is no Gu either.Taking the beehive ahead as an example, because it is too small, there is a low chance of having a Gu.Fang Yuan routed around this beehive and continued forward.The traces of the wild boar was getting more evident, and Fang Yuan knew he was getting close to it, thus he became more careful, as wild boars were very dangerous.Wild boars are not reared pig. When a mature wild boar fights with a tiger, the tiger may not win.In this mystical world, wild beasts are not simple too.\"Oh? This situation!\" When Fang Yuan finally found the wild boar, he saw that it had fallen into a huge pit. A sharpened green bamboo was situated at the bottom of the pit, where it had pierced the wild boar and was causing it to bleed.Seeing the accumulated blood in the pit, he could tell that the boar had already been in the trap for at least fifteen minutes.But this wild boar continued to struggle, whimpering and howling, still full of life.\"This trap is obviously set by hunters. To think I\u2019m reaping the rewards.\" Fang Yuan smiled but his expression was grim.These traps threatened him too.If he had fallen into it, after half a quarter of an hour, he would die.Although the village surroundings were cleared regularly, the hunters often came to hunt and set many traps. Some could be discerned, while others were designed to be hidden, and if Fang Yuan could not discover them, he might fall into the trap.\"Any area in this mountain could have a trap buried by the hunters. But among hunters, with every trap set they would inform each other on the location. It seems I have to find an old hunter\u2019s residence and find out about the trap locations from him. Along with the surrounding wild beasts\u2019 activity area and with these intel, I would not have to search like trying to find a needle in a haystack.\" Fang Yuan thought internally.This was the problem of not having a scouting-type of Gu worm.But to find a good scouting-type Gu, it was not easy.In a short time, he could barely make do with a hunter\u2019s intel.With such a thought, Fang Yuan\u2019s wrist flicked and a moonblade flew out, easily hitting the wild boar.Whoosh!With a light ring, the entire moonblade cut through the boar\u2019s neck and caused a long and slender wound. Then with a plop sound, a blood fountain spewed out from it.The spewing blood caused the wound to become bigger, and thus the blood fountain also enlarged.The boar screeched, thrashing about with the last of its energy, until its movements became smaller and smaller\u2026...Fang Yuan silently looked at the scene, his face calm.The wild boar\u2019s life faded as its eyes were staring wide and perfectly round, the muscles on its body twitching and the warm blood filling the trap hole, a thick smell of blood permeating the surrounding.\"Survival or death, this is the theme of nature.\" He sighed in his heart.At this point, human voices were heard.\"Second brother Wang, within our village, no one is better than you at hunting. Especially killing wild boars, your family\u2019s Old Wang is the hunting king in the entire region, who would not know of his great name?\"\"That\u2019s right, second brother Wang inherited the old hunter\u2019s abilities. To hunt a wild boar, it is naturally as good as caught!\"\"Second brother Wang, why didn\u2019t little sister Wang come with you today?\"After all the bootlicking, a grave and stern voice said, \"Hmph! Hunting a wild boar, how can it show my true abilities? Today I want to kill three boars, you\u2019ll see! Er Gou Dan, stop lusting after my sister, or I\u2019ll thrash you!!!\"Er Gou Dan retorted, \"Men and women marry when they\u2019re of age, what\u2019s wrong with liking little sister Wang? Moreover, I\u2019m not the only one, which guy in your village doesn\u2019t also fancy her too? Second brother Wang, in my opinion you are also nineteen already, you should marry a wife and have kids already.\"The voice spoke again, \"Hmph, I\u2019m a true blue man, how can I lust after such a small temptation? One day, I will leave this Qing Mao Mountain and explore the world and learn about everything under the sky, that will truly be fitting of my manly status!\"Saying so, the four young hunters walked out of the forest.The leader hunter had a tall build, carrying a bow and arrow, his muscles bulging and his eyes full of spirit, showing a powerful aura.When he saw Fang Yuan, he frowned and screamed, \"Hmm? Which village are you from kid, how dare you try to take advantage of me Wang Er, quickly get lost!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Get lost?\" Hearing Wang Er\u2019s words, Fang Yuan immediately broke into a cold smirk and he brandished his palm in front of him.Swoosh.With a light sound, a blue coloured moonblade shot forward.At the same time, he put strength into his leg and rushed towards the four hunters.\"Gu Master?!\" The hunters were stunned and shouted upon seeing the moonblade.The moonblade had already fired over, and they rushed to evade.Plonk.A person did not evade fast enough, and his right forearm was hit by the moonblade. Immediately his bones and flesh split, the entire wrist and his forearm cut through and fell on the ground.\"AHHHH!\"He laid on the ground, screaming in fear and pain. His left arm was like an eagle claw gripping his right arm. His right limb spewed bright red blood non stop, quickly dyeing the floor red.\"Spare me!\"\"We did not offend you intentionally!\"The other two mortals on seeing their companion\u2019s state, went pale without a trace of blood in their face. They hurriedly got on all fours and kneeled down, kowtowing to Fang Yuan nonstop.\"Hmph, a bunch of fags, what are you afraid of? It\u2019s just a Gu disciple!\" Only Wang Er was still standing. Fang Yuan attacked without warning, and this had made him frightened and angry. His arms went behind his back, and with a swift action, he grabbed hold of the bow and arrow in his arms.\"Stop, come further and I\u2019ll shoot you!\" Wang Er retreated as he readied the arrow while screaming.\"Oh?\" Fang Yuan narrowed his eyes. This Wang Er was rather intractable. Normally when mortals saw Gu Masters, they would be cowering in fear. Yet this man was able to remain calm, he must be rather bold.Pew.Another moonblade shot out towards Wang Er.\"Unappreciative bastard.\" Wang Er snorted and killing intent rose from his heart.He took a side step and evaded the moonblade while shooting an arrow. The arrow was fast, and with a swoosh, it reached Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan ducked, his head lowering slightly and evading the arrow as he continued rushing forward, quickly reaching Wang Er.Wang Er bravely threw away the bow in his hand and clenched his bowl sized fist, rushing towards Fang Yuan.He had a large build, his back strong like a wolf\u2019s and his waist like a bee\u2019s, and he was at least fifty centimetres taller than Fang Yuan. The sunlight shone from behind him, and as Fang Yuan rushed towards him, he could see a dark shadow hanging over his face, his eyes emitting killing intent like a wolf!\"No!!\"\"Stop quickly!\"The two hunters seeing that the two were going to collide into each other, frightfully shouted.\"Die!\" Wang Er\u2019s eyes were fierce as the muscles on his face twitched, showing his sinister and insane expression, like a bloodthirsty evil wolf.Both his fists flew towards Fang Yuan.Boom.His fist was fast and heavy, even cutting the wind!Fang Yuan could see the fist getting bigger in his eyes, but his expression was unchanging as he took a side step.Swoosh.At the crucial moment, he avoided the fist and forcefully rotated his body, knocking Wang Er\u2019s left hand away.Wang Er laughed sinisterly as he waved his fist horizontally, his fist striking first, about to reach Fang Yuan\u2019s back.But at this moment, a bright flash of sunlight entered his iris.His back was originally facing the sun, and now that he had turned around, the eye-piercing sunlight temporarily made his eyes hurt, and his vision went blank.Fang Yuan smirked as he backflipped in the air, dodging Wang Er\u2019s fist, at the same time waving his right arm.Pew!The third moonblade flew along the sunlight trajectory.Wang Er\u2019s senses tingled as he felt unprecedented danger. He turned his head around and the next moment, the eerie blue moonblade flew past.\"Be careful brother Wang Er!\"\"Did he avoid it?\"The two kneeling on the ground forgot to beg for forgiveness at this moment, staring widely.The piercing sunlight shone on their face.At this moment, time seemed to slow down.The surrounding sound vanished, and the world was silent.The afternoon\u2019s blazing sun paved a white background, and on this backdrop, Wang Er\u2019s body became a black shadow. His body was in the air at an arc, his muscular body stretching in a crescent shape like an open bow, full of masculine appeal.His head lowered as he tried to avoid the moonblade.The moonblade flew like a snail in the air, its eerie blue light almost invisible under the sun\u2019s rays.The white background, the black shadow, and the blue moonblade \u2014 these three formed a brilliant stage for a moment full of life and death.The moonblade flew over.The shadow that represented Wang Er landed smoothly as it flowed with the trajectory.He was safe and sound.\"Phew!\" Seeing this, a young hunter breathed out a sigh of relief.\"He avoided it!\" Another hunter was cheering internally.But at this time!A small piece of the shadow\u2019s head flew out along with red fluids, separating from the shadow and spewing everywhere.The blue moonblade gradually dissipated in the air.That black shadow was like a broken bow, as the energy accumulated within it disappeared at once. It turned into a beautiful but sad fallen leaf, silently landing on the ground.The two hunter\u2019s irises shrunk into pin size.Their mouths were agape, stretching to their bodily limits.Splat.The bright red fluid landed on their faces.The two touched their faces \u2014Blood!They jolted awake!In their perception, time had returned to normal, and noise returned.There were birds chirping, water flowing and their companion screaming while grabbing his broken arms.\"Second brother Wang...?\" A hunter called, his voice full of horror. All this time, Wang Er was their leader.\"He\u2019s dead!\" Another hunter cried out, his face grim to the limit.\"Brother Wang Er is our strongest hunter. A while ago he was still talking with us, but to think the next moment he\u2019s dead!\"\"He should not have angered that Gu Master, we mortals are no match for Gu Masters!\"The two hunters were frightened and shocked, at once they were like statues kneeling on the ground.Fang Yuan got up from the ground.Earlier, to avoid Wang Er\u2019s fist, he rotated his body in the air and lost his balance. After shooting the moonblade, he fell to the ground. But this fall was worth it, as Wang Er\u2019s fist would\u2019ve caused him to vomit blood on the spot. After all, Fang Yuan had no defensive Gu, and his body was only a fifteen year old.Now, he stood up, other than his shoulders hurting, he had practically no injuries.\"This Wang Er is very strong, much stronger than that Mo family servant Gao Wan! If any other student encountered him, they would lose without doubt. Even a Rank one upper stage Gu Master would lose to him out of carelessness.\" Fang Yuan stared at the corpse of Wang Er deeply.Gu Masters were still threatened by genius mortal martial artists when they are at Rank one stage.This Wang Er was truly skilled.His archery skill was fast and stable, just relying on this it could match moonblade. In fact, the moonblade might even be inferior, as the arrow has a larger range. His fighting skill has reached the peak of mortals \u2014 a strong body with tough bones, and he was also ruthless. With Fang Yuan\u2019s small body, it could not go head to head with him.Thus, any other student would lose undoubtedly. Unfortunately for Wang Er, he met Fang Yuan.Once he appeared, Fang Yuan noticed his bow and deduced that he could not fight long range with him.The moonblade only had a range of ten meters. The bow had far greater range than the moonblade.Thus, Fang Yuan ditched long combat. He quickly got closer and closed the gap between them, showing a physical fighting stance.Wang Er had no choice but to discard his bow and fight physically with Fang Yuan.But Fang Yuan did not really think of going close combat with Wang Er. He used the angle of the sun\u2019s rays and caused a weakness in Wang Er, before shooting out his third moonblade.He was already middle stage now, and with the Liquor worm\u2019s refinement, the moonblade had the attack power of an upper stage Gu Master. At such a close range, with Wang Er\u2019s weakened vision, his defeat was guaranteed.\"But this Wang Er is indeed skillful. I wanted to decapitate him, but at the crucial moment, he relied on his senses and reflexes and evaded half of my attack, causing my moonblade to cut off only half of his head.\"\"Life and death is nature\u2019s law. All living beings are equal, and everyone has their right to survive and be killed. There might be royalty and lower beings, but in face of death, a person\u2019s death is no different from a pig\u2019s, what\u2019s the difference? They\u2019re both dead.\"Fang Yuan took a final look at Wang Er\u2019s corpse and sighed in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thick and solid tree trunks faced each other, looking similar through the distances. The exuberant branches and leaves intertwined in mid-air.Under the surroundings of these trees was a wooden house.The wooden house was made entirely from the solid thick barks, leaking out a type of genuine firm smell. The wooden house was not a newly built one, but it had gathered many years. Thus the house surface had green moss growing all over, and some of the tree trunks had begun to sprout out tender little branches.Around the wooden house was a tall and great fence constructed from green spear bamboo. The back and front area was all vegetable fields, and in the middle of the fields was a man-made well.At this time, a young and beautiful lady was drawing water from the well.While she wore simple and plain clothing, this was still hard to mask her complexion. She was sixteen years of age, and she had a big pair of black eyes, the black and whites of her eyes clearly defined, and pure like crystals.The sunlight penetrated through the overlapping and luxuriant tree leaves, shining onto her face, letting her skin reflect light like it was white snow, also showing a sort of transparent red flush and gentleness on her.Her black hair hung down unruly and half-covered her cute earlobes.The pink lips were pursed at the moment, and she was clenching her set of white perfect teeth, her face showing an expression of full concentration.She used all her strength to pull the bucket full of water out of the well. With another breath, she moved the bucket to the ground outside the well.\"Huff!\" The young girl wiped her forehead and breathed out, using her pale hand to fan her own face.Hearing the bucket hitting the ground, the wooden house\u2019s door opened, and an old man came out.The old man\u2019s hair was a mix of black and white, his face having layers of wrinkles. Although his eyes looked tired, they showed a hint of brilliance sometimes. Like an elderly tiger, although old, the tiger\u2019s authority was still evident.\"Lass, this bucket is too heavy, I said let me carry it. Why are you secretly watering the plants behind my back again?\" The elderly looked at the young girl and showed an expression of doting affection.\"Father!\" The young girl sweetly called, \"You were hunting until late at night yesterday, I wanted you to sleep in later today. It\u2019s just a water bucket, look, I can carry it out, right?\"\"You, always loving to act tough!\" The old man\u2019s voice was full of helplessness, but his eyes were once again doting on her.He took a large step and got to the well, stretching out his hand and easily grabbing the bucket, \"Come, lass, let\u2019s water the plants together.\"The air was full of the smell of wild grass and flowers, and the summer\u2019s wind blew warmly and passed by the trees, turning into a gust of refreshing wind.The wooden house on the mountain had a vegetable field, and the girl used the pail, lowering her back to water the plants. The father was in charge of getting the water, rotating between two water buckets. The atmosphere of a loving family was evident in this tiny space.\"Sigh, I am too old, just a few buckets and I am already exhausted.\" After a while, the old man stood by the well, wiping the sweat off his forehead and sighing deeply.The young girl turned her head back, smiling like flowers, saying, \"Father, you finally realized it. You\u2019re already so old, yet you want to act tough all the time. How many times have I told you, let second brother do the hunting, you should be resting at home enjoying your life at this age.\"\"Hehehe,\" the old man laughed, nodding, \"Relying on your second brother\u2019s abilities, he can roam this mountain easily. With his archery skills, it even surpasses me in my youth. But I still cannot feel at ease, his heart is too wild, and with just martial art skills he wants to soar. Sigh, young men love to imagine freely, they all have this problem.\"\"Father\u2026..\" The young girl dragged her words.The old man laughed even more heartily now, his tone carrying a mischievous hint, \"Oh yeah, there\u2019s still you. You\u2019re not young anymore, it\u2019s time to get married. I have found a good partner for you, and with your good looks, there\u2019s no problems with finding a good family.\"The girl\u2019s face grew red like a tomato. Immediately she felt too embarrassed until she was lost for words.The old man looked at the sky, imagining the great future as he sighed, \"Once your second brother suffers some setbacks and curbs his nature, I will retire and never go into the mountains. Next I will find you a good family and watch you marry and have children, preferably a chubby boy. Heh heh, your father wants to take care of his grandson, that\u2019s all I want. A person\u2019s life is not easy, and as a hunter, how many can have a good ending? Sigh, all my partners and comrades from back then are already gone, I am all that\u2019s left.\"\"Father, you are wrong.\" The young girl consoled, \"What do you mean there\u2019s only you left? You still have us.\"\"Hehe, hmm?\" The old man was laughing and was about to reply, but he suddenly heard a sound and turned his head.The little entrance of the bamboo fence was broken from the outside by someone.\"You are old man Wang?\" Fang Yuan\u2019s cold expression with his eerie eyes, stepped forward with a lump of moonlight in his right arm.The old man was shocked as he looked at the moonlight on Fang Yuan\u2019s hand, rapidly kneeling, \"This old man pays his respects to Lord Gu Master!\"\"Old man Wang, your son dared to offend me, I have executed him. Bring his corpse forward!\" Fang Yuan stood proudly, staring at the kneeling old man as he brought out the main topic.His words had just finished, and two young hunters carried Wang Er\u2019s corpse in.Seeing this corpse, old man Wang\u2019s body shook!\"Second brother \u2014!\" The young girl screamed pitifully, rushing forward and grabbing Wang Er\u2019s corpse, her face flushed with tears.\"Wang family\u2019s daughter\u2026\" The two young hunters, seeing the girl they liked crying in front of them, felt terrible. They wanted to console her, but no words came out.\"Old man Wang, I heard you\u2019re a hunter, the best among the few villages. At such an old age, you can still hunt and get a good result every time, this is great.\"Fang Yuan paused here for a moment, and continued expressionlessly, \"Draw me a map of all the traps of the nearby mountain area now, as well as the results of your observation of wild beast territories from your hunting experience all these years. Draw it for me and I will spare your son\u2019s sin of offending me, if not\u2026 hmph.\"These villages were under Gu Yue village\u2019s control. The villagers were all farmer slaves of the Gu Yue clan.With Wang Er\u2019s offense for offending his master, according to the clan rules, their entire family would be implicated!Old man Wang\u2019s body shook again, almost falling to the ground. An impact like this was too sudden and great to him.\"Murderer, you are the murderer that harmed my brother! You treat human lives like livestock, and you dare to confront us? I will exact revenge for my brother!!\" The young girl screamed, her voice full of hatred and anger towards Fang Yuan, and she rushed towards Fang Yuan.But she was only halfway there when she got stopped by someone.It was not the two young hunters, but her father.\"Disgraceful wretch!\" Old man Wang screamed as he gave the young girl a tight slap, sending her to the ground.\"Your second brother is dead, do you want to die too? Do you want this old father of yours to be old and alone forever?!\" The old man cried profusely saying this, his body trembling furiously.\"Father!\" The young girl was awakened by this, and her tears poured out. Her voice was full of sadness, unjust, pity, hatred, and helplessness.The old man turned his body, facing Fang Yuan as he kneeled down and placed his forehead on the ground, prostrating deeply at Fang Yuan\u2019s feet. His voice shook as he said, \"Lord Gu Master, my son offended you and deserved to die! I shall draw the map for you now, please spare us with your magnanimity.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s expression turned milder, he looked at the old man arrogantly, saying, \"Be at ease, as long as you draw honestly, I will spare you. But don\u2019t think of lying to me, for if I find any suspicious points, your lives will be forfeited!\"\"I understand, this old man understands.\" Old man Wang kowtowed non-stop, \"Please Lord Gu Master, allow me to retrieve my brush and paper.\"\"No need.\" Fang Yuan waved his hand, looking at the two hunters he had forced along, ordering, \"Enter the room and find paper and brush, and bring them out.\"\"Yes, Lord Gu Master.\" The two youngsters did not dare to rebel under Fang Yuan\u2019s authority.\"Lord, the paper and brush are on the square table in the kitchen.\" Old man Wang said.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone but he remained silent.The two hunters barged into the house and quickly brought out the paper and brush.In the southern territory, the paper were specially made of bamboo, where the quality was bad and the paper was tough with green overlays. Paper like this was suited to the moist weather of the southern territorial weather.If it was rice paper, it might be destroyed after a week due to moisture.The old man carried the brush and kneeled on the ground, drawing out black lines, curves or dots.He used over ten bamboo papers, before handing them all to Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan looked through them and split these bamboo papers into two, handing them to the two hunters, \"Take a look if there\u2019s any inappropriate areas. Every mistake, I\u2019ll give you one primeval stone!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: There is no innocence in natureTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe two hunters took the bamboo papers, their hands trembling, eyes shining.\"This is hunter Wang\u2019s life experience and effort. Us hunters, although we keep in contact, it is all about trap placement, we will not tell others about the wild beast distribution. This bamboo paper, it is all the information that hunter Wang had gathered since his ancestors.\"\"So this valley has a herd of wild deer, haha, after I hunt these wild deer, I won\u2019t have to worry about expenses for the next three months! Ah, this stream has a cave of mountain bears? How close, I almost hunted at this region last time, note it, I must note it all down!\"These were precious information, it could be said to be a hunter\u2019s rice bowl!Normally not within a generation but all the way from their forefathers, these experiences and information were obtained at the expense of their blood and lives.But old man Wang\u2019s family had always hunted for a living. When it got to old man Wang, he had reached the peak of his family line, the acclaimed number one hunter.Information in the hands of such a person, is the most useful and truthful.The two young hunters checked for nearly fifteen minutes, glossing through the map multiple times. Only after Fang Yuan rushed them did they finally hand over the bamboo paper reluctantly.During this period, old man Wang was kneeling on the ground, his forehead touching the ground as he expressed his respect. The young girl was lying on the ground, as if she had gone lifeless.\"There is no problem, lord.\"\"The trap areas in these bamboo papers are all accurate.\"The two answered.\"Lord Gu Master, this concerns me and my daughter\u2019s life, I would definitely not lie to you!\" The old man on the ground shouted as he continued to kowtow.\"Mmm, not bad.\" Fang Yuan waved the stack of bamboo paper, yet suddenly his words changed, \"But, I don\u2019t believe it.\"Old man Wang jolted, raising his head, but only saw an eerie blue moonblade enlarging within the reflection of his iris.Pew.A skull flew into the air, fresh blood spewing all over.\"Argh!!!\"\"Lord, this\u2014!\"The two young hunters were taken by surprise. Shock and disbelief showed on their faces.\"Father\u2014!\" The young girl cried out profusely as she leapt towards old man Wang\u2019s headless corpse, but midway, a moonblade flew towards her face.Splat.She fell onto the ground, lifeless.Her beautiful face, from her forehead to her chin, slowly showed a thin red line.The line became thicker as fresh red blood oozed out, flowing down along half of her nose and half of her lips. They flowed onto the black soil, dyeing half of her face bright red.The other half of her face though, was still as beautiful, the skin fair and rosy. Under the bright blue sky, it seemed even more lustrous, like a work of art.\"At least she looks decent.\" Fang Yuan looked at the dead girl blandly, nodding satisfactorily.Using Rank one middle stage primeval essence, the moonblade could slice Gu. Now that he was using upper stage primeval essence, it could break bones and even cut steel!\"Wang family\u2019s daughter!\" A young hunter fell onto the ground in despair after seeing her demise with his own eyes.\"Lord Gu Master, spare us!\" The other hunter feeling Fang Yuan\u2019s faze, nearly died of shock as he plopped on the ground.\"Get up, go inside and search!\u2019 Fang Yuan ordered, \"I know that a hunter\u2019s family always keeps a beast skin map. On top of it is the terrain, trap locations and the beast territories. Find it for me, and I\u2019ll let you keep your lives.\"\"Yes, yes, yes, we will search immediately. Give us some time, Lord Gu Master!\" The two frantically got up and ran into the wooden house.Sounds of wardrobes overturning and falling could be heard from the wooden house.But a moment later, even though the hunters ransacked the house, there was no beast skin map to be found.\"Lord, please give me some time, we will find it right now!\" The two hunters were terrified as they got more desperate and searched boorishly, smashing many furniture in the process.\"Fuck, where is it?\"\"Appear, please appear!\"They muttered as their bodies shivered, their eyes getting bloodshot.\"Useless trash.\" Fang Yuan slowly walked into the house.\"Lord! Lord! Forgive us, please\u2026wahh...\" The two young hunters shivered like they were electrified and fell to the ground, begging for their lives.Fang Yuan ignored the two and observed the house.There were four rooms in the house, a living room and a kitchen. All the furniture were in a mess, like they were ransacked.Fang Yuan slowly stepped in, his steps producing echoes in the wooden house.\"It has indeed been searched, that shouldn\u2019t be right. Almost every hunter has a beast skin map inherited throughout the generations, getting refined along the way, recording all the beasts territory and pitfalls. This is the livelihood of a hunter, how can they not have it?\"Fang Yuan stood pondering, \"Moreover, I tested that old man Wang earlier, purposely getting the two hunters to search for paper and brush. The old man immediately called out the location of the paper and brush, probably worried that they might find the beast skin map, thus it has to be in this house!\"Fang Yuan observed the house again, and suddenly his inspiration struck as he looked at the firepit.This firepit was connected to the chimney, used in winter to gain warmth. There was even some residue charcoal in the firepit.Fang Yuan walked to the firepit, slowly squatting down and taking a shovel beside the firepit, digging out the charcoal.Most of the charcoal still has their wooden shape, they were brittle and easily broken into two.\"Oh?\" Fang Yuan inspected, suddenly finding a charcoal block that had a very tough material and was very heavy, not light like the other charcoal blocks.He used the shovel to dig out this charcoal block, smashing it on the ground. The charcoal smashed into bits, revealing a bamboo tube.The two hunters gasped at this scene.Fang Yuan took the bamboo tube and opened it on one side, shaking it, causing a map to fall out.The map was heavier than the stack of bamboo paper, made with a piece of white beast skin. The beast skin was huge, over a meters long and half a meter in breadth. There was black, green, red, yellow and blue lines on it, forming a complicated map.Fang Yuan was slightly taken aback looking at it.The map\u2019s range was very big, extending far beyond the village\u2019s vicinity. As a mortal, it was not easy to map out areas so far away.His gaze focused on five spots, those with wild boar herds.Two were small sized, two were medium sized, and there was a large sized boar herd. In the middle of the large sized herd, there was a giant red cross.Seeing this cross, Fang Yuan snickered. On his bamboo paper, there was no such marking!The two young hunters had also seen the bamboo paper, and found no problems. This was their own inexperience, only certain of some areas. This red cross was far beyond the village, and from this, old man Wang\u2019s cunningness could be seen.This was why Fang Yuan killed them.To hunt for wild boars, he needed such a beast skin map. But he was not convinced by a map drawn by others. Only getting a \"real\" map like this, could it be dependable.Fang Yuan had heard of all sorts of remarks in his past life. Just a word \"scram\", was not enough reason for him to kill Wang Er.When hearing the four hunters\u2019 conversation beside the boar trap, Fang Yuan had already planned his murder.Killing Wang Er reduced his opposition, and gave him reason to obtain the map. Why wouldn\u2019t he kill him?Fang Yuan would not kill for the sake of killing, killing is only a method. Using this method, if it can solve the problem, then why not?The old man definitely had to die, even if he can endure the murder of his son, Fang Yuan would not be at ease. Otherwise, it would be a case of \"When cutting down weeds, you must get at the roots. Otherwise, the weeds will return with the spring breeze.\"What, you said killing the innocent?Hehe, no matter which world, as long as one lives in this world, they would be intertwined in karma, how can anyone be innocent? Humans slaughter pigs, aren\u2019t the pigs innocent?Big fish eats small fish, and small fish eats shrimps, in nature there is only the food chain, there is no innocence.In this world, anybody can live, anybody can die, but nobody is innocent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Life is as cheap as grassTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe beast skin map was very thick, it was unlike paper that could be folded and carried around easily. Fang Yuan could only roll the beast skin up and put it back into the bamboo tube, where he then tied up both ends of the bamboo tube with hemp rope, and carried it on his back.The two hunters stared firmly at the bamboo case, their eyes unavoidably showing signs of greed. They were not idiots after all \u2014 they knew the value of the map.This beast skin map is something that Gu Masters would not even bother looking at, but to mortals, especially hunters like them, it was the most valuable treasure.The Wang family had began to pass down this map since the time of their ancestors. Old man Wang was able to become a famous hunter, his name known throughout the vicinity and beyond; the map had much contribution to this. It was truly an authentic family heirloom.\"I\u2019m going to ask you \u2014 in Old man Wang\u2019s household, is there anyone else?\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze was dark, his tone cold as he asked.The two young men kneeling on the ground shuddered immediately when they heard this question from Fang Yuan. They thought about what had just conspired earlier, and the greedy expressions from their faces disappeared in an instant, replaced with fear and terror.\"There is no one else, the entire family is dead, lord Gu Master!\"\"Hunter Wang originally had a wife, but that was decades ago, and she was killed by wild wolves that intruded the village. Before his wife died she gave birth to two sons and a daughter. But the oldest son Wang Da died on the mountain while hunting three years ago. There is no one else in the Wang family.\"This was the immediate reply from the two young hunters.\"Is that so\u2026\" Fang Yuan narrowed his two eyes and he looked at the two men kneeling before him, knowing that they were telling the truth. When one\u2019s life and death was in the hands of others, the probability of lying was very small.But he asked anyway, \"Did you lie to me?\"\"We would not dare to lie even the slightest, lord!\"\"I-I thought of something! Old man Wang actually also has a daughter-in-law, Wang Da\u2019s old wife. But after Wang Da disappeared, his wife died due to a broken heart. That year, the village even specially sent down a chastity memorial arch! But rumour has it that Wang Da\u2019s wife wanted to remarry, and she was actually hounded to death by Old man Wang. When you killed Old man Wang, lord, you are helping us citizens, rooting out the evil and bringing people peace!\"The other hunter quickly added, \"That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Actually lord, we have long found this old Wang unfavourable. Hmph, he\u2019s nothing special, just that he can hunt better than us. We\u2019re all just mortals, yet he thinks he\u2019s more special than us and purposely moved out of the village to live here. As the younger generation, we sometimes will ask him to teach us and impart his experiences, but he would just outright chase us away and never allow us to show up again near the wooden house!\"Fang Yuan listened quietly while nodding. Although these two started belittling Old man Wang in an attempt to keep their lives, he did not sense any resentment from these two men\u2019s mouths.Fang Yuan guessed inwardly that these two men asking to consult for hunting matters should be fake, he surmised that they were just over to covet for the Wang family\u2019s daughter and her good looks. Yet in the end they were found out by Old man Wang and disciplined a few times harshly.\"Weeding out the wicked and let the law-abiding citizens live in peace. Enough of such bootlicking, this time I killed them because my motive was just for this beast skin map. Well, both of you have showed a satisfying behaviour, you can both go now.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s tone softened, but at the same time the right hand behind his back shone with gloomy moonlight.The two young men kneeling on the ground felt surprise and joy once they heard this.\"Thank you so much for your mercy, lord!\"\"Lord, your generosity and indulgence, we shall remember in heart forever!\"They kowtowed on the ground, their mucus and tears overflowing, sounds of dull knocking could be heard. After several knocks they immediately got up and turned to leave.Although Fang Yuan was younger than them in age, but after witnessing firsthand what Fang Yuan was like in doing things, they were beyond fearful and terrified, wishing never to meet Fang Yuan again.\"Hold it.\" Just at this moment, a voice suddenly travelled over.The moment it finished there was a swoosh and a Gu Master jumped down from a treetop.\"You both cannot leave, tell me what happened here. All of it.\" This Gu Master that just jumped down was wearing a deep blue uniform, and there was a scarlet belt with a metal plate in the middle. There was a huge \u2018Two\u2019 word carved onto the metal plate.This Rank two Gu Master had a slim build, his two eyes slender. He wore arm protectors on his wrists, and his calves had sturdy leg bindings, his entire being radiating with a highly capable aura.\"This commoner greets lord Jiang He!\" The two young men had just got up with the intention to leave, but once they saw this Gu Master they instantly knelt down again, prostrating themselves in admiration while greeting.This Gu Master was someone they knew \u2014 it was the Gu Master stationed at the village.Every year to reinforce their control in their surroundings, the Gu Yue Village would dispatch Gu Master down into the little villages and hamlets, stationing Gu Masters there. This would also prevent the other powers from infiltrating and at the same time strengthen their defences on their borders.This Gu Master named Jiang He did not bother with the two hunters kneeling on the ground, instead looking straight at Fang Yuan, asking in a cold tone, \"I am the Gu Master Jiang He of the Gu Yue clan who has been stationed here, you are?\"Fang Yuan laughed lightly and stretched his right palm out, where the Moonlight Gu was giving out a ball of moonlight in the middle of his palm.When the Gu Master Jiang He saw the moonlight in Fang Yuan\u2019s hand, his gaze softened considerably \u2014 the Moonlight Gu was the sign of the Gu Yue clan, this was something that could not be forged.\"This matter is simple actually. Old man Wang\u2019s second son offended me, so I killed the entire family off in anger. Those two can be my witness.\" Fang Yuan straightforwardly admitted with a bold and confident manner, pointing at the two hunters kneeling down at the same time.Fang yuan was not lying, and these two hunters nodded in haste; there was no hesitation.Jiang He stared blankly for a moment before he started laughing loudly, \"You killed well! Just a bunch of measly peasant servants, to actually dare to offend their masters, they deserved to be killed!!\"But he quickly added with a change in tone, full of emotion and deep meaning, \"However young junior, what you\u2019ve done has also brought problems to me. Although Old man Wang resides far away from the masses and stayed here alone with his family, they are still villagers that I am in charge of. I was sent out from the clan and stationed here in this village, this means I\u2019m supposed to protect the villagers and be on the alert as defence. Now that you\u2019ve killed these few people, the number of villagers will have lessened. During the examination at the end of the year the clan\u2019s assessment towards me will drop.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone, and he instantly knew that this Jiang He was using this as a pretext to extort money from him.He laughed and said out, \"This isn\u2019t so difficult. Senior you just have to report the truth back. Just say that this entire family was killed by me, and it has nothing to do with senior whatsoever.\"When Jiang He heard this his eyelids twitched, anger rising in his heart towards Fang Yuan who did not know how to appreciate favors. His manner of speaking became extremely solemn, \"Then I will have to conduct business impartially here. Junior, if you are not afraid of the clan\u2019s investigation then report your name, I will record it in detail as how things really are on paper.\"His words brought a strong implication of threat; if it was any other youngster they would have been frightened by this statement already.But Fang Yuan could see Jiang He\u2019s weakness from it, and he instantly said, \"Then senior shall report as how it should be. Ah right, my surname is Gu Yue, and my name is Fang Yuan.\"\"So you\u2019re actually Fang Yuan!\" Jiang He\u2019s face evidently showed astonishment for a while, \"I have been hearing about you all the time from my little brother recently. You thoroughly beat up all your classmates, extorting in front of everyone, getting sixty pieces of primeval stones each time. Every time my little brother speaks of it he\u2019s always jealous of how you can earn money so easily. Not to mention that time when you gambled out a Liquor worm and a Mudskin Toad consecutively. This sort of luck sure makes people jealous. Oh right, my little brother is Jiang Ya, you both should have met each other long ago.\"\"So it\u2019s him.\" Fang Yuan nodded and admitted, \"Yes, every time when I buy Moon orchid petals, I would buy them in Jiang Ya\u2019s shop.\"\"Hahaha, since this it the case then we both are acquaintances. Oh well let\u2019s forget about it, this matter I\u2019ll handle it!\" When he said this, Jiang He clapped his chest with his hands, putting out the appearance of one with the spirit of loyalty and self-sacrifice.He was merely using this favourable circumstance, there was no way he could have really reported the matter.After reporting of such a thing the clan\u2019s assessment towards him would still drop either way. You might as well just do a good turn to Fang Yuan, as for Old man Wang\u2019s family\u2019s death, he could just report that they were invaded and attacked by a wild beast.It\u2019s Old man Wang\u2019s fault for his unconventional ways of insisting to move out of the village, building a wooden house far away from the population!Jiang He was not afraid of the matter being disclosed, there was just a few mortal peasants around. Their lives were cheap ass grass, who cares if they died? Even if the clan found out about the cover-up they would hardly care about such a small matter.\"But junior, you have yet to graduate from the academy and do not have the Gu Master uniform like I am wearing now. If that Wang Er saw this outfit he\u2019d know about your status as Gu Master and wouldn\u2019t offend you. Junior you are a smart person, don\u2019t you think so, hehe,\" said Jiang He again.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes flashed. Jiang He\u2019s words had implicit meaning, and was actually warning himself \u2014 do not run out of the academy and wander around for no reason, and you better not come to the area under my jurisdiction here after today to cause trouble and kill people again.\"In that case thank you very much for your advice, senior.\" Fang Yuan cupped his fists in greeting, bidding farewell to Jiang He, immediately taking his leave from here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Using the White Boar GuTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowIn the black of the night, the moon is shaped like a silver plate, hanging high in the sky spewing its watery moonlight down.The dense woods lightly unfold their dense green leaves and branches in the summer wind. The waterfalls crash down as they flow, but the sounds are unable to cover the noises of the sandalwood crickets chirping about.Fang Yuan stepped onto the green grass, quietly approaching a mountain boar.This mountain boar had its head buried, puffing and snorting as it digged the emerald earth with its snout, rummaging among the soil and grass to look for worms.The wild boar was an omnivorous animal. It not only ate worms, but also stole bird eggs and was adept at hunting wild rabbits, mice, even venomous creatures such as snakes and scorpions.Fang Yuan crept slowly from behind the boar.Under the bright moonlight, the greyish black fur coat of the wild pig could be seen clearly. Its body was strong and firm, the four limbs short and rough. On its back was a long and stiff mane, while atop its ears were sparse fur that was erect like needles. With all four limbs on the ground, each foot had four toes but only the two middle ones were digging against the soil. Its fail was thin and short, sometimes flinging about, chasing away the mosquitoes flying around.Suddenly it stopped digging for its meal, rearing its head up. At the same time the boar\u2019s sharp little upright ears quickly trembled a few times. Although Fang Yuan had managed to stop his tracks in time, this mountain boar still found him. It immediately turned around and groaned out with warning sounds.Fang Yuan was not surprised by this. A wild animal was not like a domestic one, they were all very alert. Especially the wild boar, they had acute smell and could find bird nests that were often hidden very well.Even if this mountain boar did not hear any noises, when Fang Yuan neared around a hundred meters away from it, it would be able to smell the his body odour and will still be able to sense Fang Yuan\u2019s presence.Although Fang Yuan had five Gu worms on him at the moment \u2014 the Spring Autumn Cicada, Liquor worm, Moonlight Gu, Little Light Gu and the white boar Gu, these Gu were all not able to match each other, and were incompatible.If Fang Yuan had a Smell Lock Gu that could cover up his body odour, and another Quiet Steps Gu that concealed the noise of one\u2019s footsteps, he could completely and silently reach up to a distance of ten steps away from the mountain pig.However if he had these two Gu then Fang Yuan would have been keeping seven Gu worms, this would cause his primeval essence usage to be too great and he would have difficulty supporting them.Gu Masters in general can only feed four to five Gu worms of the same rank. Thus Gu Masters usually do not move alone, but instead form small groups of five, or at the very least with three.Among the groups, there would be someone specially in charge of detection, one responsible for advancement, one bearing the offence role, another responsible for medical treatment and someone in charge of resisting and holding back hostiles.Fang Yuan continued without stop, getting closer to the wild boar.The wild boar screeched lowly, the white fur on its neck standing, the symbol of its agitation.Finally when Fang Yuan was near enough, closer than the wild boar\u2019s acceptable range, the wild boar\u2019s hoofs dug the ground three times before spreading its muscular four limbs, lowered its head and dashed towards Fang Yuan.Its upper jaw was withdrawn, its lower jaw turning upwards, forming two white tusks. Under the moonlight, the tusks shone with light as it stabbed towards Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan had no defensive type of Gu worm, and if he was pierced by the tusk, his stomach would be penetrated, his intestines would be punctured and he would be heavily injured if not dead.\"Moonlight Gu.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s face was calm as he thought in his mind, causing the Moonlight Gu in his palm to absorb his primeval essence and emit an eerie moonlight glow, interweaving with the moonlight from the night sky.The wild boar charged towards Fang Yuan as his right palm swiped across the air.With a swoosh, the moonblade flew out and hit the wild boar in the face, causing blood to splatter all over.The wild boar cried out loudly, turning its anger into fuel as its charge became even faster, and in the blink of an eye, it reached a few steps before Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan nimbly jumped to the side, rolling and breaking his fall.The wild boar charged right past Fang Yuan, and with a boom, crashed into a tree behind him.The tiny tree was only as thick as a human arm, after getting knocked by the wild boar, it received devastating damage as the tree trunk tore open and split into two.Fang Yuan stood up, quickly getting close to the wild boar while a moonblade shot out from his right hand at the same time.The eerily blue moonblade drew a straight line across the air as it landed on the wild boar.The wild boar\u2019s black fur had several thin cuts on it. The injury was very deep and bright red blood oozed out from it.The moonblade Fang Yuan activated used up upper stage primeval essence, thus it was able to break even a human\u2019s toughest bones in one shot. But on the boar, it could only cause such superficial injury, and not damage the bones.A small wild boar like this was so strong, this showed how cruel the living environment was in this world!The wild boar growled, and charged towards Fang Yuan again.In the process of sprinting, its blood-dripping wound continued to tear open, and its warm blood poured out like water.Fang Yuan used the same trick, taking a tumble sideways and dodged its charge.The wild boar, although strong and very ferocious, had one weakness \u2014 it could not change directions easily. Its speed was fast, but that meant it could not alter directions easily, so this way, every one of its charges is in a straight line. As long as a Gu Master is attentive enough, it is not hard to dodge.Boom, boom, boom.Every time the wild boar charged, Fang Yuan would shoot a few moonblades, causing its old wounds to be overlapped with new wounds, and the angrier it got, the more blood flowed.After a few times, its movements slowed and its growling also revealed a hint of weakness.\"Little light Gu.\"This time, Fang Yuan not only activated the Moonlight Gu, but also deployed his primeval essence and injected it into the Little light Gu.The Moonlight Gu after being refined had always stayed in Fang Yuan\u2019s right palm, turning into a blue crescent moon tattoo. After the Little light Gu was refined, it also resided in his right palm, turning into the shape of a five-sided star.At this point, his dark green primeval essence entered the two Gu, the moonlight emitting an eerie blue moonlight while the Little light Gu emitted a milky white glow.The milky white light fused into the moonlight, and the originally small lump of moonlight instantly became twice as big.\"Go.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s right hand sweeped, and an enhanced giant moonblade flew out.Using only the Moonlight Gu, the size was only palm-sized. But with the addition and help of the Little light Gu, the moonblade\u2019s size doubled, and its attack range also doubled as well.Swoosh!The moonblade hit the wild boar on the neck, creeping into its black grey fur. It emerged from the other end and flew for about three to four meters before dissipating in the air.Glup glup...The wild boar stood on the spot, frozen for a moment, then blood oozed out from its injuries like a fountain.It abruptly collapsed, half of its head cut off, washed away by the pouring blood, and only a small piece of flesh kept it together with its body.A thick smell of blood gushed out into his nose.Fang Yuan did not dare to hesitate, pointing a finger at the wild boar, and the White Boar Gu which was residing in his aperture instantly turned into a milky white light and entered the wild boar\u2019s body.Fang Yuan stood on the spot, nervously staying alert of the surroundings. Although the beast skin map said that the area was relatively safe, there were always accidents in nature, what if beasts were attracted by the smell of the blood?After a while, the White Boar Gu flew back safe and sound.The entire boar had shrunk in half, only leaving behind its black grey fur and the intestines under its skin. As for the meat, most of it was eaten by the White Boar Gu.But the strange thing was, although the White Boar Gu ate pork nearly a thousand times its size, it did not change physically.There was not even a drip of blood on it, as it maintained that milky white worm appearance.\"After this meal, I\u2019ll come five days later to hunt boars.\" Fang Yuan kept the White Boar Gu, but did not leave immediately. Instead, he took out his knife and extracted the two tusks of the boar.The wild boar\u2019s body had a few things of value.The first was pork, the second was fur, and the third was its teeth.But now the wild boar meat was mostly eaten by the White Boar Gu; its skin was full of holes due to the moonblades, being meaningless even if retrieved.Only this pair of tusks had some value. It could be used as food for certain Gu worms which ate teeth as food, or used as a catalyst for some Gu worm\u2019s advancement.Fang Yuan hid the teeth in the rock crack\u2019s secret cave before returning to the hostel.He did not sleep immediately, but sat on his bed and started to cultivate.Within the aperture, the primeval sea acted like waves, rising and falling.Fang Yuan was now a middle stage Gu Master, so after using the Liquor worm refinement, he had upper stage primeval essence.Thus, while the people his age had middle stage pale green primeval essence, Fang Yuan\u2019s primeval essence was dark green.Now that he killed a boar, there was only 23% of his primeval essence in his aperture.A Rank one Gu Master was not that strong in battle. Or rather, nature\u2019s environment was too harsh. Even if the moonblade could break bones, to kill a normal wild boar, Fang Yuan had to use 20% of his upper stage primeval essence.\"White Boar Gu.\"His eyes were shut tight, his spirit immersed into his aperture.In the aperture, a gush of dark green primeval essence rushed up against the flow, injecting into the White Boar Gu.The White Boar Gu immediately emitted a bright white light, and the light enveloped Fang Yuan\u2019s body. If one looked from the outside, they would see that Fang Yuan\u2019s body was emitting a pure white light from the inside.Fang Yuan\u2019s every muscle and every inch of skin, was soaked in this white light.A feeling of numbness and itchiness was felt by him. As the white light modified his muscles, it allowed strength to be slowly infused into his body, thus gaining roots and never to be lost again.However, after a moment, the numb feeling became pain. This pain was like getting electrocuted, from numbness to sharp pain like getting cut by razor blades.Fang Yuan hurriedly stopped the White Boar Gu.Anything prolonged was not good.The White Boar Gu could not be overused, it could be applied about fifteen minutes a day. Exceed it, and extreme pain would be felt, increasingly painful.If he continued using it despite that, a person might even die from the pain!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime flies, and with the blink of an eye, it was already the middle of June.The summer night, with the golden arc of the moon hanging high in the sky, shining its radiance on the green mountain lands.The winds blew and the leaves danced with the moonlight. The song of the cicadas and bullfrogs were simultaneous with each other. At times the sound of a wolf howling could be heard from afar, echoing throughout the green mountain.On a river bank, a creek was scrubbing over a piece of smooth cliff rock. Beside this bank, a battle was ongoing.A mountain boar covered in fine and deep wounds all over kicked its legs and rushed forward once more towards Fang Yuan. The blood was pouring from its wounds, marking a road of fresh red liquid.Fang Yuan wrestled with it, showing no signs of panic.The wild boar was on the verge of death, but it was precisely these moments that wild beasts are the most dangerous. Using the last remaining potential of their lives, their insanity and tenacity, could cause one to get gravely injured at any careless moment.Fang Yuan was peaceful, his black iris glowing eerily under the moonlight, showing the light of absolute calmness.He had the experience of 500 years, a part of him was engrossed in combat, while another disengaged from the battle, and remained alert towards the surroundings.Many times when he was hunting wild boars, other animals came to wreck havoc. At times, a wild boar, another time wild wolves, and even once a wandering tiger.As time passed, the wild boar\u2019s attacks gradually slowed down.Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone brightly as he took a few strides forward, getting close to the wild boar. Raising strength in his shoulder and arms, he carried and raised the wild boar in one breath.Huff!Fang Yuan growled as his face was puffed red, his arms stretching out and raising the wild boar high above his head.The wild boar feebly struggled.Fang Yuan\u2019s body was unstable, he used all his strength to throw the wild boar.With a boom, the wild boar was thrown onto a large rock by the river bank. It cried pitifully as sounds of its bones breaking could be heard.It fell down from the large rock, blood oozing out from its ears, nose and mouth.It struggled a few times before drawing its final breath.The surroundings regained its peace.The river water flowed endlessly, carrying the boar\u2019s blood along the river to some far away place.\"My strength right now can compete with a boar! Tonight I\u2019ll go try that giant rock at the passageway.\" Fang Yuan stood on the spot, breathing in heavily with a hint of excitement flashing across his eyes.These days he had used the White Boar Gu non-stop to increase the strength of his body. He could feel strongly now that his strength was getting bigger.Back then when he fought wild boars, he could only use a kiting technique with the moonblade, but now he could even carry the wild boar, so the increment of his strength had shown great progress.Of course, the White Boar Gu would not endless give him strength. The limit was a boar\u2019s strength, and once he reached the limit, it would no longer grant him any additional strength.\"I can carry a wild boar now, but that does not mean I can go head to head with a boar, like how a strong man can carry another strong man, but it does not mean they have equal strength. My strength can continue to grow.\"Feeding all the pork to the White Boar Gu, Fang Yuan used his hunting knife to retrieve the boar\u2019s teeth, and finally diced up the already heavily torn boar skin, before going into the secret cave in the rock crack.As for the boar\u2019s corpse, it did not need him to do anything. During the summer night, wild beasts roamed freely, and not long after, there should be wild beasts picking up the scent of the blood and rush here to clean the scene for Fang Yuan.Or rather, even if someone found out, it was inconsequential. The wild boar\u2019s injuries were all \u2018edited\u2019 by Fang Yuan, looking nothing like moonblade cuts.Back to the secret cave enveloped in red light, Fang Yuan threw the two wild boar teeth at a corner.The wild boar\u2019s teeth collided, causing a crisp sound.At this corner, there was already a pile of wild boar teeth. They were the results of Fang Yuan\u2019s hunting.Fang Yuan squirmed into the passageway, once again getting to the end of the tunnel.Walking on the tunnel, his footsteps could be heard echoing in the cave, his vision dyed red due to the light.Everything was unchanged; the giant rock was still there, quietly blocking his path. As for the hole created after digging out the earth treasury flower, it had already been filled up by Fang Yuan.Haa!Fang Yuan walked in front of the giant rock, raised both hands and pushed.Although his face grew red with exertion, and he used all his strength, the giant rock did not move an inch.\"With my current strength, I can only carry a wild boar. But this giant rock, it is at least the weight of five to six boars. No wonder I cannot move it. The Flower Wine Monk\u2019s strength inheritance is not that easily obtained!\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone as he estimated in his heart.He did not give up, but instead came out of the tunnel and returned to the secret room upstairs.Taking a bamboo tube from the corner of the wall, Fang Yuan sat on the ground and opened the lid, taking out the beast skin map and sheets of bamboo paper.He opened the beast skin map and started to memorise it, using his fingers to draw on the traces on the map to aid in his memorization.Ever since he had obtained the map, he had been doing this everyday.Fang Yuan did not have a storage type Gu, he could not bring the beast skin map with him everywhere. Carrying a bamboo tube on him while battling is inconvenient too. Thus, Fang Yuan put in some effort and was prepared to stuff the entire beast skin map\u2019s content into his head.Some things, even if troublesome, had to be done. In a person\u2019s life, those who did not actively resolve problems due to fearing trouble, would always face a dangerous predicament at the end. Fang Yuan understood this logic from his previous life.\"When one is young, their memory sure is good. I have already memorised more than half of this map. If I was old, I would probably forget the content while memorising this. Hehehe\u2026 of course if I had a Bookworm, I would feed this map to it, and from then on, as long as I do not lose the Bookworm, I will be able to recall this map clearly forever.\"Fang Yuan had the Liquor worm, White Boar Gu, and was now beginning to have insatiable greed, starting to crave the Bookworm.The value of the Bookworm was quite close to the Liquor worm and White Boar Gu, all being rare species among the Rank one Gu worms. The market price was expensive and they were often sold out in moments.In his previous life, Fang Yuan did not obtain the Liquor worm or White Boar Gu, but he accidentally obtained a Bookworm. This Bookworm eventually advanced ranks with him, and accompanied him for a whole sixty years.\"Forget it, Bookworms are rare and low in numbers, I won\u2019t be able to get one anytime soon. To speak the truth, my current stage is way better than my previous life at this point. Last time at this period, I was still a Rank one initial stage, while the others like Fang Zheng, Chi Cheng, Mo Bei were already upper stage, far beyond me.\" Fang Yuan was not someone who worried over nothing, quickly getting over it.He was rather satisfied with his current progress.He was a middle stage, and the others were also middle stage. With his C grade talent, he could maintain the same speed as these A and B grades, it was not easy. Much effort was given to the Liquor worm, as well as Fang Yuan\u2019s rich cultivating experience.The other aspect, was also due to Fang Yuan.His act of extortion had caused the classmates to bulk up on training their physical fighting skills under the help of their elders. Unknowingly, it caused them to be distracted, reducing the time they spent on nurturing their apertures. This resulted in everyone\u2019s cultivation level being even lower than Fang Yuan\u2019s past life.But even so, they were not so far from upper stage now.Gu Masters\u2019 early stage of cultivation was rather easy, seeing effect in a short period of time. Especially Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Mo Chen and Chi Cheng, their cultivation level had already creeped and even seemed to surpass Fang Yuan.With constant cultivation, these three with their talent, or the support behind them, had already begun to show their advantage. The lead that Fang Yuan had due to the Liquor worm was starting to disappear.Of course, there was also the reason of him hunting recently and using the White Boar Gu to raise his strength, or spending much of his time and effort in doing so.\"At this rate, before long, someone will advance to upper stage. The first person that achieves upper stage will get a reward of thirty primeval stones. But this reward, I do not intend to contest for it.\" Fang Yuan had decided long ago.If he abandoned the White Boar Gu now and rushed for upper stage, he might have some hopes of winning. But that was not Fang Yuan\u2019s goal. Thirty primeval stones might be good but he did not lack primeval stones at the moment.The bigger reason was that he needed to remain concealed and keep a low profile to reduce other people\u2019s attention towards him, so that he can inherit the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s strength inheritance successfully.This is his real motive.\"The academy has all sorts of rewards, but it is just carrots to pique the student\u2019s interest, and most importantly, it is a part of the family\u2019s system. Fighting for these little rewards, is not what a wise person would do.\"Fang Yuan collect his spirits and gazed at the beast skin map again.The beast skin map had two pages; one recorded the day while the other recorded the night. Many lines of different colours intertwined on it.These lines, some were straight, some were curved, but they all had their own specific meaning. Only old man Wang would be clear of their meaning, but it is a pity he died. But even if he was alive, by forcing him to speak, he might not say the truth.These days, Fang Yuan relied on his knowledge and experience, and according to the bamboo paper\u2019s comparison, he had already deciphered it all.\"The red cross represents danger, a forbidden zone. The area with the red cross seems to be surrounded by wild boars, it is probably a wild boar king there. With my current strength, I\u2019m as good as dead if I encounter one. Hmph!\"Thinking of old man Wang, Fang Yuan could not help but snort again.This area marked with a cross was not marked on the bamboo paper. If Fang Yuan really believed the bamboo paper, he would probably die by the fangs of the wild boar king one day. This old man Wang was indeed experienced. To avenge his son, he did not have to act himself, but borrowed the wild boar king\u2019s strength. This way, even if Fang Yuan dies, he would be able to avoid responsibility.\"But these three spots marked with a red circle, what do they mean?\" Fang Yuan was perturbed.This was the beast skin map\u2019s final suspicious point.Three red circles, showing three very isolated areas. They were also very far apart, and had little surrounding beasts, considered safer areas in the wild.\"The red cross represents forbidden area, but what does the red circle represent?\" Fang Yuan fell into deep thoughts, \"Normally, red is the most alert colour. Old man Wang marked these three areas, meaning they are important. It is a pity these areas are far, if not I would inspect them myself and find the reason.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Any organisation would also require loyaltyTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe hot summer sun blazes on, the mountain winds blowing the warm winds around, Qing Mao Mountain steaming under the hot air.In the blink of an eye, it was already near the end of June.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng!\" In the academy, the family elder called out.Gu Yue Fang Zheng got up from his seat and came before the Academy Elder.Under the admiring gaze of his classmates, Fang Zheng received a heavy bag of primeval stones.\"Fang Zheng, you are the first to advance to upper stage, this is your reward. Good job, continue working hard.\" Academy elder smiled pleasantly, patting Fang Zheng\u2019s shoulders.Fang Zheng acknowledged with a grunt, his face full of excitement.He took the money bag over with emotion and returned to his seat.\"I finally did it. The first to advance to upper stage, do you see that big brother, I finally beat you for once!\"His eyes shone with bright light as he swept his gaze over at Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan was sprawled on the table, sound asleep. Last night he had killed another wild boar, and after returning to the hostel, he used the White Boar Gu to improve his body and also used the natural essence within the primeval stones to refine his primeval essence using the Liquor worm. Finally, he used his upper stage primeval essence to nurture his aperture, all the way until morning.He hurriedly ate breakfast before rushing to class, falling asleep as soon as he settled in. He was too exhausted, and Gu Master cultivation could not replace sleep.\"Hmph, even if you don\u2019t admit it, this is the truth. Big brother, I have finally surpassed you! This is the first, and there will be a second time, a third time!\"Fang Zheng clenched his fists. This success was extremely meaningful to him. He had already broken through the dark clouds in his heart, creating and opening to allow light to penetrate in.Even though this light was thin, it gave Fang Zheng hope and encouragement!\"Hmph, I actually lost to that Fang Zheng.\" Gu Yue Mo Bei sat on his seat, arms crossed, feeling indignant.\"This is the advantage of an A grade, damn it...\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng said with a dark expression. As he cultivated, he felt strongly the advantages of a good talent. Even with his grandfather Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s support, plus his extremely hard work, he was still left behind by Fang Zheng.\"If only I had a Liquor worm, plus grandfather\u2019s help, I might not lose to Fang Zheng! Those accursed Fang family brothers! Little brother is A grade, suppressing us, but the brother being a C grade has a Liquor worm. Why did all the good things in this world go to these brothers?\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng felt really indignant.\"This time Fang Zheng broke through to upper stage first.\"\"Of course, he is A grade talent\".\"Yeah, even Mo Bei, Chi Cheng, and Fang Yuan lost to Fang Zheng. Fang Zheng has gained all the attention this time.\"\"Fang Yuan having the Liquor worm is not putting in effort. Wasting his time everyday, even sleeping in class, he might as well give his Liquor worm to me.\"The surrounding students discussed, feeling indignant in their hearts, helplessness and envy.The academy elder called them one by one, and students went up continuously to collect their primeval stones allowance, and returned to their seats.\"Everyone quieten down.\" After the allowance was given out, the academy elder used his hand to hit the table. All of a sudden, the academy became silent.\"Now, you\u2019ve all mastered your second Gu worm and even so much as broke through into the upper stage. In the past half a year, you have all worked hard, and now you have some basics, it is time for you to train in the wilds. True battles, are not scarecrows or puppets, wooden puppets that stand there and await your attacks.\"The following mid year examination, will be held three days later, all students have to attend! The examination content is to hunt wild boars. By collecting wild boar teeth as results to record, those who collect the most wild boar teeth will get better scores. At the end of the examination, each wild boar teeth can be exchanged for ten primeval stones. Furthermore, you are allowed to hunt in groups.\"The academy elder\u2019s words caused a commotion among the students.\"The mid-year exam is finally here!\"\"Every year\u2019s students study at the academy for a year, and there is always a mid-year exam and an end of year exam. Looking at the time, it really is time for the mid-year exam.\"\"Every year\u2019s examination content is different, to think that this year, our examination is to hunt and acquire wild boar teeth.\"\"What should we do? My talent is only D grade, my vital Gu isn't an attack-type like the Moonlight Gu, how can I hunt wild boars?\"\"Didn\u2019t you hear, the family elder said, we are allowed to hunt in groups. For those with talent that can\u2019t make it, or those with Gu worms that aren\u2019t suitable, we can help each other and cooperate! When we get boar teeth, we just need to share with one another, and that would work.\"\"Each wild boar teeth can be exchanged for ten primeval stones, this is the academy encouraging us to hunt more wild boars, and the prize is set for that. For true market value, one primeval stone can buy twenty wild boar teeth.\"The students had varying expressions, some were happy while other fretted, some were eager to go, while others called on companions, even Fang Yuan was slightly moved.\"It changed! I remember that last year\u2019s examination was to collect wildlife honey. To think that it changed to wild boar teeth. Is this the butterfly effect?\"A butterfly flapping its wings can cause a giant storm on the coast of another ocean. A small change in the initial conditions lead to drastic changes in the results.Ever since his rebirth, Fang Yuan had made many changes, the conditions of his current self was vastly different from his previous life. Back then he had already been left behind by Fang Zheng and the others, but now he was adamantly at the top of the student board.In his past life he did not kill Jia Jin Sheng, in fact they did not even meet. But this life, he did not only kill Jia Jin Sheng, he even excavated the deeper treasures of the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance.These changes are like a butterfly flapping its wings, indirectly causing changes to the environment. The mid-year examination change is only the first of such symptoms.\"If I continue changing things, will it cause history to become completely unrecognisable as well? In that case, the advantage from my rebirth would be significantly reduced.\"Fang Yuan looked calm, but was sighing internally.The feeling of inability and pressing urgency roamed his heart, but he quickly adjusted his mood.\"No matter what, since it has already happened, I can\u2019t stop it. What I need to do now is to actively change myself. Even if the events are completely different at the end, I would not slow down my growth just because of such concerns!\"\"In my past life I knew nothing about the future, does that mean that in my current life I lack courage? Hehe, even if the world is full of thorns, I will cut through all the thorns in my way and pave out a blood-filled path myself!\"\"Every teeth for ten primeval stones, this price is very high. Should I sell all those wild boar fangs I have stocked up at the cave? But if I do, I might attract suspicion? No, according to the Gu Yue clan\u2019s political situation, if I sell these wild boar teeth publicly, I might get screwed over.\"Fang Yuan shook his head, the risks were too big. If he really sold these teeth, what could he get in return?A little over one hundred primeval stones?\"Wait, primeval stones aren\u2019t important. Maybe I can use this change to construct my image again.\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone brightly.He needed to get rich secretly now, being as low profile as possible. If the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance was exposed, he might even lose his life.But his current position was awkward.He stood against all his classmates, being outside the system, and among the higher-ups, he was an untamable, unhappy and indignant, intelligent and cold, C grade talent teenager.This image was not good, it literally portrayed him as unloyal. But a clan requires loyalty, in fact, any organisation requires loyalty.No matter which world, loyalty is the value that is most sought after in clans. Loyalty to the clan, loyalty to the country, loyalty to his leader, loyalty to his loved one, loyalty to his friends etc.As Fang Yuan\u2019s cultivation level got higher, the higher-ups would only get more concerned, and if needed, the family may even use hard handed methods on him. At that point, Fang Yuan would be really thrown into passivity.Fang Yuan did not like passiveness, he liked to have the control of all matters tightly in his grip.Because of a series of events before, Fang Yuan could only operate on the go, relying on outside strength, and this image he constructed was only to protect himself in times of need.But now that he could protect himself, Fang Yuan needed to be stronger!Thus, he needed to change this image, letting the higher-ups think that he had given up and joined the clan system. But this conversation cannot be too abrupt, or it would be suspicious.More importantly, joining this system is only a facade, Fang Yuan would not really join them truly, and be manipulated and restricted. He had too many secrets.He needed large amounts of freedom, and in actuality he was still a loner in operation.But now the mid-year exam was a chance.\"It seems I have to do some plotting, I\u2019ll start from the extortion then.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze became certain as everything fell into his scheme.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"You said that during Fang Yuan\u2019s extortion this time, although he defeated Fang Zheng, Chi Cheng and Mo Bei, he left go of them and did not take their primeval stones?\" Hearing the guard\u2019s report, the academy elder revealed a slightly shocked expression.\"I dare not lie to lord, it is indeed like this.\" The guard kneeling on the ground immediately responded.\"Mm.\" The academy elder did not express his opinion, and waved his hand, \"I have understood this matter, you may go.\"\"Your subordinate takes his leave.\"Once the guard had left, the academy elder immediately fell into deep thoughts.He was originally concerned with this matter as he was afraid Fang Yuan would snatch away the thirty primeval stones that Fang Zheng had gotten as a reward. If that was the case, the academy\u2019s reward system would have no meaning, they might as well give everything to Fang Yuan.If Fang Yuan really did that, the academy would not allow it, and the academy elder was already prepared to punish Fang Yuan.But he did not expect that not only did Fang Yuan have no intention to take the thirty primeval stones from Fang Zheng, he even let go of Mo Bei and Chi Cheng as well.\"Fang Yuan has hundreds of primeval stones on hand, he might not be too concerned with the thirty primeval stones, that is understandable. But giving up on extorting Mo Bei, Chi Cheng and Fang Zheng, what is the reason?\"The academy elder contemplated, his eyebrows gradually easing. He had understood something.Mo Bei, Chi Cheng and Fang Zheng, they could be said to represent the three factions of the clan. Letting go of them, the meaning was that he was appealing to the three different factions. This was understandable, as Fang Yuan\u2019s attitude change meant that he was finally willing to lower his head to the clan.\"Understandable. As he cultivated, Fang Yuan may have the Liquor worm, but the situation has gotten clearer to him. The inability of a C grade talent, after a few outbursts, and letting go of the majority of his negative feelings, he is probably rather downhearted and depressed now.\"\"It seems the clan leader\u2019s words make sense, Fang Yuan is after all a fifteen year old, how can he go against the clan\u2019s system? Now that he has started to accept reality, once he finds the position that he belongs to, he would fuse into the clan naturally.\"Thinking of this, the academy elder breathed out a sigh of relief, his feelings becoming more cheerful.Three days passed in a flash. Soon, the mid-year exam was here.\"Faster, faster, I\u2019ve lured the wild boar out!\" A youngster ran as he shouted out frantically.On both his legs, there was a light green ring of swirling wind. With these two rings, it led to him having above average speed at such a young age.However, the wild boar chasing after him became faster and faster, and the distance between them was shortening.The scorching sun penetrated the forest and reflected on the wild boar, causing both its teeth to shine brightly.\"The wild boar is coming, hold the rope tightly!\" The four ambushing youngsters quickly hid in the bushes and pulled the ropes tightly, instantly forming a tripping rope.The speeding youngster leapt lightly, jumping over the road and continued running.But the boar behind him tripped over the rope and fell harshly on the ground, crashing five to six meters before stopping.\"Oww!\" The four youngsters were pulled along by the rope, and fell to the ground along with the wild boar.\"Strike!\" The youngster running ahead turned around and shouted.The few people lying on the ground frantically stood up, and surrounded the wild boar.Kacha!A small budding tree, under the impact of the wild boar, snapped in half and the tree crown fell to the ground.\"What a close shave!\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng wiped the sweat off his forehead, feeling lingering fear. \"Luckily I managed to use the Dragonpill cricket Gu and leapt three meters to the left, otherwise this tree would\u2019ve been my outcome.\"Pew pew pew!Moonblade danced in the air as it hit the wild boar\u2019s body, causing long and shallow cuts.Gu Yue Mo Bei\u2019s face was excited, his eyes glowing, his spirits immersed in this battle.Half an hour later, the wild boar collapsed due to excessive loss of blood.Gu Yue Mo Bei breathed roughly and also sat on the ground, his entire body full of mud and grass, at the same time full of sweat.\"Fighting against a living being like the wild boar is indeed different from the wooden puppet, grass puppet during practise battles. I spent thirty minutes just to kill a wild boar, I wonder how are the others doing?\"On a hidden small hill, there was a temporarily built tent. The tent blocked the punishing sun rays and casted an area of cool dark shadowy shade.Under the cover, there was a few chairs and tables, with the academy elder sitting at the main seat. Beside him, there were other clan elders. A few Gu Masters were standing behind them.In the surrounding forests around the tent, there were also some hidden Gu Masters.At this time, the forest ahead had an abnormal disturbance.Whoosh!A Gu Master emerged from the forest like a shadow and quickly ran out, kneeling outside the tentage.\"How is the situation?\" Academy elder asked.\"Reporting to Lord Elder, at this point, there are no casualties among the students.\" The Gu Master quickly answered.\"Good, good.\"\"An afternoon had already gone by since the mid-year exam started. To have no injuries, this is different from the past years.\"\"It looks like this is all the academy elder\u2019s effort.\"The other clan elders nodded satisfactorily, praising in turns.The academy elder shook his head slightly, he knew the reason. This was due to Fang Yuan\u2019s emergence, extorting his classmates, causing them to practise hard on basic martial arts, thus having such a performance.He looked towards the kneeling Gu Master, and continued asking, \"Then at this point, whose results are the best?\"The Gu Master answered immediately, \"Reporting to Lord, at this point, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng, Mo Bei, Chi Cheng, are leading. Chi Cheng killed three boars, Fang Zheng and Mo Bei killed five, and Fang Yuan has the most, at eight.\"\"Oh? To think Fang Yuan is leading!\"\"In all the years, it is a very rare sight that A and B grade talents are being suppressed by a C grade.\"\"He has the Liquor worm right? That means he has upper stage green copper primeval essence, so to have such a result, it is understandable.\"\"I believe that from now on, Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng would surpass him. Although he has the Liquor worm, his primeval essence recovery rate cannot compare to A, B grade talents.\"The other clan elders discussed.\"You may go.\" Academy elder waved his hand towards the kneeling Gu Master. \"Instruct the others, focus on their protecting job. Especially Fang Zheng, Chi Cheng and Mo Bei, pay more attention and ensure their safety!\"\"Yes, lord.\" The Gu Master retreated.These outdoor combats to most students, it was really their first time. Thus, there was danger and the clan naturally has plans. Dozens of Rank two Gu Masters were concealed in the forests, controlling the safety of this entire examination. At the same time, some Rank three clan elders were staying here to anticipate sudden accidents.The blazing sun slowly descended from the highest point in the sky, gradually nearing the north-east mountains.The sunset glow ignited the clouds; it was the sun\u2019s last flow of passion.As the last sunlight shone into the forest, another wild boar fell on the ground.\"Twenty third.\" Fang Yuan calculated in his heart, and then squatted down, skillfully carving out a wild boar teeth.There was a bag on his back, inside was a large number of wild boar teeth.At the same time, he had another bag, carrying the teeth of those boars he killed last time. These teeth were originally stored in the rock crack secret cave, and were retrieved by Fang Yuan the previous night, stored into a bag and buried in a secret location.\"I am familiar with the terrain and wild boar distribution, at the same time I have upper stage primeval essence to use the Moonlight Gu together with the Little light Gu. The others\u2019 efficiency definitely cannot compare to me. Just with this bag on me, I can get number one easily. I wonder what expressions they would show when I take out the other bag later? Hehe.\"Fang Yuan looked at the sky; it was time to retrieve the other bag.Thinking of this, in his head, a map showed up.These days, he had memorized the beast skin map. Fang Yuan was clear of his current position. If he turned left and walked along the stream for fifteen minutes, he would reach the location where he buried the bag.But when he was about to move, he hesitated.\"With my current location, I am only five to six hundred meters away from the nearest red circle marking. Such a rare chance, should I go take a look?\"Once he had the thought, it was unstoppable.Since he had already won anyway, Fang Yuan had a lot of time left.\"That beast skin map had three red circle markings, these three locations were very important to old man Wang. It is also the only meaning that I could not decipher on the map. I\u2019ll go see!\"Fang Yuan naturally knew that there were Gu Masters controlling the scene, but this was also why he needed evidence.Immediately, he acted like he was going to continue killing wild boars, and moved deeper into the forest.Seven minutes later, he arrived at the red marking location.A treehouse was hidden among the bushes on a huge tree, and if one did not observe closely they would not be able to find it.\"This is old man Wang\u2019s temporary residence while hunting?\" Fang Yuan frowned, his heart getting confused.He climbed into the treehouse.When he saw the sight in the tree house, his expression changed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe space in the tree house isn\u2019t large, but there were many items inside, so at one glance it seemed extremely messy.The floor in the center had a thick dark yellow-coloured carpet.Inside the house, there was an iron stove beside the wall, and on it there was a bronze kettle. Inside the stove there was black coloured soot, and beside it there was a small pile of unburnt dried firewood.Despite it being summer, the nights in this mountain were still icy cold. The iron stove could maintain the entire treehouse\u2019s warmth when lit, despite its small size.The treehouse has two sets of windows, two to three ropes wrapped as the frame of the windows, connecting the two together in the middle of the room.On the rope hanged several torn pieces of clothing, the torn patches pieced together. It was obviously an adult\u2019s clothing and was still slightly damp, not completely dry from the sun yet.The light of the setting sun penetrated the windows and shone inside the treehouse.The treehouse was rather dark internally. At a corner there were axes and hunting knives with beast skin wrapped on the handle. On the blade there was even dark red blood traces.On the other side of the wall, there was a piece of bamboo paper with a dagger stabbed in the middle.There was a young man\u2019s face on the bamboo paper \u2014 it was Fang Yuan\u2019s appearance!This all meant that during this short period, someone had come to the hidden treehouse and lived here. The person\u2019s intention was obvious, his target was Fang Yuan.The paper was stabbed by a dagger and showed his evil intent to the extremes!Such a scenario, even Fang Yuan was taken aback.\"What does this person want, and why is he against me? No, maybe it isn\u2019t me but Fang Zheng.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s thoughts flew all over his mind.Fang Zheng was an A grade talent, the only one in the last three years of the Gu Yue clan, and is their only hope. If he could be truly nurtured, he would be the next figure in the clan.But nurturing was a process.During this process, there were calamities and human-made disasters.Ignoring calamities, the most important was human disasters. As everyone knew, Qing Mao mountain did not only have the Gu Yue clan, but also the Bai clan and Xiong clan. These two forces would not be happy to see the dominating Gu Yue clan successfully nurturing an A grade talent.Thus, sending assassins to get rid of him was a common thing.In this world, there are little geniuses, and even less of those who could successfully grow up.A grade talent Gu Masters, it was not that they did not exist. Three years ago, one appeared in the Gu Yue clan. In even earlier generations, they also appeared on occasions.But on Qing Mao Mountain, out of the three clans in these years, there was only one successful A grade talent nurtured \u2014 the Bai clan\u2019s Bai Ning Bing of Rank three cultivation.Such a scenario was enough to say many things.\"This person, is he from the Bai clan or the Xiong clan? They want to get rid of Gu Yue Fang Zheng so soon?\" Fang Yuan frowned, staring at the portrait.\"But why did old man Wang\u2019s beast skin map indicate this treehouse? Was he a spy from the other forces? No, this person is obviously after me!\"Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone with brilliance.At this moment, he thought of many scenes.The first time, it was beside the trap, and the four hunter\u2019s conversation \u2014A hunter said, \"Second brother Wang, you\u2019re almost nineteen, it is time you got married and have children.\"Wang Er said, \"Hmph, as a true man, how can I be lusting after such small beauty! One day, I will walk out of this Qing Mao mountain and roam the world, learn everything in the world and live up to the expectations of my male body!\"The second time was after he himself acted, Wang Er\u2019s peculiar calmness. He pulled his bow and pointed at Fang Yuan. The others were already begging for forgiveness.The third was when Fang Yuan was asking questions.\"I ask you, in old man Wang\u2019s family, who else is there?\"A hunter answered, \"Hunter Wang originally had a wife, but that was decades ago, and she was killed by wild wolves that intruded the village. Before his wife died she gave birth to two sons and a daughter. But the oldest son Wang Da died on the mountain while hunting three years ago. There is no one else in the Wang family.\"\"I, I remember! Old man Wang actually also has a daughter-in-law, Wang Da\u2019s old wife. But after Wang Da disappeared, his wife died due to a broken heart. That year, the village even specially sent down a chastity memorial arch! But rumour has it that Wang Da\u2019s wife wanted to remarry, and she was actually hounded to death by Old man Wang. When you killed Old man Wang, lord, you are helping us citizens, rooting out the evil and bringing people peace!\"The other hunter quickly added, \"That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Actually lord, we have long found this old Wang unfavourable. Hmph, he\u2019s nothing special, just that he can hunt better than us. We\u2019re all just mortals, yet he thinks he\u2019s more special than us and purposely moved out of the village to live here. As the younger generation, we sometimes will ask him to teach us and impart his experiences, but he would just outright chase us away and never allow us to show up again near the wooden house!\"Old man Wang\u2019s family, moving out of the village, away from people\u2026...Eldest son Wang Da, died on the mountains three years ago while hunting\u2026...Wang Da\u2019s wife wanted to remarry, and was forced to commit suicide by old man Wang, and obtained a chastity memorial arch....Old man Wang chased away all the young hunters who were trying to ask for guidance...Old man Wang tried his best to hide the beast skin map, and on the bamboo paper, there were no such circles\u2026...Wang Er was at such a young age, but was calm towards Gu Masters. At the same time he did not marry, and had the aspiration to surpass mortal realm in his heart\u2026...Most importantly, the circles on the beast skin map indicated a hidden realm, there was obvious human activity in the area. At the same time this person held strong hatred towards Fang Yuan\u2026...All the clues pieced together, if separated they were not easy to link, but once linked it was peculiar!The more Fang Yuan thought about it, the more he felt that the mist shrouding this mystery has thinned.The setting sun\u2019s afterglow passed through the window and reflected upon his face, the strong light alike to the colour of blood.The surroundings had fallen into a deadly silence, was there someone secretly peeping at him all this time?Suddenly, Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes lit up, his vision crossing through time and space; he had seen the truth!\"Wang Da, did not die.\"At this moment, the glow in his eyes radiated the surroundings(1).\"Not only did he not die, he even became a demonic Gu Master by chance!\"It was not that mortals had no cultivating talent, but that the clan restricted the cultivation methods from leaking out, and controlled it tightly in their hands.But there was no absolute in this world.Mortals could become Gu Masters as well, from accidents in the wild and encountering the Hope Gu, opening their aperture. Or inheriting a certain strength inheritance, or getting the personal guidance from a certain clan\u2019s member.But these Gu Masters were not accepted into the clan completely, and could only be their henchmen. Thus, they would not be satisfied and became loner Gu Masters. Their cultivation is extremely difficult. As time passed, as they competed for resources, they would have to kill snatch and murder, turning towards the demonic path.\"Because of some lucky chance, the highest possibility is that he obtained a large fortune from a certain Gu Master\u2019s corpse and became a Gu Master three years ago. To hide from others, he sent out the fake information that he died, but no one had ever seen his corpse. Old man Wang\u2019s family found out about this and moved out of the village, risking the chance that wild beasts might invade and lived alone, just to hide this truth.\"\"But there were some problems that occurred, Wang Da\u2019s wife did not agree and might have wanted to report to the Gu Yue clan. Wang family had no choice but to kill her, and released some seemingly real and fake information to hide the truth. Something about her remarrying, or forcing her to commit suicide to hide the truth under all these rumors.\"\"Once in awhile, Wang Da would return home to stay. Thus, old man Wang had to chase those youngsters who were seeking guidance away. Wang Er after interacting with his brother had dispelled his fear of Gu Masters, and naturally developed the goal of wanting to be a Gu Master and explore the greatness of the outside world!\"\"Because of the fear that Wang Da might be exposed, even at such an old age Wang Er did not get married. Wang Da could not stay in the house, thus old man Wang drew three red circles on the beast skin map, these three locations should be hidden residential areas like this. Having three hiding spots, Wang Da rotated his stay around the houses, and lived in the fringe of the three clans\u2019 authority.\"The meaning of the three red circles was finally revealed!Red indicated alertness, but most importantly to old man Wang, this was his eldest son\u2019s residence. Thus, when Fang Yuan wanted the old man to draw the map, he did not indicate it on the bamboo paper, it was to protect his son. Similarly, he drew fewer red crosses, to avenge the death of his son.\"Maybe at a certain time each year, Wang Da will return home to stay for a while. When he returned, he found that his entire family was dead. After asking around, he found out it was me, thus he used the dagger to pin my portrait on the wall, so that he would exact revenge on me!\"With his previous life\u2019s experience, Fang Yuan was almost certain this was the truth.If it was some other power that wanted to assassinate Fang Zheng, they could be much more subtle. They did not have to develop a spy like old man Wang. After all, old man Wang lived at the mountain foot, not inside the Gu Yue village.\"To think that over a beast skin map, I provoked a murderer of the demonic faction. This world really works in wondrous ways,\" Fang Yuan could not help but snicker.He first killed Wang Er, the old man Wang and Wang\u2019s daughter, and it was all for the beast skin map. Old man Wang was the number one hunter in the village, so his beast skin map had the greatest value.At that time he was thinking: It\u2019s merely three mortal lives, what\u2019s the big deal, I\u2019ll just killing them conveniently.In this world, anyone had the right to live, and anyone could die just as easily.To think that out of nowhere, a demonic way Gu Master emerged!With regards to this, Fang Yuan did not have a tint of regret, but instead felt at ease.If he had been too merciful at the time, in his goal to obtain the Wang family beast skin map, Wang Er, old man Wang and sister Wang would\u2019ve been a huge disturbance. To protect Wang Da\u2019s secret, they would not give him the real product.Wang Er\u2019s battle strength could exterminate an ordinary Rank one upper stage Gu Master. Old man Wang was even more experienced with age, and in terms of killing strength, he was even more of a threat than Wang Er.Even if he had gotten the real product, old man Wang would\u2019ve informed Wang Da, and Wang Da would\u2019ve gotten Fang Yuan\u2019s information immediately. No matter how he dealt with it, he would be in the shadows while Fang Yuan was out in the open. Wang Da would be having the advantage of being in control of the situation.\"Good thing I killed them at the start! Regardless of what, I have to control the situation in my own palm. This way, even if I do not get the real item, there is no loss to me, and I can even snatch other hunters\u2019. Killing old man Wang and that girl caused Wang Da to spend a lot of time just to get my intel. Needless to say, those two young hunters must\u2019ve already been silenced.\" Fang Yuan confirmed in his heart.There was only a few people who knew the situation, and Wang Da would not attack Jiang He. Once Jiang He is dead, the clan would send people to investigate. But if those two hunters disappeared on the mountain, it was easy to manipulate. Jiang He would not reveal an incident like this as it would affect the clan\u2019s evaluation of him, and would even cover up the situation.(1) \u2018glow in his eyes radiated the surroundings\u2019 is a metaphor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Resolution of the Demonic way!Translator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowThe thoughts of Fang Yuan flew all over the place in the tree house.With the knowledge acquired from his previous life, Fang Yuan could sense Wang Da\u2019s existence, but how was his strength?Fang Yuan had never seen this Wang Da, but with the information at hand, there was much he could analyze from this.\"Courage is built upon the basis of strength, he had collected my information and still wants to exact revenge on me. With such a confidence, his cultivation has to be above Rank one!\"\"These three years he had been moving around the three red circled areas, living on the fringe of the three clan villages. Almost everyday he faced the risk of getting discovered and purged. This shows he does not have the strength to roam outside, and roaming outside requires Rank three cultivation.\"This means that, at first evaluation, he is a Rank two.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes glinted with cold light, \"Counting the time, he disappeared for three years and cultivated to Rank two now, so he should be a B or C grade talent, and his aperture should have about 40-70% primeval essence.\"\"These three years, he could survive and at the same time, live at home despite Jiang He\u2019s observation, so he has to have a stealth-type of Gu worm at work.Information was the most important thing to a Gu Master\u2019s showdown.Although Fang Yuan had no investigative-type Gu worm, with his experience and knowledge, he could forcefully reverse engineer Wang Da\u2019s cultivation level and Gu worms to a highly plausible degree.Very quickly, his mental image of a Rank two demonic faction Gu Master appeared, carrying the hatred of his family\u2019s murder and lurking somewhere to kill his revenge target.\"I can kill others, others can naturally come to kill me. This is nothing.\" Fang Yuan laughed lightly.In this world, anyone had the right to live, and anyone had the chance to die.Those who kill, are bound to get killed.Since he committed murder, he should be mentally prepared to get killed.If he was killed like that, then he would die like that, it was nothing much, and definitely no regrets. This was the path he chose.This point, Fang Yuan had great resolve already.This is the resolution of the demonic way!\"Wang Er wants to kill me, then in this mid-year exam, it is definitely the best chance. Normally, students would reside in the village, and with his Rank two cultivation, he cannot creep into the village, that is courting death.\"\"Maybe he evaluated that I might come out to hunt. But Qing Mao Mountain is so huge, he alone has to hide his traces and also have to search for me, it is too difficult. Now that there\u2019s this chance, he is most likely to strike.\"\"He is a Rank two Gu Master, and one that has struggled for three years, living a life of danger and unknown, a demonic faction Gu Master nurtured like this. With my current battle strength, I am definitely not his match. But this does not mean that I have no chance of survival.\"Escape!Fang Yuan instantly decided.Nothing is too shameless if it is to survive, so if he can\u2019t fight it, run.For a Gu Master to make a sudden breakthrough is almost never happening. Fighting against a higher realm is possible, but that is built on the base that the Gu Master has special Gu worms.Fang Yuan had a number of Gu worms in his possession, but the Spring Autumn Cicada was hibernating and unusable, while the Liquor worm, White Boar Gu, Little light Gu and Moonlight Gu were not trump cards to fight a higher realm.Obviously knowing the enemy was unbeatable, yet resolving to fight to the death, that is a stupid \"hot-blooded\" behaviour. Even if he wins, that would not win him the favor of fate.Fang Yuan is cautious his entire life even with trump cards, and if the chances of victory is slim, he would choose to avoid combat.He liked to be in control of the situation, using unscrupulous methods to raise his chances to the limit. He loved fighting assured battles.Only when he has no choice would he engage in a risky fight.Thus, his favourite activity was to bully the weak and snatch resources to get stronger. Strong enough until he surpasses his enemies and then stomp on them afterwards, bullying the weak.There is nothing shameless about this, those who find challenges just to prove their bravery and risk their lives to fight to the death with strong enemies, that is the real stupidity.But unfortunately, this \"quality\" has been praised and recommended, because any organization needed the individual to sacrifice themselves to protect the interests of the ones in power.One just needs to think slightly to know that survival is the prerequisite to all activities.In order to survive and fulfill the ambitions on their heart, this is a person\u2019s greatest courage.Dying for aspiration, those are fools. Surviving shamelessly for their ambitions, those are true brave warriors!On earth, Han Xin(1) endured the shame of crawling through someone\u2019s legs, Cao Cao(2) was chased till he shaved his beard and torn his robe, Yue Wang(3) in order to live, had to eat shit to express his loyalty\u2026...That\u2019s why, fuck off with honor and reputation, and face!Regardless of organization, they would applaud such a value system. The more that needed to be sacrificed, the more they would be promoted, like a military.\"Which direction should I go, the one that has the lowest chance of encountering Wang Da?\" A map appeared in Fang Yuan\u2019s mind.\"Wang Da already knows I have the beast skin map, now he should be hiding in the forest, searching for me by looking for the wild boar distribution on the map. I cannot go to these places, thus I can only move in reverse to find a chance to survive.\" Thinking of this, a slightly insane route surfaced in Fang Yuan\u2019s mind.Under the sunset in the mountain forest, tree shadows overlapped and wild grass grew abundantly.A pair of bloodshot eyes hid deep in the shadows. His eyes burnt with hatred and anger, as if it couldn\u2019t be doused even with a tsunami.\"Fang Yuan, I\u2019ve finally found you...\" Wang Da gritted his teeth, growling the words out from his mouth.Under his gaze, not far away, a youngster with a thin body and pale face was traversing the forest.With his enemy nearby, Wang Da did not act immediately, but turned his gaze to several other positions.From each of these positions, an invigilator Gu Master was hidden.To prevent cheating and for immediate treatment of injuries, the area nearby had around a few dozen Rank two Gu Masters hiding. There was even Rank three clan elders holding the fort on the mountains high up.Wang Da carefully moved around the forest and collected a lot of intel.\"I want to kill Fang Yuan, so I need to get rid of these three Gu Masters first. Otherwise, once I show myself, I will be disturbed. Maybe with surprise, I can kill Fang Yuan, but I will also get killed by the Gu Masters that chase after me from there.\"\"I have Rank two middle stage cultivation, and there\u2019s 50% primeval essence in my body. I have to act first and kill these three Gu Masters, it is difficult. I have to strike consecutively in a very short period. Otherwise, once they find their companions dead, they would become alert and my traces will be exposed\u2026...\"\"Shadow Follower Gu.\" Wang Da closed his eyes and called in his heart.Immediately, his body became enshrouded in a lump of darkness and could move among the tree shadows.All was silent.In a thick bush nearby, the Gu Yue clan\u2019s Rank two Gu Master sprawled inside, yawning out of boredom.\"So boring, accompanying these junior students, I feel like a nanny.\" This Gu Master complained softly, not feeling the shadow that was slowly creeping around him.A pair of bony hands stretched out from the shadows.This pair of hands was pale to the limit, the joints were huge and the ten nails were sharp and long, the nails dyed a shade of dark purple and emitted a slightly fishy smell.\"What smell is this?\" The Gu Yue clan Gu Master sniffed, frowning subconsciously.He just wanted to investigate, but it was too late.Wang Da pounced like a snake, striking at lightning speed!One hand covered the Gu Master\u2019s mouth and nose, while the other stabbed from the shadows towards his back. His dark purple nails were sharp as blades, his fingers easily entering the Gu Master\u2019s body and reaching his heart.The fingernails were poisonous, and at that moment it invaded the heart. Through the blood, it spread all over the Gu Master\u2019s body.The Gu Master\u2019s body stiffened and lost all signs of life.Although they were both Rank two Gu Masters, one had assaulted abruptly with preparation, so before the battle even begun, it had ended.\"I used 10% of my primeval essence, 40% left.\" Wang Da checked his aperture, and fused into the shadows once again.A moment later, the second Gu Master hiding behind a rock also met his assault. His eyes shrunk to pin size as he collapsed on the ground.The poison invaded his body, and soon he turned purple, and from his nose two streams of purple blood flowed out.\"30% left.\" Wang Da chanted silently, turning into shadows again.\"Who is it!\" The third Gu Master was hiding on a tree branch atop a huge tree. At the crucial moment he sensed something wrong, and at the time where Wang Da struck, he turned around and grabbed the two poisonous hands.\"Damn it!\" Wang Da laughed sinisterly, his ten nails growing crazily, at once becoming five centimeters long, stabbing the Gu Master\u2019s forearm and piercing his skin.His forearm bled and the blood quickly turned dark purple.\"This is the Love Life Separation?!\" The third Gu Master seeing this was shocked beyond doubt; the purple poison had already infected his face.He knew he had no poison resistance Gu worm and was surely dead, thus he showed resolve on his face, shouting, \"Then let\u2019s die together!\"He opened his mouth and stretched out his tongue.There was a crescent moon tattoo on his tongue \u2014 it was the Moonlight Gu.A moonblade shot out and slashed Wang Da\u2019s right shoulder, piercing through and coming out from his back.The blood splattered.Wang Da grunted, his body swaying a little, but the Gu Master had already passed away, with a trace of life left.\"Correct, this is Love Life Separation.\" Wang Da stood on the tree branch, slowly standing up, showing a bitter smile.Love Life Separation, the number one poison among the Rank two Gu worms! To refine it, one needs the Rank one life breath grass, widow spider, red needle scorpion and the heart of a lover.To refine this Gu worm, Wang Da killed his own wife who loved him deeply, and dug out her heart!\"It is all for survival, I could only choose strength... this is the resolution of my demonic path!\" Wang Da\u2019s eyes were red as he stared tightly at the nearby youngster.\"I gave up on love, and only had kinship left, but you took them from me! Fang Yuan...\" He growled lowly, \"I want you to regret deeply all that you did!\"(1) \u97e9\u4fe1 (Han Xin): Famous general of first emperor Han emperor Liu Bang.(2) \u66f9\u64cd (Cao Cao): Famous statesman and general at the end of Han, noted poet and calligrapher, later warlord, founder and first king of Cao Wei, father of Emperor Cao Pi, as well as the main villain of the novel the Romance of Three Kingdoms.(3) \u8d8a\u738b\u52fe\u8df5 (Yue Wang/King Gou Jian of Yue): sometimes considered one of the Five Hegemons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Kill!\" Wang Da growled, ferociously leaping into the air from the tree branch.As he was about to get near to his mortal enemy, three moonblades shot out from nowhere suddenly and intercepted him midway.\"Why is there a fourth Gu Master?\" Wang Da\u2019s heart sank, twisting his body forcefully in midair, narrowing avoiding two moonblades. The remaining one, which he could no longer evade, hit his left leg.Bang!Wang Da crashed onto the ground, lowering his head to look at his left leg. There was a wound, deep and long, blood already dripping all over.\"Damn\u2026...\" Wang Da gritted his teeth, his heart thinking, \"Shadow Follower Gu!\"Immediately, he turned into a lump of dark shadow as his speed rose drastically, moving backwards without a sound.At this moment.A Gu worm flew out from nowhere, at the same time an old and weary voice sounded out \u2014\"Flash Blink Gu, explode.\"The Gu worm exploded on command, turning into a blinding white light.The white light was unavoidable, abruptly appearing and turning the entire dark forest bright.\"Ah!\" Wang Da shrieked. His body which had turned into shadows could not hide anywhere under the bright light, and went back to his human form.Although the Flash Blink Gu was only Rank one and also a consumable type, it was the complete counter of Wang Da\u2019s Shadow Follower Gu. Once the darkness was dispelled by the light, the Rank two Shadow Follower Gu needed to rest three hours before it could be used again.In nature, all beings are equal, one counters another. Although the Shadow Follower Gu had very strong lurking abilities, it also had a great weakness.After he was countered, Wang Da\u2019s heart sank to the bottom of the valley.This fourth Gu Master was more experienced, not only did he know which Gu to use, he also hid himself well, a true foe. More importantly, Wang Da could no longer use the Shadow Follower Gu, thus having no way to retreat.\"I am Gu Yue Sou, lad, if you surrender now, my clan might still spare your life!\" A white haired, silver beard Rank two Gu Master appeared in front of Wang Da\u2019s vision.\"Spare me, hmph, I\u2019ll kill you first!\" Wang Da knew that if it was dragged, there would be more Gu Masters appearing to deal with him, he had to kill this fourth Gu Master as soon as possible.\"My primeval essence only has 20% left, be it revenge or preserving my life, I have to kill this meddlesome old fellow first!\" Wang Da picked up his spirits and jumped towards Gu Yue Sou.Gu Yue Sou snorted. His entire body, be it hair or pore hair, grew insanely and intertwined, in the blink of an eye forming a snow white battle armor with a spiky design.Seeing this change, Wang Da\u2019s expression changed. The experienced Gu Master was like a porcupine, causing Wang Da to not know how to strike.His Rank two strong poison Gu Love Life Separation, although the poison was extremely strong and deadly, it did not have strong attacking abilities, only usable as a sneak attack.Wang Da only had Love Life Separation and Shadow Follower Gu. If he had a defensive Gu worm, he would not have gotten hit by the moonblade.\"Hmph, if I cannot deal with you, I\u2019ll kill Fang Yuan first!\" Wang Da was not stupid. The three years of living had made him cunning and ruthless.He moved quickly, getting around Gu Yue Sou and attacking the culprit of his family\u2019s murder.\"Dream on!\" Gu Yue Sou activated his primeval essence, and his body of spikes immediately shot out two sharp pins, spiralling and flying five to six metres towards Wang Da.Wang Da\u2019s body shifted, narrowly avoiding the two snow white spikes.On his hands, his ten nails were half a palm long, purple and dark, the fog state poison circulating them.\"Die!\" Wang Da was already mad from battle, laughing maniacally as he rushed towards his target.In his eyes, Fang Yuan\u2019s face was full of shock and panic.Killing intent had overtaken Wang Da\u2019s brain, he could almost hear himself piercing Fang Yuan\u2019s skin, and his indignant last breath.\"You wish!\"Seeing that he was about to succeed, another person appeared, blocking Wang Da\u2019s way.The fifth Gu Master rushed over from nearby!\"It\u2019s actually the Love Life Separation?\" This middle-aged man was unmoved by Wang Da\u2019s crazy and ferocious demeanour.Rock Skin Gu!The middle-aged man activated his primeval essence, red steel primeval essence gushing out like smoke, his naked arms immediately turned from yellow to grey-white colour. At the same time both his arms expanded like balloons, forming a large and thick rock arm.As both parties got closer, Wang Da\u2019s expression became more twisted and insane. The middle-aged Gu Master had a solemn expression as he stretched out both arms to grab Wang Da.\"Trying to get me with this speed?\" Wang Da showed a mocking expression.The middle-aged man\u2019s limbs were covered by a thick rock skin, even Wang Da\u2019s nails could not penetrate. But the arms were really too heavy and slow. Fang Da felt that he could easily evade them.\"Really? Jade Wind Wheel!\" The middle-aged Gu Master shouted, and suddenly a pair of jade-coloured cyclones circulated around his rock arm like armbands.The rock arm\u2019s speed immediately rose!\"How can that be... urgh!\" Wang Da\u2019s face was shocked as he was swept by the rock arm and flew away.The middle-aged Gu Master was experienced in battle. If he had used the bee Gu Jade Wind Wheel from the start, Wang Da might not have fallen so easily.Wang Da was sent flying by the rock arm, falling on the ground in a mess. The chest that was hit felt pain.Puke.He barely got up, but could not help but vomit blood.\"5% primeval essence left, I\u2019m gonna die.\" He checked his aperture, laughing bitterly. Seeing Fang Yuan near him, he showed insane resolve on his face, \"Even if I die, you will join me!\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!He ignored his injuries and rushed out.\"Block him!\" The middle-aged Gu Master was a pure close-ranged fighter with no long range Gu, at once he could do nothing.The old Gu Master had already arrived, his body\u2019s white hair turning into finger-sized spirals as they flew like nimble snakes, extending five to six metres and reached from behind, piercing Wang Da\u2019s body.But Wang Da did not care, rushing out regardless.\"Die!!!\" He screamed loudly, his ten fingernails already fifty centimetres long.The middle-aged Gu Master chased after, and upon seeing this scene, his expression changed as he could no longer stop it.Seeing that Wang Da was about to get his way, a bright blue jade light burst from the other side.\"Jade Skin Gu!\" Under the pressure of life and death, Fang Zheng screamed out loudly.Immediately, his skin was covered by a sturdy layer of jade skin.Wang Da\u2019s fingers were like knife blades, stabbing at him. Although the Love Life Separation did not have strong attacking ability, the Jade Skin Gu was only a Rank one Gu worm and could not block his nails.Howl!The elderly Gu Master seeing Fang Zheng about to die, shouted frantically and his eyes expanded. Even more snow white needles shot out and pierced Wang Da\u2019s body.After that, the needles worked like snakes, first piercing his back to his chest, the circulating around his neck, his arms and his legs.Boiling blood poured from Wang Da\u2019s body, immediately dying the white hair red.His entire body was covered by white hair, just like the wild boar who had fallen into a trap of green bamboo spikes, stopping his charge and being unable to move.An intense feeling of dizziness hit him. Wang Da laughed pathetically, he knew that death was impending.How unsatisfying!His vision was dyed blur, and on his death moment, the most vivid memory in his life surfaced again.\"Wan Er....\" He subconsciously called out his wife\u2019s name, as the knife on his hand pierced her body.\"Why?\" His wife looked at Wang Da, her beautiful face showing confusion and shock, tightly staring at Wang Da\u2019s eyes.Wang Da\u2019s eyes were red, as his body shivered, forcing out a word from his mouth, \"Sorry.\"His wife smiled slightly, her smile full of love. There was not a single drop of hate.\"I understand,\" She said.She wanted to stretch out her right hand, touching Wang Da\u2019s face for the last time before she died.But in the middle, her hand dropped.Killing his wife for her heart, and refining Love Life Separation. From then on he had strength and went on the demonic path!Do you have regrets?From that day on, he constantly asked himself this.I regret it!He regretted so much that he would rather die, thus he swore that he had to protect the remaining family members of his!But.But\u2026...\"If I could start from the beginning again, Wan Er, I would still do the same....\" Emotional tears poured from Wang Da\u2019s red eyes.Fang Zheng stared at him, his body glowing with jade light.From start to end, he was in deep confusion and suspicion.An unfamiliar Gu Master rushed madly towards himself, and wanted to tear him to bits. But Fang Zheng did not know him.Under the thick death aura, Fang Zheng could not move an inch. His mind was blank as he only subconsciously activated the Jade Skin Gu.Wang Da\u2019s nails pierced the jade skin and stabbed one centimetre in, but did not move anymore.He died.He was full of tears when he died.\"Its\u2026 over?\" Fang Zheng breathed roughly, his eyes losing focus and seemed rather hollow.Then, a strong sense of dizziness overcame him.Plop.He also fell on the ground.Love Life Separation, the strongest Rank two poison. Although it did not pierce through all the jade skin, the poison already invaded his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA wild boar almost as huge as an elephant was lying in the mudpit.It closed its eyes shut, half kneeling and half lying, a pair of tusks clean from soil, shining like sharp blades.The twilight reflected on its dark black fur, its huge stomach was white and with each breath, moved up and down creating a snorting sound.Wild boar king!Fang Yuan was several hundred meters away from it, but still carefully walked along with the direction of the wind.\"Even though I can kill wild boars now, against this wild boar king, I can only run away. Even an average Rank two Gu Master cannot kill it. If he is not clear of the Gu worms on its body, he might even fall prey to it.King of the beasts normally have Gu worms inhabiting their bodies.On the wild boar king\u2019s body, there would normally be Boar Gu, such as Pink Boar Gu or Flower Boar Gu. Other than the boar species, there might also be Beast Skin Gu or Spike Fur worm.In this world, there are all sorts of Gu worms. Normally, Gu worms reside in the bodies of strong wild beasts, and live alongside the wild beasts.When the wild beast gets attacked, the Gu worms will sense the danger and assist the wild beast in resisting the strong foe.This wild boar king\u2019s body was huge, and its strength greatly exceeded the average wild boar. Fang Yuan was no match against it alone, not to mention there was at least one or more mysterious Gu worms in its body.However, Fang Yuan\u2019s adventure this time, was not to kill the wild boar king. It was to avoid Wang Da\u2019s pursue.Wang Da knew that Fang Yuan had the beast skin map, and Fang Yuan used that knowledge to his advantage. Going nowhere but instead heading towards the wild boar king\u2019s danger marking area.The wild boar king although dangerous, was still a beast after all, and had no human intelligence. Old man Wang as a mortal, could venture to this place and retreat safely, so why couldn\u2019t Fang Yuan do the same?Going on a reverse path, although seemingly dangerous, hid a way to survive instead.As he moved even further, the wild boar king was slowly left behind by Fang Yuan. On the map, it would seem like Fang Yuan took a big circle and went around the red cross, forming a concave curve. Finally, he reached the hill where several clan elders were staying and having the mid-year assessment there on the spot.An hour later, a youngster full of grass bits, his shirt torn in several areas and his feet full of mud, carried a bag and ran up the hill.This pathetic looking youngster, was Fang Yuan.\"I\u2019m finally safely back here. At this place, there are clan elders to protect me and my safety is assured. But I cannot afford to be careless.\" Fang Yuan sighed in relief, and slowly ascended the hill.The hill had a simple tentage and tens of students were nearby as the academy\u2019s guards were collating the wild boar tusks in their bags. The few clan elders that were stationed here were missing, and only one was left.\"Why is the atmosphere so weird?\" Fang Yuan frowned slightly, acutely feeling something important had occurred.When he got near the tentage, he heard the students\u2019 discussions.\"Did you hear, there was an assassination earlier, and several Rank two Gu Masters died.\"\"Are you serious?\"\"It\u2019s true,\u00a0I came here early, and I saw Gu Yue Fang Zheng carried away by several clan elders, hurrying away.\"\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng is too unlucky, to encounter something like this during the exam.\"\"Hehe, you don\u2019t know huh. The target was Fang Zheng, because he is A grade talent!\"\"I wonder if he\u2019ll die?\"\"Even if he doesn\u2019t die, he\u2019s gonna be affected. Maybe his talent might drop after that injury.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s footsteps halted. He was clear in his heart, conjuring the truth of the matter.\"Wang Da wanted to deal with me and avenge his kin. But after I found the treehouse, I changed my route and went towards the wild boar king. Wang Da did not expect this and found Fang Zheng by accident instead. His source of information came from those hunters and he did not know that I have a twin brother. He mistook Fang Zheng as me and wanted to kill me, but was stopped by the surrounding Gu Masters who were protecting the area. Right now the question is \u2014 Did Wang Da die?\"Fang Yuan frowned tightly. Wang Da successfully escaping, Wang Da captured, Wang Da killed \u2014 these three possibilities would greatly affect his future plans and actions.Thinking for a while, Fang Yuan decided to follow his original plan.The academy elder\u2019s expression was ugly, Fang Zheng was actually assassinated. Without any clues or evidence, he would not be able to guess that Fang Zheng had become Fang Yuan\u2019s scapegoat, but thought of the Bai clan and Xiong clan!Fang Zheng was the only A grade talent that the Gu Yue clan had for the last three years, the Bai clan and Xiong clan would naturally not let him grow. Sending an assassin Gu Master to kill him and prevent him from getting stronger, this was normal.Even the Gu Yue clan would do something like this. Secretly sending Gu Masters and targeting the other two clan\u2019s genius students.\"The assassin was killed on the spot, but I wonder how is Fang Zheng\u2019s injuries?\" Academy elder thought, and at this moment, his attendant brought him a piece of paper.Academy elder received the paper, reading without paying proper attention, \"In this year\u2019s examination, the results are as follows... Gu Yue Chi Cheng sixteen tusks, Gu Yue Mo Bei fourteen tusks...\"The surrounding students\u2019 attention were obtained. The results were clear.D grade students, even if they worked together, they could only obtain three to four tusks. B and C grades, at most eight to nine. Those with more than ten tusks were the good performers.The best was Gu Yue Chi Cheng with sixteen tusks. Next was Mo Bei, and as for Fang Zheng he had ten.Gu Yue Chi Cheng showed a smug expression. He was lucky this time and encountered two wild boars fighting each other, thus he got the easy reward. Gu Yue Mo Bei was indignant, allowing Chi Cheng to surpass him.The academy elder announced, \"As such, I announce the number one student for this examination is...\"\"Halt!\" Fang Yuan stepped out at this moment.\"Fang Yuan, you are late. The examination ended an hour ago, according to the rules, the wild boar tusks that you obtain will be deducted by four as punishment.\" Chi Cheng immediately shouted.Fang Yuan ignored him and opened the bag on his back, grabbing the bottom of the bag and pouring out the contents.Crash.Dozens of wild boar tusks gathered into a pile by his feet.\"This!\" Chi Cheng stared with his mouth agape.Mo Bei and the others stared their eyeballs out at the pile.\"How can there be so many? This is too much!\" The academy elder looked at Fang Yuan in disbelief, \"Fang Yuan, did you hunt all these?\"Fang Yuan cupped his fists, \"I only hunted a dozen tusks myself, but I found a bag that could\u2019ve been hidden by hunters. Inside it were many wild boar tusks. I thought about it, the exam was that we had to obtain as many tusks as possible within a day, and did not specify that we have to kill it ourselves, thus I brought it here.\"Once he finished, the crowd burst into discussions.\"How can this be?\"\"Way too lucky!\"\"This is too fake, could the questions have leaked thus he cheated?\"The academy elder stared at Fang Yuan, looking for a while, then declared, \"This exam, Fang Yuan is the first.\"...The family head room\u2019s atmosphere was heavy.Gu Yue Bo sat at the leading seat, and the other dozen elders sat in two rows beside him, their faces full of rage.\"Gu Yue Yao Ji, you are the number one healer in our clan, I\u2019m asking you how is Fang Zheng now?\" Gu Yue Bo asked a clan elder.Gu Yue Yao Ji was an old woman with a hunched back, her face full of treebark-like wrinkles.She coughed twice, slowly saying, \"Reporting to clan head, the situation has stabilized. Fang Yuan\u2019s life is in no danger, but he is still sleeping. His talent did not drop because of this.\"\"Good if the talent didn\u2019t drop.\" Gu Yue Bo breathed a sigh of relief, the asked the punishment hall\u2019s elder, \"Has the assassin\u2019s situation been assessed?\"The punishment hall elder was not as senior as Gu Yue Yao Ji, and immediately stood up, lowering his head, \"Yes, thirty-five years old, male, identity unknown, possibly a demonic faction Gu Master. He has two Gu worms, Shadow Follower Gu and Love Life Separation.\"Gu Yue Bo nodded, \"Seems like an assassin, Love Life Separation\u2026 the Rank two number one poison, no wonder he could kill three of my Gu Masters.\"\"Clan head, we have to investigate further! It\u2019s either the Bai clan or the Xiong clan!\" Gu Yue Chi Lian shouted, his eyes almost bursting into flames.\"Shadow Follower Gu, Love Life Separation... this is not like the Bai or Xiong clan\u2019s pawn pieces. He might be an outside demonic faction Gu Master, wanting to get affiliated with the clans, thus being instructed to assassinate Fang Zheng to prove his loyalty. Regardless, this matter definitely has to do with the two clans,\" Gu Yue Mo Chen coldly said.These two clan elders in power, although they did not get along, once an external enemy appears, they would discard their hatred and knit tightly together.Gu Yue Bo nodded, thinking the same himself.Wang Da had disappeared for three years, with no traces to be found. The villagers all thought of him to be dead, thus his identity became a mystery. The Gu Yue higher-ups did not know this, they would not be concerned with a servant\u2019s death. They placed all their attentions on the Xiong and Bai clans.At this moment, the academy elder walked in.\"Clan leader...\" He looked worried and was about to speak when Gu Yue Bo answered, \"Academy elder, Fang Zheng is fine, his talent is still A grade.\"The academy elder\u2019s face became relaxed.\"Oh yes, are the other students safe? And for this examination, how are their results, which place is Fang Zheng?\" Gu Yue Bo asked conveniently.The academy elder answered truthfully, and when he said that Fang Yuan had accidentally picked up a bag of wild boar tusks and got first place, Gu Yue Bo\u2019s eyes shone.The hall too went silent. The clan elders, as if they sensed it, subtly observed the atmosphere, and the originally nervous environment became slightly more peculiar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the discussion room, Gu Yue Bo expressionlessly sat in the leader\u2019s seat with deep meaningful eyes.The remaining dozen or so clan elders all sat upright, looking down, only using the corner of their eye to sweep the surroundings and discern some clues from their expressions.The atmosphere became delicate.\"Fang Yuan getting first place, the deeper meaning behind this is definitely not simple. He actually said he found a bag of hidden wild boar tusks, this is too unbelievable.\"\"This bag might\u2019ve been prepared by someone, it is not possible for Fang Yuan to do it himself. That means someone is helping Fang Yuan in the dark.\"\"This year\u2019s mid-year exam is unlike the previous ones. We had to deploy tens of Rank two Gu Masters to invigilate the exam. Thus the contents of this examination, not only does the academy elder know, but many of the elders in the clan as well.\"\"If anyone wanted to prepare this bag in advance, it can only be the clan elders present here now, or even the clan leader!\"The clan elders were all shrewd foxes. After being in the political field for years, they immediately thought of many things.Fang Zheng was an A grade talent, if he really reached Rank four, what did that mean?That would mean he is the next clan leader!Fang Yuan is Fang Zheng\u2019s brother. Even if he is only C grade, with that blood relationship, he is worth investing in!To the clan leader Gu Yue Bo, if he helped Fang Yuan secretly, that would be bringing him into his faction, and to Fang Zheng, it was a good belt to tie him to the leader faction together.To the clan elders, Fang Zheng who is the only A grade talent in years, has already been absorbed into the clan leader\u2019s faction. If he was really nurtured, the clan leader\u2019s faction would be even stronger. However, if the clan elders made Fang Yuan into their own, using this layer of blood relation, it would be a good chess piece when dealing in Fang Zheng in the future.Thus, the ten over people in this hall, they all had the motive to help Fang Yuan.But who?Gu Yue Chi Lian thought deeply, \"I did not recruit Fang Yuan, so who would help him secretly? Is it Mo Chen that old man, hmm, possible. Although Fang Yuan killed his family servant, but that\u2019s just a servant, even if they all died it wouldn\u2019t hurt him. The clan leader is more possible though, he took in Fang Zheng, so if he recruited Fang Yuan as well, that would increase his control over Fang Zheng! But\u2026 in previous years, the norm is to recruit them during the year end exam. Taking his action now during the mid-year, it is breaking the rules.\"\"Not exactly breaking the rules, but it really is throwing a curveball. Just exactly who thinks highly of Fang Yuan, even more than me?\" Gu Yue Mo Chen was also thinking.The truth is, after Fang Yuan killed Gao Wan and sent the minced corpse, he changed his impression of Fang Yuan and had the thoughts of recruiting him.But such actions only happened during the year end, after the students graduated from the academy.Fang Yuan being recruited in advance, it struck Mo Chen by surprise.Gu Yue Bo\u2019s gaze was focused on Gu Yue Mo Chen and Gu Yue Chi Lian, the two elders in power.This clan leader had greater insight.Fang Yuan blatantly said a lie and got the first place. This action had the meaning of being fearless, thus sending a signal to everyone to show them that \u2014 I\u2019m protecting Fang Yuan! He is now my member, and you all better not touch him.Then who is this person?The political field in the Gu Yue clan was split into three. Other than the clan leader faction, it was Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s Chi family, and Gu Yue Mo Chen\u2019s Mo family.Gu Yue Bo knew that he himself did not take any actions to recruit Fang Yuan. Thus, the greatest suspect was Chi Lian and Mo Chen.\"These two old fellows, their acting is improving. Seeing their expressions, I really cannot tell. Don\u2019t tell me it really isn\u2019t them, but some other small faction?\"Gu Yue Bo observed carefully as he investigated. He did not know that all the elders were like him, observing, suspecting and deducing.The academy elder was also guessing, but he had always been in a neutral position, outside of politics, thus his thoughts were simpler, \"So Fang Yuan has been recruited by a clan elder. No wonder he let go of Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng while extorting, that means the one who recruited him was either the clan leader, Chi Lian or Mo Chen. This is good news! It shows that he has accepted reality and has starting integrating into the clan. No matter what, he is now a member of the clan, so once he fully integrates, he will contribute his entire life to the clan!\"After a short silence, Gu Yue Bo could not see any more clues, thus he spoke, \"An eye for an eye, since the other party has started targeting Fang Zheng, our Gu Yue clan is not to be trifled with, we will show them! Dark Hall Elder, formulate a plan for this matter and report to me afterwards.\"\"Yes, sir clan leader.\" Dark hall elder immediately nodded.\"As for Gu Yue Fang Zheng, I\u2019m afraid his heart might be damaged from such an encounter. He is an A grade talent, and to our clan, the status is monumental. From now on, I will teach him personally.\" Gu Yue Bo said.No clan elders objected.Many people knew that the clan leader had already given much benefits to Gu Yue Fang Zheng in the dark. Now that he mentioned this, even though it violated the fairness rule, with sufficient reasoning, the clan elders could not stop him.\"As for Gu Yue Fang Yuan...\" Gu Yue Bo dragged his words.At once, all the clan elders paid their fullest attention. Was the clan leader hinting that he was the one helping Fang Yuan secretly?Gu Yue Bo looked at everyone\u2019s expression as his gaze swept through, but he was destined to be disappointed.Thus, he could only continue, \"With his C grade talent, he managed to get first place. It is not easy. Thus, in my personal name, I reward him thirty primeval stones. Academy elder, pass my word and tell him to continue working hard.\"\"Yes, clan leader.\" The academy elder bowed as he received his orders.\"Thirty primeval stones, such an ordinary reward, what does this mean?\" The clan elders frowned.\"No matter who absorbed Fang Yuan, this thirty primeval stones is my expression of goodwill. After all, there is still the Bai and Xiong clan other than Gu Yue.\" Gu Yue Bo sighed in his heart.Fang Zheng was assassinated by external foes. Fang Yuan\u2019s cheating was internal conflict.Against external foes, one had to use hard handed methods to retaliate, but for internal conflict, Gu Yue Bo chose to use the soft approach, in order to avoid too much internal conflict and result in the entire clan\u2019s strength being weakened.\"Alright, this matter will be settled like this. Everyone may leave and do all your work well, the clan\u2019s prosperity has everything to do with your performances.\" Gu Yue Bo waved his hand.\"Yes clan leader, we will take our leave.\"The clan elders left one by one, and after a few breath\u2019s time, only Gu Yue Bo was left in the room.He sighed deeply, using his fingers to rub his two temples.As the clan leader, even if he was the person with the most authority in the Gu Yue clan, it did not mean that he had it easy. He needed to coordinate the interests of the different factions, and could not do as he wished. The clan\u2019s forces were dispersed and intertwined through many generations of inheritance, and they all had long history, restricting one another.Against outside forces, he had to deal with the arrogant and rude Xiong clan village and the gradually rising Bai clan village.Internally, he had to resolve the complicated political conflict in the clan. Although he was middle-aged, he already had white hair all over.\"These years of being the clan leader, although I had sufficient resources, my cultivation has barely advanced. My heart is tired from all these tiresome clan affairs. Sometimes, I really want to be a lone cultivator, free and easy with no burden. That would allow me to move faster and I might travel even further in my cultivation path.\"Gu Yue Bo sighed in his heart.As long as one is in the clan system, they had responsibilities on them. Once they had responsibilities it would not be easy to wholeheartedly cultivate.But on the reverse, if one is not in the system, the clan\u2019s resources would not be available to them, and without resources, their cultivation would come to a halt.This formed a contradiction, a weird loop.Because of this loop, many people's futures were ruined, burying an insurmountable number of talents and geniuses.Wang Da is dead.Three days later, Fang Yuan got the news.At the same time, he also heard from Jiang He that the two young hunters vanished when hunting in the mountains. As for the hunter whose right hand was broken by Fang Yuan, he \"committed suicide\" in his home out of depression.Jiang He looked at Fang Yuan meaningfully when he said the news. He had seen Wang Da\u2019s corpse, thus recognising him.But he did not dare to say Wang Da\u2019s true identity.He was the stationed Gu Master, and held responsibility. As long as one is in the system, regardless of position, they had responsibility.Wang Da became a demonic faction cultivator for three years, and Jiang He as the village Gu Master did not investigate. If they really pursued responsibility, this would become the biggest flaw in his records, and his future in the clan would be ruined.The three hunter\u2019s peculiar deaths were covered up by him.\"Fang Yuan, since we\u2019re acquaintances, from now on you get a 50% discount when you purchase things from my cousin brother Jiang Ya\u2019s shop!\" During one time, Jiang He said this to Fang Yuan.Everyone else was dead, only Fang Yuan and him knew of this matter. But if the matter was revealed, it did not have a huge impact on Fang Yuan.He only killed three village servants, and even if he killed thirty, the clan would not pursue it, at most he would pay \"tens of primeval stones\" as a punishment.Jiang He\u2019s bribery, Fang Yuan took it with ease. To him, this matter was full of surprise and danger, but the result was good.After this matter, Fang Yuan who had no foundation within the clan, received half an ally and also a non-existent faction supporting him.This mysterious backer became Fang Yuan\u2019s second safety net. When he started showing his strength gradually, this safety net would have a crucial impact, at least able to allow him to cultivate until Rank two without much opposition.At this point, he could feel clearly the academy elder\u2019s changing attitude towards him, into a more amicable one.Over ten days passed in a flash.After Gu Yue Fang Zheng and Mo Bei advanced, Fang Yuan and Chi Cheng almost simultaneously advanced to Rank one upper stage successfully.Although extortion continued, he no longer took Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng\u2019s primeval stones, and he started becoming more low key, while his strength grew rapidly at a speed multiple times of his previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTime was like a white steed that flitted past a crack, and summer left with the arrival of autumn.In the walled-in path, Fang Yuan stood once more before the giant boulder blocking the way.Due to the weather growing colder, he wore plain and simple garment with long sleeves. But his body figure was no longer the thin sort like how it was a few months ago.His chest, two arms and legs, and abdomen all showed obvious muscle.These muscles were not as protruding as a stone, but it showed as a type of streamline, matching up with Fang Yuan\u2019s slowly growing body. Matched as well with his white skin, this gave others a type of youthful, full of vitality feeling.\"Starting from three days ago, the White Boar Gu stopped supplying me any increase in strength. That means, I already have one boar\u2019s strength, thus reaching the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s requirement. Today, I shall try pushing this round rock again!\"Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone as he took a step forward with his right leg, his left leg at the back, forming a bow step.His arms touched the surface of the round rock as he took a deep breath in and pushed with all his strength.The large boulder moved under the pressure of both his arms, moving slowly, gradually gaining momentum and rolling forward.The road before the boulder blocking the path was an inclined slope. Being turned into a round rock by the Flower Wine Monk, it was most suitable for rolling. This must have been his intention, to allow the inheritor to push the boulder upwards and move it away.\"Ten steps, twenty steps, thirty steps...\" Fang Yuan slowly progressed, counting in his heart, \"Last week, I pushed it to forty-five steps and that was the limit of my stamina, forcing me to quit. This time, I wonder how far I can push it?\"Forty steps, forty-five steps\u2026...A while later, Fang Yuan broke his original record, but that was enough for him to feel unbearably tired.Forty-six steps, forty-seven steps\u2026...Fang Yuan could feel strongly, at this point his stamina was almost all gone.Forty-eight, forty-nine steps....He mustered all his strength and moved another two steps. Finally, he was at his limit, sweating profusely. Using his shoulder and leg to anchor the rock in place, he took a few deep breaths.\"Should I give up?\" Fang Yuan could not help but have such thoughts. This inclined slope, when returning he has to expend quite a bit of stamina as well. After all, the rock has to roll down and he had to slowly release it in the process.If he let go and ran, the rock would roll faster and faster. Fang Yuan did not want to get turned into a pile of flesh after being unable to avoid it.But thinking for a while, Fang Yuan felt indignant. Let\u2019s push it a few more steps.Fiftieth step.He suddenly felt that the pressure from the huge rock had lightened. It had actually rolled into a straight platform.Fang Yuan pushed for a few more steps. After routing past the huge rock he found himself in a secret room.This secret room was like the rock crack\u2019s secret cave. He temporarily named it the second secret room.There was nothing in the room. The four walls were a strange red soil, glowing red. On the other end of the secret room, there was a simple grey-coloured rock door. It should be the hurried product of the Flower Wine Monk.Fang Yuan rested for a while but did not immediately open the rock door, as he had a new discovery.He found that the ground before the rock door was slightly damp.\"Don\u2019t tell me...\" Fang Yuan had a thought. He bent down, stretching out both arms and loosening the soil.The second Earth Treasury flower!Fang Yuan laughed heartily, carefully peeling the flower petals and retrieving the Gu worm slumbering in the golden nectar.Once he deployed his primeval essence, it was instantly refined.This was a Jade Skin Gu. Its appearance was like the bedbug, flat and wide with a small head and its green body was oval in space, emitting a faint jade coloured glow.\"I obtained the White Boar Gu, and was still thinking where could I get a Jade Skin Gu so I could refine it into the White Jade Gu. To think that the Flower Wine Monk already prepared it for me,\" Fang Yuan contemplated, thinking about the significance of this Jade Skin Gu.This is Fang Yuan\u2019s sixth Gu worm.Although he had five already, none were defensive. Now that he had the Jade Skin Gu, he could cover up his weakness in defense.At times, defense means offense.This was not hard to understand. Taking for example Fang Yuan\u2019s body. Using the White Boar Gu, his strength grew to one boar\u2019s strength. Theoretically, with this strength, he could smash a rock in one punch, but Fang Yuan never did such a thing.Because he knew his defense was not sufficient, so with one punch, the rock would break, but his fists would also turn bloody from the damage.Now that he had the Jade Skin Gu, he could supplement the advantage he had in strength.Obviously, there were advantages and disadvantages.The Jade Skin Gu had a high value, being one of the best defensive Rank one Gu. It was not easy to feed, consuming two pieces of jade rock every ten days.Jade rock\u2019s market price was expensive, and the source was often the problem.Fang Zheng also has a Jade Skin Gu, but he has the clan leader\u2019s backing, providing him with jade rocks. If Fang Yuan wanted jade rocks, he would have to buy them, and that could easily expose him.\"Originally in feeding the White Boar Gu, I had to regularly kill wild boars, and that is already troublesome. With the addition of this Jade Skin Gu, do I have to go dig in mines?\" Fang Yuan laughed bitterly, seeing a new problem in front of him.Keeping the Jade Skin Gu, temporarily nurturing it in his aperture, Fang Yuan gradually opened the rock door.The rock door was heavy, and if Fang Yuan did not have the White Boar Gu\u2019s boost in strength, he would not be able to move it. But now, with Fang Yuan pushing it, the door slowly opened.The scene that was revealed to Fang Yuan caused his field of vision to expand all of a sudden.It was no longer a narrow tunnel or a secret room, but a large spacious plot of underground stone forest.Fang Yuan estimated at initial approximation, the stone forest\u2019s size was over thirty Mu(1)! On earth, a standard football field was only eleven Mu.\"I should be inside Qing Mao mountain now, this underground space should be naturally formed.\" Fang Yuan looked up at the stone walls.The stone walls in this space were over sixteen meters tall, and the ceiling was also made of stone.From the top, there were large dark red pillars erected. Each emitted a faint red glow, and so did the walls, just like the tunnel and secret room. The light although dim, allowed Fang Yuan to see some things at least.Fang Yuan looked far, and each stone pillar was like an upside down tree, except without branches, and only leaving the stem.The stone pillar\u2019s surface was not smooth, and was full of dark eerie holes. Numerous pillars drooped down, forming an inverted stone forest within the mountain.Nature had its way with things.Fang Yuan with his immense knowledge, was not shocked, but stared at the dark holes in the pillars, frowning more intensely.He had suddenly understood the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s intention in placing the Jade Skin Gu.\"If I am not wrong...\" Fang Yuan turned his right hand, and out came a moonblade.The eerie blue moonblade flew through the sky in an arc, precisely hitting a dark hole in the stone pillar.A shrill and angry sound came from the dark hole.With a \u2018swoosh\u2019, a grey monkey flew out from the cave and leapt towards Fang Yuan.Pow pow pow.Fang Yuan shot three moonblades.The monkey was in midair and could not adjust its position, but its tail was extremely agile, sweeping several times and causing its body to flip in midair. After avoiding two moonblades, it was finally hit by the third, plopping on the floor dead.It was dead, without a drop of blood.Only its grey body turned to stone, and in a second, its flesh and blood body became a stone monkey statue.The statue\u2019s posture and facial expression was just like the monkey right before it died, imitated to perfection. After two breath\u2019s time, the stone monkey\u2019s surface cracked, and cracks developed all over its body. Finally with a boom, its entire figure blew up into tiny rock fragments.\"It really is an underground colony of jade eye stone monkeys.\" Fang Yuan knelt down, sweeping the fragments aside and taking out two jade green yellow pearls. These two pearls were the jade eye stone monkey\u2019s eyes.This strange animal would turn into grey rock fragments once dead, and only its eyes would turn into two jade green spherical pearls. Each were very heavy, reaching at least fifty grams.This meant that as long as he killed jade eye stone monkeys, the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s food problem would be resolved.\"I not only have to feed the Jade Skin Gu, I also have to continue the inheritance. Flower Wine Monk\u2019s next clue should be hidden in this stone forest.Fang Yuan frowned. Things had become complicated.He tried taking a few steps forward, his eyes peeled to the stone pillar.On his seventh step, on the pillar closest to him, numerous jade-coloured glowing eyes could be seen peeking out of the stone holes.At once, a drop of sweat fell from Fang Yuan\u2019s forehead.He quickly took a step back, and the numerous eyeballs in the dark holes faded.Evidently, each pair of eyeballs meant a jade eye stone monkey. The jade eye stone monkey was terribly agile, and to kill one Fang Yuan had to use four moonblades.On a stone pillar, there were at least a hundred jade eye stone monkeys, and in the entire forest, who knew how many were there in total.With Fang Yuan\u2019s current strength, he would die from being attacked by four monkeys. If he included the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense, Fang Yuan could deal with twelve monkeys at once at most.Thankfully, these monkeys usually slept in their dark holes and ate rocks when they were hungry or thirsty. The stone pillar was their home and food. Unless he got within ten meters of them or provoked them purposely, they would not come out.Using earth\u2019s words, they were a bunch of neet/hikikomori monkeys.(1) Mu (\u4ea9) - 1 Mu is 666 \u2154 meters\u00b2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe autumn wind rustled through the air, while the red leaves drifted aimlessly.The wild grass was dried yellow, and brilliant red or orange yellow wild fruit hung from the tree branches.\"Hurrumph!\" A black coloured wild boar rushed madly with its four hooves on the ground, its mane pricking up.There was a thick layer of fallen leaves that accumulated on the surface of the mountain.As the wild boar rushed forward, a gust of wind was wedged between it, and the fallen leaves were sent dancing behind its body.Fang Yuan silently stood there, showing a cold calculating expression as the wild boar got closer.Kill!He took a huge stride forward, and then both his legs stood firm, not dodging at all, facing the wild boar head on.The wild boar\u2019s two snow white tusks tore through the air with overwhelming killing intent.Fang Yuan turned his body to avoid the tusks, his shoulder knocking onto the wild boar\u2019s skull.When they were about to collide, Fang Yuan\u2019s shoulder shone with a faint green coloured light.Jade Skin Gu!Boom.With a loud crash, the two collided.Fang Yuan took three steps back, while the wild boar took one step back.To be fair, when comparing both side\u2019s strength, Fang Yuan was stronger. But Fang Yuan ran with both legs while the wild boar used four to sustain its force, and at the same time the center of gravity of the wild boar was lower and more stable than Fang Yuan.However, after being harshly hit on the head by Fang Yuan, although the wild boar was still standing, its fat body was already wavering.With a roar, Fang Yuan rushed up again, his left hand grabbing the wild boar\u2019s tusk, his right hand raising high in the air, the light green colour jade glow forming a thin layer of protection covering his fist.Bam.His fist crashed strongly downwards and the wild boar screamed in pain, struggling intensely.Fang Yuan\u2019s muscles on his left arm tensed, and the green veins popped like centipedes encircling his arm as he restrained the wild boar with all his strength.At the same time, his right fist continued to raise and slam down on the boar.Bam bam bam.Every time his fist hit the wild boar\u2019s head, the green coloured glow on his fist would shine once.The wild boar was smashed into oblivion by the fist, and its struggle became weaker.\"Last strike!\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes glowed like lightning. He loosened his upper body, his right arm stretching straight and raised to the highest point, before smashing down at full force.The green coloured jade light stuck to Fang Yuan\u2019s right arm and following his movement, drew a green arc in the air.Bam.Fang Yuan knelt on the ground on one knee, his elbow harshly whacking the wild boar\u2019s skull. Even before the wild boar could cry out, its noise came to a stop.An entire pig head turned deformed, the broken white skull pierced through the black skin, exposing outside. Fresh blood and brain matter slowly flowed out, and in the layers of leaf litter, it infected an area of bright redness.The autumn wind blew.Leaves flew about as the scent of the pig blood emanated.\"Life, is splendid just like the flowers of summer. Death, is as delicate as the leaves of autumn,\" Fang Yuan muttered, appreciating this frame of scenery.The survivor lives brilliantly while the dead is lonely and pitiful.Dead or alive, filled with intense difference, it reflected nature\u2019s cruelness and the excitement of life.\"No matter the world, the victor always gets all the fame, while the loser suffers defeat in the unrelentless world. Victory and loss, to me means life and death. Because I walk on the demonic path, once I lose, it means death awaits.\"Fang Yuan got close to the corpse and sat on the ground, taking out the White Boar Gu, letting it consume the meat while his consciousness entered the aperture in his body.Within the aperture, the black green-coloured primeval sea\u2019s tides turned and crashed, ebbed and flowed.When the primeval sea is full, it occupied 44% of the space. After an intense battle, Fang Yuan used the Jade Skin Gu multiple times to raise his defense, and some primeval essence was expended, thus there was only 36% primeval essence left.Counting the amount, he only used 8%, not even 10% of his total. But because this was the Rank one peak stage black green primeval essence, the expenditure was considered large.Rank one initial stage is jade green primeval essence.Rank one initial stage is pale green primeval essence.Rank one initial stage is dark green primeval essence.Rank one initial stage is black green primeval essence.The essence was in concentration (the relative amount of a particular substance contained within a solution or mixture or in a particular volume of space.).The Moonlight Gu\u2019s activation required 10% of jade green primeval essence, and in terms of pale green primeval essence, it was 5%. For dark green primeval essence, it further halved, and the same went for black green primeval essence.That is to say, 10% of black green primeval essence, was equivalent to 20% dark green, 40% pale green and 80% jade green primeval essence.Using the Jade Skin Gu cost 8% black green primeval essence, if converted to initial stage jade green primeval essence, it would be 64%!If Fang Yuan was still at initial stage, his aperture would only have 44% primeval essence, and halfway through using the Gu, his primeval essence would be completely expended.\"The higher the Gu Master\u2019s cultivation, the stronger their battle strength, and this shows in the primeval essence. The higher the stage, the darker the colour of the primeval essence, and the more durable it is. My black green primeval essence was on the basis of upper stage primeval essence, refined by the Liquor worm. It is unlike Fang Zheng, who is already Rank one peak stage cultivation already.\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone.Time flies, it is already late autumn.Two months had passed since Wang Da\u2019s assassination.Fang Zheng was poisoned and was in comatose for seven days and seven nights. Once he woke up he was like a changed man, very hardworking and also cultivated extremely dutifully.Some people say, difficulties in life was wealth just like gold.Regardless of whether this saying is correct, Fang Zheng did emerge from this difficulty changed and obtained much experience. He was like a raw jade, and after some polishing, he finally showed the beautiful jade quality inside.He was the first to advance to upper stage, and not long ago, he was the first to advance to peak stage, leaving his classmates in the dust. The advantages of an A grade talent has finally started showing.\"I am not far from peak stage either, at most half a month. In fact, I have been nurturing my aperture nonstop every day, but a C grade talent really cannot compete with A and B grades, and I also have another reason...\" Fang Yuan laughed bitterly without sound as he thought of it.Once in a few days, he would have to kill jade eye stone monkeys to feed the Jade Skin Gu. At the same time, he had to search inside the stone forest to find the next clue of the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance.The stone forest was complicated with pillars of huge rocks drooping from the ceiling. If Fang Yuan was not careful and got too close to any pillar, he would trigger the attack of all the stone monkeys.A few times, he was chased by tens of stone monkeys and had to escape. The most dangerous time, when retreating he stepped into another pillar\u2019s territory, and ended up having up to a hundred monkeys chasing after him.Luckily, these monkeys were sedentary, and every time they chased after him, they would not chase too far. After a distance, they would go back to their homes and continue being sedentary.Even so, Fang Yuan walked on the brink of death several times. During crucial times, the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense came into good use.Such investigation and exploration caused Fang Yuan to devote much time and effort, and thus became the key reason why his cultivation was advancing so slowly.\"Even so, this is way better than my previous life. The stone forest exploration is not without results either. At least I already know that the walls around the forest have no problems. That means that the next clue of the strength inheritance, should be somewhere in the forest.\"Fang Yuan continued thinking, but suddenly a shadow stepped over the dried branches and got close.This is a wandering old wolf.It had a brown fur coat, limping and had one eye was damaged. Only the danger and alertness of its left eye remained.It stared at Fang Yuan tightly, its nose twitching. Wolves and dogs were the same, using their keen sense of smell, it must have been attracted by the pig blood.Wolves were often in packs, but there were also lone wolves like this. There were competition in wolf packs as well, and to maintain the atmosphere in the pack, they would sometimes get rid of those crippled old wolves.Fang Yuan quickly stood up and silently looked at this old wolf.Back then when he killed a wild boar, there would be little primeval essence left in his body and that caused his fighting strength to greatly reduce. Thus when he encountered other wild beasts, he would choose to avoid them.But these few months, his battle strength had increased tremendously, and with the Jade Skin Gu, against a crippled wolf, it was more than enough.The unrestrained mountain trees were everywhere with their red leaves.The setting sun illuminated the dark hour.A person and a wolf distanced fifty steps away, silently observed each other.In the wolf\u2019s eye, green light shone as it showed a cruel and cunning expression. Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes however, were dark and eerie, his black iris emanating chilling intent.The White Boar Gu came out. It was full and returned to Fang Yuan\u2019s aperture satisfied.The old wolf looked at the wild boar, it had only bones and skin left, the meat was all eaten by the White Boar Gu.The wolf\u2019s eyes shone with green light and contracted. It first took a few steps back, then jumped into the bushes.This wolf was still alive till today, it definitely had some intelligence. It keenly felt Fang Yuan\u2019s danger, and decided to retreat.Its entry and exit were both fast and abrupt.Without the wild boar\u2019s crashing sound, and without the tiger\u2019s growling.Against Fang Yuan, without a sound, the battle had started and ended.\"The main theme of life and death, such excitement born from great nature.\" Fang Yuan stood on the spot, and did not give chase. This wolf did not have anything worth Fang Yuan\u2019s attack.Aiiee!But the next moment, the old wolf\u2019s crying was heard.The wolf\u2019s howling suddenly erupted and ended suddenly. Even so, there was a thick surge of death aura overflowing.Crack crack.In the bush, there were sounds of twigs being stepped on.The sound was fearless and got closer, causing Fang Yuan\u2019s iris to shrink.\"Able to get rid of that sneaky old wolf in a second...\" His gaze became more and more chilly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe footsteps got closer, and soon the dark green trees at the side of the slope were forcefully separated. A tall man stepped forward, appearing in Fang Yuan\u2019s vision.He had black short hair, each strand standing straight up. The upper half of his body was naked. He had a large and thick body, the entirety of his body muscles bright red colour.He was almost two meters tall, and during the cold autumn, he gave off the feeling of a mobile cauldron, his every breath able to raise the surrounding temperature.On his waist, several wild beast corpses were hanged. There were foxes, wild rabbits and chickens, not to forget the old wolf who had just left.Seeing Fang Yuan, he was slightly shocked, but quickly took large steps and walked past Fang Yuan.\"Gu Yue Chi Shan.\" Seeing the large man\u2019s back leaving, Fang Yuan thought of his name.He was a representative of the Chi faction, having Rank two upper stage cultivation. His experiences were similar to Fang Yuan even.This person was also very talented, having very great strength from young. At ten he accidentally beat a family servant to death, and at twelve he could hold a heavy stone grinder and played it like a frisbee.Back then, the family all thought well of him, thinking he was an A grade. But during the awakening ceremony, they tested that his talent was only B grade.He had an originally wild and untamable nature, looking down on everyone. But he quickly changed after this experience, becoming more mature. Even with B grade talent, he was the top student in his level.After a year of studying, he graduated from the academy and fought his way to the top. Years later, he had already become an elite among the clan\u2019s Rank two Gu Masters.Happiness cannot teach a person life\u2019s true meaning, while only pain and suffering can.\"In the clan, a youngster attends the awakening ceremony at fifteen and enters the academy. At sixteen, they graduate from the academy and form a five person group and complete the clan\u2019s missions, at the same time inheriting the family fortune. From sixteen, they will fight and compete while continually raising their cultivation. As the missions get more dangerous, their status will also increase. Some die and some live. Some get injured, and their cultivation level drops, living a plain life thereafter. Some become a Rank three Gu Master after all the hardship and advance to clan elder, being one of the higher-ups.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone, thinking of many things.The more a Gu Master cultivates, the harder it gets, and advancing becomes way more difficult. Coupled with dangerous and tough living environment, those that can advance to Rank three are few to none.\"Speaking of which, it is almost winter. That means I\u2019ve spent almost a year at the academy. Each year there are two examinations. The first is the mid-year exam, with different contents each year. The second is the year end exam, and the contents never change, being arena fights. After the arena fight, I would no longer be able to stay at the hostel, and I would need to move out.\"Move out, but stay where?Fang Yuan could not live with his aunt and uncle, which was what they wanted.In this world, sixteen meant adulthood, the age to start reproduction. Coupled with Fang Yuan\u2019s numerous secrets, he needed to live independently.\"In my previous life, after leaving the academy I was only Rank one middle stage. This time, the situation is much better, I would be Rank one peak stage by then. But with a C grade talent, coming this far is really an achievement. Although it had its costs, expending much of my primeval stones.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s eyebrows raised, he did not have many primeval stones left.Restricted by his talent, the primeval stones he expended for cultivation was much more than Fang Zheng, Chi Cheng or Mo Bei.He raised six Gu worms by himself!Furthermore, the Liquor worm\u2019s refinement, nurturing the aperture, using the White Boar Gu to increase strength \u2014 they all needed primeval essence. After the primeval essence was used up, with a C grade recovery speed, it could not satisfy his needs, so he could only use primeval stones and retrieve the natural essence within to replenish.Luckily he had the Spring Autumn Cicada, and also retrieved two Gu from Earth Treasury Flowers, thus refining Gu worms did not expend much of his primeval stones. This made him feel slightly better.But after this when he leaves the academy, he needs to rent a house and get some income.After peak stage, it was to push for Rank two. This process would spend a lot of primeval stones.After Rank two, he still had to combine Gu worms, and each combination attempt was a hefty cost.With all these factors, he was even clearer that his financial situation could no longer support him. Furthermore, he still had to continue feeding his Gu worms and continue cultivating.If it wasn\u2019t for the mid year exam where he used the wild boar tusks to exchange for quite some primeval stones and alleviated the pressure, he would not have survived till now.\"Primeval stones, primeval stones... the Flower Wine Monk did not give any primeval stones in his inheritance, what a shame. Extorting my classmates is still my most important source of income. But after graduating, the academy\u2019s allowance would stop, and I cannot continue extorting. But if I get first for the year end exam, I can get a hundred and fifty primeval stones as reward,\" Fang Yuan contemplated in his heart.If he could get first place, the hundred and fifty primeval stones would alleviate his financial difficulty for a while....Time flies, autumn leaves and winter comes.On the arena in the academy, three stages had already been built.Beside the stage, near the bamboo walls of the arena, there were tents and long tables and chairs.The academy elder, clan leader and a few other clan elders were sitting below the tentage cover.There was a little snow in the sky.Fifty-seven students stood straight on the arena. Each of their noses were bright red from the weather, and every breath they took had steam coming out of their noses.The academy elder spoke loudly, \"In a flash a year has ended. During this year you were trained in the academy and have started to grasp the qualities of a Gu Master. Tomorrow, you will have the year end examination to test the fruits of your hard work! Not only will the clan leader and clan elders come personally to watch, your family elders and seniors will also come to observe to pick excellent performing students to join their small teams.\"\"Your performances tomorrow, will to a large extent affect your future. Getting first place, not only is it a hundred and fifty primeval stones, but you also get an advantage in picking Gu worms! Now, start the final cultivation check in your academic life!\"Saying so, the academy elder nodded to a Gu Master beside him.The female Gu Master received the instructions and called out the name from the list, \"Gu Yue Jin Zhu!\"A young girl walked towards the Gu Master with a nervous expression.The Gu Master stretched out her hand, touching the young girl\u2019s abdomen. She closed her eyes to feel, then opened her eyes and declared, \"Gu Yue Jin Zhu, Rank one middle stage. Next, Gu Yue Peng.\"One after another, youngsters went up to check. Then they walked back down and returned to the group.Their expressions varied, some were happy while others were upset.The worst result was naturally Rank one initial stage, all being the D grade talents.A large number of the students were Rank one middle stage, and little of them were B grade, mostly C grades.\"Gu Yue Chi Cheng.\" The middle-aged female Gu Master called.From the group, the shortest Gu Yue Chi Cheng puffed his chest and walked out.After checking, the female Gu Master opened her eyes, \"Gu Yue Chi Cheng, Rank one peak stage!\"Up till now, this was the first Rank one peak stage Gu Master.The clan elders present turned their heads.Some elders recognised, saying lightly, \"This is Chi Lian\u2019s grandson, having B grade talent, no wonder.\"Outside the tent, the youngsters also commented.\"Chi Cheng is Rank one peak stage, I wonder if Mo Bei is too? They are rivals after all.\"\"Being able to advance to peak stage, they are all A and B grades. Sigh, we C and D grades encounter bitterness that cannot be envied.\"\"Hmph!\" Gu Yue Mo Bei snorted, seeing Chi Cheng\u2019s proud expression, he was annoyed.Gu Yue Fang Zheng clenched his fists, his lips tightly shut, as if he was stifling in his emotions.\"Gu Yue Mo Bei.\" Soon, the examiner called.The horse-faced Mo Bei quickly walked out.\"Gu Yue Mo Bei, Rank one peak stage.\" With this declaration, he walked back and stared defiantly at Gu Yue Chi Cheng when returning.The examination continued, and the snow in the sky became smaller, until it vanished.The cold chilly air was rather refreshing.\"Gu Yue Fang Yuan.\" The middle-aged female Gu Master called.Fang Yuan walked up expressionlessly.Soon after, she opened her eyes, looking at Fang Yuan in shock, before declaring, \"Gu Yue Fang Yuan, Rank one peak stage!\"\"Rank one peak stage, did I hear wrongly? Fang Yuan cultivated to this level?\" The youngsters were shocked.\"Sigh, he\u2019s just lucky, having the Liquor worm to nurture his aperture. Even against the A and B grades, with his C grade he isn\u2019t at a disadvantage.\" Some youngsters said with envy.Especially those C grade talents, they sourly said to console themselves, \"This isn\u2019t much. The Liquor worm cannot refine Rank two primeval essence, Fang Yuan would no longer have such an advantage anymore.\"\"Even if he is peak stage, he is still a C grade, this is of no concern to us.\" Mo Bei and Chi Cheng stared at Fang Yuan, but quickly turned their attention to Fang Zheng, who was still waiting for his turn.In their hearts, only the A grade talent Fang Zheng was a competitor.\"Brother, you\u2019ve caught me by surprise. But from now on, watch carefully...\" Fang Zheng looked at Fang Yuan walking down, his eyes shone and revealed an anticipating expression.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng.\" The female Gu Master finally said.\"The A grade talent?\" The clan elders focused their attention to Fang Zheng.Fang Zheng walked out from the crowd, he could feel the pressure that these gazes were bringing him, causing him to become slightly nervous.But when he saw the clan leader Gu Yue Bo\u2019s smile, the nervousness in his heart melted.He walked in front of the female Gu Master.She shut her eyes, and then abruptly opened her eyes, saying in shock, \"Gu Yue Fang Zheng, cultivation level \u2014 Rank two initial stage!\"Boom.The youngsters erupted into a wave of discussions.\"What, he reached Rank two?!\"\"As expected of the A grade talent genius.\"\"Incredible, he left Mo Bei, Chi Cheng, and Fang Yuan in the dust.\"\"This Fang Zheng!\" At once, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng stared at Fang Zheng in shock.\"Hehehe, actually higher than in my previous life...\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyelids drooped down as he laughed. He was not surprised, and after observing Fang Zheng\u2019s expression earlier, he could guess the result.\"A grade talent after all.\"\"The hope of our clan.\"\"This is the credit of clan leader\u2019s nurturing...\"The clan elders praised.At once, Fang Zheng became the center of attention.Half a year ago, Gu Yue Bo gave him a Jade Skin Gu and asked him to be the first person to advance to Rank two. He did it!\"Clan leader, I did not disappoint you, I did it! From now on, I will achieve even more, getting the approval of the clan elders and the people around me. Brother, I\u2019ve left you behind, you are no longer the shadow in my heart. I, Gu Yue Fang Zheng, am no longer the one from back then!\"Fang Zheng yelled in his heart, his eyes shining with a kind of brilliance.This brilliance, is called confidence!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hehehe, I wonder if the scene I saw from more than a decade ago when I graduated will be seen again.\" A middle-aged Gu Master with long green hair cascading down his back stood outside the academy, reminiscing.\"Leader, get in, you love reminiscing.\" The young female Gu Master beside him had blood red lips, her hands placed in the pockets of her pants. There was a blade of grass in her mouth, and she rolled her eyes.\"Hehehe, Yao Hong, don\u2019t rush. We have to get in anyway. Since the clan leader had arranged it already, our new members have been decided long ago.\" The green haired Gu Master laughed.\"The A grade talent Fang Zheng?\" The female Gu Master Gu Yue Yao Hong tutted in her mouth, saying unhappily, \"The clan leader\u2019s idea is to get us to babysit him!\"\"But this babysitting mission is not easy to accomplish.\" The green haired male Gu Master sighed, \"Nevermind, let\u2019s go in.\"As time passed, more and more Gu Masters entered the academy doors, and stood in the arena.These were male and female Gu Masters. There were young faces, middle-aged, and old people as well.Gu Masters after graduating would come out and form small teams to complete the clan missions. The Gu Masters that came to the arena were all the representatives of their groups, to assess the performances of the students and absorb them into their own teams.To the small groups, this was injecting fresh blood and expanding their group.To the newly joined members, under the guidance and teaching of the older members, they can swiftly adapt to the new environment and more effectively complete the clan missions and result in lesser deaths.The sun gradually rose, as the students entered the fray.\"So many people today.\" The youngsters proclaimed.\"Quickly see, that is Lord Qing Shu. He is our Gu Yue clan\u2019s number one person among the Rank two, and he is known for his mild and amiable temper.\" A person pointed at the green haired male Gu Master and shouted.\"Chi Shan senior is here too.\"\"That is the Mo family\u2019s little miss Mo Yan!\"Qing Shu, Chi Shan, and Mo Yan were the rising stars of the Gu Masters, known by all students.\"Sigh, their teams are too hard to get in. I am only D grade, and my vital Gu is a Gentle Silk Spider, I am meant to be a support staff.\" A youngster sighed, then asked his friend, \"You?\"\"Oh, I got it settled with relationships. Through the godson of my uncle\u2019s cousin\u2019s sister.\"...As the students observed the Gu Masters, Qing Shu, Chi Shan and Mo Yan also observed the students.\"Oh? There are two Gu Yue Fang Zhengs.\" Yao Hong saw Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng, shouting out subconsciously.The green hair male Gu Master Gu Yue Qing Shu helplessly sighed, \"Did you see the information I gave you yesterday? Fang Zheng has a twin brother, they look very similar in appearance, but his brother is only C grade talent.\"\"Oh so that\u2019s the case. I seem to have heard that the one who made poems when he was young was Fang Yuan? Are we getting him into the team?\" Yao Hong patted her forehead with her palm, saying whatever she thought of.Qing Mao shook his head, \"The clan leader specifically mentioned, do not recruit him. He seems to be wanting to observe something. The brothers don\u2019t have a good relationship anyway. Even if we want to recruit him, Fang Yuan probably wouldn\u2019t join.\"Yao Hong did not think much of it, muttering, \"Among the groups, we are the publically acclaimed number one, joining us means a bright future. Any student would be interested. How could he be unwilling?\"Qing Shu laughed lightly, \"That\u2019s because you don\u2019t know him, look at the information I sent you first.\"At this time, the clan leader Gu Yue Bo, and the authoritative clan elders Gu Yue Chi Lian and Gu Yue Mo Chen entered, getting into the seats under the tentage.\"Not only the clan leader, but also Lord Chi Lian and Lord Mo Bei are attending this year.\"Seeing this, not only the students but also the Gu Masters were excited, this did not happen in previous years.\"Nothing strange, Chi Lian and Mo Chen\u2019s grandsons are all in this year\u2019s class.\"\"Fang Zheng is the clan leader\u2019s successor, the hope of the future to go against Bai Ning Bing. The clan leader naturally has to observe carefully.\"Discussions were aplenty among the people.\"Perform well brother.\" Mo Yan looked at Mo Bei among the people, silently praying in her heart. Her group had the most people, it was of the largest scale. Thus there were a bunch of Gu Masters around her, showing her imposing aura.As her most intense rival, Gu Yue Chi Shan from the Chi faction was standing alone, his huge figure easily acting like a giant red tower in a sea of people, standing out extensively.After checking out Chi Cheng, he retracted his vision.With a speech from the clan leader, the year end exam began.The three stages held fights at the same time.At once, shouting noises, sounds of moonblades flying, and the sounds of punches and kicks as well as the discussions of the Gu Masters below the stages fused into a loud banter.\"This year\u2019s physical fighting skills is high.\" Soon, Yao Hong saw the difference.\"Hehehe, all thanks to Fang Yuan.\" Gu Yue Qing Shu laughed.\"What do you mean?\" Yao Hong did not understand.Qing Shu explained to her.Yao Hong exclaimed in shock after listening, \"Fang Yuan this lad, he\u2019s really daring, almost to the point of fearless. Hehehe, bullying even his own brother. This is interesting.\"She looked towards Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng from the crowd, thinking internally \u2014 Which is the elder brother and which is the younger one.\"Next, Gu Yue Jin Zhu against Gu Yue Mo Bei.\" On the arena, the hosting Gu Master shouted.Gu Yue Mo Bei leapt upwards, and Jin Zhu walked up the stage with a serious expression.The two paid respects to each other and said no more, fighting at once. Moonblades danced in the air.The two continued to shoot and at the same time, moving and evading nonstop.Although a girl, Jin Zhu had good basic skills and was able to fight equally with Mo Bei for a while. But as time passed, her stamina could not keep up, and she started to be suppressed.Finally, with her body full of sweat and having no energy left, she surrendered.Mo Bei on the other hand was not even fazed.\"Increasing endurance Gu huh, probably the Yellow Camel Longhorn Beetle Gu....\" Below the stage, Fang Yuan observed, quickly seeing through Mo Bei.Fang Yuan had six Gu worms, but that was an exception. Among the people of his age, they all had one or two Gu worms.Not only because of the financial stress of feeding Gu worms, but also because the Gu worm\u2019s usage needed constant practice to accumulate experience.Greed for more would backfire. The students only started interacting with Gu worms, and just began on their cultivation journey. Two Gu worms were enough for them to practice.Only an exception like Fang Yuan with his rich experience from his previous life, could easily grasp every Gu worm that comes into possession and use them to the very best he can.The exam continued.\"Damn, jumping like a rabbit!\" On another stage, a youngster angrily shouted, \"Gu Yue Chi Cheng, you\u2019re not a man, do you dare to fight with me physically?!\"\"Tsk, only a fool would fight close range with you.\" On the stage, Gu Yue Chi Cheng laughed in disdain. He used the Scarlet Pill Cricket Gu and jumped around, his body being very agile.His opponent only had a Flower Boar Gu. Even if he could temporarily raise his strength by one boar, it was useless. Chi Cheng would not go hand to hand with him.Finally, he got hit by a moonblade from Chi Cheng and lost too much blood, retiring from the fight.The healing Gu Masters below the stage quickly rushed up and treated his injuries.As time passed, more and more students were mercilessly eliminated, and many youngsters also started to show their abilities.Chi Cheng, Mo Bei, Fang Yuan, Fang Zheng\u2026...Until noon.The D grade talents were all eliminated. They had limited talent and all chose support-type Gu worms for production line or transport, which suited their lives. Thus, they had little help in battles.\"Little junior sister, your vital Gu is a Life Breath Grass right, my group needs a healer Gu Master.\"\"Senior, I wish to join your group, my vital Gu is a Moonlight Gu.\"\"Sorry, we are not lacking any attack-type Gu Master.\"...The small groups quickly recruited newbies, and the students also chose the groups they wanted.The fights on the stage did not have much visual appeal, and after a few rounds, there were not many highlights, it was even boring. This was because most people chose the Moonlight Gu, and to most people, the fight would start with shooting moonblades. Whoever expended their primeval essence first would lose.If both parties had no more primeval essence, they would fight with punches and kicks. At the end, one will fall.Be it students, Gu Masters, or clan elders, they got bored watching and some were about to fall asleep.Until evening, there were only less than ten students left on the stage.\"Finally ending.\" Some Gu Masters lifted their spirits, shrugging off the sleepiness.At this moment, the Gu Master shouted, \"Next round, Gu Yue Fang Zheng vs Gu Yue Mo Bei!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today I will challenge and beat a higher realm.\" Mo Bei gritted his teeth, his expression solemn, cheering for himself in his heart. Against the Rank two Fang Zheng, he indeed felt a strong sense of pressure.\"Come.\" Fang Zheng roared, rushing out ferociously.Mo Bei\u2019s heart jumped, this Fang Zheng wasn\u2019t acting according to plan. Normally, they would first shoot moonblades before using hand to hand combat. But this time, he actually rushed up immediately, and wants to fight physically?\"Isn\u2019t he afraid of getting injured by my moonblade when exchanging punches and kicks?\" Mo Bei was perturbed.He was naturally not worried for Fang Zheng\u2019s safety, but knew that if they engaged in close combat, with such a short distance if Fang Zheng shot a moonblade, it was unavoidable.Mo Bei quickly took a step back, attempting to pull some distance. At the same time, he shot out a moonblade with a flick of his wrist.Fang Zheng was unfazed, taking a tumble and avoiding the moonblade, continuing his pursuit. At the same time, a lump of lunar energy collected in his palm.Mo Bei looked at the moonlight in his hands that hasn\u2019t been fired and felt tense in his heart, quickly taking steps back.Although he worked hard in close combat and also trained his moonblade, he was still inferior to Fang Zheng who was nurtured personally by the clan leader.Mo Bei was not suited to this style of combat, and quickly fell into disadvantage.\"Eh? That side is interesting.\" The battle on this arena attracted much attention.\"They\u2019re actually fighting so closely, this Fang Zheng has guts.\" Yao Hong could now discern who is Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng. Fang Yuan had a cold expression and emitted an aura of maturity, while Fang Zheng was steel-willed, radiating a sunny aura.\"It must be the clan leader\u2019s teaching. Normally when students fight, they would be ten meters apart. Further than this distance and the moonblade would dissipate. If they fought closer than this distance, the students would not react in time.\" Gu Yue Qing Shu\u2019s gaze shone, \"Fang Zheng\u2019s battle distance now has shrunk to six meters, but his ability to avoid the moonblade is proficient. It seems that not only is the clan leader helping Fang Zheng, but Fang Zheng also put in some hard work and went through much hardship.\"\"Little brother!\" Mo Yan seeing Mo Bei forced into a corner by Fang Zheng, showed worry and panic on her face. She really wanted to go in and help out, giving Fang Zheng a good beating.Chi Shan however was expressionless, only watching and not speaking. After Fang Zheng got close to Mo Bei and shortened the distance to six meters, he no longer got closer, but used the Moonlight Gu and entered a firing contest.Mo Bei tried hard to improvise. His actions were in a mess, and many times he was almost hit by the moonblades, constantly in danger.Fang Zheng on the other hand, already had his winning formula.Even if he could not evade in time, he still had the Jade Skin Gu, and as long as he uses the jade green glow in time, he would be able to block the moonblade.Seeing how Mo Bei was defenselessly beaten by himself, Fang Zheng\u2019s thoughts flew back to a time in the past.Under the moonlight, the clan leader taught him the evasion movements step by step, unreservedly imparting him all the experience he had.\"Clan leader, I will not let you down.\" Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes shimmered with hope, he was getting braver as he fought!\"Fang Zheng, you have the talent and the endurance, studiously training. The result is all because of your blood and sweat. This is the fruits of your hard work, continue like this, Fang Zheng. Using this aura, go and show your brilliance!\" Under the tentage, the clan leader excitedly cheered on inwardly, even though he looked like he was quietly watching the fight, his lips curled into a smile.Although Mo Bei struggled furiously, resisting adamantly, but after fifteen minutes, his entire body was full of injuries, the blood oozing out and dyeing his shirt red.The organizing Gu Master, upon seeing such a scene, announced, \"The victory goes to Gu Yue Fang Zheng.\"\"I haven\u2019t lost yet!\" Mo Bei shouted loudly, his entire bloodbathed body wavering in the air. But after struggling to no end, he was forced to receive treatment by the healing Gu Masters.\"A battle of such an intensity is already beyond the graduating standard.\"\"An A grade talent, is after all a genius.\"\"I heard he received personal guidance from the clan leader, can he not be amazing?\"Seeing such a result, the Gu Masters below the stage praised endlessly.Gu Yue Fang Zheng panted as he walked down the stage. Three Gu Masters came to him and healed him, while also providing free primeval stones to allow him to quickly recover his primeval essence.After resting for a while, he recovered to his peak condition and ascended the stage again.This time, he was against Gu Yue Chi Cheng.Chi Cheng looked at Fang Zheng, laughing dryly, \"Very good! Fang Zheng, you defeated Mo Bei that rascal, if I defeat you now, it would be killing two birds with one stone.\"He seemed very confident.Fang Zheng\u2019s lips remained tight, as he said nothing but rushed towards him.\"Dragonpill cricket Gu!\" Chi Cheng\u2019s thought flashed, and immediately an orange red-coloured glow came from both his legs. He leapt lightly and instantly retreated ten meters away.The distance that Fang Zheng had just shortened was immediately lengthened.\"Hehehe.\" Chi Cheng got smug and laughed, \"Fang Zheng, you have no speed increasing Gu, and with your two legs, you cannot catch me. Although this stage isn\u2019t big, it is enough for me to manoeuvre. Your tactic might have worked on Mo Bei, but against me it is ineffective.\"\"Is that so?\" Fang Zheng stopped his movements and stood on the spot, staring intently at Chi Cheng.He smiled, his eyes showing iron will, shouting loudly, \"Continue dodging like that, but everytime you use the Dragonpill cricket Gu, you have to use a certain amount of primeval essence. You have merely Rank one peak stage green copper primeval essence, but I am already at Rank two red steel primeval essence, three times your endurance. Your talent is inferior to me as well. At the end, you would run out of primeval essence and the loser will be you!\"\"You!\" Chi Cheng was shocked, he only saw his advantage but did not notice his weakness. Right now, he could not help but agree with Fang Zheng, and his fighting spirit dampened.\"What, Fang Zheng is Rank two?!\" The surrounding Gu Masters gasped. The examination results were only obtained the day before, thus they were only spread among certain people, so most of the crowd did not know about it yet.\"An A Grade talent no doubt, amazing, this Fang Zheng might really be the rising star of our clan.\"\"Bai clan has that Bai Ning Bing, he is really too powerful. If Fang Zheng can grow up, he might be able to resist Bai Ning Bing.\"\"This lad is interesting. Getting to Rank two in the academy and with such solid basic skills, this is such an uncommon scene. No wonder the clan leader poured so much effort into him,\" Yao Hong muttered.Qing Shu replied, \"The clan leader\u2019s guidance is only part of it, don\u2019t look down on this lad. Ever since he survived the assassination incident, he has become very hardworking, cultivating to the best of his limits, he is a good seedling, with both talent and hardwork. If he can grow up..., sigh, I feel like my burden is increasing.\"\"Hehehe.\" Clan leader Gu Yue Bo laughed lightly.Chi Cheng\u2019s weak nature was analyzed by him to Fang Zheng. Now that he saw Fang Zheng using it to his advantage, Gu Yue Bo was very pleased.\"It seems that Fang Zheng is this year\u2019s number one.\" Beside the clan leader, Gu Yue Mo Chen said.Gu Yue Chi Lian snorted, staring at the scene intently. He obviously wished for his grandson to win and defeat Fang Zheng, that way he would win honour for the Chi faction.But things do not go as he wished, and on the stage after getting demoralized, Chi Cheng could no longer display his 100% ability against Fang Zheng, and made continuous mistakes.Eventually, Chi Cheng was caught with a fatal flaw, and was swept down the stage.\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng wins!\" Gu Master announced.Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s face was black.At once, Fang Zheng was famous, getting all the attention from the clan people.\"Fang Zheng beat Mo Bei and Chi Cheng simultaneously with wits and courage, it seems he is the first place this year,\" Some people praised.\"Makes sense, I think well of him as well. Too bad he cannot join our group.\" As the groups choose students, students are also choosing groups. A seeded student like Fang Zheng was already long booked.\"Fang Zheng is the clan leader\u2019s faction, while Mo Bei, Chi Cheng are the Mo faction, Chi faction\u2019s future leaders. This way, it seems that the Gu Yue Clan would be heavily dominated by the clan leader faction, suppressing the two clan elders.\" Some people could see even further.On the other two stages, the battles continued.Fang Zheng walked down the stage long ago, hearing the people\u2019s praises, his heart roaring as he felt himself being reborn.Different, it was very different from before.His heart was filled with the excitement of recognition, the anticipation of being appreciated, and the joy of being commended.A gust of winter wind blew, and although he felt the chilly wind, Fang Zheng could only feel the sense of warmth like the summer day.\"Last match, Gu Yue Fang Zheng vs Gu Yue Fang Yuan!\" A while later, an announcer shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go ahead and defeat him, you have red steel primeval essence while also having the Jade Skin Gu. With both offense and defense, you have the greatest advantage. Break apart this obstacle in your way, and you shall be reborn!\"The final match finally started.The two brothers stood on the same arena, staring at each other.The last remaining sunrays were like blood\u2026The light of the sunset was like a luxurious carpet for the arena.Two very similar faces.The little brother\u2019s fighting spirit burned on, while the older brother\u2019s gaze was deep as the abyss.\"Brother...\" Fang Zheng\u2019s fists were clenched as he stared intently at Fang Yuan, speaking with a firm voice,\" Admit defeat! I am already Rank two, and I have over 80% red steel primeval essence. Your green bronze primeval essence is only 44%, you have no chance.\"Fang Yuan lightly looked at his brother, \"You are surely clear about my primeval essence. But it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t spout nonsense. If primeval essence can decide the victory, what\u2019s the point of fighting?\"Fang Zheng was stunned, but soon he raised his spirits, and his vigor could be seen burning in his eyes.In truth, in the deepest part of his heart, he also did not want Fang Yuan to admit defeat. But Fang Yuan was his older brother after all, thus in view of their relationship he had to say it.If not, that would be too cruel.\"Since big brother is so determined, then I have no choice but to attack!\" Before he finished his sentence, Fang Zheng rushed towards Fang Yuan.\"This again!\" Below the stage, Mo Bei looking at this scene, gritted his teeth. He made up his mind to harshly train himself after going back and return this humiliation tenfold to Fang Zheng!\"Fang Yuan is finished, he does not have my Dragonpill cricket Gu.\" Chi Cheng folded his arms and smirked, enjoying Fang Yuan\u2019s troubles.Fang Zheng sprinted and instantly shortened the distance. In his hand there was a ball of moonlight.Fang Yuan\u2019s expression was like steel; there was not a single change as he looked at the charging Fang Zheng. He did not take a single step away but blue coloured moonlight also gathered in his right palm.Suddenly!Fang Yuan took a firm step after stomping the ground, and moved towards Fang Zheng instead of backing away.\"This!\" Fang Zheng did not expect Fang Yuan\u2019s movement, he panicked internally and quickly fired a moonblade.Fang Yuan rushed quickly, and twisted his body, avoiding the moonblade by a hair\u2019s breadth.His expression was cold, without any shouting or aggression. But in his silence, there was an aura of absolute iciness emitting from him.Fang Zheng subconsciously took a few steps back. His limit was six meters, but now Fang Yuan was five meters away from him. This time he had to be the one trying to increase their distance.Dundundun.Fang Zheng retreated while flicking his right wrist several times, sending moonblades flying to try and push Fang Yuan back.Fang Yuan took fluid steps that were one after another, his body extremely agile. He moved intensely, and every time he managed to avoid the moonblade with no margin for error.\"This Fang Yuan is even more daring!\" Yao Hong shouted.\"Such a battle, they\u2019ve disregarded death already,\" Qing Shu also exclaimed.\"Another battle maniac!\" Mo Yan gritted her teeth, giving a glance at Chi Shan who was not far away.Chi Shan was expressionless, but his eyes glimmered occasionally.The noise from the audience stopped, they were all captivated by the battle on the stage.The moonblades and Fang Yuan brushed past each other. From time to time there was a blue light that would reflect upon Fang Yuan\u2019s face. His cold expression remained as it was without any change, and each time he narrowly evaded death, showing his extreme battle talent!The clan leader and clan elders all showed a serious expression.Chi Cheng and Mo Bei stared with their mouths wide open, looking at Fang Yuan dodging every single moonblade in an impossible manner.How did he do it? Numerous students had a giant question mark on their heads.Hmph, Fang Yuan who had 500 years of battle experience, how can he be compared to Fang Zheng who was only taught for a year by a Rank four Gu Master?In Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes, Fang Zheng was as thin as a clear stream. No matter how the stream flowed, or turned its way among the mountain rocks, he could see through it clearly to the bottom of the river.The moonblade\u2019s every attack was not instant, it needed a process. Fang Zheng had to flick his wrist, and that was the greatest foretelling.In Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes, Fang Zheng\u2019s shoulder movement, the movement of his wrist, every step he took provided a large amount of information. Fang Zheng\u2019s every attack, evasion and dodging was easily seen through by Fang Yuan, even as to what was going on in Fang Zheng\u2019s head, Fang Yuan could guess to a degree.Fang Zheng\u2019s mind right now was flabbergasted!Fang Yuan was the obstacle in his heart for more than ten years, the shadow quickly expanding into darkness, dragging him into the abyss.The nervous emotion made him forget to use the Jade Skin Gu. Fang Yuan\u2019s strong approach caused him to panic and he was unable to regain his tempo, thus not allowing him time to think.This was the difference in experience, this was the difference between inside knowledge!In Fang Yuan\u2019s perspective, his inside information was even more important than the Spring Autumn Cicada, it was his greatest reliance.He was able to not rely on the clan leader, clan leader, family, friends, or Gu worms.He had always and only relied on himself!In this world, only oneself is the most reliable!!Those teammates and battle partners, they were just the masks of weaklings, the excuse to anticipate help from others.He finally reached near Fang Zheng!Bam.Fang Yuan\u2019s punch was pulled from a hidden angle, smashing right into Fang Zheng\u2019s stomach.Fang Zheng\u2019s body curled as the force of the fist almost caused him to vomit. He quickly protected his head with his arms and took a large step back. At the crucial moment, it showed his steady basic skills.\"Where is he?\" Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes stared wide, looking around from the gap between his arms, trying to find Fang Yuan\u2019s location.\"Behind!\" With this thought, Fang Zheng felt a strong force at his waist.He lost his center of gravity and fell on the ground.But Fang Zheng had gone through tough training. With this movement he flipped around on the ground and at the same time, shot out a moonblade from his palm towards his back.This movement was the battle experience imparted by the clan leader.If it was a normal person, they might follow closely behind Fang Zheng. If they could not react in time, they would be hit by the moonblade. Even if the moonblade did not hit, they would be forced back.But who was Fang Yuan? Even Gu Yue Bo could not compete with him in terms of experience.Fang Yuan moved steadily, not giving chase. Instead, he moved in a circle and got near to Fang Zheng. The moonblade only managed to hit air.Fang Zheng thought he was able to pull some distance and quickly stood up. He was about to reorganise himself but he suddenly heard a swoosh sound.\"This is the gust of a punch!\" At that split second, Fang Zheng had such a thought.Immediately after, he was harshly hit in the ear by Fang Yuan\u2019s fist.Bam.He immediately felt his vision darken, and a strong sense of dizziness caused him to lose balance, completely collapsing on the ground.He sprawled on the ground for over two breath\u2019s time, and finally he recovered slightly. His vision became clearer, seeing Fang Yuan\u2019s two feet right beside him.He suddenly understood how ugly his situation was. He was sprawled on the ground like a dog while Fang Yuan stared at him from that high position.\"Damn it!\" Fang Zheng was furious and tried to get up.Under everyone's eyes, Fang Yuan lifted his right leg and stepped down firmly.Bam.Fang Zheng\u2019s head was harshly stepped on, like a rock hitting the stage, making a loud sound.\"Fuck!\" Fang Zheng raged and tried to get up again.Fang Yuan stared coldly, trampling down once again.Bam.Fang Zheng\u2019s head hit the stage again. His scalp knocked open and blood bled nonstop.\"Damn! Damn it!!\" Fang Zheng\u2019s teeth were about to be crushed from his clenching, and the rage in his chest burned through his entire body. He raised his head again, trying to get up.Bam.Fang Yuan\u2019s third step came down. This time he continued to step on his head, not letting go. Under the immense force, Fang Zheng\u2019s face was harshly squeezed on the stage floor.Fang Zheng\u2019s face was almost deformed, and he breathed raggedly, struggling to no avail. He felt that on his head, there was a huge rock that would not move no matter how he struggled.\"Right, how could I forget, I have the Moonlight Gu!\" Under the despair, Fang Zheng\u2019s inspiration struck, and he thought of the Moonlight Gu.His right palm gathered moonlight again.But how could Fang Yuan not notice?With a light sound, he shot out a moonblade onto Fang Zheng\u2019s right palm.Argh!Fang Zheng cried out, the immense pain sending his body into a spasm like he was struck by lightning.His palm was almost pierced through by Fang Yuan, showing his white bones. The Moonlight Gu on his palm was already struck a great blow, it was on the brink of death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re with you.\"\"Fang Zheng, you can do it, you can do it!\"The crowd cheered on fiercely, and sounds of encouragement entered Fang Zheng\u2019s ears.Huff! Huff! Huff!

As the sounds entered his heart it gave him an unimaginable strength!The scenes of the past played in his head.On the streets, the clansmen\u2019s comments.\"That\u2019s Fang Yuan, the future genius, he is not to be underestimated!\"\"Who\u2019s that behind him?\"\"Oh, probably his brother, who knows what his name is.\"...Uncle and aunt laughed, \"Fang Yuan, now the entire village is discussing the new poem you wrote! This is very good, uncle and aunt are proud of you.\"Fang Yuan waved his hand, saying calmly, \"I only made those on a whim.\"Uncle and aunt nodded, saying to Fang Zheng, \"Learn well from your brother, if you are half as talented as your brother, we would not have to worry.\"...Under the moonlight, deep in the courtyard.Clan leader Gu Yue Bo looked at Fang Zheng, saying gently, \"Fang Zheng, have confidence. You must find your purpose, believe in yourself.\"\"But, sir clan leader...\"Gu Yue Bo patted his shoulders, encouraging, \"The shadow in your heart, others cannot dispel it for you. You can only rely on yourself. I await that day.\"...The night before the year end exam.Shen Cui looked at Fang Zheng with love in her gaze under the lamp lights, \"Young master, I believe that you can get number one. I have always believed it! Work hard!\"...The morning before departure.Uncle and aunt stood at the doorstep, \"Fang Zheng, after the year end exam, you would be leaving the academy. Seeing your growth, we are very happy! Go, go and show everyone the strength of an A grade!\"And\u2026...Under the setting sun, in a dark corner, a female classmate cried profusely, \"The allowance is only three primeval stones, but Fang Yuan snatched a piece away, leaving me with two. I am almost unable to feed my Moonlight Gu at this rate.\"Fang Zheng\u2019s heart softened, \"This is my primeval stone, I\u2019ll lend it to you.\"The female classmate took the primeval stone, saying with tears, \"Fang Zheng, you are too nice, please defeat your brother and end his tyranny in the academy!\"Fang Zheng was silent.A bunch of classmates appeared in front of him.\"Fang Zheng, you are an A grade talent, you can do it.\"\"Fang Yuan is too much, constantly bullying us, you are our only hope.\"\"Fang Zheng, from today onwards, we\u2019re with you, we will always support you!\"\"Everyone...\" Fang Zheng observed the surroundings, seeing the concerned pairs of eyes, and felt extremely touched....Everyone...Everyone has expectations of me.My classmates, uncle, aunt, Shen Cui, and sir clan leader!Everyone is waiting for me, looking at me, supporting me\u2026...How can I lose? How can I fall here? How can I!Boom, boom, boom, boom. Fang Zheng awoke as the MC!!His heart pounded in his chest, and Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes shone with MAIN CHARACTER brilliance.I cannot fall here!I will dispel the shadow and stand up!!Fang Zheng\u2019s fists were tightly clenched, no longer feeling any pain at this point. He felt a lion in his chest, awakening from its sleep and opening its huge mouth to roar!Hot-blood boiled in his body.Stand up, stand up!\u7acb\u3064! \u7acb\u3064!Break the shadows, break the darkness!\"Kamehamehaaaaaaaa!\" Fang Zheng opened his mouth wide to shout, his body starting to emit a jade light.\"What\u2019s that?\" The crowd silenced.\"Jade skin Gu!\" Someone shouted.Bam!The students roared towards the heavens\"Fang Zheng, ganbatte!\"\"Fang Zheng, we have your back!\"Finally only one last cheer remained--- \"Stand up! Stand up!\"Everyone\u2026.. I can hear your voices.\" Fang Zheng clenched his fist, his teeth almost crushed, Fang Yuan\u2019s pressure was no longer so imposing, he could finally, get up, slowly and steadily.The shouting intensified.\"Sasuga shounen anime!\"\"He\u2019s going to do a comeback.\"Gu masters hearing such cheers and excitement from the crowd, were all moved.\"That\u2019s right, Fang Zheng, that\u2019s right! Stand up, stand up, abandon the past, dispel the shadow, and stand up, you will become a new person!\" Clan leader\u2019s eyes shone with bright light as he cheered Fang Zheng on in his heart.\"Jade skin Gu...\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes drooped, he pulled back his leg, and saw Fang Zheng stand up slowly, the jade skin Gu\u2019s radiance turning his face green.Fang Zheng was actually hiding this trump card, and did not reveal to anyone, thus nobody knew about it.\"Fang Zheng got up!\" The crowds\u2019 cheers exploded.\"He stood up!\" Clan leader was moved, uncontrollably standing up from his seat, at this moment, he saw the rise of an A grade talent! He saw the future of the Gu Yue clan!\"I stood up, brother, I will defeat you!\" Fang Zheng\u2019s eyes burned with determination, his entire body enveloped in bright green light, like he was wear a jade armor!\"Oh wow, this defense, even the moonblade can\u2019t pierce it. It seems Fang Zheng wins.\" Yao Hong raised her brows, blowing a whistle.\"Indeed, even with the little light Gu\u2019s reinforcement, hitting on this barrier, it would only cause Fang Zheng\u2019s primeval essence to be consumed faster. But comparing primeval essence expenditure, Fang Yuan is no match for Fang Zheng. After this match, Fang Zheng is going to rise!\" Qing Shu laughed lightly.\"Fang Zheng had a jade skin Gu, but only used it now. It seems Fang Yuan\u2019s earlier attacks confused him. But now, victory is already waving towards him.\" Mo Yan folded her arms, her gaze slightly uncertain.Time seem to have paused.On the stage, the brothers faced each other.The two\u2019s distance was so close yet so far.Fang Zheng\u2019s determination, Fang Yuan\u2019s aloofness.\"Little brother...\" He looked at Fang Zheng peacefully, his lips curling into a smirk: \"To defeat me, you\u2019re still far from it.\"He raised his right hand, his right arm flexing, pulling into a bow shape.\"Brother, you\u2019ve lost!\" Fang Zheng felt amused seeing Fang Yuan\u2019s fist.As long as he had primeval essence, even with the little light Gu\u2019s reinforcement, moonblade could not break the jade colour barrier, not to mention his fist? Unless he used the flower boar Gu or the brute force longhorn beetle Gu, to raise his strength. But even so, he would need a defensive type Gu\u2026...Fang Yuan did not say anything, he used his fist to reply.The next moment, the first flew in the air and harshly hit Fang Zheng on the face.Bam!After a loud crash, blood spilled as the jade light smashed to bits, like broken mirror fragments dancing in the sky, before vanishing.\"What?!\" Fang Zheng was hit by such a shock once again, after a stunned moment, his neck was almost broken as he hurriedly retreated.Fang Yuan followed up closely, using a bow step and raising his left fist, pulling back and striking again upwards!Bam!!Fang Zheng\u2019s other half of his face was hit by the impact, his head rising high up, with blood and broken jade light flying in the air.Bambambam.He took three steps backwards, his ears buzzing, and a dizziness 10 times greater than before assaulted him.\"How can this\u2026 be!\" His vision darkened, and he collapsed on the arena------Plop.Fang Zheng fell on the ground, the light dissipating on his body, fainting.The shouts and cheers came to an abrupt end.The happy, excited expressions of the students were still glued on their faces, unable to change due to such a shock.The entire arena was silent.Fang Yuan\u2019s fists were bloody, almost seeing his bloody finger bones. Drops of blood fell and dripped on the stage.Wind blows\u2026...A cold winter wind blew, freezing all the hot-bloodedness.Fang Yuan\u2019s hair wavered in the air, he stood still on the stage, almost as if the heavily injured person with both his fists almost crippled was not him!He looked coldly at the surrounding with a calm expression.Everyone was silent.In the tentage, the clan leader was still standing, staring dumbfounded.\"Sorry, I let you all down.\" Fang Yuan said lightly.(Unedited version for less patient readers)Will post 3 edited chapters tonight. 2AM atm I have work tomorrow Q_QPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUNEDITEDOn the stage, Fang Zheng fainted on the ground with no more movements from him.Fang Yuan however, continued with his cold expression, standing in the middle of the stage.After a momentary silence, the crowds erupted.\"How can this be?\" Some people hugged their heads, revealing an expression of disbelief.\"Two punches breaking the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense, this-this-this...\" Some people were tongue-tied.\"Too savage, even the jade light got smashed by him, does he not feel pain?\" Some female Gu Masters took in a chilly breath.\"Without any defensive Gu worm and using his bare hands to break the jade light, this is true blue self-harm!\" Even male Gu Masters\u2019 eyes twitched upon seeing Fang Yuan\u2019s hands, and were shocked by his ruthlessness.Being ruthless to others, that is easy, but being ruthless to yourself, that is hard.Fang Yuan using his bare hands to break the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense, it was not only savage to his younger brother, but even harsher on himself!\"I\u2019ll go take a look.\" The academy elder could no longer stand it, and after saying so, he jumped onto the stage.He first squatted down and observed the fainted Fang Zheng, sighing in relief as he found that Fang Zheng was not in a critical condition. His head just had a huge impact, causing him to fall unconscious.\"Unbelievable, with the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense, he still suffered such heavy injuries from someone using their bare hands.\" The academy elder was shocked internally, raising his head and looking at Fang Yuan, his eyes shining with a fierce light.\"Fang Yuan, I\u2019ll heal you.\" The academy elder stood up, taking a few huge strides towards Fang Yuan and grabbing his forearm.Fang Yuan\u2019s arms were in terrible condition. Not only was the blood and skin vaguely mashed, even his bones were revealed. Because of the huge impact there were also cracks on the bones.\"How intense this pain is, yet he didn\u2019t even frown a bit.\" Even if it was the academy elder, his heart shuddered seeing such injuries.His tone was complicated, saying to Fang Yuan, \"Endure it, the healing is very itchy and also very painful.\"Saying so, his five fingers spread open and emitted a wave of blue moonlight. The moonlight got brighter and caused the academy elder\u2019s right hand to be translucent from the shine.At a glance, the academy elder\u2019s entire right hand was like a piece of blue jade, the blood vessels and bones were all turned into jade.The academy elder lightly raised his right hand and covered Fang Yuan\u2019s injured fist.It was just like a piece of cold jade touching on an injury that was mashed with blood and flesh. Fang Yuan felt a heart-piercing pain, but he gritted his teeth and did not make a sound.The academy elder\u2019s hand emitted gentle moonlight and the moonlight nourished Fang Yuan\u2019s injured spot.On the bones, the cracks started to mend, and the flesh and skin started to grow rapidly and heal.Fang Yuan felt an intense itching, causing him to breathe heavily. (Academy elder x Fang Yuan)The academy elder\u2019s expression was calm, while healing Fang Yuan, he diverted a bit of his concentration towards Fang Yuan\u2019s arm, and inspected his aperture.In the aperture, the black green coloured green bronze primeval essence was raging like waves in the sea.A white and fat liquor worm was swimming and playing in the primeval sea.The four walls of the aperture, was all made of white coloured crystal walls. This showed Fang Yuan\u2019s rank 1 peak stage cultivation clearly.The academy elder did not look away, but continued to scan Fang Yuan\u2019s body.Finally, he found that on Fang Yuan\u2019s palm, there was the moonlight Gu and little light Gu.\"No other Gu worms, did Fang Yuan really use his own strength to break the defense of the jade skin Gu? Such strength, is far beyond a mortal adult, he is only 15 years old, how can he have such strength?\" The academy elder\u2019s eyes shone with suspicion.\"Clan elder, thank you for your treatment.\" Fang Yuan took back his arm from the academy elder and moved it around.Although there was still some pain, the injury had already healed. If it was on earth, such an injury would have taken a year or two to heal and would even leave some serious side effects.The was the magical aspect of this world. Now that Fang Yuan\u2019s arms were healed, although he still feels like they are weak when he waves them around and grabs with them. Seven or eight days later, the strengthless side effect would disappear.But Fang Yuan was not grateful to the academy elder. His injury could also be healed by other healing Gu masters, he was sure that the academy elder\u2019s motive was to inspect his aperture.Fang Yuan had expected this from the start, leaving the white boar and jade skin Gu in the second secret cave. As for the spring and autumn cicada, with its rank 6 status, if it wanted to hide, even the rank 4 Gu Yue Bo would not find it if he inspects personally.The academy elder did not find anything, and that caused him to frown. Although he was still suspicious in his heart, in front of so many people, he did not have the opportunity to ask.\"Fang Yuan, you performed well, continue working hard.\" Finally, the academy elder patted Fang Yuan\u2019s shoulder and declared loudly: \"This year\u2019s final exam, the first place goes to Fang Yuan!\"From the academy elder\u2019s ascension to the stage, the audience watched quietly. After hearing his announcement, they started discussing fervently.\"To think that at the end, Fang Yuan had the last laugh!\"\"He\u2019s merely a C grade, but beat the rank 2 Fang Zheng who has a jade skin Gu, did he cheat?\"\"Probably not, from the academy elder\u2019s personal treatment and probing, if he did not find any problems, Fang Yuan probably did not cheat.\"\"Fang Yuan\u2019s fists were greatly injured, that\u2019s normal. But as a 15 year old, having such strength, that way surpassed an adult, isn\u2019t it suspicious?\"\"What is there to be suspicious about? There are always people who are born with strange talents. Either super strength, or super smart, actually Fang Yuan\u2019s strength isn\u2019t that scary, think about that guy.\" The speaking Gu master indicated at the standing Chi Shan.People were immediately enlightened: \"Oh yes. When Chi Shan was still a kid, his strength was already greater than an adult, is Fang Yuan also such a monster?\"\"That has to be it. When Fang Yuan was young, he could make poems. Those poems were famous around the village back then. We thought he was an A grade, but he turned out to be C grade, but it seems heaven has other plans, and compensated him with strength.\"\"He is still a C grade anyway, if he was B grade he would be another Chi Shan. Hmph, nothing to be envious about, a Gu master\u2019s cultivation relied on their talent. If I can get a black boar Gu in the future, I would have even greater strength than him. That is nothing much, he can only be arrogant for a while.\" Some people shrugged, speaking unconcernedly.Fang Yuan walked down the stage, his eyes picking up the people\u2019s discussions and smirking coldly internally.The liquor worm\u2019s origin was already perfectly explained by Fang Yuan, but once the jade skin Gu was exposed, Fang Yuan would not be able to explain. Thus, he had to keep this secret and could not use it in public.As for these people\u2019s thoughts and explanations, it was the direction Fang Yuan wanted them to go. Or rather, even if the higher ups were suspicious, they would only be suspicious of his mysterious backer.\"Half a year ago, I risked the danger and created a second layer of protection at the wild boar\u2019s teeth camp. It is finally coming into play.\" Fang Yuan eyes were dark like the abyss.Gu Yue Clan leader did not sit down, he was standing and frowning deeply.This matter had developed out of his control.Fang Yuan getting first place, he did not give two hoots. Just a year end exam first place, it was nothing significant.He was worried about Gu Yue Fang Zheng.Undeniably, today\u2019s impact was too great on Fang Zheng.If Fang Zheng was beaten completely from the start and lost the fight, so be it. But it purposely was at the point where he used his full strength, and got a huge confidence boost, that he was sent sprawling by Fang Yuan\u2019s two fists.Such a psychological trauma might negatively impact his growth.\"Under by guidance and arrangement, Fang Zheng was the first to advance to upper stage, peak stage, and rank 2, continuously gaining success and confidence. But these confidence, they are probably gone by now. Sigh, my hard work has all gone up the smoke.\" Gu Yue Bo sighed deeply, naturally gaining a little sense of disgust towards Fang Yuan.If Fang Yuan had lost to Fang Zheng, everything would have been perfect.But he actually won, that is too\u2026 infuriating.Not only the clan leader, but the other clan elders\u2019 were also full of solemn and complex gazes.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s strength is really so huge, is he really a monster like Chi Shan?\"\"Actually, he was strange from young, making poems when he was younger than ten, his strength getting larger as he grew up, is nothing strange.\"\"But there is another possibility, that is human action. Fang Yuan has a mysterious backer, maybe the backer assisted him.\"\"But the person behind him, who could it be?\"...The clan elders\u2019 hearts were overturning, but their expressions said otherwise.Clan leader Gu Yue Bo went silent, before revealing a smile, saying: \"Fang Yuan, getting first place with a C grade talent, this is an unprecedented grand feat! Becoming first place, you have 100 primeval essence as reward, and also Gu worm choosing priority. Now, I shall reward you further, you can choose any small group you want and join it. Regardless of the group, whichever one you want, just say it and you can join!\"Upon saying so, all the rank 2 Gu masters and students stared at Fang Yuan in envy.Small groups had their difference too, joining a good group meant a bright future. Gu Yue Bo\u2019s reward was very generous.\"Although I made this decision on the spot, I believe the clan elders here would agree with me.\" Gu Yue Bo smiled even more intensely, looking at the clan elders beside him.With Gu Yue Chi Lian, Gu Yue Mo Chen as the head of the clan elders, all of their faces were grim, and some even frowned, but did not stop him.Fang Yuan\u2019s heart jumped.Trouble had come.UNEDITED (Editing now, then tomorrow I will post up to chapter 92 (total 9 chapters)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Attitude is the mask of the heartTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowFang Yuan could see the intentions behind such an action, this was a small probing (test) from the clan leader.His gaze swept through the arena, the entire clan\u2019s best performing three groups were here. The clan leader\u2019s faction\u2019s Qing Shu group, Chi faction\u2019s Chi Shan group, and Mo faction\u2019s Mo Yan group.If it was a regular student, joining any of the three groups meant getting a huge backer, representing a bright future.But to Fang Yuan, it was the reverse.In the clan\u2019s higher-up\u2019s perception, he was already part of a mysterious faction. Joining any of the three spelt trouble.For example, if he joined the Chi Shan faction, the Chi family obviously know they did not recruit him, so their first thought would be \u2014 Fang Yuan is a pawn of another family, but now that he\u2019s joining our group, what intentions does he have?Next they would think \u2014 The mysterious faction that recruited Fang Yuan earlier had already broken the rules, and now that Fang Yuan is present here, the clan leader would think that we were the ones who recruited him, so isn\u2019t this \u2018carrying the fault\u2019 for them? That will not do, we have to arrest Fang Yuan, keep a close eye on him and investigate him! We shall find concrete evidence and reveal the mysterious backer of his.But the truth was, Fang Yuan has no backer!\"Once I join any of the three groups, it means I am offending one out of the three biggest factions in this clan. That will definitely not do! Sigh, I originally wanted to keep a low profile and join Jiang He\u2019s group, but Jiang He\u2019s group is backed by the punishment hall elder. Under everyone\u2019s watchful eye, if I join abruptly, that is inappropriate as well.\" Fang Yuan inevitably hesitated.Gu Yue Bo\u2019s smile became even more intense, continuing, \"Fang Yuan, if you don\u2019t choose, I\u2019ll select for you.\"The clan elders beside him watched quietly with an unmoving expression, each of them standing like statues.\"Hmph, forcing me?\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone, immediately guessing Gu Yue Bo\u2019s next words \u2014 either throwing him to Chi Shan\u2019s group or Mo Yan\u2019s group.Gu Yue Bo knew in his heart that he did not recruit Fang Yuan. To him, this act can not only remove suspicion on him but also weaken his foe, as well as reveal the mysterious faction; it was killing three birds with one stone. It was a play that could divert the problem away \u2014 although seemingly simple, it was a strategic move showing Gu Yue Bo\u2019s experienced political ability.\"No, I must not let him dictate it. It seems I can only choose a crappy group.\" Fang Yuan was about to open his mouth and speak.Suddenly at this moment, someone spoke, \"Why don\u2019t you join our team. Our group is lacking an attacker.\"Who said that?At once, everyone turned around towards the source of the voice.The person speaking was neither tall or short, with dark yellow skin that made him look sickly. A pair of triangular eyes shone with brilliance.\"It\u2019s the sickly snake Gu Yue Jiao San(1).\" Someone pointed out his identity.\"Gu Yue Jiao San? It\u2019s just a trash team with no background!\" The clan leader and clan elders all showed a disappointed expression.\"Jiao San...\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone with an undetectable dark shine.He and this Gu Yue Jiao San person had never met or spoken before, and he had no memories of such a person.Why did Jiao San open his mouth and invite him into his team? Was it purely because he had gotten first place in the examination?How can that be!Only someone as childish as Fang Zheng would have such a naive thought.But\u2026...Since Jiao San opened his mouth and invited Fang Yuan personally, such a situation was a good breakthrough point.\"The clan\u2019s higher-ups must be very disappointed now. Hehe.\" Fang Yuan smiled thinking of this, his eyes looking downwards, hiding the brilliance in his expression.\"Then I\u2019ll join your group,\" Fang Yuan agreed on the spot, blocking Gu Yue Bo\u2019s upcoming words.\"Is this Fang Yuan retarded?\"\"Ignoring those top performing groups and joining the sickly snake\u2019s group!\"\"He must be bonkers, Jiao San\u2019s personality, hehehe...\"The students and Gu Masters started to discuss, looking at Fang Yuan like he was a fool.The clan leaders and elders\u2019 expression turned dim.Today\u2019s probing was thwarted by this Gu Yue Jiao San! No... Maybe this Jiao San is also a pawn in this game, but no matter what, they must investigate on this Gu Yue Jiao San!Three days later.It had already been snowing for a day, and now that it was gradually getting smaller, pieces of snowflakes flew in the air gliding with the wind.On Qing Mao mountain, there was a layer of white colour over it. Many branches were naked with no leaves, except the evergreen pine trees and Qing Mao bamboo, which had retained their original colours standing proudly in the snow.A group of five people ran in the snow.The leading person was neither short nor tall, bearing a sickly yellow skin \u2014 it was Gu Yue Jiao San.As he ran, he turned towards the quiet Fang Yuan, smiling gently with kindness, \"Fang Yuan, don\u2019t be nervous. Although this is your first clan mission, the contents are simple. Just follow us and learn along the way.\"\"Yes,\" Fang Yuan lightly replied, staring forward with a solemn expression.It was already winter.Running on the snow, the chilly winter winds were even more intense. Every breath was like eating snow dust, chilling his entire chest.Fang Yuan\u2019s face was originally very white, and now that the snow shone on it, it appeared even more pale. In the process of running, the snow kept falling on his short black hair, his shoulders and forehead.What was different than before was that Fang Yuan had changed his clothes.This was a dark blue coloured battle attire.The attire had long sleeves and long pants, with bamboo sheet tied on his legs as wrappings, and bamboo shoes adorned his feet. On his head there was a bright blue headband, and the headband fluttered in the air as Fang Yuan ran.On his waist, there was a loose belt.The belt was navy blue with a bronze plate on it, carved with the number \"1\"; it was very much eye-striking.This was a Gu Master\u2019s attire, showing Fang Yuan\u2019s status as a Rank one Gu Master.The youngsters had to stay a year in the academy and graduate before they were allowed to wear this.This attire had much meaning. Once worn it meant that one has transcended the realm of mortals, leaving the lowly life and stepping into the upper society, being the middle class of the entire human race. Even if Rank one Gu Masters were the bottom of this tier, from now on any mortal had to give way to Fang Yuan and pay respects to him.Gu Yue Jiao San\u2019s gaze continued to shine. This battle attire when worn by Fang Yuan, coupled with his cold expression, showed the atmosphere of a cool and collected person.While running, he continued asking Fang Yuan, \"We are out on a mission, and normally we would have to rush when travelling, so running is a common thing. Are you used to it?\"\"I can cope.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s words were precious like gold, using the corner of his eye to look at Gu Yue Jiao San.Jiao San\u2019s warm and kind expression caused him to think about the legend of Ren Zu.Words have it that Ren Zu used the Rules and Regulation Gu and obtained strength but lost wisdom, leaving behind three Gu worms. One was Suspicion, one was Trust, and another was Attitude.Ren Zu grabbed the Attitude Gu.Attitude Gu followed the betting rules, submitting to Ren Zu, telling him, \"Human, you caught me, I can only curse my bad luck. From now on, I will be at your command. Wear me and you will be able to use my ability.\"Attitude Gu\u2019s appearance was like a mask. Ren Zu put it on his face, but in the end he could not wear it. Even if he used a rope to tie it, it would still fall off.\"What\u2019s going on?\" Ren Zu was troubled.Attitude Gu laughed, \"I know, human, you have no heart. Attitude is the mask of the heart, so without a heart, how can you wear me?\"Ren Zu realised at once, he had already given his heart to hope.He was heartless.Someone who is heartless cannot wear the attitude mask. In other words, to someone with a heart/an intention, their attitude is a mask.\"This kind and warm attitude is only Gu Yue Jiao San\u2019s mask, what is his real intention?\" Fang Yuan pondered.While the person \"sickly snake\" Jiao San observed Fang Yuan, Fang Yuan was also secretly observing him.(1)Gu Yue Jiao Shan - His name Jiao Shan means three angles. Probably referring to his triangular eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the snow, five small groups were running.Gu Yue Jiao San looked at the sky, saying, \"The sky's getting dark, our mission this time is to collect \u2018permafrost decayed soil\u2019. Although it is easy, it consumes too much time. We have to speed up, everyone follow me, try not to get left behind. Fang Yuan, if you are unable to keep up, just inform us. Don\u2019t worry, you are a newcomer, we will take care of you.\"Gu Yue Jiao San smiled very amicably.Fang Yuan nodded silently.The other three members exchanged glances. The sky was actually still bright, Jiao San had no need to say this. In reality, he wanted to give Fang Yuan an initial display of authority.The three knew this deep down, but did not expose him.In actuality, these kind of authoritative displays were common. When a new member joins, the older members would usually exert their authority to get rid of the younger member\u2019s arrogance so that it would be easier to command and control them.\"Let\u2019s go.\" Jiao San said lightly, taking huge steps and being the first to rush out.Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone, heading out with the same speed as the other three, following closely behind.The bamboo shoes stepped on the snow, leaving behind traces of footprints.The mountain road was full of obstacles, being difficult to manoeuvre. Especially with a layer of thick snow, it was even easier to fall down. At the same time, due to the snow cover, who knew if underneath it was sharp rocks or pitfalls?If one stepped on a hunter\u2019s trap, they would be even more unlucky.Living in this world was tough. Travelling seemed easy but in fact it had much to do with experience. Many newcomers suffered due to this.Only through a long period of training, having going through much hardship, a Gu Master that has accumulated much experience would be able to avoid these obstacles.The chilly winter winds blew directly towards their faces as Fang Yuan strode through the snow.At times he took small leaps, at time he ran long distances. Sometimes he sidestepped, sometimes he climbed, following closely behind Jiao San.The entire Qing Mao was covered by a layer of snow coat, and many of the trees had naked branches, without a single leaf.At times, squirrels or wild deer were frightened by these people and ran away quickly.Thirty minutes later, Jiao San stopped in his tracks as he had reached his destination.He turned over his head, looking at Fang Yuan, smiling, and praising, \"Good job! You truly are this year\u2019s champion, following behind me and not losing your pace once.\"Fang Yuan smiled silently. This kind of authoritative display, he was clear of it. In fact, sprinting in the snow had become a \"traditional event\". Many small groups used this to suppress the newcomer\u2019s arrogance.The two stood on the spot and waited, until the remaining three members arrived.Puff, huff, puff\u2026...They took deep breaths, their foreheads full of sweat, their faces red as they placed their hands on their waits, the last members plopping on the ground.Jiao San harshly stared at them, barking, \"Stand straight! Haven\u2019t you embarrassed us enough? Look at Fang Yuan, then look at yourselves. Hmph, after this mission, go back and reflect on yourselves.\"The three immediately stood up straight, but lowered their heads. They were chided by Jiao San until they did not dare to raise their heads or rebuke him.Only their gaze towards Fang Yuan changed.\"How strange, how can this Fang Yuan be so experienced? I did not see him fall even once!\"\"Sigh, we only have normal strength, how can we compete with this monster?\"\"Hmph, not only did we not get a show to watch, we even became the sacrificial lambs. This guy...\"\"Enough, buck up.\" Jiao San pointed forward, \"This small-sized valley is our destination. Inside, there are large amounts of permafrost decayed soil for us to collect. Let\u2019s split up here and harvest the frozen earth. An hour later, we will gather here. Kong Jing, distribute the tools.\"Jiao San had just spoken, and the male member called Gu Yue Kong Jing stood up.He opened his palm wide and a yellow light shot out from the aperture in his abdomen, landing on his palm.The yellow light dispersed, showing its true form. A frog with a golden back.This golden frog was plump with a giant snow white belly, causing its entire body to look like a ball when inflated. The frog\u2019s mouth and eyes were all at the top of its head due to this belly, being squeezed into a spot.Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze shone, recognising this Gu worm.This was the Rank two Gu worm \u2014 Large Belly Frog.Soon after, Kong Jing\u2019s hands emitted traces of red steel primeval essence, and were absorbed by the frog.Ribbit.The Large Belly Frog screeched, opening its mouth to vomit out a steel spade.The steel spade flew in the sky, turning large quickly. In the blink of an eye, it landed on the ground, becoming a large steel spade half the size of a person.Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit\u2026...It called for several times, throwing up a tool each time.Eventually, the snow field in front of everyone had five steel spades, and five wooden boxes. The wooden boxes all had two ropes for carrying.Gu master feeding Gu worms was a large burden. Thus, Gu worms were limited in numbers. During the initial stages, it was hard to single-handedly deal with different environments, and with different intensity of troubles, Gu Masters thus often worked in groups.In a small group, there was someone doing reconnaissance, someone for offence, someone in charge of defence, someone healing, and someone as logistics support.The Gu Master who stood up, Kong Jing, was a logisctics support Gu Master. He controlled this Large Belly Frog, which was a support Gu worm, where its belly had another space that could be used as storage space.Of course, every Gu had its strengths and weaknesses.The Large Belly Frog\u2019s weakness was that not only was the storage space limited, every time it vomited an item, it had to croak once, and this was irritating. Especially when a Gu Master is hiding in the battlefield, if handled poorly, it would reveal one\u2019s location.Another thing was, the Large Belly Frog could not store Gu worms, and it was not immune to poison, unable to store poisonous objects.After distributing the tools, each of the group members had a steel spade and a box in their hands.\"Let\u2019s set off,\" Jiao San waved his hand, leading the party into the valley.Fang Yuan held the steel spade and carried the wooden box, choosing another direction.\"He is after all a newbie, rushing in like that. Hehe.\"\"Is the permafrost decayed soil so easy to harvest? If he cannot differentiate it, he might get normal frozen earth, wasting his efforts.\"\"The truth is, it is really difficult to differentiate. The permafrost decayed soil\u2019s colour is around the same as normal frozen earth, especially under the cover of all the accumulated snow, so newbies can only dig relying on their luck.\"The three members seeing Fang Yuan\u2019s backview, laughed internally.An hour later, they saw that Fang Yuan returned with an entire box of permafrost decayed soil, and were all stunned.Including Jiao San, all their wooden boxes were only half-filled with permafrost decayed soil.Seeing Fang Yuan\u2019s wooden box, they were almost ashamed to show their results.\"It is all permafrost decayed soil!\" A member observed carefully and was even more shocked.\"Fang Yuan, how did you gather so much frozen earth?\" A female member could not hold in her curiosity and asked.Fang Yuan\u2019s brows raised, and the snowlight shone on his iris, showing a clear and transparent gaze.He laughed lightly, \"The academy elder said before, the permafrost decayed soil is a fertilizer created when the snow freezes the swamp. It has a tint of purple in the blackness, and is actually very smelly, but because it is frozen by the snow, it cannot be smelled. It is the Smelly Fart Fatworm\u2019s food. At the same time it is also very fertile, often mixed in soil to grow crops, fruits and vegetables. The clan sending out this mission, is probably because they want to use it in the underground cave and fertilize the moon orchid flowers.\"His words caused the four to be frozen on the spot.\"These theories are obviously learnt in the academy. But theory and reality is very difficult to be linked. Has Fang Yuan collected permafrost decayed soil before?\" The three members looked at each other in shock.Gu Yue Jiao San\u2019s gaze shone, saying, \"Good job Fang Yuan.\"As he praised, his usual warm and kind smile became a little forced.Jiao San turned around, saying to the rest, \"This way, our mission is completed. Everyone pass your spades and boxes to Kong Jing, and let\u2019s return.\"When they got back to the village, it was already afternoon.The five walked out of the internal affairs hall, Jiao San distributing the six primeval stones they earned. He got two pieces, while the rest of the members got one.The primeval stones were so easily earned, so the members all broke into a smile.Fang Yuan kept his primeval stone stealthily.Only in his heart did he think, \"When a newcomer joins a small group, the clan would usually give a large reward for the mission as a form of supporting the newcomer. Collecting the permafrost decayed soil mission, the reward was at most two primeval stones, but because of me there were three times more. According to logic, I should have gotten more stones. If the snow sprinting was an authoritative display, then having us purposely collect the frozen soil alone was a sign of picking on me, and the distribution of primeval stones is suppression already.\"One or two primeval was not a concern for Fang Yuan. He was only wondering strangely \u2014 he and Gu Yue Jiao San never had any interactions, so why was he suppressing him?\"Unless...\" An inspiration struck Fang Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems we did a correct thing inviting you to join us. You have just graduated from the academy, and might be unclear of some things. Let me introduce you to them.\"\"Firstly, the clan missions, each Gu Master must complete at least one a month. The more you complete and the more perfect it is, the higher your evaluation.\"\"Secondly, the missions are distributed by the internal affairs hall or the external affair hall, each Gu Master can only accept one. Once accepted, they must complete it.\"\"Thirdly, under special conditions, a Gu Master may choose to abandon a mission, but that will cause their evaluation to fall greatly. At the same time, Rank one Gu Masters have no rights to give up, and only Rank two Gu Masters do. But they can only abandon one mission a year.\"\"Fourth, the clan\u2019s evaluation is very important. It concerns your future in the clan, and the higher your evaluation, the greater your future and the brighter it is.\"Fang Yuan listened, nodding. These things were already memorized by him. Gu Yue Jiao San was right and did not misdirect him, but many key contents were not spoken.\"Alright, the permafrost decayed soil\u2019s mission has just been completed. Next, I accepted a wild deer hunting mission. The danger is low, so it is suitable for you to practice.\" Jiao San said to Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan laughed coldly in his heart, but said, \"Thank you for your concern, group leader.\"Gu Yue Kong Jing immediately followed up, \"Little brother Fang Yuan, you should really properly thank the group leader. Although simple missions are easily completed, they have little reward. The group leader's actions are to take care of you.\"The other two female Gu Masters also spoke, \"Yeah, yeah, little brother Fang Yuan, action speaks louder than words. Why don\u2019t you thank the group leader by treating him to lunch.\"\"Little brother Fang Yuan, you just left the academy, society is complicated. Human relationship is very important. If you don\u2019t know anything, just ask us during lunch.\"Gu Yue Jiao San laughed, purposely waving his hand, \"Don\u2019t put him in a spot, he just left the academy, he must be tight on primeval stones.\"\"How can that be! Besides, just being the first place in the year end exam gave him a hundred primeval stones as reward right?\" A female Gu Master purposely said, and then showed an expression of envy, \"I\u2019m really envious of you, a hundred primeval stones is a huge sum even to us.\"\"Group leader, you\u2019ve mistaken our little brother Fang Yuan. How can he be so stingy. Am I right, little brother Fang Yuan?\" Gu Yue Kong Jing laughed heartily, as if he was very happy.Another female Gu Master got nearer to Fang Yuan, as if they had a close relationship, saying, \" Little brother Fang Yuan, a word of advice. You can choose not to suck up to us, but the group leader, you have to. You know, our group\u2019s evaluation has a portion written by the group leader. If he says you\u2019re outstanding, you\u2019re outstanding. If he says you performed badly, it means you really performed badly.\"\"That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Evaluation is very important to us Gu Masters, we need at least an outstanding evaluation to be noticed by the higher-ups. In the future where we have sufficient achievements, we would be able to work for several years less!\" Kong Jing immediately followed up.Throughout the entire process, Gu Yue Jiao San was smiling and watching.Finally he waved his hand with a kind expression and laughingly said, \"Ah, don\u2019t speak nonsense. I am always impartial when writing my evaluation, and will not be easily bribed by you. But don\u2019t worry Fang Yuan, you are a newcomer, so now that you\u2019re in our group, I will take good care of your evaluation.\"If it were a normal teenager, they would\u2019ve been led by the nose by these few people, feeling touched secretly. They are bullying a newcomer\u2019s ignorance and naivety.But Fang Yuan\u2019s iris was calm as the sea.Group leader being involved in the member\u2019s evaluation, that was the truth. This is the clan\u2019s system, giving the authority to the group leader, so that they can manage each small group.But it is not as severe as these people said.For the clan evaluation, the group leader\u2019s evaluation is only a very small portion, and it is still mostly attributed to the clan\u2019s internal affairs hall.Or rather, even if the group leader had a great influence on it, so what?Fang Yuan didn\u2019t give a damn about the evaluation.He had already decided \u2014 quickly raise his cultivation, reach Rank three, and then leave this place. He had never thought of staying in this clan for over a hundred years to slog his life away.To these ignorant and lowly peasants, the evaluation was the most important thing. But to Fang Yuan, it was lower than dog shit!Thus, their somewhat threatening tone was of no use to Fang Yuan.\"I understand what you all have said. I still have something on, so I\u2019ll take my leave,\" Fang Yuan after being quiet for a while, said.Eh?At once, the four Gu Masters showed a shocked expression.\"What is the meaning of this? Did you not hear what we said earlier?\" A female Gu Master stared with her eyes wide, screaming in her heart.\"Is your comprehension ability really okay?\" Gu Yue Kong Jing at this moment, really wanted to grab Fang Yuan by the collar and ask him.Jiao San\u2019s mouth twitched.Fang Yuan\u2019s indifference caused their self-directed performance to look like a joke. It made the scheme that they set up become a laughingstock.Seeing Fang Yuan turning around and walking away, the fury in his heart blazed on.\"Come on Fang Yuan, don\u2019t leave so quickly, don\u2019t listen to their nonsense.\" Jiao San controlled his temper and conjured a smile, quickly chasing up and blocking Fang Yuan, \"You\u2019re going to rent a house right? Let us go with you. I have some personal relations, I am more familiar with the rental situation.\"\"I am indeed going to rent a house, I can\u2019t stay at the hostel anymore, do you have any ideas?\" Fang Yuan raised his eyebrows, asking calmly.\"I know a few houses that are considerably cheap, and with good location.\" Jiao San smiled, leading the way....\"My house, fifteen primeval stones a month, no second price.\"\"Pfft, renting my house with eight primeval stones? In your dreams.\"\"You must pay a deposit, 25% deposit. Other vendors are doing this too.\"\"My house has good Feng Shui, and its quiet at night. More importantly, it is facing the clan leader\u2019s pavilion, you know how good the location is. It is really cheap, only twenty-five primeval stones a month.\"All the way until night time, Fang Yuan did not find a house to stay.\"Little brother Fang Yuan, you\u2019re too stingy. The village is only so big, the prices are all like this.\"\"In my opinion, you should get the house near the clan leader\u2019s pavilion, the second floor is very spacious and the scenery is nice. Little brother Fang Yuan, don\u2019t be so thrifty, it is only twenty-five primeval stones. The reward that you got is enough for you to stay four months.\"The two female Gu Masters continued to urge him on with ill intent.Fang Yuan shook his head, \"I do not have many primeval stones, I cannot be wasteful.\"\"Then rent an underground apartment, it\u2019s cheaper.\" Gu Yue Kong Jing\u2019s eyes shone with cold brilliance, suggesting.Fang Yuan snorted in his heart, this Kong Jing has such a vile heart!The village is already high in precipitation, and now that it is winter, the underground apartments would have poor airflow, and tenants would easily catch a cold. Even if there aren\u2019t diseases, it would cause problems in the long term.Seeing that Fang Yuan kept his silence, Jiao San said, \"Actually the big hall\u2019s first floor is good too. Co-staying with other people causes the rent to reduce as well.Fang Yuan shook his head, \"I want to stay alone, I do not like to stay with others.\"Gu Yue Kong Jing snorted, saying unhappily, \"You don\u2019t want this, you don\u2019t want that. I\u2019m not trying to scold you, little brother Fang Yuan, but you\u2019re too picky and expect too much. With such high standards, it is not realistic.\"Fang Yuan listened, laughing coldly in his heart while thinking, \"Even if they fulfil the criteria, I would not accept any house you recommend.\"His act of pacifying them was just for the sake of being careful, finding out if there are any traps.Just as Fang Yuan was about to leave, Mother Shen appeared.\"Young master Fang Yuan, I finally found you. The academy can no longer be stayed at, and the old master and his wife have already prepared a banquet, specifically asking me to invite you home. Staying at home is so much better, there is no need for you to go about renting houses outside,\" She urged.Finally here\u2026...Fang Yuan laughed coldly in his heart, this Mother Shen really found a good time. Finding him here at once, someone must have notified her!Just as he had expected, the masterminds were his uncle and aunt!And Jiao San was the chain that his uncle and aunt created to bind him.Fang Yuan\u2019s silence looked like hesitation.\"Fang Yuan, why don\u2019t you stay at your uncle and aunt's house, why make life difficult? Renting a house will spend a lot of primeval stones.\" Gu Yue Jiao San spoke in a \u2018concerned\u2019 manner at an appropriate juncture as he looked at Fang Yuan, his eyes shining ominously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: It\u2019s just a little wind frostTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowIn the hall, the lights shone brightly.On the round dining table, the wine was already cold, and the dishes were cool.The brilliant red candle flickered and danced, projecting the shadows of Aunt and Uncle onto the wall.The two figures\u2019 shadow combined into one, and swayed gloomily with the candlelight.In front of them, Mother Shen was kneeling.Uncle broke the silence, \"To think this Fang Yuan is dead bent on going against me. Sigh, I wanted to calm him down with nice words and keep him in the house first before finding a reason to chase him out of the house. To think that he did not fall for it! He has made up his mind, rejecting my invitation without a single way to negotiate! Not even taking a step into my house!\"Aunt gritted her teeth, her expression slightly flustered, \"This scoundrel is already sixteen years old, so if he wants the family fortune now we cannot deny it to him. Years ago we obtained that family fortune and it was clearly recorded in the inner affairs hall. Now that we cannot deny it, what shall we do now?!\"\"Leave first.\" Uncle waved at Mother Shen to withdraw, laughing coldly, \"Don\u2019t be anxious. Throughout the year, I have already been planning for this. First, to get back the assets, he needs to have Rank one middle stage cultivation. He already achieved this and is even at peak stage, and gotten number one in the exam, that is very impressive. Hehe...\"\"But, to successfully obtain his family fortune, it is not so easy! Rank one middle stage cultivation is only a pre-condition. To split the assets, Fang Yuan has to apply for it, and the internal affairs hall has to approve it and send him a mission to test if he has the qualifications. This is to prevent the clan from splitting family assets nonsensically, causing internal strifes and weakening the clan.\"Aunt was enlightened, \"This means that, he has to complete the mission before he can get his parents\u2019 inheritance.\"\"That\u2019s right.\" Uncle laughed sinisterly, \"But the internal affairs hall\u2019s missions are sent to groups. The family asset mission will be the same. If Fang Yuan wants to complete it, he would have to rely on the group, he cannot do it alone. The family does this to make sure that the small groups stay united and increase their cohesiveness.\"Aunt laughed loudly, \"Husband, you\u2019re too smart. Getting Jiao San to recruit Fang Yuan \u2014 this way, if Fang Yuan wants to accomplish the mission, he would need their strength. But Jiao San is on our side, so Fang Yuan can never accomplish this mission.\"Uncle\u2019s eyes shone smugly, \"Hmph, even if he cannot get him into the group, I have other ways to deal with him. Not to mention completing the mission, even if he wants to apply for the splitting of the fortune and receive the mission, it might not be possible!\"\u2026Nightfall arrived and the snow stopped.Fang Yuan walked on the streets. The bamboo houses along the way were all covered by a layer of white snow.The snow that he stepped on emitted a light sound. The cold air entered his respiratory system, causing Fang Yuan\u2019s brain to be extremely awake.After rejecting Mother Shen, Fang Yuan disregarded Jiao San and the group\u2019s advice and said goodbye to everyone, leaving by himself.\"So that's it.\" He walked and thought, \"Uncle and Aunt are trying to trap and delay me, causing me to lose the chance to take back my inheritance.\"\"After the new year, I would be sixteen years old and be qualified to split the assets. My parents are dead, and my brother has new parents. If I am successful, the entire inheritance is mine. But to take back the inheritance, there are two crucial steps, each being extremely important.\"\"The first is to apply for the mission at the internal affairs hall without any other missions at hand. The second is to complete the mission to earn the rights to inherit the asset.\"\"Jiao San is in cahoots with Uncle and Aunt. Leaving aside the second step, he\u2019s already trying to trap me at the first step.\"The clan rules state that Gu Masters can only be on one mission at a time. This is to prevent Gu Masters from hogging and causing negative competition in the clan.Jiao San received missions consecutively. After finishing the permafrost decayed soil mission, he immediately accepted a new mission for catching wild deer.The clan\u2019s missions were all given to groups, that is to say, according to clan rules, Fang Yuan has to finish the deer capturing mission before applying for his asset splitting mission.\"But at that point, I believe Jiao San would just accept another new mission. As the leader, when accepting missions, he will always be a step ahead of me, causing me to be unable to accept my mission, thus always stopping me.\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone ominously.These plots and schemes were irritating, like an invisible rope blocking Fang Yuan\u2019s progress.But Fang Yuan did not regret entering this group.At the arena, he was backed into a corner. Jiao San\u2019s invitation became a way for him to be free from the predicament.If he did not enter the team, his uncle and aunt would have other ways to deal with him, this cannot be prevented and will be hard to defend against. But now that he is in the group, he can clearly see their schemes and easily counterattack.\"Solving this problem, I have my ways. The easiest way is to just eliminate Jiao San, or assassinate uncle and aunt, then no one would compete with me over the family assets. But this way is too risky, they are all Rank two Gu Masters and my cultivation is still too low. Even if I kill them I cannot get out of the troublesome aftermath. Unless there is a good chance for me to take advantage of... but these chances are usually by luck.\"Fang Yuan could kill the servant Gao Wan and could kill old man Wang, but that was because they were mortals and servants, with life cheap as grass. Killing them was akin to killing a dog or pulling off weed, it was insignificant.But assassinating Gu Masters is very troublesome.Gu Masters were all Gu Yue clansmen, no matter which one dies, the punishment hall would investigate. Fang Yuan evaluated his own strength and knew there was too much risk in killing them now; he might even get killed. Even if he kills them, the punishment hall\u2019s investigation is even more troublesome. His future actions would be spied on and they might even find out the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance.\"Attracting a much larger problem when eliminating a small problem, that is not what a wise person does. Oh? I\u2019m here,\" Fang Yuan spoke lightly, stopping at a worn out bamboo building.This bamboo building was torn and worn out, like an old man about to die, panting for his last breath in the cold harsh winter.Seeing this bamboo building, Fang Yuan\u2019s face showed a trace of reminiscence.This was the room he rented in his previous life.In his previous life, after being thrown out by his uncle and aunt, he had less than fifteen primeval stones left and had to sleep in the streets for a few days before finding this place.This place was too worn out and had much lower rent than other places. In addition, while other places counted the rent by months, this place calculated it by days.\"I do not know about other places, whether or not they have uncle and aunt\u2019s traps. But my previous life\u2019s memories tell me that at least this place is safe.\" Fang Yuan rang on the door.After half an hour, he established the renting terms and was brought to the second floor by the owner.The floors were old, emitting dangerous and concerning sounds when stepped on.The room had only one bed, and a blanket. The blanket had many patches but was still riddled with some holes, and the yellow cotton wadding leaked out from inside.The head of the bed had an oil lamp. The landlord left after lighting the lamp.Fang Yuan did not sleep, but sat on the bed and started cultivating.As his primeval sea raged on in the aperture, every drop of primeval essence was black green.The aperture\u2019s four walls were a white crystal colour, in a translucent state.Rank one peak stage.Suddenly, the green bronze primeval sea started to have currents, like wild beasts raging and suiciding towards the four aperture walls.Bam bam bam...The huge waves crashed onto the aperture walls, causing the little ripples to break into small droplets before dissipating.After a while, the 44% primeval essence sea was quickly expended, with large amounts of primeval essence used up.On the sturdy aperture walls, there was lines of cracks.But just cracks were not enough.Fang Yuan wanted to break through Rank one peak stage and reach Rank two, thus he needed to break this aperture wall completely, evolving through its destruction!Black green primeval essence continued to attack the crystal wall, and the cracks increased, forming a giant piece. At some places, the cracks were even deeper, forming very evident lines.As he used up the primeval essence, he did not continue to use primeval essence to attack, and the crystal walls started to heal, causing the cracks to vanish.Fang Yuan was not surprised, collecting his spirits and opening his eyes.The oil lamp had gone out already. There was not much oil anyway.The room was dark, with only the window providing a little bit of light through the crack.The room had no firepit and was not warm. Fang Yuan had sat on the bed for a long time without moving, and felt that the chilliness had intensified.His dark iris fused with the darkness.\"To breakthrough Jiao San\u2019s lock, there is an easier and safer method. That is to advance to Rank two! Rank one Gu masters have no right to give up on missions, but Rank 2 Gu masters can do it once a year. If I advance to Rank two, I can give up on my mission and apply for the asset splitting.\"\"But to breakthrough to Rank two, it is not an easy task.\" Thinking of this, Fang Yuan sighed. Coming down from his bed, he strolled in the tiny room.From initial stage to middle stage, middle stage to upper stage, these are all small realms. From Rank one peak stage to Rank two initial stage, that is breaking through a large realm. Between these two cases there was an extremely different difficulty.Simply put, to break the crystal wall, it needed explosive strength, forming a strong impact in a short time to smash the wall.But Fang Yuan only had C grade talent, and the primeval sea is only at 44%. If he used his entire force to attack the wall, his primeval essence would be used up immediately.Just like earlier, after his primeval essence was exhausted, he would no longer have the strength to continue. And the wall had recovery ability, so before long, it would heal up. Whatever Fang Yuan did earlier would have been wasted.\"Breaking the wall and reaching Rank two without special situations, one needs 55% black green primeval essence. But my talent is limited, having only 44%, thus people say that talent is the key in a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation!\"Thinking of this, Fang Yuan slowed in his steps.Unknowingly, he had moved to the window, thus he opened the windows casually.Every gust of wind shook the bamboo lattice window, and when opened the snow-covered mountain greets one\u2019s eye. (1)Under the moonlight, the snow was like white jade, spreading out and letting the world resemble a crystal palace before one\u2019s eyes, untainted by dust.The snowlight shone onto Fang Yuan\u2019s youthful features. His expression was peaceful and calm, his brow smooth, his pair of orbs looking like the ancient spring underneath the moon.As the cold winds blew onto his face, the young man laughed, \"It is merely a small bit of wind frost(2).\"(1) This is a line from a poem.(2) Just a little wind frost: non-literal sense refers to hardship/obstacles. A pun to the obstacles that he is facing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he lived there for long, the chill would enter his body and cause him to get sick.Fang Yuan\u2019s primeval stones were already half-used up, but he still had to purchase the necessary equipment. He could not scrimp on these things.Firstly was a blanket, he had to get a large blanket stuffed with cotton, or at least two. He also needed bed sheets and a mattress.He needed another oil lamp so that it could illuminate the room, and he needed at least two pots of lamp oil.Thinking about it, although the room was small, it could still hold a table and a chair, thus he bought those as well.Most importantly, it was a stove.In the winter, if he did not have a stove to warm himself when sleeping in the room, he would still get shocked awake by the cold.Other than these, he also bought some dry rations and some water to last around seven days\u2019 worth.The winter sun slowly rose, giving out languid rays of light.Gu Yue Jiao San and the other Gu Masters stood at the North door of the village, waiting anxiously.\"Something\u2019s not right. Last night we agreed to meet at this time and place. But it has already been fifteen minutes, and this Fang Yuan still hasn\u2019t shown up?\" A female Gu Master asked.\"Calm down and just wait. It is inevitable that a newcomer is late,\" Jiao Sao laughed. He had been fretting over not having any reasons to fault Fang Yuan with, but to think he faltered on the second day.\"Never mind that we are waiting. Even the group leader has to wait for him, this lad thinks too much of himself!\" Gu Yue Kong Jing complained, his tone indignant.Half an hour later, Fang Yuan was still nowhere to be found.Jiao San\u2019s face was darker than night.\"This scumbag, did he remember the wrong location? We said clearly that we are meeting at the northern door,\" Kong Jing said suspiciously.\"I\u2019ll wait here, you guys go look around the different doors,\" Jiao San instructed, and the three obliged.Fifteen minutes later, they returned with no fruit.\"Did this Fang Yuan see through our ploy and left the group directly?\" A female Gu Master asked.\"You think too highly of him. Even if he is the first place in the year end exam, he is still a young newbie. His age is apparent.\" Kong Jing said.Jiao San\u2019s face was grim, \"It is secondary to whether he has seen through us. The crucial thing is to find him now. I am afraid that he has left us behind and is trying to breakthrough to Rank two on his own. Once he reaches Rank two, he can abandon this mission and apply for the splitting of assets from the internal affairs hall. Find him, go and find him! The village is only so big and there are only that many rental houses, we must find him and not give him the time to breakthrough to Rank two!\"\"Yes!\"\u2026...In the room, Fang Yuan sat on the bed.In front of him were a few money bags, and inside them was all primeval stones.\"Not enough primeval stones,\" Fang Yuan sighed, his expression grim.Primeval stones are the driving force behind a Gu Master\u2019s advancement, and if they are lacking, the Gu Masters would need to rely on their own recovery speed for primeval essence, which would greatly reduce their cultivation speed. At the same time, without sufficient food, the Gu worms would die of hunger.Fang Yuan\u2019s primeval stones, during his time at the academy, it had reached the peak of being slightly above a thousand. But it could not stand up to the expenditure over time.A same stage Gu Master up till now, only has three Gu worms.But Fang Yuan, after getting number one in the year end exam, entered the Gu hall and chose another Little Light Gu for free.He must choose, for if he gave up, it would invite suspicion.Like this, he had seven Gu worms on hand!Undeniably, this was a huge financial burden.\"If this continues, I can only hold out for two months. I must get back my family assets, that is the greatest financial support. But to get them back, the first step is to advance to Rank two.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze was dark.To Fang Yuan, advancing to Rank two was not easy.For a Gu Master\u2019s cultivation, first was resources, second was talent. Without talent, the path of cultivation would be difficult and their accomplishments in the future would be lower.Talent is split according to D, C, B and A grade.But this is only a rough distribution.In fact, every grade has another specific differentiation.Taking a C grade for example \u2014 the primeval essence storage in the aperture would be around 40-59%.Fang Yuan\u2019s primeval essence was 44%, so in the C grade range, he was only middle-lower class.Rushing to Rank two, he needed at least 55% black green primeval essence. To an A and B grade Gu Master, this was not difficult, and to the 55-59% C grade Gu Masters, they could pass as well.Thus, for C grade Gu Masters, once they reach a certain accumulation, most of them would advance to Rank two. Only very few can attain Rank three.Thus, the talent could determine most people\u2019s achievements in their lives. Fang Yuan being given the cold shoulder, he could not blame the people for being biased.\"Although my C grade talent is only 44%, if I want to break the wall and reach a new height, attaining Rank two, it is still not impossible. The easiest way is to find a talent raising Gu worm. Secondary, I can get a support-type Gu like the Liquor worm, and that can help to break the barrier as well. Lastly, I can attain the help of a higher-ranking Gu Master, but using external primeval essence has a huge backlash, unless I can get the Cleansing Gu in future to eliminate the external presence.\"Fang Yuan thought about it while using both hands to take out a primeval stone, using his fingers to rub the smooth surface of the stone.\"But the above methods are not recommended for me. I do not have any friendly Gu Master to help, and even if I do I will not let my aperture be at their mercy. Gu worms like the Liquor worm are too rare, even getting the Liquor worm was my extreme luck. As for talent raising Gu worm, I got it in my previous life and attained Rank six cultivation, and I also know where to find them, but I cannot go to those places now with my current cultivation. Even if I get them, I cannot keep them, or even use them.\"\"But other than these methods, there is a final most stupid method. Using primeval stones to force it!\" Thinking so, Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes flashed as he gripped the primeval stone tightly.Gu Master cultivation, first was resources, second was talent.Without sufficient talent, one can compensate using resources to a degree.\"My primeval essence is only 44%, I do not have enough to break the aperture walls. But if I absorb primeval essence while attacking the walls, I can hold on much longer, and in about four to five days, I would be able to smash the walls!\"Making up his mind, Fang Yuan opened his eyes, his heart sinking into his aperture.Green copper primeval sea raged on as the waves crashed into the aperture walls.But this time, to prevent his primeval essence from drying up and becoming insufficient to maintain the cracks and causing the aperture to recover, Fang Yuan purposely slowed the attacking speed.This way, the green bronze primeval essence expenditure would be greatly reduced, but the crack formation would also slow down. Despite so, Fang Yuan continued to absorb the natural essence of the primeval stones.Primeval essence recovery has to be slightly above the crack recovery speed. This way, even if it is slow, showing less than 1% progress, there would be hope as time passes.The only thing about this method would be that other than eating and shitting, Fang Yuan had to cultivate non-stop. The more time he wasted, the more primeval stones would go down the drain and the more his hard work would squander.He could stop for a maximum of fifteen minutes, and after that if there isn't any primeval essence to continue attacking, the aperture would fully recover.Thus, once the attack began, he had to persevere until he succeeded, and cannot be disturbed. Once he stopped for too long, he would have to restart the process.Fang Yuan did not have so many primeval stones on hand to do it multiple times.Time flies when cultivating, and in the blink of an eye, the sun set.Under the setting sun, Jiao San with a cold expression said, \"After finding for a day, you still haven\u2019t found him?\"\"No, group leader.\" Kong Jing wiped the sweat off his forehead and said, \"That lad, he did not go to any of the houses we recommended, we have no idea where he is hiding.\"\"Hmph! Continue searching tomorrow, we have to find him. Remember to search the inn as well, I do not believe that we cannot find him. The village is only so big, no matter where he is hiding, there has to be a trace!\" Jiao San walked away in fury.Until the afternoon of the second day, their search finally bore fruit.A female Gu Master walked to Jiao San excitedly, reporting, \"Found him, found him! Fang Yuan is at a worn-out bamboo building, and has rented the second floor. According to the owner\u2019s description, it should be him.\"\"Hmph, as I expected, he really hid himself and is trying to breakthrough to Rank two.\" Jiao San laughed sinisterly, \"Let\u2019s go and make ourselves guests in his room and show him some concern. He is a newcomer after all.\"\"Hehehe..\u2026.\" The others also started smirking.The four immediately came to Fang Yuan\u2019s residence.There was a paper on the door.Jiao San took it down and read it. It was Fang Yuan\u2019s handwriting, saying that he needed to go into closed door cultivation for a few days and will not leave, as he would be attempting to breakthrough to Rank two. If others saw it, they should not disturb him. If Jiao San saw it, it was a \u2018request of absence\u2019 application.Jiao San snorted, throwing the paper away.How can I let you advance to Rank two so successfully?He laughed coldly, knocking on the door.Knock knock knock.\"Little brother Fang Yuan, are you here?\" He purposely said loudly, \"We are here to see you, how could you not tell us about your closed door cultivation, seriously.\"There was no reply.Knock knock knock.Jiao San knocked loudly.\"Little brother Fang Yuan, it\u2019s not that I want to nag at you. But you are making decisions on your own. Now that you are our group member, you should listen to instructions and obey orders, moving together. We have already accepted the wild deer hunting mission, this is specifically for you to train, so why don\u2019t you stop first and complete the mission with us, then cultivate,\" Jiao San\u2019s eyes squinted as he said in a gentle tone, although his expression was dark.There was still no reply.JIao San suddenly raised his voice, \"Little brother Fang Yuan, why are you not replying, did something happen to you? It is not so easy breaking through to Rank two, you can ask us for experience. Fang Yuan! Did you hear me, oh no, could it be that you fainted?\"Jiao San talked to himself, smirking coldly but his voice was full of concern and anxiety.The other three members observed the show.Kong Jing interrupted at an appropriate timing, \"Leader, you might be right, Fang Yuan hasn\u2019t responded after so long, let\u2019s go in and save him!\"\"Fang Yuan! Fang Yuan, quickly open the door. We\u2019re really worried if you keep silent. If you don\u2019t open the door, we will break in. You are our newest member, we cannot let you be in danger!\" Jiao San shouted loudly.Still, there was no reply.Jiao San\u2019s mouth curled, indicating to Kong Jing.Kong Jing acknowledged and raised his foot.With a loud BAM sound, the entire door was sent flying, crashing onto the bed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hmph, I was just about to find you. Coming to my house and raising a huge ruckus, even breaking down my door. Young man, you sure are capable.\" The landlord was an old man, but his tone was very firm.Being able to own additional houses in the Gu Yue village and renting it out, he was obviously a Gu Master.A Gu Master\u2019s strength and status supersedes a mortal. Mortals do not dare to operate such a business. In fact, they do not own property.The entire village\u2019s property is owned by the Gu Yue clan. The mortals who live here are the farmers and servants of the clan.\"Senior, we are here to find a young man, he is our group member.\" Facing the landlord, Jiao San controlled his temper.An old Gu Master like the landlord, even if he is old and no longer striving for his career, he still has strong relationships and connections. Even if he is retired his ability is still not to be underestimated.Those without human relationships and trump cards, how would they dare to do business?This is not a peaceful era, it is full of violence and plunder.The landlord shook his head, his tone rigid, \"I do not care about my tenant\u2019s whereabouts, but I do know that you broke my door. You need to compensate me.\"\"Hehe, this is our fault, it is only right that we compensate you,\" Jiao Sao laughed dryly. Although he was furious inside, he still forced himself to compensate some primeval stones and even gave some extra.The landlord\u2019s expression turned slightly better, \"If the young man who rented this room is who you are finding, then I must tell you that he has not turned in for a day. After paying a month\u2019s rent, he bought a huge amount of things yesterday and asked me which place sold coal cheaply. I told him that there was no need to buy coal, as there is a valley outside the village towards the north. A mine is situated there where he can excavate the coal. After thanking me, he left and never returned.\"\"So that\u2019s it.\" Jiao San looked at the decorations in the room.Indeed, the mattress and bedding was new. The table and chairs were old goods bought by Fang Yuan that were seemingly firm.The stove was empty, it indeed did not have coal.Jiao San breathed out slowly, being at ease.\"It seems Fang Yuan was delayed by excavating coal. Nevermind, let\u2019s come again tomorrow.\" He walked out of the room first.But on the third day, Fang Yuan still did not show up.Jiao San and the others stood outside the room, hesitant.\"Digging for coal, it does not need so much time. Fang Yuan wants to do closed door cultivation so maybe he dug more. But it\u2019s been so long, could something have had happened to him while he was excavating?\" Kong Jing conjured.Jiao San nodded unnoticably, pointing towards the bed and stove, \"This lad is very stingy. He paid a month\u2019s rent all of a sudden and even bought so many things, and especially pasting that paper on the wall, he probably wanted to cultivate here. Too bad he was unlucky. These days the wolf hordes have gotten bigger, and the wild beasts around the village have gotten more active. He might have encountered some wild beasts.\"\"Leader is wise!\" The two female Gu Masters said at the same time, flattering him.Jiao San laughed while raising his head, \"Hahaha, I was still fretting over how to deal with him. Though we have that deer catching mission, let\u2019s not rush out to do it. If we meet him in the wilds, we are forced to save him, right?\"\"Hehehe.\" The other three members started laughing.Day four.In the aperture, waves of black green primeval essence hit against the crystal walls relentlessly.The translucent white crystal wall was already full of cracks, crisscrossing each other.This is Fang Yuan\u2019s result after working hard non-stop for three days and three nights. At most, when he really could not take it anymore, he would quickly take a meal and settle his bowels.These days, Fang Yuan had purposely slowed the wave crashing process, and at the same time he drew more primeval essence from his primeval stones. Thus, after such a long time, the green copper primeval sea had only dropped from the 44% limit to around 20%.As time passed, when there was only about 13% primeval essence left, the wall could not longer hold up, and had reached its limit.Crack crack\u2026The originally sturdy crystal wall broke into pieces, and the fragments fell into the primeval sea, causing ripples and waves. After that, it turned into white dots and vanished into thin air.What replaced the crystal wall, was a brand new white light wall.This was the Rank two light wall. Although there was not much difference and it still emitted white light, it was much more glimmering that the Rank one light wall.At the same time, traces of red primeval essence were produced in the sea and it mixed around with the black green primeval sea in the aperture.This was the Rank two initial stage red steel primeval essence!\"Finally I did it, I broke through to Rank two!\" Fang Yuan opened his eyes abruptly, the room immediately brightening up.But a second later, a strong wave of nausea hit him.\"I went through four days and three nights of non-stop cultivating, it is too intense and my body is going to collapse soon.\" Fang Yuan laughed bitterly, slowly lying down. \"My cultivation was not disturbed at all, it seems that my set up at the rental house had worked. It was worth spending this sum, next I shall rest well for the night and return to the village tomorrow.\"Thinking of this, intense sleepiness assaulted him.Fang Yuan forced his eyes to stay open and used his intense will to cover himself with the blanket.After closing his eyes, in a few seconds, he fell soundly asleep.The cultivation earlier had used up most of his spirit.He slept until the afternoon of the second day.Fang Yuan opened his eyes, feeling his spirit recovering to around half, but he was still feeling weakness in his body.He opened the door, walking out of the room for the first time in five days.This attracted a person.This person had slim long eyes with a thin body \u2014 it was Jiang Ya\u2019s brother Jiang He.Seeing Fang Yuan, he exhaled in relief, saying, \"You\u2019re finally out! Hmph, I would have broken into the room if you still did not come out after the next few days. After all if you die here, I\u2019d be held responsible.\"Fang Yuan laughed but did not say anything.The winter sunlight broke through the window, shining onto his face, amplifying the trace of pale white weakness on his features.Five days ago, he purposely asked the landlord and gave Jiao San the clues of his coal story. After that he left the Gu Yue village and went to the hamlet at the mountain foot.Because of old man Wang previously, Jiang He was half an alliance mate of his. Using this relationship, Fang Yuan stayed a few days at the village and advanced to Rank two without any interruption.Of course, the rock crack secret cave was much more elusive than Jiang He\u2019s place, but it was not completely safe. Fang Yuan had to consider the possibility of Jiao San and the others relentlessly finding him, and might find the rock crack secret cave.Although chances were slim, if the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance was found out, Fang Yuan\u2019s life would be in danger.Fang Yuan was a very cautious person, and he naturally would not take such risks.At the same time, it was safer at Jiang He\u2019s place. Even if they had a shared secret, Jiang He would not kill him to silence him.The risks and troubles of killing a Gu Master was too great. Without sufficient benefits, Jiang He had no motivation to do it. In fact, to preserve the secret, Jiang He would even have to worry about Fang Yuan\u2019s safety.After all, if the clan\u2019s punishment hall investigates Fang Yuan\u2019s death, they might find out about old man Wang\u2019s secret.Seeing Fang Yuan safe, Jiang He was really relieved.But quickly, he felt the aura of Fang Yuan and his expression changed, \"To think that you really succeeded, reaching Rank two in one go!\"He was shocked in his heart. Five days ago when Fang Yuan approached him and stated his intentions, he was actually feeling disdainful in his heart.Absorbing the primeval essence from the primeval stones and breaking through to Rank two, this kind of multitasking method was very draining on the spirit. Normally speaking, Gu Masters needed very strong will, patience and years of cultivating experience.Only with the experience, a Gu Master could treat the extraction of primeval essence from the stones as an instinct. At the same time, manipulating the primeval sea skillfully and causing the impact to be controlled at a degree, and it had to be perfectly calculated, just enough to match the recovery rate of the primeval essence so that the process could be sustained.In Jiang He\u2019s opinion, Fang Yuan had no chance of success. But to think, he did it in one go.Fang Yuan laughed indifferently, \"I was lucky. I plan to return to the village today, but before that, it would be nice if I can have a meal.\"\"Hehehe, little brother Fang Yuan, since you\u2019re here, of course I\u2019m taking care of your meals.\" Jiang He patted his chest, his attitude even more friendly than before.Although he did not think well of Fang Yuan\u2019s future, but now that he has advanced to Rank two, it meant that he had gone through a difficult hurdle and has the qualifications to be on par with him now.After a scrumptious meal, Jiang He brought Fang Yuan to the entrance of the small village personally.\"Little brother Fang Yuan, be careful this time. Recently the wolf nest area has gotten slightly fiercer, causing the wild beasts to become more active. Eh, it is snowing.\" Jiang He paused, then continued, \"My opinion is, don\u2019t go now. How about you stay here for another night?\"After Fang Yuan reached Rank two, he became really friendly.But Fang Yuan was insistent on leaving, thus saying goodbye to Jiang He.The snowflakes fell calmly, just like pure white fur that was floating down slowly.The light of the setting sun turned the snow into a golden yellow.Flake by flake, the snow drifted onto Fang Yuan\u2019s head and shoulders.In the far distance, the Gu Yue village stood upright over the mountain waist, watching over quietly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Newcomers better pay special attention!\"On the way back to the village, there would be a five-man group from time to time running hurriedly past Fang Yuan\u2019s side.\"Did something happen?\" He had not walked for more than five hundred meters when Fang Yuan saw the thirteenth group.He could not help but contemplate, but to be quite honest, with five hundred years\u2019 worth of memories it was just too superfluous and messy. Mentioning this, although Fang Yuan was reborn, he had never given up any of his old memories.Yet, much of his memories were enshrouded in a layer of thick fog, and if he tried to retrieve them by force, he would only get lost in the fog, getting more losses than benefits.Only a few deep and powerful memories that were like sparkling and translucent pearls ran through his previous life\u2019s five hundred years like a connected thread.It was evident that what was happening right now, was in fact not in any of these pearls.The life of his in the Gu Yue Village was just the beginning of the preceding period, it was just way too long ago. Besides\u2026\"There\u2019s a possibility that this never happened in my previous life, but because of my change, a butterfly effect happened and caused changes to the surroundings.\"Just like that, he walked while pondering. Subconsciously, Fang Yuan reached the Northern gate of the village.By chance, there was another group about to set off.\"Eh?\" On seeing Fang Yuan, only one person from this group stopped in his tracks. \"Fang Yuan, why are you still here?\"\"What\u2019s wrong?\" Fang Yuan raised his eyes and looked at this person. It was no other than his fellow schoolmate, Gu Yue Chi Cheng.Chi Cheng immediately frowned and said, \"Oh geez, you still don\u2019t know yet? There\u2019s been a small scale beast tide that formed near the village. If we let it be, it will slowly become a big scale beast tide. When that happens the villages at the foot of the mountain will be crushed. Without those lowly mortals and slaves, we\u2019d also be at a difficult position sometimes.\"\"Oh, so it\u2019s like this?\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze flashed.Being reminded like this, he was able to remember that such a thing did happen in his memories.In this world, it was hard for humanity to survive. Every few years a beast tide would happen. Humans need resources and living space. This is no different from wild beasts and insects, they also needed such things!To explain the beast tide as a war between wild beasts and humanity, perhaps this will be easier to understand.Taking Qing Mao Mountain for example, every three years there would be a large scale wolf tide that attacks each of the big mountain villages.\"According to my calculations, the real outburst of the wolf tide will happen next year. However this small scale beast tide, is a subsidiary of that. The wolf group will continue growing stronger and bigger, and this will cause the other beast groups around the area to lose their living space. As this effect accumulates, when it reaches the maximum limit, it will cause the migration of beast groups. Migrating beast groups will naturally influence other beast groups.\"\"Under such an intertwined influence, there is a chance that the influence would be expanded and cause all sorts of beast groups to relocate, causing the beast tide to be formed from this matter. If this problem is not controlled in time, the tide would only get bigger. Although it is still unable to endanger the existence of the Gu Yue village, if we leave it alone, the village\u2019s power would be greatly reduced.\"\"Wait! If this is the case\u2026 Heh heh heh heh.\" There was a sudden flash in his eyes, but Fang Yuan promptly cast his gaze down, hiding away the change in his eyes.Seeing that Fang Yuan had not said anything, Chi Cheng continued to speak. \"At the present time, the internal affairs hall and external affairs hall have both already given out the order to mobilize, they proclaimed this as an urgent mission. Fang Yuan, don\u2019t you think of goofing off. Your group has already left in the morning, you must also go. But\u2026\"As he spoke up to this point, Chi Cheng purposely dragged out his intonation, \"Danger lurks everywhere during a beast wave. All kinds of wild beasts roam about, and most of all a battle in the night is way more dangerous than the day. You\u2019re just a small little Rank one Gu Master, unlike a Rank two like me, you should be careful. Heh heh heh!\"As he said this, he purposely held his head high and puffed his chest out, stroking his own belt, his expression joyfully satisfied and proud.His belt was no longer the green coloured Rank one belt, but a Rank two Gu Master\u2019s red coloured belt. At the same time on top of the metal plate on the belt, there was a \u20182\u2019 word.It was thanks to his grandfather Gu Yue Chi Lian\u2019s help that he ascended to Rank two not long ago.\"I just heard about this news, but since this is the case.\" Fang Yuan suddenly smiled and said, \"Then I\u2019ll follow you guys and set out together. Once on the front lines I\u2019ll leave the team and return to mine.\"\"What? Urgh, who wants to bring you!\" Chi Cheng folded his arms, his mouth twitching disdainfully.Fang Yuan\u2019s tone was distant. \"The clan rule states: Gu Masters that are left behind must merge into the closest group to their location, they have an obligation to continue fighting. Chi Cheng, you don\u2019t even know this point?\"\"You!\" Chi Cheng glared, just about to flare up.\"Indeed, this is the case,\" Chi Shan who had been watching quietly finally spoke.His body stature was close to two meters tall, and his figure was powerful and strong. His upper body was bare, the muscles hard and tough like metal. His entire body was covered in fiery red skin that seemed to faintly emit hot air.Undoubtedly, he was the leader of this group.Seeing him speak, even Chi Cheng who was the Chi faction\u2019s inheritor, kept his mouth shut.Chi Shan expressionlessly looked at Fang Yuan, continuing, \"Let us depart, you keep up.\"His voice was low and deep, his words short and simple. There was an aura of him that caused people to hardly question him.Fang Yuan shrugged nonchalantly, taking it as agreeing.Chi Cheng laughed coldly, his gaze harboring malicious intentions as he looked at Fang Yuan, speaking in an emphasized, peculiar tone, \"Then you had better keep up!\"Fang Yuan did not reply to him.\"Hmph, why do we have to drag him around. Just a Rank one Gu Master.\" Chi Cheng mumbled to himself angrily, but since he was hindered by Chi Shan\u2019s authority, he did not dare act impudent.At once, a group of six people set out from the entrance, following the mountain road and running down the slope.Gu Yue Chi Shan took the lead. He may be big-sized, but his speed was also not slow. Besides him and Chi Cheng, there were also two men and one female, their facial expressions indifferent.As they ran, Chi Shan\u2019s group started to display the graceful bearing of being one of the three most strongest groups.Each of them had rhythmic breathing, their footsteps fast and easy. Only Chi Cheng seemed to be in a difficult situation, but he would use his Scarlet Pill Cricket Gu from time to time, catching up reluctantly. Yet it could also be seen that he had received good teaching, for although he often staggered along the way, at least he never fell down.When they reached the mountain foot, with one hand gesture from Chi Shan, the group swiftly stopped in their tracks.Huff huff\u2026Chi Cheng had fallen behind by three hundred meters, and he was the last to catch up. His face was pale and he panted heavily, his gaze inconceivable as he looked at Fang Yuan.During the journey Fang Yuan had always been following tightly behind, and up till now his breathing was only slightly heavy. He did not look the least bit like a newcomer who just graduated.\"Chi Cheng, remember, regulate your physical strength,\" Chi Shan looked back and advised Chi Cheng. Then he swept his gaze past Fang Yuan, his eyes showing a hint of praise.The looks that the other few group members gave towards Fang Yuan had also softened a little.\"We will be nearing the beast tide down there. Chi Cheng and Fang Yuan, come towards the middle of the team.\" Chi Shan looked at the pitch-black mountain forest before him as he spoke.This sentence let Fang Yuan reevaluate Chi Shan.This huge boulder of a man sure had tolerance. The middle of a group is often the safest spot. Although Fang Yuan was not a person of the Mo bloodline, Chi Shan still maintained the manner of protecting a newcomer. To compare him to the sickly snake Jiao San, the latter would immediately pale in comparison.The sky had already become completely dark, and the black clouds were in layers, causing the accumulated snow to also become dark and gloomy.Chi Shan\u2019s group had already changed their group formation. Their speed dropped greatly as they ran slowly through the complicated terrain of the mountain forest.Fang Yuan and Chi Cheng were in the middle part of the group, where on the left side was the huge Chi Shan, while the right side was an old man. Behind them was a young woman with a head of watery blue-coloured long hair.And in front of them was a male Gu Master called Chi She.He was the reconnaissance Gu Master of this group, and he gave out hissing noises. From time to time he would stick his tongue out into the air.Right now his tongue had a small divide in between, becoming the bright red forked tongue of a snake. As they entered deeper into the mountain forest, their surroundings started to show wild beasts violently running about wildly.Suddenly Chi She opened his mouth and spoke, \"Before us, three medium-sized animals have appeared. Suspected to be wild deer.\"\"Drive it away.\" Chi Shan\u2019s expression was unchanging as he immediately gave the order.The six-manned group did not change their direction; they continued pursuing forward. Three wild deer appeared before them, quickly changing their direction and dispersing.Not long after, Chi She\u2019s expression changed. \"A group of medium-sized creatures. Suspected to be turtleback apes.\"\"Shift,\" Chi Shan said.The small group immediately broke to the left side, bypassing this group of troublesome apes.This was the benefit of having a reconnaissance Gu Master, he was able to anticipate and inform earlier, letting them make accurate decisions from it.\"Chi She is probably using the Snake Tongue Gu. This Rank two Gu worm can sense heat temperatures. But it has three very obvious flaws \u2014 firstly, the perception radius is small, secondly it is easily interfered with. Thirdly it cannot detect cold-blooded creatures. Yet no matter what, it is better than not having any detection. I have reached Rank two now, and in future to survive in the wild, I will also need a detection-type of Gu,\" Fang Yuan thought.Suddenly Chi She urgently spoke, \"A middle-sized creature, suspected to be a white tiger. It\u2019s found us and is quickly approaching!\"\"Engage.\" Chi Shang\u2019s tone was calm and collected.Roar!A fierce tiger jumped out from the thicket in front of them, and the group met it head-on. Without Chi She\u2019s warning in advance, perhaps they would be caught unprepared.But right now, the group had long anticipated.Firstly, the old Gu Master on the right suddenly drummed up his cheeks and then spit out a white coloured, viscous substance.The substance abruptly expanded in mid-air, becoming a huge spider net. It used its strong viscosity and trapped the white tiger full in the face.The white tiger struggled fiercely in the net, and Chi Shan immediately stepped forward and brandished his fist, pounding onto the tiger\u2019s head.His fist had a golden luster flashing through, and with a bang, the tiger\u2019s head was smashed into pieces. The white tiger died in one breath.The group did not stop to stay behind, but instead walked over the tiger\u2019s body and continued forward. Chi She took Chi Shan\u2019s place again and ran in front, taking the lead.Through the entire process it was like moving clouds and flowing water. All the group members displayed mutual understanding.\"That entire process did not take more than three seconds. If it was me right now who was taking on that tiger alone, I would need at least five minutes to contend with.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze was flashing.These Gu Masters were also Rank two like him, but the main disparity was still Gu worms.They all used Rank two Gu worms, and this enabled them to bring out the best in each other. However all the Gu in Fang Yuan\u2019s hands were still Rank one.Gu Master, Gu Master, the word Gu is before the word Master, signifying that Gu worms have a huge impact on a Gu Master\u2019s fighting power. (1)\"Although I have advanced to Rank two, I still need to have Rank two Gu to be able to display the fighting power of a Rank two Gu Master. However right now I do not have much primeval stones on me, I have used up a very huge portion from breaking into Rank two. Refining two Gu worms together will also use up a considerable amount of primeval stones.\"As Fang Yuan thought of this, Chi She who was in front of him suddenly said, \"I found the sickly snake\u2019s group.\"(1) The chinese like to repeat things sometimes when emphasizing something. Gu Master, Gu Master\u2026 Gu and Master! Gu is before Master, Gu is so important.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Suddenly withdrawing strengthTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\"Found the sickly snake group in front, they are currently contesting with a large-sized wild beast.\" Only half a second later, Chi She said again, this time more specific.\"What\u2019s the situation?\" Chi Shan frowned.\"There\u2019s no mistake,\" Chi She\u2019s snake tongue continued to stretch and shrink, \"Jiao San\u2019s red lava python is the only one in the entire village, and now they are fighting against... wild boar king!\"Everyone\u2019s expression changed.\"Wild boar king... If I want to combine Gu worms, I require the wild boar\u2019s tusks. Undoubtedly, the wild boar king\u2019s tusks are the most suitable.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s heart stirred, and in actuality he had the intention to kill the wild boar king from the start.\"That wild boar king?\" Watery blue hair female Gu Master raised her brows.\"Other than that one, there is no other in the vicinity. But relying on just the strength of the sickly snake group to reap the wild boar king, their appetite is too big.\" The old Gu Master sneered in disdain.If Old man Wang could grasp the terrain of the mountain himself, these Rank two Gu Masters who were always roaming around on Qing Mao mountain would obviously be more familiar with it. Not eliminating the wild boar king before this, they had their reasons.Chi Shan pondered, then said, \"Go support them.\"\"Hehe, I\u2019m afraid they might not reciprocate.\" The old Gu Master laughed coldly.\"Even if we do not go and support them, we still have to send someone over, right!\" Chi Cheng looked at Fang Yuan, saying in an unhappy tone.The team\u2019s direction steered towards the left.Although Chi Shan and the rest always looked down and did not like Gu Yue Jiao San, but as clansmen, towards outside foes, even if they had amnesty normally, they would group up and work together.This is the cohesiveness of a clan in this world.And especially relying on this cohesiveness could a hundred year old clan sustain itself without dying out, even becoming a thousand year old clan.Everyone moved through the jungle in the darkness, heading towards a low-lying land.Sickly snake group\u2019s four Gu Masters were surrounding the wild boar king, engaging in fierce combat.In the most center, the elephant-like wild boar king was fighting with a thin and long red-coloured python.This red giant python had dark red rock pieces all over its body, the temperature very high. It was like a thick chain coiling around the wild boar king.The wild boar king cried out angrily, constantly rolling on the ground, its snow white tusks piercing the darkness and drawing cold light in the air.Its body was full of big and small injuries, its tail already broken. While flipping around, it revealed its fresh red injuries, stuck to the red lava python\u2019s body and scalded by the high temperature.The Chi Shan group did not get closer, but observed from a distance.Taking a few looks, the old Gu Master was enlightened, \"I say, how did the sickly snake have this courage. Looks like the wild boar king was actually injured already, tsk, he sure picked up the cheap goods, this scoundrel got lucky.\"Do you guys think that this wild boar king\u2019s body would have the Black Boar Gu?\" Chi Cheng excitedly said with glowing eyes.Fang Yuan\u2019s expression was unchanged as he watched silently.At this time, Jiao San and his gang also realised the situation of being watched, and immediately the support Gu Master Gu Yue Kong Jing who was the furthest away from the wild boar king left the battlefield and ran over.\"Oh, it is Lord Chi Shan. There\u2019s no problems here now, we can handle it. There are many wild beast groups in front, they need your support.\" Kong Jing said to the people.\"Hmph, what do you mean you can handle it? You\u2019re clearly lying through your teeth, I can see that this python isn\u2019t going to hang in there much longer.\" The old Gu Master\u2019s experienced gaze revealed the situation at once.\"You\u2019re just afraid of us wanting to split the rewards after helping,\" the watery blue long-haired female Gu Master immediately pointed out Jiao San and his gang\u2019s intention.\"This wild boar king is yours,\" Chi Shan said, looking at the old Gu Master.The old Gu Master snorted, but he still bent down, vomiting out a piece of white sticky spider web.The spider web expanded in the air and spread out, enveloping the wild boar king.The wild boar king struggled intensely in the web, breaking threads after threads, but it could not get free quickly.During this period, sickly snake Jiao San quickly got the red lava python to retreat. After that, together with the healing female Gu Master in the group, they underwent emergency battle healing on the python.In the fierce battle earlier, the red lava python\u2019s rock body already had some cracks. Through the healing, the cracks mended, shrinking until they disappeared.\"Fang Yuan, you should go back. You still want to depend on our group?\" Chi Cheng said in annoyance.Fang Yuan took a step out and walked out from behind Chi Shan.Gu Yue Kong Jing was blocked by Chi Shan\u2019s huge body earlier and did not see him. At the moment when he saw Fang Yuan, his expression turned weird.Jiao San turned his head around and upon seeing Fang Yuan, was overjoyed at once, \"Fang Yuan, you\u2019re finally here! Quick, the spider web is not going to hold, you have huge strength, go and restrain the wild boar king and buy us time. We need time to heal the red lava python.\"Without a defensive Gu and only with Rank one cultivation, getting close to the wild boar king was nothing but risky.Chi Shan took a look at Fang Yuan and said, \"Go.\"Saying so, he took a huge step and left the place.He kept his word; although the wild boar king had much value, he turned around and left without hesitation.Seeing Chi Shan\u2019s group leaving, Jiao San and the gang breathed a sigh of relief. From start to finish, they did not say a word of thanks.Jiao San continue shouting, \"Fang Yuan, hurry, the wild boar king\u2019s strength is huge, the spider web is not going to hold out. If you perform well this time, I will not pursue the matter of you leaving the team on your own.\"\"Okay.\" Fang Yuan agreed, quickly getting to the wild boar king and grabbing its two huge tusks.He used all his strength and pulled, causing the wild boar king to be suppressed, its struggling suddenly diminished.\"Good job!\" Jiao San praised, but his eyes shone with cold light.This Fang Yuan came at a good time, the small beast horde was the perfect chance!Jiao San had never thought of killing Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan was his member, and if he died, the clan\u2019s evaluation of him would drop. This did not suit his interests.He only promised his uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu to slow Fang Yuan\u2019s growth. If he could drag it beyond sixteen years old, he would obtain a fortune promised by Gu Yue Dong Tu.The truth is, even with his scheming and intolerant nature, he did not think of killing Fang Yuan before. This is not just because after a Gu Master dies, the punishment hall would hold a thorough investigation, thus being risky, but also because of the clan\u2019s belief \u2014 Blood is thicker than water, family comes first. This notion is ingrained into the people\u2019s hearts. Unless there is a feud of killing one\u2019s parents or stealing one\u2019s wife, there is no such phenomenon of disputes.Like how the Gu Yue clan leader once taught the academy elder, not only does the system and rules hold the clan together, there is also the thick family relationships.Any organisation would need to have a system and values as their basic core.\"Using this opportunity, I\u2019ll let Fang Yuan get injured and return to the village to nurse his injuries. Let\u2019s see if he can cultivate to Rank two like that! Of course, I cannot strike personally, if I get discovered that would be bad. Since there are so many beasts in the horde anyway, I\u2019ll borrow from their strength.\"Gu Yue Jiao San laughed coldly in his heart, but he asked, \"Fang Yuan, how long can you hold out?\"\"A while more, don\u2019t worry group leader.\" Fang Yuan replied with much strength.\"Very good, Hua Xing, go and plant the corrosion blood grass Gu,\" Jiao San instructed while healing the red lava python.\"Yes!\" A female Gu Master walked up.She came to the side of the wild boar king and stretched out both hands, giving a thumbs up on both hands. The nails on her thumbs had a purple vine insignia coiling around.Light red coloured red steel primeval essence gushed out and surrounded her white thumb, and entered the insignia.The vines were brought alive immediately, extending a delicate tentacle from her nails.The tentacles moved like snakes, extending to the wild boar king\u2019s mouth, and then along its teeth, going deep into its stomach.\"Hehehe....\" Fang Yuan covered his mouth in the darkness as it curled into a devious angle.Others would think about kinship and not have killing intent on their clansmen, this was going against the traditional moral values of the clan. But he did not put these values into his heart.The strength he placed on the wild boar king\u2019s tusks suddenly vanished.The wild boar king furiously growled and summoned all its strength. Its tusks swung in the air as Fang Yuan who was holding onto both tusks was brought along with the force and was thrown away.The wild boar king once again turned its head, and the tusks swept through. The female Gu Master was beside it and could not react quickly enough to such a change. She was hit by the tusks and screamed in agony.Then her slim body, after getting hit by the tusks, broke into two with a snap.The female Gu Master flew away like a broken bag; she was swept highly into the sky, and then plopped down again.She landed on the ground, her eyes wide open. She was dead on the spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From the waist and across it was broken, and her upper body laid on the ground, displayed at an odd angle against her lower body, the arms parallel to the ground while her legs were pointing towards the sky.From afar, Fang Yuan also started to descend.First, he hit the tree canopy and broke many branches before landing on the snowy ground.He turned his body nimbly and stood up on the snowy ground. Because he had utilized the Jade Skin Gu earlier, other than some pain on his back, he was unscathed.On the battlefield, after a momentary silence, Jiao San\u2019s angry howl could be heard, \"Fang Yuan, didn\u2019t you say you could hold on!\"Fang Yuan laughed coldly in the dark, but suddenly his body twisted and he almost fell down. He used his hand to hold onto the tree trunk as support and was able to maintain his body balance.He pretended to limp as if he could not walk, but his gaze swept across the surroundings to see if there was any other Gu Masters.Against the beast horde, the Gu Masters were fighting with all they had, and could not be free enough or even have the mood to observe Fang Yuan. Even though he had been observing in secret and found no Gu Masters nearby, Fang Yuan still discreetly chose to hide himself.From the other side, intense battle noises could be heard again.Evidently, the wild boar king had escaped its entrapment and was fighting once again with the red lava python.Fang Yuan shifted step by step towards them with a face of anxiety, almost falling onto the ground a few times. Dirt, soil, grass and snow were all over his body, making him appear battered and exhausted.He finally got back to the fringe of the battlefield.On the battlefield, three people and a pig were fighting.The red lava python coiled around the body of the wild boar king and its two hind legs.The wild boar king\u2019s two front legs could only thrash around randomly, causing it to roll on the ground, sometimes struggling. With the movement of its two front legs, it knocked and crashed into things randomly.There were even more injuries on its body now, the boiling pig blood had dyed the floor red.Seeing Fang Yuan, the most outer positioned Gu Yue Kong Jing said, \"Fang Yuan, you scum, you caused Hua Xin to die!\"\"I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it. But I really couldn\u2019t hold it.\" Fang Yuan shouted.\"Fuck, then why did you promise so confidently if you couldn\u2019t. No means no, giving false promises like this will kill us all!\" Gu Yue Kong Jing furiously screamed. If he was not in combat at the moment, he would go up and give Fang Yuan two tight slaps.\"S-Sorry, I won\u2019t do it again.\" Fang Yuan quickly yelled back.\"Fang Yuan, we\u2019ll talk about this later!\" Sickly snake Jiao San roared, feeling his pressure intensify. The almost dead wild boar king had flown into madness, and the red lava python had injuries and cracks all over its body.\"Kong Jing, don\u2019t bother with Fang Yuan. Quickly take out the knife scale web!\" When Jiao San saw that the red lava python was almost at its breaking point, he shouted in panic with cold sweat all over.\"Yes!\" Kong Jing quickly retrieved the big belly frog and used his primeval essence, vomiting a piece of steel web.On this steel web, there were sharp spikes and apparent blades.\"Fang Yuan, grab the other end and rush up with me, we\u2019ll entangle the wild boar king.\" Kong Jing said.\"But my leg is injured, I cannot walk!\" Fang Yuan said with an anxious expression, crippling his way there.\"Useless thing!\" Kong Jing with no other choice, had to do it himself, his hands dragging the knife scales web and throwing it at the wild boar king.The wild boar king was covered by the knife scale web, causing it to cry out as fresh blood splattered.It had predicted that its death was impending, and struggled even more fiercely. As its struggle intensified, the knife scale web\u2019s entanglement got tighter, and its injuries worsened.As for the red lava python, because of its rock body, it did not take much damage from this knife scale web.\"What a waste of this fur!\" Jiao San said in pity.\"Finally settled.\" Kong Jing breathed out in relief.At this time, Fang Yuan shouted, \"Let me help you guys!\"Swoosh swoosh swoosh.Numerous moonblades flew out and hit the knife scale web, causing the steel threads to be torn apart. With the wild boar king\u2019s intense struggle, the hole got even bigger and the knife scale web was torn into pieces, allowing the wild boar king to escape.At once!Kong Jing stared with bulging eyes, lost for words.\"What\u2026 what the fuck...\" Another female Gu Master could no longer care about her feminine image and swore loudly.\"I\u2026 it seems I messed up. I wanted to help!\" Fang Yuan said, sounding very sincere and innocent.Jiao San dodged the wild boar king\u2019s charge, rolling on the floor. Before he even got up, he shouted, \"Fang Yuan\u2014! You dumb piece of shit, see what you did! You\u2019re simply garbage for a teammate!!!\"\"Leader, you must trust me, I didn\u2019t mean it,\" Fang Yuan defended himself.\"Shut the fuck up, from now on, do nothing, wait at the corner!\" Jiao San shouted, rolling again and dodging the wild boar king\u2019s trample.Fang Yuan snickered, but still obediently took tens of steps back.\"All of you get back!\" Jiao San shouted, finally showing his true trump card as two strands of poisonous yellow air came out from his nostrils.The poisonous air continued to come out from his nose, growing more and more until they gathered into a lump of yellow poisonous cloud.The wild boar king and Jiao San\u2019s shadow could be seen outside the poisonous cloud.Kong Jing, Fang Yuan and the others observed outside the yellow cloud.Fang Yuan said to the remaining female Gu Master, \"Heal my leg, it\u2019s injured!\"The female Gu Master flew into a rage, \"My good sister is dead, and your leg is only stumped! Why don\u2019t you go and die?!\"Fang Yuan said in grievance, \"I didn\u2019t want this to happen either.\"But his eyes shone with a trace of sharpness.Should I act, and eliminate these people?It is a chance to act now. In their subconscious minds, they would not expect me to have killing intention.If the sickly snake group is exterminated, there would be less restrictions on me.But...If any Gu Master saw this process, I would fall into the abyss. The crime of killing a clansman is the most unforgivable in this world. Not only will I be executed, I would also have to face all sorts of torture for seven days and seven nights.Death is not scary, but for such a small group, it is not worth the risk.A pity the wild boar king is dying. After this battle the sickly snake group would be greatly weakened and their battle strength would be at the lowest, they would definitely leave the battlefield. What a pity, this was a godsend opportunity\u2026...Fang Yuan felt regret and pity in his heart.But he had done it to the greatest limit, and if he exceeded this, the feeling of \"sabotage\u2019 would thicken. The others were not stupid, they would notice and if other Gu Masters saw this, the risk would intensify.Five minutes later, the wild boar king plopped onto the ground.The yellow cloud dissipated, and Jiao San breathed loudly with a pale face. He had used his final trump card, and now he had little to no primeval essence left.\"All of you come here and dissect the corpse quickly, we will retreat after taking the spoils of the battle!\" Jiao San shouted.Fang Yuan surrounded the wild boar king and quickly began to dissect the corpse.The wild boar king\u2019s blood was still hot, and the smell of blood was thick. Throughout the surrounding forest that was enshrouded in darkness, there were continuous howls from wild beasts and intense battle noises.But there were no wild beasts in this tiny battlefield.This was the authority of the beast king.There were rules among the wild beasts.The thick aura of the wild boar king caused other wild beasts to shrink in fear, and if the beast horde came here, they would find their way around this region. Of course, if it was another stronger beast horde or another beast king, they would not care about the wild boar king\u2019s aura.At this time, pairs of blue eyes glowed in the surrounding darkness.From other places, blood-curdling screeches and alarmed cries of Gu Masters could be heard.\"It\u2019s the wolves, the wolf pack!\"\"The lightning wolf pack actually appeared!\"\"Damn it, why is there a wolf pack here, it is still not the time for the outburst of the wolf tide right?!\"\"Retreat, forget the wild boar king, we have to retreat quickly!\" Jiao San shouted, and the faces of the surrounding people also turned white.One lightning wolf was not scary. But a pack of lightning wolves, even the wild boar king would have to run.Most importantly, the lightning wolves\u2019 durability and endurance was high. They also had great speed, being most proficient at chasing.At such a critical moment, Jiao San could no longer care about the others, abandoning the three and running for his life.\"Group leader, wait for me,\" Kong Jing shouted in panic, catching up to him.\"I do not have a Gu worm that enhances my speed, I can\u2019t escape. Jiao San and the others have no primeval essence left, so even if they have a speed-type Gu, they can\u2019t escape the chase of the lightning wolves!\" Under the danger of death, Fang Yuan evaluated calmly.He quickly hit the neck of the female Gu Master near him who was in a daze, causing her to faint.Next, by dragging her, he burrowed into the wild boar king\u2019s stomach that was cut open.The wild boar king\u2019s stomach was already cut open with a huge wound.Fang Yuan squeezed his way into the bloody wild boar\u2019s body, at the same time using the female Gu Master\u2019s body to block away the entrance and cover up his body.The wolf pack quickly descended, mostly chasing after Jiao San and Kong Jing, while a portion of them surrounded the wild boar king and feasted.While Fang Yuan was inside the wild boar\u2019s body, he could hear the wolves\u2019 chewing and swallowing, as well as their biting, causing vibrations in the corpse.\"To think that the first beast horde had lightning wolves, this is a surprise, the clan would definitely send reinforcements. The wild boar king\u2019s body is huge, so if the lightning wolves want to eat it completely, they would still need some time. As long as I can hold out, I would be spared from them.\"Fang Yuan pondered deeply.Without accident, Jiao San and Kong Jing should be dead meat. They had little primeval essence and were not speed oriented, so with such a small distance, they would definitely get slaughtered by the wolves.When people panic, they would make dumb decisions. Under the pressure of death, there are little who can remain as calm as Fang Yuan and make the most appropriate decisions.Even if the wild boar king\u2019s flesh was all eaten, exposing Fang Yuan who was hiding, the amount of lightning wolves that Fang Yuan would have to deal with is definitely lesser than the others. According to his experience, at most five would appear, which would be his limit. He had much greater chance of surviving.The lightning wolves continued to chew and bite, the sound indicating that they were getting closer. The wild boar king\u2019s flesh had mostly gone into the lightning wolves\u2019 stomach.If a normal person was in such a predicament, they would feel as if the seconds that were passing by were like an eternity. But instead Fang Yuan closed his eyes and took out his primeval stones, fighting against time to recover his primeval essence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Reverend InsanityCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe primeval essence that Fang Yuan recovered while in the boar\u2019s stomach went unused ultimately.The beast horde this time was under the supervision of the Gu Yue higher-ups, and the lightning wolf gang was just a small accident. Quickly, the Gu Yue higher-ups gave their response.Three clan elders led their respective teams and swiftly grasped the situation.Merely ten minutes later, Fang Yuan could hear fighting sounds from outside the boar\u2019s stomach, as well as the cries of the lightning wolves.He quickly kicked the female Gu Master out, and crawled out with blood stains all over him.Fang Yuan was naturally not afraid of the lightning wolves, but he was afraid of getting caught in the battle. If a Gu Master accidentally attacked the corpse, wouldn\u2019t he be too unlucky, by then who can he hold responsibility for?With a big living person suddenly crawling out from the boar\u2019s stomach, this caused the few Gu Masters fighting the lightning wolves to be taken aback.Fang Yuan\u2019s entire body was a bloody mess, and his leg was still entangled in the wild boar king\u2019s intestines. His entire body emitted a nose-piercing bloody smell, and the few Gu Masters frowned in response.But Fang Yuan paid no heed to that, he breathed deeply in enjoyance, extending his limbs and observing the battlefield.As he had predicted, there were five lightning wolves.But these lightning wolves were either old or injured. They were the bottom of the pack\u2019s hierarchy. As the wolf pack got stronger and bigger, in order to protect the young and healthy lightning wolves, the wolf king would expel all these old and sickly wolves in order to allocate resources efficiently.These lightning wolves gathered together and rushed towards the surrounding beast groups, and under each other's influence, eventually formed this small beast horde.The five lightning wolves quickly had casualties under the Gu Masters\u2019 attacks.They were too full from eating, and their stomachs expanded, affecting their battle strength. At the same time, new arriving Gu Masters had sufficient primeval essence in their aperture and had their peak battle strength, unlike Jiao San and the rest.Primeval essence was especially important to Gu Masters. A weakened phoenix is inferior to a chicken, with less primeval essence, a Gu Master\u2019s battle strength would fall rapidly. And without primeval essence, they were even inferior to mortals.Why do you think for example, the Liquor worm, Black and White Boar Gu, these Gu were so precious?It had to do with this fact.Firstly, with the Liquor worm, it can refine primeval essence and allow Gu Masters to store much more primeval essence. (Remember that higher tier essence is essentially double of the previous tier 88% Mid tier = 44% Upper tier)And the Black and White Boar Gu worms gave Gu Masters strength. Without requiring primeval essence, they can unleash their worth. And for the Black and White Boar Gu, once one person has used them, they can be given to another person to use, showing great collective value in a group.The battle continued for a while and stopped.The five lightning wolves continued to fall, and the new reinforcement group did not venture further. Their primeval essence had been used up nearly, and their battle strength had been greatly reduced. To be safe, they stopped on the spot. As they recovered, they awaited further reinforcements.A group of five, with the reconnaissance Gu Master keeping alert while the other three used primeval stones to recover their primeval essence, the healing Gu Master bent down and observed the female Gu Master\u2019s corpse.\"She\u2019s dead...\" Healing Gu Master sighed deeply. Seeing his sad expression, it seemed like he knew the female Gu Master.Fang Yuan watched coldly.This female Gu Master which he had knocked unconscious was blocking in front of him. Now she had lost her right chest, and a leg. Her arm was also greatly injured by the wolves, eaten until the bones could be seen.But these injuries and the massive loss of blood was not the true cause of her death.What caused her demise, was cardiac arrest.The lightning wolves\u2019 bites carried electric currents with them. The currents flowed into the female Gu Master\u2019s body while she was unconscious, and caused her to have a heart attack.The originally beautiful and sexy body was now lying on the ground, still and unmoving. Her previous glamour was nowhere to be found, being just an ugly dead corpse now.\"She\u2019s dead, and it is all your fault! As a man, why did you hide behind a woman? You\u2019re a disgrace to men!\" The healing Gu Master looked up, staring at Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan shrugged emotionlessly, his expression calm, \"The truth is, she competed with me over the spot, but eventually I won, so I\u2019m very glad about the results.\"\"Scumbag!!\" The healing Gu Master rushed up.Bam.Fang Yuan raised his feet and sent him flying.Healing Gu Masters were normally weak at combat, and because of the clan rules, he did not dare to use his Gu worms. Just competing with physical strength, how can he be Fang Yuan\u2019s match?\"This detestable guy!\" Healing Gu Master crawled up with a dusty face and wanted to rush up again, but was stopped by the reconnaissance Gu Master.\"If you think I committed a crime and caused her to die, you can report it to the punishment hall, I\u2019ll take it,\" Fang Yuan said lightly as he stared at the healing Gu Master, and left.\"Damn! Damn it!\" The healing Gu Master\u2019s eyes were blowing fire as he stared at Fang Yuan\u2019s backview, urging to rush up but was restrained by his teammates.\"Calm the hell down!\"\"Even if you report it to the punishment hall, the clan won\u2019t punish him!\"\"We know you liked her, but although the clan cannot punish him, we can spread this matter out...\"Under the urging of his teammates, the healing Gu Master calmed down and lowered his head, crying.\"A boat encountered trouble, a man grabbed onto a wooden plank and was temporarily saved. At this time, another man swam up and wanted to grab the plank as well, but this plank can only hold the weight of one man, so the first man pushed the second man away so that he could be safe, causing the other person to drown in the sea. The rescued man was later tried in court but declared not guilty. This is the wooden plank incident on earth.\"\"Meaning, to save oneself under forced circumstances, endangering another person\u2019s life is no crime. On Earth, it is the Necessity Law. In this world, there are similar clan rules. This means, even if the healing Gu Master reports it to the punishment hall, I will not be punished. But....\"Fang Yuan continued to walk as he pondered. He moved in a steady pace without any rush.Along the path that had been cleared, Fang Yuan would discover corpses, the majority of these being wild beasts of all kinds of varieties, and in the mix were some Gu Master corpses.At the same time, there were small rescue groups rushing to the front lines. When they met Fang Yuan on the way, they would look at this bloody young man with curious and confused gazes.Fang Yuan paid no attention to them. His eyes were a dark abyss, continuing his train of thought.\"But\u2026...\"\u00a0If the fact that I knocked the female Gu Master unconscious was found out, I would be tried for \u2018harming a clansman\u2019. Yet at that time, nobody should have seen it, Jiao San and Kong Jing were all looking at a different direction and rushing for their lives. Eh?\"Fang Yuan\u2019s footsteps came to a halt.He saw the corpses of Kong Jing and Jiao San.The former\u2019s body had already been eaten until it was unrecognisable, while the latter\u2019s corpse was still well preserved.The red lava python was already a pile of lava rocks, completely dead. And beside the sickly snake, there were a few lightning wolves\u2019 corpses. Evidently Jiao San\u2019s final struggle caused a huge battle.\"Good, that means that other than me, everyone else is dead.\" Fang Yuan evaluated internally, feeling joy.\"This means I would have less restrictions around me\u2026. Eh?\" Fang Yuan stopped, he saw Jiao San\u2019s finger twitch softly.\"Not dead, what a stubborn life\u2026\" Fang Yuan snickered, killing intent rising again.At this point, there was tens of healing Gu Masters coming from the front.\"Quick, save the injured!\"\"They are our clansmen, we have to save what we can!\"\"If they are confirmed dead, retrieved their Gu worms.\"Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze concentrated.What to do?They were so close, he would have to take a huge risk to kill Jiao San. Whether using strangulation or a moonblade, there will be traces.In front of these Gu Masters, he had no time to clear the traces.So... let him live?Even if Jiao San is treated now, he might not survive.NO!\"If I can exterminate Jiao San, there would be a lot lesser opposition in my way. Such an opportunity, if lost, I would have a hard time finding another one.\"Thinking of this, Fang Yuan had an inspiration.He gradually half-kneeled beside Jiao San, removing his upper shirt and covering Jiao San\u2019s face and upper body.He was inside the boar\u2019s stomach for a long time, so the pig\u2019s blood had soaked his shirt, causing it to be heavy and wet.He put the upperwear on Jiao San\u2019s nose and mouth, preventing him from breathing.Fang Yuan half-kneeled, silently watching, his expression solemn and pained.At this point, a Gu Master came over, \"Little lad, I am the medicine hall\u2019s Gu Master, let me take a look...\"\"Scram!\" Fang Yuan growled angrily, pushing him away.The Gu Master fell on the ground, but he was not angry, instead consoling him, \"Little brother, my condolences! I know how you feel right now and I know how it feels to see the clansmen that you live with die in front of you. But you are covered in blood now, you must be heavily injured. For the sake of these sacrificed clansmen, you have to live properly. Come, let me heal you.\"Fang Yuan did not open his mouth. He remained silent, the lower half of his face covered in a dark shadow. He allowed this Gu Master to check his body.The result was rather surprising. Although Fang Yuan was bathed in blood, appearing terrifying to everyone, he actually had no injuries at all!But the Gu Master quickly collected his spirits, concentrating on Jiao San.\"I\u2019m very sorry, the clan needs to take back the Gu worms.\" The Gu Master sincerely looked at Fang Yuan, then he lifted the bloody shirt slowly off Jiao San.Jiao San\u2019s eyes were half open without any life in them.The Gu Master professionally used his finger to prop open Jiao San\u2019s eyelids, looking at his iris and then touching his neck. But he felt no pulse.Dead.Completely dead.The Gu Master did not suspect anything. He sighed and placed his hand at Jiao San\u2019s stomach.His stomach still had some warmth and the aperture was slowly disappearing; there were no Gu worms inside.The Gu Master looked at Fang Yuan, whether intentionally or unintentionally, \"Every Gu Master\u2019s Gu worm is stated in writing, and after a Gu Master dies, his Gu worms will be treated as an inheritance for his inheritor. Taking it for oneself is against the clan rules.\"Fang Yuan was fearless, staring right at the Gu Master, \"Of course I know that. You suspect that I took the group leader\u2019s Gu worms?\"Taking these Gu worms involved risks and trouble. If his secrets were dragged out, they would bring more loss than gain. Fang Yuan knew this, even if with the Spring Autumn Cicada he could instantly refine any Gu, it was difficult to do in the clan. It was not worth inviting such troubles for these minute gains.Apart from than this, there was another point \u2014 with his financial status now, even if he got them, he might not be able to feed them.To Fang Yuan\u2019s question, the Gu Master laughed quickly, \"I did not mean that! People cannot come back to life after dying, so please restrain your grief, little brother. For the sake of the deceased, you have to live even better!\"Fang Yuan gradually stood up.He used an extremely sad and pained expression, staring at sickly snake\u2019s corpse with rapt attention.The night wind howled in his ears.\"You are right.\" After a while, Fang Yuan broke the silence, his gaze determined, saying with an intentional meaning, \"For the sake of those who died, I have to live even better than before.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Devils run amuckTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowInternal affairs hall, interrogation room.The light of the winter sun shone on the ground through the only window.Fine dust particles slowly floated on the light pillar.The light pillar enshrouded a chair.Fang Yuan was sitting on that chair, bathing in the sunshine.In the darkness ahead of him was a long table where three elders were seated.The interrogation had already continued for an hour.\"Fang Yuan, are you sure there are no mistakes in your narration?\" An elder asked.\"Yes.\" Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes were down, looking at his toes. The sunshine shone on his fair face, making him look like a white sculpture.He had already expected this situation.After all, all his group members had died except him.In fact, every Gu Master would go through a certain degree of interrogation which conveniently helped the clan to gather battle statistics. But, Fang Yuan was continuously interrogated for an hour; clearly, someone was making it difficult for him from behind the scenes.This was completely understandable.As long as one was human and had social relations, there would be series of people involved.\"Then narrate your account on the battle situation at that time again.\" The elder continued to ask.\"Okay. I used several days to breakthrough to Rank two. Upon returning to the village gate, I met Chi Shan group\u2026 and reunited with Jiao San group after finding them. At that time, they were having a fierce fight with the wild boar king\u2026\" Fang Yuan calmly narrated.He took the initiative to reveal his breakthrough to Rank two. With no concealing Gu worm, he wouldn\u2019t be able to conceal his Rank two aura.Now the sickly snake and the team were dead, so he naturally fabricated the events. But, he could only conceal some main details and narrate the majority of the events as they were.This was already the fifth time Fang Yuan narrated the events. The three elders frowned as they listened.They couldn\u2019t find any holes, but they knew - if it was fabricated, then there would be unnecessary details. After one kept on talking about it several times, there would naturally be holes. But after five times, although there were some differences in how Fang Yuan narrated the events, the contents were the same.\"It should be true.\" The three elders communicated with each other using eye signals.But one elder was not satisfied.Her daughter was the sickly snake group\u2019s healing Gu Master whom she loved dearly but ended up dying a cruel death in the wolves\u2019 mouths. Thus she was very angry and her gaze carried coldness as she looked at Fang Yuan.\"Fang Yuan, you cut the knife scales net with your moonblades, why did you do it?\" This middle-aged female elder spoke sternly.\"Because I wanted to have some contributions, but it ended up being a bad move.\" Fang Yuan replied.\"Then let me ask you, did you intentionally use your teammate - the female Gu Master - as a shield when you hid in the boar\u2019s stomach?\" The elder asked again.\"I don\u2019t know. I was very scared at that time and hurriedly tried to hide inside the boar king, but she also entered inside and fought me for the inside position. She couldn\u2019t win me and was bitten to death by the lightning wolves. I am ashamed.\" Fang Yuan answered.The middle-aged female elder grinded her teeth. Fang Yuan\u2019s answer was cunning, he only stated the fact but didn\u2019t mention his subjective intentions at all. This made the elders who wanted to suppress him, not find any handle on him; their hearts were filled with anger but they couldn\u2019t do anything.Under such situation, they couldn\u2019t judge Fang Yuan guilty.It had already been three days since the small beast tide.The statistics of the casualties made all the higher ups have ugly expressions.There were losses in the past small beast tides too but they were definitely not as grave as this. The cause was the lightning wolves pack. Before, these lightning wolves packs would only appear after at least three waves of small beast tide.The environment was dangerous in this world; survival, difficult.From a human standpoint, to survive, apart from fighting with other humans for resources, they still had to struggle against fierce beasts and nasty weathers.And these struggles were often very difficult.The small beast tide was still only a prelude. The real terror would be the large wolf tide, a year after. Tens of thousands of lightning wolves would charge towards the village with the terrifyingly powerful lightning wolf king.The female elder continued to ask several questions but she had to finally give up under Fang Yuan\u2019s invulnerable answers.\"Then Fang Yuan, what do you plan to do from now on?\" Another elder asked with deep intention.\"I plan to apply for the family assets, inheriting and continuing my family\u2019s heritage.\" Fang Yuan spoke openly, there was no need to conceal it.Sickly snake group was destroyed and now only Fang Yuan was left. Because of this, he didn\u2019t have to use Rank two Gu Master\u2019s right to give up a mission and could accept the family assets mission.The elder nodded his head then shook his head, \"You didn\u2019t understand my meaning. Apart from you, your group is no more. I can give you a suggestion: Join another group. Internal affairs hall\u2019s missions difficulty is designed for groups, it is very difficult for a lone person to complete them. Whether it is your family inheritance mission or the compulsory monthly missions, they are both like this.\"Fang Yuan was silent.This elder continued, \"Of course, there is another option. You are already a Rank two Gu Master. You have the qualifications to become a group captain. You just need to pass the examination mission and you can build your own group. Which do you want to choose?\"Fang Yuan blinked his eyes: \"I don\u2019t know yet, I need some time to consider.\"\"Then you can leave. Think it over as soon as possible. After a few days pass, it will be difficult for you to join a group,\" the elder said concernedly.Fang Yuan sneered inwardly, he wouldn\u2019t choose any of these two paths.He had a lot of secrets. Only by himself could he be safe and do things properly. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t he be annoyed to death if there were others with him all the time?Leaving this interrogation room, Fang Yuan didn\u2019t immediately leave the internal affairs hall but instead applied for the family inheritance mission. However, he was informed that he could only take it after three days due to the busy events recently.Coming out of the internal affairs hall, he gazed at the sky.It was just an ordinary winter afternoon.The winter was bleak along with biting wind. The sky seemed to be pervaded with deep grief.\"Today is group memorial assembly. Gu Yue Jin Zhu is dead, did you know, Fang Yuan?\" Mo Bei, along with a group of youths, were walking through the path.Other than Mo Bei, there were Fang Zheng, Chi Cheng and others.Mo Bei and Chi Cheng normally hated each other very much, but today, they seemed to forget this grievance and walked together.\"Big brother, Jin Zhu studied with us for a year. Come with us.\" Fang Zheng said.Gu Yue Jin Zhu\u2026A girl\u2019s image immediately appeared in Fang Yuan\u2019s mind.Previously, she had been evenly matched with Mo Bei on the arena but lost because of her lacking stamina. She was a hardworking girl.But, death didn\u2019t discriminate between beauty and ugly.Most people would feel pity, but Fang Yuan was indifferent as usual.\"Ah, she is dead? But dying of old or sickness, they are both normal events. After seeing it many times you\u2019ll be indifferent to it. You guys go, I am busy.\" Fang Yuan brushed past the group.\"This guy!\" At once, many among the group were angered.\"He is really cold-blooded and heartless\u2026\"\"He simply doesn\u2019t have a feeling of friendship!\"\"Hehe, there is a rumor going around recently. You should have all heard it, right? The reason Fang Yuan survived was because he hid inside a boar\u2019s stomach and used his female Gu Master teammate as a shield.\"\"He is really a disgrace with no worth. He doesn\u2019t even have the manners of a man.\" Chi Cheng folded his arms and laughed coldly.\"Big brother\u2026\" Fang Zheng lowered his head and grinded his teeth.Hearing these discussions, as Fang Yuan\u2019s little brother, he felt shame.Fang Yuan left and as he walked farther, the mockeries behind him gradually couldn\u2019t be heard anymore.His heart was calm.\"Why would insults matter to me?\"Insults were insults, what could they do?A superficial person would be angry due to curses and would be happy due to praises.These were just bystanders\u2019 way of looking at you. Those who lived according to other\u2019s point of view were really pitiful.In fact, some people had deliberately spread the rumors to degrade Fang Yuan\u2019s name.Sacrificing a female teammate to protect oneself wouldn\u2019t be subjected to punishment, but would be criticized by moral consensus.But, this was the exact situation Fang Yuan wanted.Once one enters the system, one would be a pawn with no freedom and must follow the system\u2019s rules. To Fang Yuan, it was a huge obstacle, he needed resources and even more needed to be solitary.So, he wanted to be a loner.What if you were rejected by the crowd? Haha, only weak-hearted people would be afraid of being rejected.If this happened on Earth, no matter who, they would end up dead. After all, two fists can\u2019t beat four hands, social connections were the way to survival.But in this world, if the cultivation was strong, one person could beat ten, hundreds and thousands of enemies. So what if you were rejected, just kill the ones who block your path. If you don\u2019t have resources, snatch them.Every world had different rules and regulations, the society structure was also bound to be different, causing the difference in human behaviours.And in a world of martial arts, group thoughts were rather weak.So in this world \u2014Devils run amuck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That lad, he\u2019s a Rank two Gu Master now, and even applied for the asset-splitting mission from the internal affairs hall!\" Uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu\u2019s furious and shocked voice reverbed throughout the main hall.\"That is indeed so. Although I accepted your primeval stones, I cannot do much to stop him, I only managed to tell him to collect the mission in three days. I can only stall that long for you, that is my limit.\" The middle-aged Gu Master beside him said.Gu Yue Dong Tu snorted in his heart, he could sense the hidden meaning in the internal affairs hall\u2019s Gu Master\u2019s words.\u2018Stall for three days, it is the limit\u2019, such words were merely an excuse to extort even more money.\"But, top priority now is still to do all I can to retain the assets. This rascal is really too troubling!\" Gu Yue Dong Tu\u2019s sweat poured from his forehead as Fang Yuan\u2019s growth was so rapid it gave him the feeling of a heart attack.\"I came here especially to tell you this, so I\u2019ll take my leave now.\" The middle-aged man stood up to depart.\"Don\u2019t be in such a rush, brother. There are some things I still need for you to assist me a little with.\" Gu Yue Dong Tu hurriedly stood up, retrieving a money bag and stuffing it into the middle-aged Gu Master\u2019s hand.The male Gu Master took the entire bag of primeval stones and stuffed it into his chest pocket, his tone quickly changing, laughing loudly. \"Brother Dong Tu, you are too polite. We have such a great relationship, we\u2019ve known each other for over ten years. Don\u2019t worry, I will prepare the toughest mission for Fang Yuan, but he might employ other Gu Masters to help him. You have to watch out for this.\"\"Hehehe, you can be rest assured. Although I have retired, I still have my relationships, I\u2019ve sent people to observe him. If that lad employs outsiders, that is against the clan rules, and I am still waiting to get a hold of his weakness. Hehe...\"\"Then I am at ease, goodbye.\"\"Let me send you out.\"\"It is okay, please stay.\"Gu Yue Dong Tu stared at the leaving Gu Master, his smile slowly collapsing.\"This Fang Yuan, he is only C grade, how can he advance to Rank two so soon?! Dammit, what were Jiao San and the others doing! Can\u2019t even guard against a newbie.\"\"Sigh, now Jiao San and the team were all killed by the beast horde, what incompetent fools. Fang Yuan also advanced to Rank two, this way he can definitely receive the family asset mission. My previous methods to block him will no longer work. But he is now working alone, and aiming to complete the asset inheritance mission alone is really difficult.\"\"No! This lad\u2019s luck is absurd, first I got Jiao San and the rest to suppress him, and immediately the beast horde came. If he relies on this luck again and completes the mission, what then? I have to prepare for the worst!\"An old sly fox, Gu Yue Dong Tu being able to enter and leave the fighting life peacefully and live up until now, it represented success already.Compared to the newly independent Fang Yuan, his interpersonal relationships were much stronger.\"Collecting honey wine?\" When Fang Yuan received the asset mission, his eyes shone with cold glimmer.This mission was very troublesome, it was to collect five Liang(1) of golden bee\u2019s honey wine. Golden bees were all fist-sized with gold and black stripes, and they had a sharp stinger packed with a strong attack.That was not all. Among normal small hives, there was only honey. Only those large or medium hives had the precious honey wine made from a large accumulation of honey.\"This mission, even for a five-man group, is very difficult. Because the number of people no longer matter, the Gu Master collecting honey wine has to have a defensive-type Gu to withstand the stings. It seems that uncle\u2019s relationship has struck and is bullying my lack of a defensive Gu worm. Unfortunately for him... \" Fang Yuan laughed coldly in his heart.At this point, it showed the inherent benefits of the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance.Easy to do things secretly, difficult to do things openly.The more one worked openly, the more their trump cards get revealed, and they become easier to trap. Conversely, working secretly helps to hide trump cards and lets others be unable to assess your situation, thus not being able to nip the problem in the bud.\"But, if I want to collect honey wine, the Jade Skin Gu isn\u2019t enough. Jade Skin Gu is only a Rank one Gu, but if it can advance to the Rank two White Jade Gu, I would be able to do it easily.\"WIthout the need to attempt to take risks, his rich life experience allowed him to take less pointless steps.Speaking of which, Fang Yuan is already a Rank two initial stage Gu Master, but the Gu worms on him, other than the Spring Autumn Cicada, were all Rank two Gu worms.This situation is like a grown man who is able to wield a halberd only holding a small dagger. The dagger is unable to display the full extent of the man\u2019s strength, and only with a halberd is it the most suitable.Fang Yuan had seven Gu worms in his possession.The vital Gu Spring Autumn Cicada, Moonlight Gu, Liquor worm, White Boar Gu, Jade Skin Gu and two Little Light Gu.In this mix, the Moonlight Gu can fuse with the two Little Light Gu to form the Moonglow Gu. The White Boar Gu and Jade Skin Gu can fuse into White Jade Gu.Moonglow Gu represents a surge in attack power, while White Jade Gu is an increase in defense.If Fang Yuan had enough primeval stones, he would choose to refine them both. But not long ago, in order to push his cultivation to Rank two, he expended most of his primeval stones. Now, with the primeval stones on hand, it was only enough for one use.\"Undoubtedly, choosing to refine the White Jade Gu is a better choice. With the White Jade Gu, I can retrieve the honey wine. And with the White Jade Gu, I can advance better in the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s inheritance. But if this fusion fails, the results will be dire. My finances are on the brink of collapse, so without the White Jade Gu, I cannot get my parent's assets. Stuck at this point, it will greatly slow my growth.\"Fang Yuan felt a subtle pressure.He knew that he was at a crossroad, and if this fusion succeeds, the future is bright. If he fails, then he would fall into the abyss. To get back to the current point, he would need even more effort in management and spend a longer time.\u2026...\"Gu Masters use their primeval sea as the base, and Gu worms as the method. Gu is a Gu Master\u2019s necessity, without Gu they are not Gu Masters. Other than their own cultivation, Gu Masters also have to refine, nurture and use Gu.\"In the room, clan leader Gu Yue Bo meticulously explained to Fang Zheng.\"Refine, nurture, and use. These three aspects, whichever one is also a huge knowledge trove. Even if you spend an entire lifetime, you cannot completely finish it. On the aspect of refining Gu, you already know how to refine a Gu and make it yours. But this is only a single refinement. There is also the more important aspect of fusion.\"Through fusion, you can fuse multiple Gu worms into one with a higher rank. This is the evolution of life. Fang Zheng, you are already a Rank two Gu Master, but your Gu worms are all Rank one. It is time you refine a Rank two Gu worm.\"Fang Zheng asked, \"Clan leader, how do I do fusion?\"Gu Yue Bo said, \"To fuse, you have to know the recipe. Some Gu worms cannot be fused together. Through many eons of trial and error, and endless failures, our ancestors have come up with several recipes. Our Gu Yue clan has the most in-depth research with the Moonlight Gu, and we now have two Rank five recipes on hand.\"\"What is a Rank five recipe?\"\"In accordance to this recipe, through multiple fusions, one can finally refine up to a Rank five Gu worm. Fang Zheng, you have one Jade Skin Gu and a Moonlight Gu on hand, it satisfies the condition for one of the Rank five recipes. If you follow this recipe, you will get the Rank five Gu eventually \u2014 Moonlight Treasure King Gu!\"\"Moonlight Treasure King Gu?\" Fang Zheng\u2019s face was full of desire.\"Hehehe, telling you about a Rank five Gu now is still too early. Come, take out your Jade Skin and Moonlight Gu, I\u2019ll teach you how to fuse these two Gu into the Rank two Moon Raiment!\"Saying so, Gu Yue Bo\u2019s expression turned solemn, \"The most important thing about fusing Gu is parallel thinking, fusing your consciousness. The Moonlight Gu and Jade Skin Gu in your hands now have no wild consciousness anymore, overwritten by your own consciousness. What you have to do now is to fuse these two thoughts together.\"\"Fuse together?\" Fang Zheng blinked, confused.Gu Yue Bo smiled, \"No worries, practise more, you will be able to grab hold of this feeling. Let\u2019s begin.\"\"Mm.\" Fang Zheng nodded, and under Gu Yue Bo\u2019s guidance, his light red-coloured red steel primeval essence rose like smoke, enveloping the Jade Skin Gu and the Moonlight Gu in midair.Fang Zheng shut his eyes, feeling and manipulating the two Gu worm\u2019s consciousness.Gu Yue Bo was outside watching, and saw the Jade Skin Gu and Moonlight Gu circling each other like two planets.As the consciousness fused, the distance between the two Gu worms shortened.After three hours of continuous tries, their consciousness was finally controlled by Fang Zheng, and fused together perfectly.At once, the Jade Skin Gu and Moonlight Gu both erupted in a bright white light.The two lights linked together, forming a lump as big as a face.\"Maintain this condition, and throw primeval stones into the light.\" Gu Yue Bo advised.Fang Zheng took out a primeval stone and threw it into the light.Strangely, after throwing the primeval stones in, the stones turned into a surge of pure natural essence, completely fusing with the lump of light. Only rock powder remained, scattering on the bed.\"Continue throwing until the Rank two Gu is complete.\" Gu Yue Bo said.Fang Zheng was about to throw a second piece, but at this point, the light disappeared, and the two Gu flew in two opposite directions like they were pushed away ruthlessly by each other.The fusion failed.\"Damn, I forgot to maintain the fusion of the consciousness earlier.\" Fang Zheng immediately realized his mistake.\"No worries, failing at the start is normal.\" Gu Yue Bo consoled, but reminded, \"But be careful, you cannot fail too many times, if not both the Moonlight and Jade Skin Gu will perish.\"Fang Zheng recalled back the Jade Skin Gu and Moonlight Gu, and found cracks on the Moonlight Gu\u2019s surface, while the Jade Skin Gu looked like it was weakened.His heart sank, feeling the difficulty of refining Gu.(1) Liang - one Liang is 31.25grams.(2) So to make it clear just in case: \u70bc\u86ca - refine Gu, \u5408\u70bc\u86ca - fusion/fusing Gu. Fusion is part of the process of refining a Gu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Human, not GodTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowCrash...Great waves tumbled in the primeval sea, rising up and down.The sea was light-red in color. This was not the green copper sea of a Rank one, but a red steel sea.The aperture was covered with a layer of light coating; this was the appearance of Rank two initial stage.The whole red steel primeval essence sea occupied 44% of the aperture. Above the sea, the Spring Autumn Cicada appeared.After going through a year of recuperation, it had already somewhat recovered.Previously, there was no shine from its body, it looked rough and dim like withered wood. Now, it had some gloss to it.Its two wings had been like the yellowed and withered leaves of autumn and the tips had been damaged. Now, there was some green to it and there were black leaf lines on its tips, making a complete arc without any previous defect.\"Spring Autumn Cicada, spring and autumn\u2026 I see now, it needs to experience the changes of spring and autumn to recover. Since rebirth, a year has passed by, which means a turn of spring and autumn, and so it has recovered.\"Fang Yuan looked at the Spring Autumn Cicada and this thought rose within him, increasing his understanding of the Spring Autumn Cicada by another stage.A Gu Master needs to refine, nurture and use Gu. Among them \u2018use\u2019 was further classified and contained myriads of variations. Fang Yuan had been in contact with the Spring Autumn Cicada all the time; his comprehension of the Spring Autumn Cicada was slowly accumulating and deepening.\"But the Spring Autumn Cicada is still weak, it has only moved a few steps away from nearing death. I can only use its aura to suppress Gu worms and increase the efficiency of single refining. As for fusing, it won\u2019t be of any help.\"There were mystical Gu worms that raised the success rate of fusion. Everything had their own specialities; Spring Autumn Cicada possessed the ability of rebirth.Other than the Spring Autumn Cicada, there was the fat Liquor worm which was curled up in a round ball, floating and playing around in the sea.The ladybug-like White Boar Gu and the Jade Skin Gu which had green jade color were revolving around each other.Fang Yuan opened his eyes and slowly unfolded his right palm. In it were the imprints of a crescent moon and two five-sided stars.They were precisely the residence of the Moonlight Gu and the two Little Light Gu.Fang Yuan sat cross-legged on the bed, his line of sight falling on the bed sheet.There were three money bags on the bed sheet; two were bulging and one was mostly thinned out. Apart from this, there was also a snow-white tusk from the wild boar king. It looked like an elephant\u2019s tusk, lying close to Fang Yuan\u2019s leg on the bed sheet.Sickly snake group had used all their strength to kill the wild boar king, but they met with the lightning wolf pack\u2019s attacks and the majority of the skin and flesh of the wild boar king had been eaten away by the lightning wolves. The two snow white tusks were thus the most valuable spoils of war.According to the clan\u2019s rules and regulations, Fang Yuan - being one of the members in killing the wild boar king - received one of the wild boar king\u2019s tusks.Fang Yuan looked at these items, his expression was heavy. \"I don\u2019t have much primeval stones left and it is only enough for one fusion. After this fusion, no matter success or failure, my financial condition will drop. But if I don\u2019t fuse it now, my primeval stones will only last for twelve or so days and I will even lose the chance to fuse.\"Fang Yuan was raising seven Gu worms so he had a large financial burden. And because of his C grade aptitude, he had to repeatedly use the Liquor worm to quickly improve his cultivation. Thus, his primeval stone consumption was more than an ordinary Gu Master\u2019s.Recently, he no longer used primeval stones to recover the primeval essence in his aperture. The red steel sea in his body now was all recovered by its natural self-recovery rate.Fang Yuan was already beginning to cut the primeval stones consumption; he couldn\u2019t misuse them after calculating his expenditures.The current situation was like he was about to fall from a cliff. He could only grab on to the wild grass at the side of the cliff to stabilize his body without falling.But as time passed, these lifelines would be continuously used up. If he didn\u2019t take any risks, it wouldn\u2019t take long for him to fall off the cliff.What he had to do now was to use these lifelines and climb up the cliff with all his strength.If he succeeded, he could seize the opportunity to obtain the family inheritance and ascend to another level and it would be a whole new scene in front of him.If he lost, he would drop down and in trying to climb up to this stage again, he would need to spend large amount of time and energy.\"No matter what happens, let\u2019s begin.\" Fang Yuan took in a deep breath and focused his gaze.White Boar Gu, Jade Skin Gu!The two Gu worms followed his will, drilling out of his aperture and floating in front of Fang Yuan.\"Fuse!\" Fang Yuan shouted inwardly. White Boar Gu and Jade Skin Gu suddenly emitted dazzling lights and directly bumped into each other.This was a silent bump, but it created a ball of light.The white light was more dazzling than before.This showed that Fang Yuan\u2019s two consciousness were fusing.Fang Yuan used his consciousness to maintain the white ball of light white taking out primeval stones from the bag and throwing them into the ball of light.The primeval stones were engulfed by the ball of light and only rock powders remained, scattering on the bed. Each time the ball of light swallowed a primeval stone, its edges would expand a little.The ball of light absorbed the natural primeval essence and became bigger and bigger.Gradually, it changed from the size of a washbowl to a grindstone size.\"Almost there.\" Fang Yuan narrowed his eyes; he decisively threw the wild boar king\u2019s snow-white tusk into the ball of light.If anyone were to witness this scene, they would be astonished. The secret recipe of fusing White Boar Gu and Jade Skin Gu to form White Jade Gu was well known and circulated for over thousand years, but no one had ever heard of adding in a wild boar king\u2019s snowy tusk.However, not being used in the past doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t be in the future.One hundred and fifty years from now, a Gu Master would improvise this recipe; he discovered that adding a wild boar\u2019s tusk would greatly increase the fusion success rate.Fang Yuan had five hundred years of experience, he naturally knew of this trick.The snowy tusk was thrown into the ball of light and a fantastic transformation happened immediately.The previously dazzling light turned softer. The light that was blindly shooting off everywhere now had a movement pattern to it, naturally changing between light and dark.Under Fang Yuan\u2019s gaze, the ball of light slowly shrunk and finally dissipated into the air.Instead of the Jade Skin Gu and White Boar Gu, there was now a completely new Gu worm calmly hovering in front of Fang Yuan.It was like an oval pebble, its whole body was completely white; this white was not pale like Xuan paper and was not milky white like milk, but was a kind of moist white like that of the luster of jade.This was \u2014 Rank two White Jade Gu!Only now did Fang Yuan let out a mouthful of turbid air, his heart relieved.You might think that this process looks simple. It is not.First, the consciousness merging needed multitasking.Drawing a circle with one hand and a square with another is called dual tasking. A lot of people cannot even do this, let alone the highly difficult multi-tasking.One can only achieve multi-tasking after years of hard cultivation, suffering through countless defeats and setbacks, and even then one would still need some talent.Fang Yuan could do this so proficiently because of his five hundred years of deep experience; not a hint of his experience was fake or forged.Second was understanding and knowledge of Gu worms.The deeper the Gu Master\u2019s understanding of Gu worms, the higher the success rate of fusing.This point, in about three hundred years from now, would be a widely recognized knowledge.Thus, the longer you use Gu worms, the greater the probability of success in Gu fusion.Third was the correct and original recipe.For example, this time, adding the snowy tusk was like the finishing touch, increasing the success rate by 20%. Its efficiency was extraordinary.Some recipes were widely spread in this world, but there were many recipes which people would collect and weren\u2019t circulated.Such as in the Gu Yue village, the recipe of refining Moonlight Gu was held by a small number of elders and successive generations of clan leaders.Especially those rank five and above recipes. They would be hidden and treasured like their lives. Many Gu Masters would not spread these recipes until death.But even with these three points, there was no absolute guarantee of success. Even a person like Fang Yuan who had five hundred years of memories, plentiful experiences, deep understanding of Gu worms, could multitask and knew a lot of recipes, had a possibility of failure when fusing Gu worms.One can only say that his failure rate is lower.Fusing Gu worms was an evolution of life, a type of creation. It condensed time to the extreme, making the long evolution process bear fruit in an instant.On earth, only gods could do this.This was no doubt a miracle of life. Gu Masters making divine intervention with a mortal body, how could it succeed every time?If it succeeded every time, that would not be human, but god.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: White Jade GuTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: SkyfarrowIn the blink of an eye, ten more days passed.Deep in the mountain, in the underground rock forest.Squeakkkkk!Tens of jade eye stone monkeys jumped in the air with blurred silhouettes.They continued to leap and attacked Fang Yuan aggressively.If it was like before, Fang Yuan would retreat without a doubt. But now, he stood on the spot with a cold expression, still like a rock.The stone monkeys slammed, scratched, and bit Fang Yuan\u2019s body, but a crisp \u2018ding ding\u2019 sound could be heard, as if they were not attacking a person, but a sturdy jade pillar.A bright white jade light covered the area as it attached itself to Fang Yuan\u2019s body. This light, although it was thinner than the Jade Skin Gu\u2019s jade green glow, it had more than twice of the defensive power.Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense can only handle up to sixteen monkeys\u2019 simultaneous attack, but now Fang Yuan could face off against more than thirty monkeys alone.\"On the arena, I could break Fang Zheng\u2019s Jade Skin Gu\u2019s defense with my bare fists, but if Fang Zheng used this White Jade Gu, even if I broke my wrist bone, I would not be able to penetrate his defenses.\"Fang Yuan pondered while diverting a part of his thoughts towards his aperture sea.In the red steel primeval sea, the White Jade Gu sank to the bottom of the sea, constantly absorbing primeval essence. Its surface also emitted a faint white jade glow, like a lightbulb.Every time the stone monkeys attack Fang Yuan, the White Jade Gu\u2019s surface which resembled an oval pebble would flash faintly.At the same time, Fang Yuan could feel a trace of his primeval essence being expended.\"White Jade Gu\u2019s defense is the same type as the Jade Skin Gu, they both require a continuous source of primeval essence. At the same time, the greater the intensity of the attack, the more primeval essence is expended.\" Fang Yuan concluded in his heart.At the same time, he counterattacked.Punches and kicks kicked up a sandstorm. His strikes were simple, yet brutal and effective with an imposing aura.Although the White Boar Gu was gone, the strength it gave to Fang Yuan still remained in his body.Endless monkeys were hit by Fang Yuan. Some were kicked away, knocking on the stone pillar; some were killed in midair, turning into stone and breaking into fragments when they landed on the ground.At the same time, with a flick of his wrist, Fang Yuan sent moonblades flying around, like the scythe of the reaper, harvesting the lives of the stone monkeys.With the supply of red steel primeval essence, the Rank one Moonlight Gu could cause the greatest attack damage to the monkeys with every hit.Squeak squeak...The stone monkeys screamed in fright, retreating.Fang Yuan had exterminated the stone monkeys in a short moment of counterattack, with only five or six remaining.Fang Yuan killed another, and the remaining stone monkeys broke down, frantically running around and escaping deep into the stone forest.Fang Yuan did not chase these escapees, but continued forwards deeper into the stone forest.These days, he had been working hard to find the next clue for the inheritance. With continuous exploring, he had stepped foot on most of the areas around the stone forest, but did not find anything.He had a hunch, vaguely guessing the Flower Wine Monk\u2019s idea. He felt that the next step of the inheritance was likely linked to the most central area of the stone forest.The deeper he got into the forest, the larger the stone pillars were, and the more stone monkeys lived inside them.Fang Yuan walked as he observed \u2014 at the center of the stone forest, there was a large stone pillar. Its circumference was wider than tens of men surrounding it and attempting to hug it.This stone pillar was his objective.But, the deeper he got, the larger the monkey gangs, and the higher the difficulty.Fang Yuan took a crucial step out and entered the alert zone of a group of monkeys.Squeak squeak squeak!The black caves in the stone pillar had emerging furious jade eye stone monkeys, and up to a hundred jumped in Fang Yuan\u2019s direction.Fang Yuan ran for his life.Against so many monkeys, even with the White Jade Gu, he could not massacre them.The stone monkeys chased Fang Yuan for a while, then some started to abandon the chase and turned around, going back to their caves. Eventually, only thirty or so monkeys trailed after Fang Yuan.Fang Yuan seeing the time was right, turned around and fought.After a round of fighting, the last few monkeys ran and escaped, not even daring to return to their original caves.After a few rounds, Fang Yuan killed over a hundred stone monkeys. On the road there were traces of broken stones from the corpses of the stone monkeys.\"Insufficient primeval essence.\" Fang Yuan inspected his primeval sea and sighed, forced to stop in his tracks.If it was before, he would use his primeval stones to recover swiftly, but now, after fusing the White Jade Gu, he had a severe lack of primeval stones, or rather his entire finance was on the brink of collapsing.Fang Yuan picked up the jade rock eyeballs and stuffed them into his bag.\"It should be at the bottom of the center of that rock pillar. But to reach there, I have to open a path.\" This feeling was getting more intense, Fang Yuan gave it one last look before opening the stone door and returning to the second secret room.At the corner of the hidden room, there were some items.A small bag with hundreds of eyeball jades. Fang Yuan opened the bag and poured his loot in from today.The jade pearls collided with one another, emitting a crisp sound.There was another bag, and wild boar tusks were inside. But now Fang Yuan no longer needed to slaughter wild boars.He used the White Boar Gu and the Jade Skin Gu to refine the White Jade Gu. The White Boar Gu had disappeared, and reduced his necessity for pork to 0.The new White Jade Gu was more like the Jade Skin Gu, it consumed jade rocks.Jade Skin Gu needed two liang of jade rocks every ten days. While the White Jade Gu needed eight liang of jade rocks every twenty days.Normally speaking, the higher the rank, the longer interval there is for each meal. Rank two Gu usually feed every half a month, while Rank three Gu feed every month, or longer.Of course, higher ranking Gu also consume more food. On average, the White Jade Gu consumed more in cost than the Jade Skin Gu and the White Boar Gu combined.But to Fang Yuan, he had this rock forest and did not lack jade rocks. At the same time he did not need pork, so he did not need to kill wild boars, thus this saved him a lot of trouble and a lot of time.Tying the little bag up, Fang Yuan picked up a bullskin water sack.Inside the water sack, there was golden honey wine inside. A few days ago, Fang Yuan had relied on the Jade Skin Gu and endured the bees\u2019 attacks, and gathered enough honey wine.\"I only have two and a half primeval stones left, it is time to go to the internal affairs hall and turn in the mission.\"Fang Yuan kept the water sack well and returned to the tunnel, squeezing out of the rock crack and returning to the outside world.It was sunset now.The golden sunset of winter was in fact not cold, the weather bright and fair. The setting sun emerged with comfortable rays of a red-orange colour, the exquisite sunlight passing through the crown of pine trees and shining onto the mountain floor.Walking alone, he headed towards the village.Yet Fang Yuan did not go directly, but took a few reroutes to prevent the rock crack from being found out.Winter wind blew on his face, this was the smell of freedom.Back in the academy, he could only sneak out at night. Now that he was Rank two, he could move about freely in the day without any suspicion.More importantly, the death of sickly snake and the others allowed Fang Yuan to move alone with fewer restraints.The only thing is, Fang Yuan was now alone without any supporting group members. The following clan mission which occurs monthly, he had to complete one at least, and that would be difficult.Now, after the small beast horde, all the groups had regrouped. Fang Yuan had missed the chance.Because of his reputation, Fang Yuan was also ostracized by the Gu Masters. Joining other small groups was not going to be easy.\"So what if I\u2019m left out, the more I float around at the brink, the less attention is on me, and the more advantageous it is for me. As for the clan mission, it is mandatory so I have to take it. But....\"Thinking of this, Fang Yuan\u2019s eyes shone with cold light, he had plans already.The clan mandates that every Gu Master had to accept a mission every month, but did not force them to complete it.Being unable to complete the mission will result in falling evaluation. This was something no Gu Master wanted to see, thus they did their all to complete the missions.But to Fang Yuan, this evaluation was crap!Walking into the village, there was an endless stream of people walking along the limestone paths of the streets.At this time, it is normally the peak period.Many Gu Masters complete their missions with injuries and whatnot, returning to the village. After working for a day, farmers drag their muddy feet and tired bodies, quietly moving along.In this world, living was not easy, it was full of pain and suffering.The setting sun slowly dropped below the mountain top, giving out the last ray of warm light. This light would be diminished by the unevenly criss-crossed branches of the withering trees, becoming the fragments of time scattered upon the green jade walls of bamboo houses.\"Oh no, my toy,\" a girl cried out, chasing her spinning top among the crowd.The spinning top rolled to Fang Yuan\u2019s feet, and the girl also hit Fang Yuan\u2019s leg, falling on the ground.\"Sorry, sorry! For offending lord Gu Master, please pardon us!\" The little girl\u2019s father hurried over. When he saw Fang Yuan\u2019s clothing, his expression was white as paper, bringing the little girl and kneeling down, kowtowing to Fang Yuan.The girl cried out of shock, pearls of tears trailing down her white and rosy face.The walking mortals upon seeing this scene, turned away and avoided them like the plague.Some Gu Masters stared coldly, before turning away and leaving.\"Stop crying, you troublemaker!\" The father was frightened, angry and afraid, moving his hand to give her a slap, but Fang Yuan grabbed his hand, not allowing any movement.\"Just a small matter, no worries.\" Fang Yuan laughed lightly, touching the little girl\u2019s head, softly consoling, \"Don\u2019t be afraid, it is okay.\"The girl stopped crying, using her teary eyes to look at Fang Yuan, thinking this big brother was really gentle.\"Thank you lord, thank you lord for your kindness!\" The girl\u2019s father was overjoyed, kowtowing to Fang Yuan without a break.Fang Yuan continued forward.His rented house was not far away.And on the ground floor of that bamboo house, his uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu stood, staring at Fang Yuan who was still a distance away, evidently waiting for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
